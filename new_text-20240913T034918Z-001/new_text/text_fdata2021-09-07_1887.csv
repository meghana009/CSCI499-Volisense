the penultimate paragraph of the new york times account warned that the likelihood the assassins were arabs gave credibility to who contend that foreigners including osama bin laden are playing an ever bigger decision making role among the taliban a day later bin laden would be a household name and the fate of the taliban would become an american obsession that would extend to this day on that day donald j trump sat with sarah jessica parker and monica lewinsky in the front row of a marc jacobs fashion show on manhattan s far west side the next day he would do a live telephone interview on a new york television show and say of his 71 story building at 44 wall street not far from the collapsed twin towers now it s the tallest on that day americans were preoccupied with the bare female

the stock show name and logo the nebraska state fair which took over management of the stock show after its move to grand island four years ago has sued two central nebraska men including an associate of gov pete ricketts over ownership of the name aksarben stock show which is billed as the nation s largest 4 h livestock show the federal lawsuit claims that trent loos the governor s associate his wife kelli and greg harder a former state fair employee have wrongly claimed the name and the stock show s unique logo for their own use via a nonprofit corporation they formed a year ago called nebraskans 4 youth livestock inc harder of phillips used to manage the stock show for the state fair but he was fired in september 2020 just a couple of days after that year s show ended his role in forming the nebraskans 4 youth livestock entity to stage livestock shows was cited as a sign of disloyalty and an effort to seize control of the fair s assets harder is the president of the new nonprofit while trent loos of litchfield is the vice president and his wife is the secretary they obtained the legal rights to the aksarben stock show logo via a filing with the nebraska secretary of state s office such filings are routinely approved if no one else has filed a corporate name or logo referred to as a service mark in the lawsuit that is identical or closely related which appeared to be the case with the aksarben stock show name and logo the state fair wants the name and logo back and in the lawsuit says harder and the looses have refused to relinquish them the fair claims that deceives the public violates the state s deceptive trade practices act and harms the event which is slated to be held at the fair s barns in grand island on sept 24 26 the stock show was moved to grand island and the state fair s modern livestock pavilions in 2017 after staging it at chi health center omaha where elevators had to be used to transport cattle became too difficult the event first held in 1928 draws hundreds of young ivestock exhibitors from across the midwest when it was held in omaha local steakhouses bid for the right to the champion cattle or hogs then displayed photographs of them at their restaurants but after the aksarben racetrack closed and the barns used to house livestock there were torn down the show s future became less certain mark fahleson the attorney representing the state fair declined to comment the lawsuit he filed said that the knights of aksarben had transferred all rights to the stock show name and logo in april and that the looses and harder have failed to respond to requests to voluntarily turn over the rights to the name and logo trent loos has shared a stage with gov ricketts more than once he joined the governor at a mccook rally opposing president joe biden s 30 by 30 conservation program and at a governor s news conference in 2019 to pitch property tax relief ricketts appeared on a podcast produced by loos in july loos was recently appointed by the governor to the commission that oversees the state capitol loos said he had served as announcer of the aksarben stock show after it moved to grand island but he lost his job when harder was fired he said his group had filed for the rights to the aksarben stock show name because the state fair board had discussed dropping the event our only intent was to preserve the history and heritage of the aksarben show for families like ours and keep it alive loos said he added that nebraskans 4 youth livestock doesn t have any current plans to use the name and logo so why not return it and avoid an expensive lawsuit pitting lawyers from two high priced firms rembolt ludtke of lincoln and kutak rock of omaha loos said he doesn t trust the state fair to keep the event going and wants to retain the rights just in case this story has been updated to clarify trent loos connections to gov ricketts photos ak sar ben racetrack and coliseum through the years livestock

canada on august 30 investment advisory cowen maintained an outperform rating on lithium americas corp nyse lac stock and raised the price target to 19 from 17 noting the high pricing of lithium products as a major growth catalyst for the firm out of the hedge funds being tracked by insider monkey new york based investment firm axel capital management is a leading shareholder in lithium americas corp nyse lac with 408 130 shares worth more than 6 million alongside apple inc nasdaq aapl advanced micro devices inc nasdaq amd tesla inc nasdaq tsla and chewy inc nyse chwy lithium americas corp nyse lac is also occupying retail investor interest on reddit forums in its q1 2021 investor letter massif capital an asset management firm highlighted a few stocks and lithium americas corp nyse lac was one of them here is what the fund said lithium americas the volatility noted above in lac has resulted in solid returns via our options trades around our core equity position at the current time we are short calls on lac as we have done multiple times throughout the position s life expiring on may 21 2021 at a 17 5 and 22 5 strike price the volume of contracts sold at each strike corresponds to the size of the equity position we want should the calls expire in the money and the underlying equity gets called away from us the thought process behind this trade construction is that if we know the size of the position we want at a particular price point there is no reason not to accumulate additional returns by pre selling the stock we would have sold anyway high levels of volatility positively impact the price of options increasing the premium we can earn from selling covered calls to date we have sold covered calls on lac that have expired worthless four times yielding a roughly 7 return on the equity position s current value or 71bps for the portfolio overall the outstanding covered calls appear to be trending towards a similar worthless expiration if they do the covered call trades on lac will result in us owning the shares with committed capital of 0 28 per share although we believe in the fullness of time lac warrants a 30 valuation the prices achieved in early january of this year were not justified by the underlying fundamentals some will argue we should have sold down our position we had already established our option positions and believe lac is an emerging major in the lithium mining industry thus we decided to maintain the position unchanged although still relatively high the current 15 per share valuation is not crazy compared to where we think the firm should be trading based on fundamentals so we are no longer overly concerned with the position as is lac management also took advantage of the volatility issuing stock on january 22 for 22 a share the 400 million in proceeds will be used to develop thacker pass the us based clay lithium deposit which will likely be the largest producing lithium mine in america when turned on in our opinion the stock issuance could not have come at a better time lac management has advanced the project through various development stages de risking but with the share issuance they have significantly reduced the need to bring in an outside partner to develop the asset as the first phase of the project is expected to cost roughly 581 million after tax and at an 8 discount rate the thacker pass project s present value is approximately 2 6 billion the firm s current market capitalization is 1 5 billion although the share issuance was dilutive increasing the total shares by 17 we believe it will in the long run prove a forward looking value additive decision by management the lithium market remains an area of interest and focus for us this reflects our belief that the most exciting investment opportunities to capture secular trends in ev s and batteries are found upstream in the mining industry it is also a reflection that there is a greater diversity of lithium investment opportunities relative to other battery metals number of hedge fund holders 18 mcafee corp nasdaq mcfe is a california based integrated security solutions provider it is placed eighth on

for decades the aksarben stock show was an omaha fixture operated by the titans of the city through the knights of aksarben but now there s a showdown in central nebraska over who owns the rights to the stock show name and logo the nebraska state fair which took over management of the stock show after its move to grand island four years ago has sued two central nebraska men including an associate of gov pete ricketts over ownership of the name aksarben stock show which is billed as the nation s largest 4 h livestock show the federal lawsuit claims that trent loos the governor s associate his wife kelli and greg harder a former state fair employee have wrongly claimed the name and the stock show s unique logo for their own use via a nonprofit corporation they formed a year ago called nebraskans 4 youth livestock inc harder of phillips used to manage the stock show for the state fair but he was fired in september 2020 just a couple of days after that year s show ended his role in forming the nebraskans 4 youth livestock entity to stage livestock shows was cited as a sign of disloyalty and an effort to seize control of the fair s assets harder is the president of the new nonprofit while trent loos of litchfield is the vice president and his wife is the secretary they obtained the legal rights to the aksarben stock show logo via a filing with the nebraska secretary of state s office such filings are routinely approved if no one else has filed a corporate name or logo referred to as a service mark in the lawsuit that is identical or closely related which appeared to be the case with the aksarben stock show name and logo the state fair wants the name and logo back and in the lawsuit says harder and the looses have refused to relinquish them the fair claims that deceives the public violates the state s deceptive trade practices act and harms the event which is slated to be held at the fair s barns in grand island on sept 24 26 the stock show was moved to grand island and the state fair s modern livestock pavilions in 2017 after staging it at chi health center omaha where elevators had to be used to transport cattle became too difficult the event first held in 1928 draws hundreds of young ivestock exhibitors from across the midwest when it was held in omaha local steakhouses bid for the right to the champion cattle or hogs then displayed photographs of them at their restaurants but after the aksarben racetrack closed and the barns used to house livestock there were torn down the show s future became less certain mark fahleson the attorney representing the state fair declined to comment the lawsuit he filed said that the knights of aksarben had transferred all rights to the stock show name and logo in april and that the looses and harder have failed to respond to requests to voluntarily turn over the rights to the name and logo trent loos has shared a stage with gov ricketts more than once he joined the governor at a mccook rally opposing president joe biden s 30 by 30 conservation program and at a governor s news conference in 2019 to pitch property tax relief ricketts appeared on a podcast produced by loos in july loos was recently appointed by the governor to the commission that oversees the state capitol loos said he had served as announcer of the aksarben stock show after it moved to grand island but he lost his job when harder was fired he said his group had filed for the rights to the aksarben stock show name because the state fair board had discussed dropping the event our only intent was to preserve the history and heritage of the aksarben show for families like ours and keep it alive loos said he added that nebraskans 4 youth livestock doesn t have any current plans to use the name and logo so why not return it and avoid an expensive lawsuit pitting lawyers from two high priced firms rembolt ludtke of lincoln and kutak rock of omaha loos said he doesn t trust the state fair to keep the event going and wants to retain the rights just in case this story has been updated to clarify trent loos connections to gov ricketts photos ak sar ben racetrack and coliseum through the years livestock

u s airline stocks just can t catch a break taking a hit on monday as the european union recommended its member states reinstate covid related travel restrictions on the americans the eu s recommendation hurt all airline carriers following a good run during the summer season with more flights resumed and sales skyrocketing major carriers american airlines delta air and united all saw their stocks fall around 3 5 even domestic oriented spirit airline jetblue airways and southwest airlines stocks fell around 3 american airlines stock fell to 19 51 delta slid to 39 91 while united fell to 45 60 regaining 1 3 on tuesday the eu s recommendations are based on a rapid uptick in covid cases in some us states in the last couple of months but the decision is likely to only affect those travelers who are unvaccinated according to data from the centers for disease control and prevention cdc only 52 1 of the population is fully vaccinated the eu lifted travel restrictions for american visitors in late june in time for the busy summer travel season covid 19 s delta variant is currently surging through florida texas and louisiana most notably the southern states have the lowest vaccination rates as a result hospitals are reeling as icu beds fill up and oxygen supply is scarce the daily average for hospital admissions has risen past 150 000 for the first time since last winter florida has more than 16 000 covid 19 patients in hospital the most of any state followed by texas and california death rates have risen too reaching an average of more than 1 000 per day the eu s new guidance to its member states is nonbinding the u s has yet to reopen its own borders to eu tourists imposed in march last year in its newest guidance except the united states five other countries were removed from its safe travel list israel kosovo lebanon montenegro the republic of north macedonia as for u s airlines they saw seat capacity expectations realized for the summer season with approximately 90 of their 2019 system seat capacity even higher ticket prices haven t scared off flyers according to the booking app hopper airfares were soaring all summer up 12 since april while international flights up 8 the surge of summer travelers also helped airlines improve their financial results for the first quarter seeing sales increase more than 300 on average the last quarter also saw major airlines trim their net losses compared to the same time in 2020 according to the u s department of transportation data airlines reported after tax net loss of 4 2 billion down from the fourth quarter loss of 7 billion however they also reported pre tax operating loss of 12 7 billion up from the fourth quarter loss of 9 7 billion the recovery might end up being short lived if the pandemic s resurgence continues and they get hit with a restrictive fall season especially if business travel declines nearly all u s based carriers both international and domestic focused have trimmed their fall schedules compared with expectations a few months ago according to a 2020 report from moody s investor services the airline industry will continue to suffer well into 2023 because of the current coronavirus pandemic and that is the best case scenario in the worst case prediction the industry will not rebound to last year s levels until 2024 or 2025
what researchers need to know according to the merriam webster dictionary the word provenance means the origin or source of something in the world of antiques it means the history of ownership of a valued object or work of art in the scientific world when applied to biospecimens it covers a number of categories of information a sample processing history b information about the donor and their medical history c the geographic origin of the sample which provides information about environment and ethnicity and d previous custodians which may include one or more brokers reliable biospecimen provenance information is essential for reliable research at the most basic level knowing the identity of the biobank of origin allows researchers to decide whether samples are likely to be reliable if that biobank has obtained appropriate licencing certification or accreditation this gives confidence about sample quality and reliability examples of this include licensing by the human tissue authority in the uk iso certification iso9001 and iso20387 us cap accreditation and ctrnet certification looking at a more detailed level information on sample processing can be captured using a tool called the standard preanalytical code or sprec which facilitates annotation of biospecimens with preanalytical factors that are suspected to impact the results of downstream analyses and can be addressed using standard operating procedures sops sprec data elements for fluid samples include for example the type of primary container the pre centrifugation delay centrifugation conditions temperature time and g force and more this tool has been implemented by professional biobanks around the world and illustrates the meticulous attention to detail that is important to fully account for the different pre analytic variables influencing biospecimen quality researchers who are unable to assess the reliability of their samples are at risk of producing research that is irreproducible this is not only a waste of research funding on a huge scale but it also delays the development of lifesaving therapies why the procurement system is broken unfortunately for researchers in industry provenance information is often lacking one reason is related to the fact that researchers in industry often obtain biospecimens through a commercial broker these act as intermediaries between the hospital biobank where the sample was originally collected and preserved and the client in industry they source the necessary samples for their client and charge a fee for this service generally speaking they do not want to allow free and unconditional communication between the researcher and the hospital biobank for one simple reason this would risk their own circumvention and loss of profits so many brokers will not reveal the precise origin of the samples with the result that the end user may lack biospecimen provenance information biosamples are needed by industry to study disease processes in patients and to relate the results of molecular analysis of these samples to the diverse characteristics of the corresponding patients and their own specific environments so it is obviously vital for the researcher to have information about the medical history of the patient their various diagnoses treatments responses to treatment and demographic information age race and sex this information needs to be reliable and the best way of being sure of this is to deal directly with a source biobank with known credentials furthermore it may be necessary to recontact the biobank for information on the patient s response to treatment or for additional samples from the same patient so again it is important to know the biobank identity for this it is also important to know the geographic origin of each sample for a variety of reasons one is that the patient s environment and exposure to various risk factors sunlight temperature altitude diet pollution etc may have a bearing on pathology and information on these factors may be needed to make sense of research findings the need for this information is accentuated by the fact there is a great deal of international trade in patient samples a recent survey by the medicines discovery catapult agency found that diagnostics companies obtained 75 of their samples from abroad this is partly due to the fact that in the uk and other countries in western europe hospitals and biobanks are generally not comfortable to provide samples to commercial brokers so these brokers need to look further afield for sources of samples obtaining them from eastern europe asia and the usa instead some countries like china india and russia have laws that restrict the export of samples so it is also important to be sure of geographic origin in order to avoid the possible use of illegally sourced samples the supply of clinical samples from different parts of the world may involve a series of commercial entities for example there may be one company in asia which supplies samples to another company with a distribution network in europe and the usa if a series of brokers are involved then the reliability of information on patient consent and sample provenance obviously becomes less certain what can be done information about sample provenance is clearly vital for a range of scientific ethical and legal reasons so what can be done to make sure that when industry obtains samples they always come with reliable provenance information regulatory authorities look likely to play a decisive role in the future for access to the european market the makers of medical devices including in vitro diagnostics must now show that the biospecimens used to validate their devices have undergone acceptable pre analytic processing this is a requirement of the new european ivd regulation ivdr which comes into force on the 26th may 2022 no doubt other such regulations will follow and it can only be a matter of time before evidence of reliable and acceptable biospecimen provenance is required for approval of all drugs diagnostics and vaccines for clinical use together with the introduction of new regulatory requirements there are promising technological developments that will help ensure reliable sample provenance information blockchain for example allows secure and ethical tracking of the transfer of biospecimens from source to end user through an incorruptible shared digital ledger coupled with the sprec tool mentioned above this has enormous potential for improving the reliability of biospecimen based research another option is for brokers to modify their business practices and allow direct communication between the hospital source of samples and the end user but to require both parties to sign a contractual agreement to the effect that they will not circumvent the broker such contracts are indeed being used effectively by a number of commercial brokers however the fact they place restrictions on the freedom of companies and biobanks to form partnerships is not always acceptable to one or other of the potential partners companies can independently build their own networks of biobanks to obtain the samples they require indeed many long lived pharmaceutical companies have done this but it takes time in the short term it is often very difficult to find suitable hospital biobanks with the necessary samples in stock there are publicly available biobank directories that companies can consult but these are generally designed with academic researchers in mind and may not indicate whether the biobanks are willing or indeed motivated to work with industry a recently established not for profit company called biosample hub provides a further solution through an online platform dedicated to partnering industry with academic biobanks the platform presents companies with a ready made network of biobanks all of which want to work with industry the platform also includes a directory of companies a directory of requests and networking features to allow members to communicate so far this has been well received by academic biobanks in western europe providing industry with a route to previously inaccessible sources of clinical samples final note where biospecimens are used in research to develop drugs diagnostics and vaccines it is vital that these are provided together with reliable and complete provenance information regulatory authorities have taken note as demonstrated by new european regulations affecting makers of ivds this development will most likely herald major improvements in the practice of biospecimen procurement for industry references 1 betsou f et al standard preanalytical code version 3 0 biopreservation and biobanking 16 9 12 2018 2 hofman p et

covid 19 and the structural crises of our time a once busy shopping complex in the centre of bangkok in latest august retailers have been forced to close or lay off staff as the pandemic rages photo arnun chonmhatrakool the covid 19 pandemic devastating as it is not simply a health crisis it is the product of an interlocking web of diverse problems that have been building up over time given the structural nature of this crisis even as the embers of the immediate fire of infections and deaths burn out the fallout from the conflagration will continue taking different forms in its wake including the rise of yet another pandemic to understand why first consider the numbers as a health crisis the toll is huge and climbing worldwide more than 180 million people have been infected and over 4 million deaths have been officially reported the true numbers are likely to be much higher the economic costs are enormous it could amount to us 10 trillion 324 trillion baht or 12 of world gdp forgone over 2020 21 not to mention the social costs of lost education mental depression and suicide but that is not all because of the way the crisis is rooted in dysfunctions in the global economy finance politics and the ecological balance from the environmental perspective the zoonotic outbreak is bound up with an ecological crisis that is the result of humans relentless and ruthless encroachment on the natural habitats of wild animals there have been warnings from scientists and previous smaller scale outbreaks of other zoonotic diseases of an eventuality such as the pandemic we are facing now at a societal level covid 19 has laid bare many fractures and flaws the inability of public health systems to cope with calamities huge socio economic disparities that widen as the pandemic hits the poor and lower working class harder than the rich the increasing fragility of an inherently unstable financial system and political polarisation between those who are economically left behind and the privileged minority who continue to benefit disproportionately from growth the pandemic landed on a wobbly financial stage it hit the world economy hard just when it was still struggling to emerge from the catastrophic 2008 global financial crisis gfc the gfc the most serious financial crisis since the 1932 great depression resulted from four decades of excessive financialisation the buildup of an inherently unstable and parasitic financial system abetted by financial deregulation and neoliberal economic policies financialisation meant the economic centre of gravity shifted from production to financial circulation from value creation to value extraction finance came to not only dominate the real economy but whip sawed it like the proverbial tail wagging the dog growth is driven more by debt than productivity and income gains speculation and investment in financial assets fanned repeated booms and busts financialisation breeds inequality and inequality contributes to financial crisis the two mutually reinforcing each other the complex interplay of all these factors has produced an unstable financial system that lunges from one financial crisis to the next as happened in the us savings and loans crisis in early 1980s the latin american financial crisis of 1980s the asian financial crisis of 1997 and the global financial crisis of 2008 to get out of the gfc central banks lowered interest rates and unleashed massive liquidity into the financial system through quantitative easing while these policies bailed out banks they were less effective in reviving the real economy it took 11 years after the gfc for the world output gap to become marginally positive before plunging into negative territory again in 2020 corporations borrowed cheap money for financial activities such as mergers and acquisition and share buybacks rather than for investing in production cheap money also enabled the wealthy to borrow at low interest rates to invest and speculate in financial markets pushing up stock and bond markets to new heights surpassing the pre gfc levels the results were higher levels of inequality and debt the very mix that led to booms and busts and the recession in 2008 by 2019 world debt reached us 253 trillion 320 of world gdp 70 higher than before the gfc inequality was at also at historic peak with the top 1 of households owning over 50 of the world s wealth it is against this backdrop that the covid 19 pandemic struck bringing about the sharpest decline in economic growth since the great depression governments in most countries went into emergency mode pushing through unprecedented fiscal and monetary measures in response by may 2020 g10 countries plus china had spent us 15 trillion in fiscal and monetary packages to rescue their economies fiscal expenditure in the form of government grants and subsidies to businesses forced to shut down and individuals who lost their jobs or had income cut cushioned the negative impact central banks slashed interest rates to near zero and ramped up quantitative easing this time purchasing not only government securities but also mortgage backed securities and corporate bonds but repeating the same monetary policies that were used to fight the last financial crisis is sowing the seeds for the next financial crisis ultra low interest rates and massive liquidity again tempt corporations to binge on debt prop up zombie companies misallocate capital and disadvantage savers and people who depend on wage or fixed income in favour of financial investors and speculators global debt surged 10 in one year to reach us 281 trillion by the end of 2020 and is set to rise further in 2021 global financial markets soared to historic high stretching valuations to dangerous levels the monumental rescue plans made for a quick rebound in the first half of 2021 mainly due to the low base effect but a full recovery is still tentative it is also highly skewed in a form of a k shape rather than v shape with large swaths of the economy and population still very much underwater policy makers are stuck between the scylla of possible inflation and charybdis of rising interest rates will longer term structural factors such as ageing demography and revamping of global supply chain combined with the unprecedented rescue packages lead to inflationary pressures necessitating central banks to raise interest rates yet with the mountain of cheap debt weighing on governments and corporations alike raising interest rates will threaten debt servicing and repayment not to speak of huge losses from us 16 trillion worth of negative yielding bonds worldwide like a rider trying to dismount from a tiger s back the most difficult challenge facing policy makers is whether they are able to find an exit strategy from these extraordinary monetary and fiscal liquidity injections without plunging the world into another financial crisis unlike the fight against covid 19 there is no vaccine to deal with the mire of deep seated structural problems that are both its cause and effect

last year was one of the mildest flu seasons on record with mask mandates and restrictions in place but doctors fear this flu season will be different example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video indianapolis with flu season around the corner experts are worried about a potential double pandemic or twindemic where influenza cases collide with rising covid 19 numbers the possibility of a twindemic is pretty real this year said dr brian dixon director of public health informatics at the regenstrief institute last year was one of the mildest flu seasons on record with mask mandates and restrictions keeping the numbers down the situation is much different this year and it leads us to think that we will have at least a normal flu season if not a bad flu season and if we do it s going to be problematic for our health care system dixon said so far this summer physicians have already reported seeing an unusual amount of rsv cases and other viruses among children experts say it s a possible indicator for what s to come this fall and winter but for right now flu cases remain low in indiana currently the state is averaging about 750 flu tests a day of those about 14 usually come back positive that s about a two percent positivity rate now compare that to covid 19 which has about an 11 percent positivity rate with our hospital system already overburdened from covid 19 there is a real concern about flu coming in this fall as it does every year and putting additional people and strain on the healthcare system dixon said the other challenge will be knowing the difference between the flu and covid 19 since the symptoms are so similar we have rapid tests for both we have tests that take a couple of days to process for both so we will start to see both kinds of tests be more common during the flu season this year in order to rule out one or the other dixon said experts say it is possible to contract both viruses at the same time but it s highly unlikely with very few cases being reported to protect yourself doctors say it s simple wear a mask and get both vaccines doctors say the best time to get the flu shot is in september and october for ideal protection the cdc now recommends you can get a covid 19 vaccine and other vaccines at the same visit you no longer need to wait 14 days between vaccinations

the stock show name and logo the nebraska state fair which took over management of the stock show after its move to grand island four years ago has sued two central nebraska men including an associate of gov pete ricketts over ownership of the name aksarben stock show which is billed as the nation s largest 4 h livestock show the federal lawsuit claims that trent loos the governor s associate his wife kelli and greg harder a former state fair employee have wrongly claimed the name and the stock show s unique logo for their own use via a nonprofit corporation they formed a year ago called nebraskans 4 youth livestock inc harder of phillips used to manage the stock show for the state fair but he was fired in september 2020 just a couple of days after that year s show ended his role in forming the nebraskans 4 youth livestock entity to stage livestock shows was cited as a sign of disloyalty and an effort to seize control of the fair s assets harder is the president of the new nonprofit while trent loos of litchfield is the vice president and his wife is the secretary they obtained the legal rights to the aksarben stock show logo via a filing with the nebraska secretary of state s office such filings are routinely approved if no one else has filed a corporate name or logo referred to as a service mark in the lawsuit that is identical or closely related which appeared to be the case with the aksarben stock show name and logo the state fair wants the name and logo back and in the lawsuit says harder and the looses have refused to relinquish them the fair claims that deceives the public violates the state s deceptive trade practices act and harms the event which is slated to be held at the fair s barns in grand island on sept 24 26 the stock show was moved to grand island and the state fair s modern livestock pavilions in 2017 after staging it at chi health center omaha where elevators had to be used to transport cattle became too difficult the event first held in 1928 draws hundreds of young ivestock exhibitors from across the midwest when it was held in omaha local steakhouses bid for the right to the champion cattle or hogs then displayed photographs of them at their restaurants but after the aksarben racetrack closed and the barns used to house livestock there were torn down the show s future became less certain mark fahleson the attorney representing the state fair declined to comment the lawsuit he filed said that the knights of aksarben had transferred all rights to the stock show name and logo in april and that the looses and harder have failed to respond to requests to voluntarily turn over the rights to the name and logo trent loos has shared a stage with gov ricketts more than once he joined the governor at a mccook rally opposing president joe biden s 30 by 30 conservation program and at a governor s news conference in 2019 to pitch property tax relief ricketts appeared on a podcast produced by loos in july loos was recently appointed by the governor to the commission that oversees the state capitol loos said he had served as announcer of the aksarben stock show after it moved to grand island but he lost his job when harder was fired he said his group had filed for the rights to the aksarben stock show name because the state fair board had discussed dropping the event our only intent was to preserve the history and heritage of the aksarben show for families like ours and keep it alive loos said he added that nebraskans 4 youth livestock doesn t have any current plans to use the name and logo so why not return it and avoid an expensive lawsuit pitting lawyers from two high priced firms rembolt ludtke of lincoln and kutak rock of omaha loos said he doesn t trust the state fair to keep the event going and wants to retain the rights just in case this story has been updated to clarify trent loos connections to gov ricketts photos ak sar ben racetrack and coliseum through the years livestock

with an average of over 13 000 daily cases the reopening of schools in france that began last week is preparing a new wave of infections illnesses and deaths among teachers children and the population at large in the face of this criminal policy workers and teachers must fight for a strategy to eradicate the virus based on the measures proposed by epidemiologists virologists and other scientists throughout the pandemic this means the international application of all the measures available in the fight against the virus including lockdowns and social distancing measures the implementation of this strategy requires the development of a powerful international and unified working class mass movement based on science millions of children and students returned to school and universities on september 2 youth aged under 12 are not vaccinated and those aged under 18 are on average the least vaccinated in september 2020 france counted an average of 5 407 new daily cases which prepared a new epidemic wave and the spread of new variants now the health situation is worse due to the aggressiveness of the delta variant children sit in a classroom at school in strasbourg eastern france sept 2 2021 ap photo jean françois badias questioned on news channel bfmtv health minister olivier véran said we must be extremely vigilant and i ask the french people who are watching this to be very careful in the days and weeks to come to respect social distancing measures to wear the mask wherever necessary to wash your hands all of that you know on the same channel lila bouadma a health worker at the bichat hospital in paris and member of the scientific council estimated that in the coming days there will be 50 000 children infected per day which is colossal we can fear that there will be a return of a paediatric epidemic we are not prepared for that because it is specialty care for children we think that it is not more serious but we must change the paradigm this does not matter some have long forms of covid they are not very symptomatic but they remain so with a significant state of fatigue the epidemiologist arnaud fontanet warned on france inter the schools are the most complex situation that awaits us this fall we cannot apply the same recipes as before the reopening of schools in the united states confirms these warnings in france in the second week of august more than 121 000 children tested positive for the virus and a record number more than 1 900 were hospitalized in the us alone these numbers are expected to skyrocket in the coming weeks with the full reopening of schools already in the initial days of the opening teachers have posted statements on social media warning of the lack of preparation the absence of resources and no means to impose even limited social distancing measures one teacher marie posted an image on the red pens facebook group showing her windows almost sealed shut with the caption here are the windows of my classroom in their maximum open position the two other walls have no windows there are two doors but they open into another classroom and a hallway a co2 captor would not be a luxury wrongly presented as a disease of the elderly the virus is increasingly infecting young adults and unvaccinated children le monde reports as of august 23 nineteen children and adolescents aged 0 to 19 were hospitalized in provence alpes côte d azur exceeding the thresholds reached during the third wave these figures are linked to the record levels of contaminations in these territories during the holiday season faced with this alarming situation the education minister michel blanquer announced on august 29 that the return to school would take place under a level 2 health protocol that is to say face to face instruction with all students as soon as the first case is detected in middle and high schools there will not be any shutting of classes and vaccinated students are to continue attending class only in primary school and kindergarten are classes to close for seven days after the first case is detected non vaccinated students who are contact cases will have to isolate for seven days in guadeloupe and polynesia where lockdowns have been implemented the start of the school year has been postponed by two weeks the maintenance of the start of the school year accompanied by limited health measures despite the alarming warnings of epidemiologists underscores the criminal policy of the macron government the limited measures will not prevent the circulation of the virus among children and teachers as well as parents encouraging the development of new and potentially more dangerous variants the policy of herd immunity has already caused more than 110 000 deaths in france and more than one million in europe macron will be responsible for the deaths of tens of thousands of people in the coming months including children as well as the long term impact of long covid from which many children will suffer this criminal policy would not have been possible without the complicity of the trade union apparatuses the reopening of the schools is part of the herd immunity policy of the financial aristocracy having flooded the financial markets with liquidity and implemented bailout packages for itself the financial elite is imposing the return to work which would be impossible without the reopening of schools the aim is to make massive profits on the backs of workers and their families who are in mortal danger not only did the trade unions refuse to fight to keep workers safe since the beginning of the pandemic the cgt and cfdt like the german trade unions applauded the eu bailout packages and participated in the negotiations to restructure the european economy throughout the pandemic they helped the state and employers to impose on worried teachers and parents the dangerous reopening of classes for children the minister of education negotiated and agreed with the unions upon the implementation of the reopening of in person classes the unions have since participated in protests against the health pass organized by the extreme right demanding the lifting of health restrictions for the implementation of a policy of herd immunity without mitigation the struggle to eradicate the virus can only be led by an independent political struggle of the workers breaking with the trade unions and the pseudo left political tendencies only a working class movement which is not motivated by the pursuit of profit or of personal wealth is capable of imposing a scientific policy to eradicate the virus last year it was the workers in italy and other countries who downed their tools spontaneously in wildcat actions to protect themselves from the pandemic forcing governments to institute lockdowns out of fear of a social explosion the strategy for eradicating the virus requires shutting down nonessential production and closing schools as well as universal testing contact tracing and isolation of those who are infected these measures must be combined with full income support for workers and small business owners affected by the shutdowns as well as a massive infusion of resources to provide high quality distance education for all children this initiative must be developed as part of an integrated global movement of the entire working class through the building of the international workers alliance of rank and file committees iwa rfc

the nature of work has undergone a lot of changes during the pandemic millions of office workers began working from home the service industry has struggled to get workers to come back and some businesses like kickstarter are now experimenting with four day workweeks without reducing salaries in congress rep mark takano d calif has introduced legislation to make a 32 hour workweek standard this great reassessment of labor feels revolutionary but we have been here before in 1933 the senate passed and president franklin roosevelt supported a bill to reduce the standard workweek to only 30 hours subscribe to the post most newsletter for the most important and interesting stories from the washington post americans have worked hard perhaps too hard since the colonial era english and other european colonists often had to work longer and harder on farms here than in the old world and a philosophy of working from sunrise to sunset prevailed according to the economic history association the massachusetts colony even passed a law requiring a 10 hour minimum workday enslaved people whose labor profits were stolen generally worked 10 16 hours a day six days a week some studies estimate that when slavery ended the hours african americans spent working fell by 26 35 percent in the 1830s workers in manufacturing were on the job roughly 70 hours a week often in horrendous and even deadly conditions by the 1890s that had dropped to about 60 hours this period also saw the rise of labor unions the creation of labor day as a national holiday grand eight hours leagues and the motto eight hours for work eight hours for rest eight hours for what you will at that time what you will did not include saturday workweeks were generally six days with only sunday off the eight hour day picked up in popularity in the decades preceding the great depression federal workers railroad workers and ford motor co employees all moved to eight hour shifts ceo henry ford first instituted a six day 48 hour workweek for male factory workers in 1914 according to history com in 1926 a five day 40 hour workweek was extended to all employees along with a pay raise ford argued that his employees were more productive in fewer hours critics were skeptical they could be productive enough to make up the difference story continues then came the stock market crash the great depression and record high unemployment after an underwhelming response from president herbert hoover he faced new york gov franklin roosevelt in the 1932 election shorter work hours was a major issue among voters and both candidates had ideas according to historian benjamin hunnicutt in his book work without end abandoning shorter hours for the right to work roosevelt a democrat pushed federal legislation to establish shorter work hours something he had already done at the state level in new york while hoover backed voluntary share the work drives the idea was that if workers had shorter hours no one would be unemployed even if everyone ended up making less money though unions were also pushing for a decent federal minimum wage after roosevelt won the election but before he took office sen hugo black d ala introduced a bill backed by the american federation of labor to temporarily shorten the workweek drastically to only 30 hours six hours a day five days a week for a while it had roosevelt s support and he began negotiating with business leaders behind closed doors if they would shorten the workweek to 30 hours voluntarily then he would go easy on antitrust reforms he said according to hunnicutt as soon as roosevelt took office on march 4 1933 he called congress into a special session what would become its most productive streak in history over the next 100 days roosevelt and his cabinet guided more than a dozen major bills through the house and senate stabilizing the banking system regulating wall street subsidizing farmers and getting relief checks into the hands of the unemployed amid this flurry on april 6 the senate passed black s 30 hour week bill 53 30 in a bipartisan vote supporters claimed it would create 6 million jobs the washington post reported it was expected to pass the house and secretary of labor frances perkins was publicly supportive business leader were up in arms instead of looking at the increase in leisure as inevitable or as potentially beneficial hunnicutt wrote they feared that if workers got a taste of a 30 hour week they would never want to go back and the law would become permanent men of industry held emergency meetings in chicago and philadelphia and perkins who also supported a federal minimum wage was flooded with messages of opposition meanwhile at the white house as roosevelt worked on a comprehensive recovery plan he began to turn against the 30 hour week what if rather than sharing available work there was just more work as the plan for a massive public works program took shape support for the 30 hour week collapsed instead roosevelt used the threat of it as leverage to get industry leaders to agree to ban child labor set a modest minimum wage and limit the standard workweek at 40 hours hunnicutt wrote the resulting national industrial recovery act was a triumph but one that didn t last two years later in may 1935 the supreme court declared it unconstitutional in a decision that so angered roosevelt he threatened to expand the court in 1938 the minimum wage 40 hour week and child labor ban returned in the form of the fair labor standards act this time perkins asked department of labor lawyers to draft a law that had a better chance of passing judicial scrutiny and they had another ace in their sleeve a few months earlier roosevelt had nominated his first justice for the supreme court he chose hugo black for decades the 40 hour week has endured but it didn t seem like it would in the beginning as joe pinsker of the atlantic pointed out in june many economists once assumed we would be working fewer than 40 hours by now in 1956 even then vice president richard nixon predicted a 32 hours four day workweek in the not too distant future it hasn t happened yet in fact in a 2014 gallup poll half of full time employed respondents reported working 41 hours or more per week 18 percent said they worked more than 60 only 8 percent said they worked 39 hours or less related content jordan

reflect the new dividend yield target spotlight antipodes global investment company limited apl antipodes global investment company limited has announced they have entered into a scheme of arrangement with antipodes global shares quoted managed fund agx1 for the exchange of apl shares for units in agx1 subject to shareholder and court approval agx1 is an existing exchange traded managed fund also known as an active etf apl is the third lic lit this year to complete or announce their intention to restructure convert to an etmf we note that apl s offer is a little different to other restructure announcements given that a new etmf will not be created apl shares will be exchanged for units of an existing etmf key details of the scheme if shareholders vote in favour of the scheme apl shares will be exchanged in agx1 units and apl will be wound up after the investment portfolio has been transferred to agx1 the exchange rate will be based on apl s post tax nta after transaction costs relative to agx1 s nav at the time of implementation the company estimates transaction costs will be less than 0 003 per share as at july end apl shares would be exchanged at a value of 1 201 per share post tax nta minus the estimated transaction costs representing a 7 7 premium to the share price at 31 july 2021 the investment management agreement ima between apl and the manager will be terminated if the scheme is approved the manager has agreed to forego termination fees even though the ima has over five years remaining we view this as a positive for shareholders but also appropriate given the portfolio is being transferred to another vehicle managed by the manager the investment strategy for apl shareholders will change to some degree if the scheme is approved with agx1 having a long only international equity strategy therefore apl shareholders will be transitioned from a long short strategy to a long only strategy the apl portfolio shares the same long positions as agx1 so the long exposure will be essentially the same this is highlighted by the top 10 holdings for the two vehicles as at july end tabled below while the strategy will be different the management fees and performance fees are the same for the two vehicles if approved the transition to an etmf will likely result in some shareholders seeking to exit given the open ended structure of an etmf the liquidity of the underlying portfolio of investments is important as this determines the timeliness with which redemptions can be met we do not envisage liquidity being an issue with over 70 of the portfolio invested in stocks with a market cap of more than 25b and over 50 of the portfolio invested in stocks with a market cap in excess of 100b we note that the transfer of apl s assets to agx1 will significantly increase the size of agx1 as at 31 july 2021 apl had a post tax nta value of 584 1m compared to agx1 s fum of 26 3m key differences between lic and etmf structures there are some key differences between a lic and an etmf structure one of the key differences is a lic is a closed ended structure while an etmf is an open ended unit trust under the lic structure the capital is captive with liquidity achieved through a secondary market in an etmf units can be created and redeemed with the size of the fund changing as units are created or redeemed etmf s are required to appoint a market maker that provides liquidity to unitholders as such etmfs should trade around the nav of the fund eliminating the premium discount at which lics can trade the lic structure allows for the payment of franked dividends and the company can use the balance sheet to put aside income and capital gains to pay out as dividends over time under the etmf structure income and capital gains generated in any given year are required to be paid out as distributions given the trust structure is a pass through structure no franking credits can be paid although any franking credits earned will be passed through to investors franking credits are typically low from an international portfolio below we provide a comparison of the historical dividends of apl and agx1 and the level of franking credits attached as well as a comparison of the rolling 12 month dividend distribution yield of the two vehicles to 31 july 2021 the agx1 distribution is much more volatile and will depend on the performance of the portfolio in any given year the lic structure offers the opportunity to pay out dividends in a more consistent manner further to the above the governance between the two structures differs with the lic having a dedicated board with independent representation that provides oversight of the company s operations under an etmf structure a responsible entity re is appointed the re of agx1 is pinnacle fund services an affiliated services firm to pinnacle investment management a significant shareholder of the manager of apl why is apl seeking to wind up lic the company is offering the exchange to the etmf primarily to address the discount to nta that the company has been trading at the board has implemented a number of initiatives in an attempt to narrow the discount but the initiatives have had little impact as shown below apl has traded at a discount to pre tax nta for most of its history with an average discount of 8 1 since listing to 31 july 2021 based on month end data we note that this has been an issue for the international diversified lic lit category as a whole as shown in the below chart after obtaining shareholder approval in november 2020 the company implemented a conditional tender offer cto in an attempt to address the discount however the cto has not had the desired effect which has seen the initiative suspended and the scheme offered as a superior initiative to eradicate the discount to nta independent investment research iir is an independent investment research house based in australia and the united states iir specialises in the

automatic monthly payments for your netflix or hotstar subscription without a debit or credit card thanks to upi the feature which was launched more than a year ago is finally being adopted by large merchants and the most popular upi apps it s a potential game changer in a country like india where only a tiny percentage of people use plastic money automatic recurring payments through upi launched last year by the national payments corporation of india npci had a slow start but are now picking up speed top merchants such as netflix and hotstar now let users set up recurring payments through upi autopay allows users to make recurring transactions of less than rs 5 000 using upi and can be used for everything from repaying loans to paying rent school fees and for subscriptions most recurring payments currently take place through credit or debit card based mandates for which settlement is more expensive upi autopay is expected to be a gamechanger for small businesses that collect monthly fees as it allows them to have a customisable debit agreement with customers through one time consent without the need for a debit or credit card experts told us the sudden increase in interest around upi autopay coincides with new rbi rules that will make recurring payments through debit and credit cards more cumbersome under the new rules which will come into effect next month banks must send pre transaction and post transaction notifications to customers and the pre transaction notification should allow the customer to withdraw consent the rbi extended the deadline to implement this from april to october after banks said they needed more time while upi autopay was launched in july 2020 only the upi apps of banks such as sbi hdfc bank icici bank and paytm payments bank were processing such transactions india s leading upi app phonepe only introduced the feature this june while google pay is yet to do so last month state bank of india paytm payments bank and bank of baroda were the three top banks on upi autopay having registered 660 000 204 000 and 186 000 mandates respectively according to npci the union government is standing firm on the traceability issue saying social media platforms such as whatsapp must reengineer their platforms if needed to help law enforcement agencies trace the originator of any message the government deems problematic official sources told us traceability is one of the requirements under india s new it rules which came into effect on may 25 that very day whatsapp sued the government in the delhi high court on this issue but at a recent meeting with social media platforms the ministry of electronics and it stood its ground it argued that traceability has nothing to do with breaking end to end encryption that it is very much possible and that it is an absolute necessity for national security and law and order the move comes after a change of guard at the ministry with ashwini vaishnaw taking over as union minister for electronics and it and rajeev chandrasekhar as the junior minister chandrasekhar has held a series of meetings with executives of top technology and internet firms in the past few weeks the ministry has been involved in face offs with various platforms especially twitter and whatsapp over the it rules whatsapp maintains that traceability requirement would force them to break the end to end encryption and thus compromise the privacy of their users the traceability rule requires significant social media intermediaries to be able to trace the first originator of a particular message it applies to platforms such as facebook twitter instagram signal whatsapp and telegram whatsapp wrote on its blog that it launched end to end encryption in 2016 so that calls messages photos videos and voice notes to friends and family are only shared with the intended recipient and no one else not even us traceability is intended to do the opposite by requiring private messaging services like whatsapp to keep track of who said what and who shared what for billions of messages sent every day traceability requires messaging services to store information that can be used to ascertain the content of people s messages thereby breaking the very guarantees that end to end encryption provides in order to trace even one message services would have to trace every message it added lee fixel who fueled the first

krishna depura right and sumer junejasoftware as a service often shortened to saas is the industry of cloud hosted software businesses that charge their customers a recurring usually monthly or annual subscription fee the broader saas market and the successful companies in it have been hot topics in technology publications for a while now but one specific question responsible for 50 of the total market cap of saas companies is yet to garner much media coverage it is how can someone approach creating a saas category i e a new class of saas software that doesn t yet have any directly comparable products in the market as cofounder and investor of mindtickle a saas platform that s the global leader of a rapidly emerging category called sales readiness here s a summary of our top 5 learnings on saas category creation from our journey as technologies are adopted more and more across our personal and professional lives it s only natural that many new saas categories will be created in the next few years but how does one identify a specific opportunity among these if you are selling something that has never been sold before you already have a tough adoption battle ahead to make it slightly easier identify an early adopter group willing to try out new software products even before they are truly finished when you try to create a new software category it s imperative to create awareness in the overall market even among the potential buyers and other stakeholders who might not become your customers immediately many saas pioneers have done category evangelisation incredibly well such as salesforce hubspot and gainsight it s often said that enterprise software products are in the business of making their buyers successful this saying is perhaps even more true for new categories if your buyers and users are sticking their necks out to get through the internal approval processes and secure budgets to adopt your unheard of software you owe it to them to make them successful also when they become successful they ll tell their friends and peers about you generating invaluable word of mouth marketing when done right the creators of new saas categories reap huge rewards and become massively successful however the category creators often take a significant period to reach the critical mass of awareness and adoption for reference the largest 10 saas category creators to go public after 2015 took 13 years on average median to achieve this feat krishna depura is cofounder and ceo of mindtickle sumer juneja a partner at softbank investment advisers is a board member and

menafn ing in the face of uncertainty around the cpi trend we expect the bank of russia to make a cautious 25 basis point hike to 6 75 this friday but it may signal scope for a further increase to 7 or above in the medium term before an eventual cut in 2022 23 this should keep the russian real rate elevated being supportive of the ruble all else equal shutterstock shareauthor dmitry dolgin newsletter stay up to date with all of ing s latest economic and financial analysis subscribe to think bank of russia is likely to act cautiously this month our base case scenario for this friday s key rate decision is a 25 basis point hike to 6 75 putting us in the middle of the consensus range of 6 50 7 00 we see several reasons why the central bank of russia has to proceed with the hiking cycle after a 225 basis point move year to date but the actions from now on should be far more cautious than the previous 50 100 basis point steps indeed the current inflationary trend is a concern after a brief plateau at 6 5 year on year in june july inflation seems to be looking up again and based on preliminary weekly data could reach 6 7 or higher in august as the seasonal monthly deflation in fruit and vegetables proved shallow while prices in other segments pressed on supported externally by global supply chain disruptions and internally by strengthening in the labor market while the final numbers on august cpi have yet to be confirmed release date is 8 september our expectation for a year end cpi forecast at 5 7 is becoming rather optimistic but still appears in line with the bank of russia s 5 7 6 2 yoy range at the same time a longer term inflationary pick up appears less certain given the cautious stabilisation in household and corporate inflationary expectations in july august moderation in corporate and retail lending growth and a further deceleration in the monetary supply growth while the market is focusing on the potential 0 2 0 3ppt inflationary effect of the extra social payments that households are to receive in august september it seems to have already been incorporated into the bank of russia s macro forecast in july in fact it appears that the sharp 100bp hike this summer has front run the fiscal action ahead of the blackout period cbr officials indicated no desire to adjust their signal from july i e that the bank of russia will consider the necessity of a further key rate increase at its upcoming meetings we interpret this as a sign that the range of decisions to be seriously discussed will be between no change and 50 basis points the additional social spending is not considered fiscal easing as it is financed by higher than expected non fuel revenues of the budget bank of russia rosstat ing bank of russia rosstat ing rosstat bank of russia ing figure 1 current cpi keeps bringing negative surprises but the longer term expectations seem to be stabilisingfigure 2 ppi and corporate inflationary expectations are stabilising but so far are highly elevatedfigure 3 monetary supply growth keeps decelerating suggesting downside to cpi in the medium termmedium term signal the key uncertainty as both local and global context need to be incorporated as usual the cbr commentary will be key to gauging the medium term prospects for the key rate after friday s decision we believe the rhetoric will remain focused on the elevated inflationary risks potentially hinting at the higher likelihood of the key rate overshooting the 6 5 7 0 range in the event of negative cpi surprises and positive gdp developments at the same time we see a number of arguments in favour of restraining the hawkish bias for now local economic activity seems to be moderating as gdp has reached pre covid levels meanwhile the risks to mobility remain for 4q21 in our view given the spread of the delta variant while russia s vaccination rate at 30 is still lagging most of its peers most of the cbr s peers have a wait and see approach to rising inflationary risks if turkey is excluded from the set russia s nominal rate is close to the top of the range however we do note that the latin american peers brazil and mexico increased rates in august suggesting that the frame of reference for russia remains uneven and upside risks to the global emerging markets rates space exists looking at the real rates based on cpi expected by the market in 12 months it appears that at current levels the russian real rate is hovering around 2 which is the upper border of the neutral stance and remains in the top 3 among peers this suggests that a further noticeable deterioration in inflationary expectations would be required to justify high upside to the nominal rate bank of russia refinitiv ing refinitiv ing figure 4 russia s em commodity

approach to inflation targeting which we see as a base case for friday should be largely neutral for the ruble and the bond market a more hawkish outcome such as a 50bp hike plus no indication of an

toledo ohio september 6 2021 back in the spring a shortage of computer chips that had sent auto prices soaring appeared finally to be easing some relief for consumers seemed to be in sight that hope has now dimmed a surge in covid 19 cases from the delta variant in several asian countries that are the main producers of auto grade chips is worsening the supply shortage it is further delaying a return to normal auto production and keeping the supply of vehicles artificially low and that means analysts say that record high consumer prices for vehicles new and used as well as rental cars will extend into next year and might not fall back toward earth until 2023 the global parts shortage involves not just computer chips automakers are starting to see shortages of wiring harnesses plastics and glass too and beyond autos vital components for goods ranging from farm equipment and industrial machinery to sportswear and kitchen accessories are also bottled up at ports around the world as demand outpaces supply in the face of a resurgent virus it appears it s going to get a little tougher before it gets easier said glenn mears who runs four auto dealerships around canton ohio squeezed by the parts shortfall general motors and ford have announced one or two week closures at multiple north american factories some of which produce their hugely popular full size pickup trucks late last month shortages of semiconductors and other parts grew so acute that toyota felt compelled to announce it would slash production by at least 40 in japan and north america for two months the cuts meant a reduction of 360 000 vehicles worldwide in september toyota which largely avoided sporadic factory closures that have plagued rivals this year now foresees production losses into october nissan which had announced in mid august that chip shortages would force it to close its immense factory in smyrna tennessee until aug 30 now says the closure will last until sept 13 and honda dealers are bracing for fewer shipments this is a fluid situation that is impacting the entire industry s global supply chain and we are adjusting production as necessary said chris abbruzzese a honda spokesman the result is that vehicle buyers are facing persistent and once unthinkable price spikes the average price of a new vehicle sold in the u s in august hit a record of just above 41 000 nearly 8 200 more than it was just two years ago j d power estimated with consumer demand still high automakers feel little pressure to discount their vehicles forced to conserve their scarce computer chips the automakers have routed them to higher priced models pickup trucks and large suvs for example thereby driving up their average prices the roots of the computer chip shortage bedeviling auto and other industries stem from the eruption of the pandemic early last year u s automakers had to shut factories for eight weeks to help stop the virus from spreading some parts companies canceled orders for semiconductors at the same time with tens of millions of people hunkered down at home demand for laptops tablets and gaming consoles skyrocketed as auto production resumed consumer demand for cars remained strong but chip makers had shifted production to consumer goods creating a shortage of weather resistant automotive grade chips then just as auto chip production started to rebound in late spring the highly contagious delta variant struck malaysia and other asian countries where chips are finished and other auto parts are made in august new vehicle sales in the u s tumbled nearly 18 mainly because of supply shortages automakers reported that u s dealers had fewer than 1 million new vehicles on their lots in august 72 lower than in august 2019 even if auto production were somehow to immediately regain its highest ever level for vehicles sold in the u s it would take more than a year to achieve a more normal 60 day supply of vehicles and for prices to head down the consulting firm alix partners has calculated under that scenario said dan hearsch an alix partners managing director it s not until early 2023 before they even could overcome a backlog of sales expected demand and build up the inventory for now with parts supplies remaining scarce and production cuts spreading many dealers are nearly out of new vehicles on a recent visit to the central avenue strip in suburban toledo ohio a road chock full of dealerships few new vehicles could be found on the lots some dealers filled in their lots with used vehicles the supply is so low and prices so high that one would be buyer heather pipelow of adrian michigan said she didn t even bother to look for a new suv at jim white honda it s more than i paid for my house she said ruefully ed ewers of mansfield ohio traveled about two hours to a toledo area subaru dealer to buy a used 2020 four door jeep wrangler he considered buying new but decided that a used vehicle was more in his price range to replace an aging dodge journey suv mears whose honda dealership is running short of new inventory said dealers are managing to survive because of the high prices consumers are having to pay for both new and used vehicles he doesn t charge more than the sticker price he said enough profit to cover expenses and make money nor does he have to advertise as much or pay interest on a large stock of vehicles many vehicles he said are sold before they arrive from the factory chip orders that were made nine months ago are now starting to arrive but other components such as glass or parts made with plastic injection molds are depleted hearsch said because of the virus and a general labor shortage he said auto parts makers might not be able to make up for lost production some tentative cause for hope has begun to emerge siew hai wong president of the malaysia semiconductor industry association says hopefully that chip production should start returning to normal in the fall as more workers are vaccinated though malaysia vietnam taiwan singapore and the united states all produce semiconductors he said a shortage of just one kind of chip can disrupt production if there is disruption in malaysia wong said there will be disruption somewhere in the world automakers have been considering shifting to an order based distribution system rather than keeping huge supplies on dealer lots but no one knows whether such a system would prove more efficient eventually hearsch suggested the delta variant will pass and the supply chain should return to normal by then he predicts automakers will line up multiple sources of parts and stock critical components there will be an end to it but the question is really when said ravi anupindi a professor at the university of michigan who studies supply chains ap

last week i dealt with the less controversial changes to the shiller p e you probably want to read that first in this post i derive a more advanced version cape 3 0 the main finding if you measure it differently the last 20 years go from being an expensive aberration to a typical investment period factors i adjust for average pretax earnings i assume the future tax rate will be the same as a mixed u s international statutory rate the difference over the previous 10 years in actual vs statutory adjust for buybacks adjust for changes in accounting standards adjust for effects during high inflation periods of overstated reported profits adjust for the cost of trading and spreads to reflect the after fee returns to shareholders i haven t adjusted for negative earnings i want to see a different series that does adjust but i don t have enough data i haven t used shiller s total return re investment adjustment i disagree with it see the effect below of this version of cape 3 0 the net effect is not that much on the latest reading but these changes increase prior levels in some cases substantially still expensive but not outrageously so and importantly the last 20 years no longer look like an expensive aberration relative to bonds the excess cape 3 0 yield goes from slightly expensive to slightly cheap which probably says as much about bonds as it does equities advertisement the rest post is for those who care about the detail it is probably too much information for most 1 tax detail i m going to start by admitting that i don t have 150 years of detailed company financials there are a lot of estimates based on judgement hopefully some enterprising students looking for thesis topics can fill in the gaps in the coming years in cape 2 0 i used statutory rates to adjust tax there are so many minor tax issues that this seemed to be a less arbitrary adjustment in cape 3 0 i m interpreting tax more realistically first we use the same methodology i e take an average of the last ten years of pretax profits per share then apply the current tax rate to indicate the after tax earnings per share an investor can expect in this version we use the actual tax rate paid rather than the statutory rate this varies over time pre 2000s the actual tax paid was often above the u s statutory rate primarily due to the amortisation of goodwill which was not tax deductible post 2000s with no more goodwill amortisation plus the rise in international earnings and the ability of technology companies to move profits to tax havens it is usually lower so how do investors think about it in the 1980s investors expected tax rates to be a little above u s statutory now they expect it below but after the trump tax cuts u s corporate tax rates are now closer to other countries so the expectation should be that tax rates will not be as far below u s statutory as they used to be and there needs to be some sort of transition in the numbers advertisement this makes for a reasonable amount of arbitrary assumptions i make an estimate about the amount of tax paid internationally very little in the mid 1900s lots recently then make an estimate for average international tax statutory rates this gives a blended statutory rate i use the 10 year difference between statutory and actual tax rates as the investor s expected tax differential and then i make some arbitrary changes as you can see above in 2008 the tax rate went to 50 i strip that out of investor expectations because i m pretty sure the vast majority of investors weren t expecting that differential to return in most years the net effect isn t that different from using statutory rates in cape 2 0 but in some individual years it makes a difference 2 buyback detail i had a few queries after my first post about the adjustment to buybacks i want to note that this is not an adjustment for share issues it is specific only to buybacks for the reasons below when a company issues shares for an acquisition paying down debt or employee options it gets something in return i e work performed an asset or a decrease in debt the shareholder is diluted but the intention is to increase profits to compensate the shareholders this effect is captured by earnings per share both the numerator and denominator increase this is an investment or operational decision buybacks are a financing decision whether a company chooses a buyback or a dividend does not affect the company s earnings i e dollar earnings aren t affected per share earnings might be when you pay a dividend the cash leaves the company the shareholders get the benefit directly when a buyback is performed the cash leaves the company shareholders do not get cash shareholders get a future benefit from a reduced number of shares this is not captured by the shiller p e advertisement a good way to think about this is to think about two different index funds which invest in the s p500 both funds raise 100m invest the money in the s p500 and issue 100m shares at 1 per share to investors in year 0 dividend fund pays out all of the dividends received to shareholders as a dividend buyback fund uses dividends received to buy back its own shares i e both funds always own the same dollar amount of the underlying s p it is just that they both have a different number of shares in their own fund ideally you want each fund to have the same valuation statistics using cape 2 0 or 3 0 they do using cape they don t say the underlying profit grows at the inflation rate the payout ratio is 70 and the s p trades on 19x the prior year earnings then you will see the cape for the buyback fund is way higher than the other methods advertisement flex the assumptions the result is the same say you put in 4 real growth under both methods cape 2 0 22 5x the dividend only cape is 22 5x but the buyback only cape 26 2x net effect because shiller s original version does not adjust for buybacks the cape will look artificially higher 3 asset accounting standards have changed advertisement the main issue is this in 1919 there is a pandemic and my sales drop 50 i write down the value of my assets by 50 the pandemic passes my sales bounce back and i write the value of my assets back up in 2020 there is a pandemic and my sales drop 50 i write down the value of my assets by 50 the pandemic passes my sales bounce back and i cannot write the value of my assets back up jesse livermore does a great job of exposing these issues across a series of posts tldr summary accounting standards have changed we need to adjust earnings to reflect that 3 1 write downs advertisement write downs split the investment community on how to adjust for example a company makes 100 per year in earnings it buys an asset for 50 earning 5 per year now company earnings are 105 then the asset hits trouble and the earnings fall to 1 the asset gets written down to zero company earnings are 100 1 50 49 for one year and then 99 after that on the one hand the 50 loss is a genuine reflection that management stuffed up we want to see the effect particularly if the stuff ups are irregular but persistent by taking a ten year average we get a smoothed view of the effect on the other hand investors only care about the 99 and the current capital structure from a valuation perspective that is what the company has going forward it doesn t matter if the company paid 50 for the asset or 1 or 5 000 it was in the past the penalty of the bad acquisition has been paid in the form of higher debt or more shares this is the mechanism for affecting earnings per share if we also add in the write downs then we are double counting we care about how much a company that earns 99 per year is worth with today s capital structure 3 2 fake write downs the practical problem is companies use this preference against investors investors want to ignore write downs ok companies will try and disguise whatever they can as a write down advertisement restructuring charges pop up all the time with companies hoping investors will ignore them but they are not the same paying former employees redundancy payments is a straight up cost not a balance sheet adjustment and restructuring happens all the freaking time companies also try other things on say inventory write downs which sound like a real writedown but really they simply show the company spending more on making something that it receives again a straight up loss it isn t double counting 3 3 no good sources of data i ve looked at company earnings data from all of the major data sources none of them gets it right every time most of them make it difficult to get the actual numbers that i want what we want to exclude are non recurring changes in assets or liabilities but it isn t easily available mostly this is the fault of companies they try to obfuscate but the data collectors don t really try that hard to fix 3 4 and in the other direction goodwill amortisation used to be a thing but is no more this systematically reduced earnings before 2001 but no longer does that makes a difference in the opposite direction 3 5 pre 2000 data i am making two assumptions that i am unsure about one is that the write ups will offset some but far from all of the write downs especially as we are taking ten year periods advertisement the other assumption is there were no other major accounting issues in the distant past that i should be adjusting for i have less faith in this assumption 3 6 effect of changes i have adjusted to remove 50 of the effect of write downs from numbers post the fas 142 accounting change why only 50 because there were still some write downs before 2001 offset by write ups plus goodwill amortisation plus there is likely a chunk of real depreciation or amortisation that companies hide in the write down process ideally i would prefer to see the entire time series with non recurring changes in assets or liabilities removed but i don t have the data the main effect of this is to reduce the earnings effects of the most recent crises 2001 2002 2008 and 2020 4 depreciation advertisement depreciation typically understates the amount of capital that a company needs to replace because of inflation i e depreciation of a factory is based on the cost of building a factory say ten years ago rather than the cost of building the same factory today in particular in times of high inflation earnings can be considerably overstated jesse livermore once again does a sterling job in his earnings mirage piece noting in 1977 harvard business review shared the results of a review of required replacement cost disclosures of the 100 largest u s companies at the time the results revealed that earnings numbers measured using a replacement cost framework were 35 lower than officially reported gaap earnings numbers reflecting an overstatement of 50 when inflation was at its peak in the united states bodies did mandate practices to correct for it in 1976 the sec published asr 190 which required large companies to disclose what their financial numbers would have come out to under a replacement cost framework fasb followed up in 1979 with the now superceded fas 33 which required a similar disclosure if inflation and capital expenditure were consistent over time then this wouldn t matter but they aren t in times of high inflation like the 1970s earnings will be more overstated than other times and that matches with the data if you look at the cape ratio you can clearly see high inflation periods correspond with a low apparent p e this is a reflection that investors aren t stupid they knew about these issues in fact the sec issued several changes to accounting standards to require companies to disclose the difference the s p 500 traded on a lower p e because investors knew the earnings were overstated a secondary issue is that capital expenditure has been falling as the economy changes from more manufacturing to more services earnings from a market that has less manufacturing and more services should be less understated advertisement so i make two adjustments for 10 year average inflation between 1 and 3 i make no changes outside that range i use jesse s estimates to normalise earnings back to a 2 inflation rate where i can back to 1947 i calculate the inflation from capital expenditure inflation rather than consumer inflation i make a small adjustment to historical earnings to reflect the rise of services and the decrease in capital expenditure the net effect of these changes is to increase the cape during periods of high inflation in particular the 1970s 5 cost of trading and spreads the other major factor that changes as we look across long periods of time is the cost of investment these days fees are sub 0 1 fifty years ago investors paid significantly more maybe 2 or more how does this affect valuations do investors price stocks based on returns before trading costs or after i find the case more compelling that investors care about returns after trading costs advertisement but how much should we adjust sure costs might have been 2 to buy or sell a stock but investors traded much less i e it wasn t 2 per annum maybe it was 2 over 2 years or 3 trading volumes give some guidance but how do we treat financial manias like the late 1920s when trading volumes rocketed and then you run into the issue of diversification the only free lunch in investing it is much cheaper and easier to get a diversified portfolio today so it makes sense that if investors get better risk adjusted returns they can afford to pay more for individual stocks now than in the 1800s i don t know how large these adjustments should be i have bundled them all together into a 1 25 per annum adjustment in the 1870s i decrease this gradually to 1 in the 1970s and then sliding roughly in line with the fall in fees to current levels it feels about right to me but i have no better support for these changes 6 negative earnings a contentious issue on the one hand share prices don t go negative say i have a portfolio of companies a and b making money and company c losing money if a and b both make 100 and c loses 100 net earnings are 100 put that on 20x earnings and my portfolio is worth 2 000 but what happens if c goes broke now net earnings are 200 should the value of my shares in a and b be worth more because c went broke that doesn t make sense or is it just that my portfolio should be still worth 2 000 and it is now on 10x earnings at a stock level subtracting earnings does not make sense maybe we should just call earnings 0 for loss making companies on the other hand there will always be some companies that lose money and others that make money when we sum up every company in the market we better understand the amount of money the average investor is making i e someone is losing the money when loss making companies become a bigger part of the index or lose more money the index should look more expensive i prefer the second argument but i do like the first as well my preference would be to see both series seeing where the divergences are provides information i have more recent data but i don t have enough historical data to do this back in time 7 re investment there is an argument in some circles that if companies retain capital by paying lower dividends future growth should be higher advertisement i m not sold on this argument if you make adjustments for lower dividends then you also need to make adjustments for buybacks and then you need to make adjustments for changes in debt and new equity issues my concern is that this argument conflates a financing decision with an investing decision i believe the two are separate for example assume you have three companies a b and c all make 100 in earnings in year 0 and want to make an investment of 75 in year 1 company a pays out 25 in dividends then retains 75 to pay for the investment company b pays out 50 in dividends buys back 50 of shares and then borrows 75 to pay for the investment company c pays out 100 in dividends and then raises 75 of new shares to pay for the investment in theory the growth in earnings before interest and tax will be the same for all the effect on earnings per share is different depending on interest rates valuations and returns but why adjust only for company a the effect of all of the above will be captured in earnings per share jesse livermore once again did a lot of analysis to conclude that the effect was largely insignificant net effect there are different ways a company can fund growth i don t believe dividend re investment to be a factor worth adjusting for wrap up the messages from the cape 2 0 are that there are some fundamental easily solved issues with cape that make it look more expensive than it is my cape 3 0 changes are more arbitrary but don t change the current levels however they do suggest that historical cape levels may have been considerably higher in some periods considerably lower over the last 20 years advertisement the key message for me is that the current market is not as overvalued as the shiller p e makes out and it wouldn t have to fall that far to bring it back to a more average value relative to bonds equities are a little cheap but that probably says just as much about bonds as it does equities most importantly the last 20 years go from looking like an expensive aberration to merely being a typical investment period with some low valuations some high

when it comes to music and movies rolling stone is pretty good they should probably just stick to their roots as a music journalism venture being an entertainment magazine is also fine there s plenty of music and movie news to fill the pages and people can still be biased they can still include their culture swipes at conservative america i don t care we should all expect these outlets to carry that tile anyway then again seldom does a publication eat buckshot so brutally twice in less than 10 years i mean you cannot make this up who looks down the barrel of a loaded shotgun twice and then gets blasted twice that ll be rolling stone you d think they d learn after the university of virginia fiasco you d think they d learn from the libel lawsuit from that circus apparently not this publication lied about a gang rape and now has lied about covid granted the covid story while a bad one isn t as bad as the uva gang rape that never happened still the errors that led to both stories being outright hoaxes are the same they don t check their sources let s go to the publication s covid hysteria piece that was grade a trash that resonated loudly among the liberal media echo chamber to refresh there was a media driven hoax about ivermectin that s an anti parasite drug commonly used to treat roundworm infections and river blindness it s reportedly been tossed around as a treatment for covid it s not officially but a simple analysis cannot be done since the liberal media does what they do best overreact and make stuff up for a few days we had this tall tale of rural hospitals being awash with ivermectin overdoses rolling stone was the starting quarterback on this one which led to this correction update one hospital has denied dr jason mcelyea s claim that ivermectin overdoses are causing emergency room backlogs and delays in medical care in rural oklahoma and rolling stone has been unable to independently verify any such cases as of the time of this update this is a prime example of why journos should be treated like garbage notice none of them are calling this out it s because this is their standard business practice now comfortably smug comfortablysmug september 5 2021 all rolling stone does is peddle hoaxes sean davis seanmdav september 5 2021 checking in on the guy who wrote the rolling stone piece and ah pic twitter com tlzi6x5dr7 noam mf blum neontaster september 5 2021 still up still no misinformation warning still no correction stephen l miller redsteeze september 6 2021 latest update from rollingstone completely shreds the premise of the original piece why hasn t it been taken down pic twitter com u8uugtder6 drew holden drewholden360 september 6 2021 so the whole story is fake news the magazine couldn t verify any cases is this a joke gunshot victims left waiting as horse dewormer overdoses overwhelm oklahoma hospitals doctor says was what was originally tweeted out by rolling stone gunshot victims left waiting as horse dewormer overdoses overwhelm oklahoma hospitals doctor says pic twitter com is4nassoya rolling stone rollingstone september 3 2021 the inability to verify seems to be an issue that s nagging at this liberal outlet whether it s a pandemic of rape on college campuses they fail let s go back to a rape on campus which was first exalted as an ace piece on the issue sabrina rubin erdely was just so brave for writing about it until it fell apart within days remember that the jackie was gang raped by drew and his pals at some fraternity party one of the many issues is that drew didn t exist the photo of him was of a person that wasn t even a student at uva he was a high school classmate of jackie oh and his name appeared to be haven monahan rolling stone did not interview jackie s three friends who saw her the night of the alleged attack erdely should have folks the level of rolling stone s failure here was so bad and so deep that cnn had to take part in cleaning up the mess on a fall night two years ago jackie the alleged victim of a brutal gang rape recounted her story in vivid detail to two friends she recalled the assault for ryan duffin and alex stock on picnic tables at the quaint university of virginia campus duffin and stock told cnn they remember a starkly different account than what appeared in rolling stone their version cast doubt over whether the man who allegedly orchestrated the attack even existed i mean there are definitely some major holes in the story said stock who also met jackie through a mutual friend at summer orientation i think that that was pretty clear in the rolling stone piece it was almost too perfect of a story jackie s lawyer declined to comment to cnn for this article duffin and stock said they were never contacted by the magazine instead the writer portrayed them through jackie s eyes t rees shapiro who was then an education reporter for the washington post actually did what erdely should have done when the story collapsed he tried to verify everything that was alleged core pieces simply did not reflect reality the final gut punch was the columbia school of journalism s 13 000 word evisceration of this piece via nyt the first misstep during the reporting process the columbia report said was that ms erdely did not seek to independently contact three of jackie s friends who were quoted in the piece using pseudonyms expressing trepidation at the idea of jackie telling the authorities that she had been assaulted the quotes came from jackie s recollection of the conversation those friends later cast doubt on jackie s story in interviews with the washington post and denied saying the words rolling stone had attributed to them the three told the report s authors that they would have made the same denials to rolling stone if they had been contacted rolling stone the report said also did not provide the fraternity with enough information to adequately respond to questions from the magazine later when the article had been published the fraternity phi kappa psi said it did not host a function on the weekend jackie had specified and the magazine failed to identify jackie s attacker the report said it was content to give him a pseudonym drew when jackie resisted ms erdely s request to help find him the fraternity the post and the police have been unable to find anyone who matches jackie s description of drew the reporting errors by ms erdely were compounded by insufficient scrutiny and skepticism from editors the report said and the fact checking process relied heavily on four hours of conversations with jackie everything was wrong everything and yes you notice that a lot of liberal outlets called out rolling stone for this piece of sensationalist garbage this isn t the first time the national media got a ton of egg on their face over the duke lacrosse rape story that also was a piece of fiction they failed then what makes you think they ll learn especially now when intentionally lying is rewarded and often protected key editors initially kept their jobs after rolling stone s uva trip up erdely was originally kept on staff and the magazine s apology was so botched that you could see how a rape on campus went to print with all the calamities that rested within the text it was a classic example of when the liberal moral superiority complex is owned totally by the facts facts they ignored so they could manufacture a story that fed into their narrative now we have this parasite covid story that very much fell victim to the same practices that torpedoed the uva story yes the latter brought lawsuits yes the latter ruined erdley s career as she was found guilty of libel against then uva associate dean nicole eramo but both stories show why the media s trust numbers are in the toilet they don t care if they lie they intentionally do so for rolling stone maybe they should just leave the news business entirely for everyone else well they have their moments no doubt a broken clock is right twice a day though that still doesn t negate the fact that the quasi state media complex that always helps democrats is an enemy of the people this industry can t report rape in america accurately the same goes with covid now it s an evolutionary journey that many of us aren t shocked to see

the analysis comes at a time when the covid 19 pandemic has made millions of american workers uneasy about their financial stability it s been more than a decade since the federal minimum wage increased to 7 25 an hour one of the longest periods of time its gone without a boost since the program was first implemented nearly a century ago in that period of time the us has seen enormous growth in its economy with the stock market and corporate profits reaching record heights still wages have stagnated and even decreased if inflation is considered however if the minimum wage did keep pace with the country s booming economy one economist says workers would be seeing a federal minimum wage of about 26 an hour in a blog post for the center for economic policy and research economist dean baker says for the first 30 years of the program s existence wages did keep pace with the country s economic productivity but some time in the 1970s wages began lagging behind the country s productivity and has been in a tailspin ever since baker says his research is not meant to inform any serious economic policy it s more of a thought experiment for picturing what the world could look like but he states it s a very unrealistic picture in order to have a minimum wage that high other changes would need to be made to the economy baker says that would result in mass unemployment however that s mainly due to the fact that our economy is structured to not support workers earning near the bottom according to baker the analysis comes at a time when the covid 19 pandemic has made millions of american workers uneasy about their financial stability during the pandemic the wealth of the richest americans soared while those who relied on low wage jobs were more likely to get laid off according to cbs news labor data shows that around 250 000 workers earn the federal minimum wage of 7 25 an hour nearly 865 000 earn less

donate to support us former fed official warns of urgent threat of another financial crisis t co iuoxk6h4l7 stephene klein stepheneklein september 6 2021 are you ready for the greatest financial disaster of our generation several key indicators that have accurately predicted previous stock market crashes are now signaling that financial markets and the economy are about to face a massive crisis and one of the most important gauges is flashing red for the first time in decades recent data released by the u s department of housing and urban development hud reveals that the median sales price for houses sold across the country in the second quarter of 2021 was 374 900 the highest figure ever recorded and 4 51 percent higher than the figures seen during the final quarter of 2020 about one year ago the median price for a home was 322 600 which is to say that housing prices skyrocketed by a whopping 52 300 in only 12 months marking a 16 percent increase the hud report highlighted that the last time housing prices surged by 16 percent in a single year was in 1987 34 years ago what does this have to do with the stock market well when housing prices are rising this aggressively in such a short time span it s typically a sign of severe distortions in the financial system meaning that a stock market crash and an economic recession are about to unfold given that the current financial bubble includes everything from stocks to bonds to housing what happens in one market can have a direct impact on the other and the imbalances seen in the housing market are threatening to push the stock market to the brink of a major collapse never before in history the fed and the national government have created such a staggering amount of money in such a short period needless to say these reckless policies have sparked dramatic economic distortions across a series of important industries nothing else can explain why housing prices increased to the highest level in over three decades or why stock markets recorded the largest gains ever and multinational corporations reported extraordinary profits amidst one of the bleakest economic scenarios of modern times all of this started to occur just as the economy faced mass business shutdowns that led to millions of job losses september is historically known as the cruelest month for wall street and many investment experts have been warning that a stock market crash is likely to occur this month autumn is a traditionally rough season for investors the 1929 stock market crash black monday 1987 and the lehman brothers meltdown in 2008 all happened in september or october as the managing director of fund platform bestinvest jason hollands recently outlined in an interview with cnbc history suggests we should all be very worried about what s coming next september spells danger for investors as it is a month with a reputation for volatile markets this is more than a myth he said the financial expert warned that the current rally cannot last for much longer at this point all evidence is signaling that a stock market crash of epic proportions could occur at any moment and one extremely concerning market indicator just jumped to its highest level ever recorded suggesting stocks are about to face a steep downfall given that the market already reached its peak the buffett indicator named after the legendary investor warren buffett has climbed to unprecedented levels which means stocks are vastly overpriced and a crash is now looming on the horizon about a week ago the wilshire 5000 total market index closed at nearly 46 69 trillion and the s p 500 and nasdaq indexes ended hit new record highs from then on stocks started to plummet and on the other hand the latest estimate for second quarter gdp is 22 72 trillion which puts the buffett indicator at 205 according to the famed investor and berkshire hathaway ceo when the indicator hit a record high during the dot com bubble it should have been a very strong warning signal of an imminent crash right now investors should be looking out for the catalyst that could trigger the crash otherwise they may be left empty handed before they have an opportunity to run for the exits in the meantime conditions in both financial markets and the economy continue to deteriorate because rather than returning to fiscal sanity the current administration and the fed continue to do everything in their power to spend trillions of dollars more on new unnecessary government programs projects and stimulus packages right now not only the u s economy is treading on extremely dangerous ground but housing stock and bond markets are also on the verge of a financial catastrophe it s time for americans to prepare for the worst because things are changing extremely fast

bloomberg sign up for the new economy daily newsletter follow us economics and subscribe to our podcast global central bankers trying to gauge the threat posed by surging inflation have another puzzle to solve too whether the pandemic has shifted their policy bearings the disruption caused by covid 19 has been so extensive that economists including kristin forbes at the massachusetts institute of technology are now wondering if one repercussion could be an increase in advanced economies neutral level of interest rate the setting at which growth is neither stimulated nor constricted if that equilibrium point sometimes called r has drifted higher that would mean central banks already ultra easy monetary policy is looser than generally thought while that offers the prospect that officials may need to repeatedly raise interest rates in due course to brake the economy it also holds the risk that they misjudge how stimulative their stance is such a policy error could open the door to an enduring bout of inflation economists including new york federal reserve president john williams have long judged r to have plummeted since the turn of the millennium citing forces such as demographics or productivity growth factors that might reverse that now include a sudden shift toward digitization a wave of innovation structural labor market changes massive fiscal stimulus and a wholesale return of risk appetite just because it has fallen in the past we don t know where it s going and there s a good chance it could pick up again said forbes an mit professor and a former external member of the bank of england s monetary policy committee everyone talks about the long term decline like it will last forever and i think the risks are two ways forbes touched on the topic last month at the kansas city fed s annual jackson hole symposium the event also featured a paper concluding that worsening income inequality in the u s has been a key factor in the decline of r rather than demographics such discussions underscore how identifying the forces driving the metric remains a matter of academic debate just as views also differ on how to calculate it in the u s deutsche bank ag economists reckon the rate has fallen almost to zero fed officials are taking a wait and see approach according to the median estimate of quarterly federal open market committee projections which has assessed r at 0 5 on an inflation adjusted basis since mid 2019 a model maintained by the new york fed suggested it was probably at 0 36 in june 2020 its last estimate before calculations got suspended due to big output swings caused by the pandemic such is the rate s elusive nature that in 2018 st louis federal reserve president james bullard in arguing that the level was likely to stay persistently low resorted to the star wars analogy of the phantom menace to describe r central bankers use the gauge in judging whether their policy stance is appropriate to generate the right amount of inflation that s pertinent now as officials on both sides of the atlantic confront rising consumer prices which they currently attribute to temporary factors such as transportation bottlenecks it s the pandemic s impact on the structure and potential of economies that raises the prospect that r has shifted on productivity for example there s tentative evidence that years of slowing expansion may have reversed aided by remote working and digitization mckinsey global institute research estimates productivity growth in the u s and western europe could increase by about 1 percentage point annually in the years to 2024 more than doubling the pre pandemic pace lasting workforce changes for example from women dropping out to home school children during the crisis might also have helped lift the neutral rate dario perkins an economist at ts lombard in london wonders if the pandemic actually even initially depressed r further but he now reckons it s rising again with the tailwind of wholesale fiscal stimulus first we need to get back to where we were he said beyond that you can see the signs of a gentle inflection point but it s going to be very reliant on governments spending longer term an aging workforce across industrialized countries might mean a smaller supply of labor and a lower demand for savings as people leave jobs for retirement budget deficits and the expansion of credit to the private sector also could weigh on savings i now believe that the global saving glut may be ending said philip turner a visitor at the london based national institute of economic and social research and previously an official at the bank for international settlements this would mean that the equilibrium real interest rate needed to hold back inflation has risen inflation path the path of inflation itself will help determine how much a higher r actually matters for central bankers while the bis is among those observing little evidence of labor costs picking up enough for people to start expecting price increases down the road wages in the u s and the u k have begun to rise as firms struggle to attract workers concerns about such pressures have yet to take hold among investors however even though risk aversion is now far less pronounced than it was earlier in the pandemic what the market is telling us is that we have that savings absorption problem implicitly telling us that the neutral real interest rate in the industrial world even in the face of very large real interest rates is going to be significantly negative former u s treasury secretary larry summers a paid contributor to bloomberg said during a panel discussion on sept 2 longer term however lower demand for safe assets such as government bonds as the covid crisis abates should push the natural rate up said former european central bank chief economist peter praet though he doubts more powerful factors like productivity growth or demographics will have much of an influence imminently if atif mian ludwig straub and amir sufi authors of the jackson hole paper are right about inequality being a big driver the worsening gap between the haves and the have nots caused by the pandemic would mean r isn t likely to rise soon at all are we going to see a reversal in the coming years there are some indications but i would not bet too much on this praet said 2021

the square mile must embrace communist china to thrive after brexit city lobbyists have said in a manifesto which risks drawing the wrath of tory backbenchers ministers should help firms deepen their ties with the authoritarian country and could offer to help beijing develop its capital markets according to thecityuk which represents financial and professional service companies across london other proposals in its manifesto for british finance include cutting the tax burden on uk lenders by scrapping the bank surcharge reducing sponsorship costs and processing times for visas for highly skilled workers and providing clearer guidance about how a new national security act will be applied the china charm offensive aligns the lobby group with rishi sunak the chancellor who has backed a closer relationship however it drew swift condemnation from campaigners and mps critical of china s brutal treatment of uighur muslims and its suppression of democracy campaigners in hong kong tom tugendhat a conservative mp and chairman of the commons foreign affairs committee said over the past three months we have seen beijing order a wave of crackdowns on chinese businesses including companies being warned that they won t be able to list abroad when xi is tightening his grip over the chinese economy now is surely the time for british businesses to show extra caution about deepening relationships with the chinese government and its capital markets thecityuk said that finance firms should help china to develop its markets and expand its green finance and fintech industries it added that the square mile should also look to do more business with other developing markets including russia saudi arabia and india it made the proposals as part of a new international strategy aimed at helping london to overtake new york as the world s leading financial centre within five years mr sunak hailed china as one of the most important economies in the world and said that the uk s relationship with it lacks nuance in a speech at mansion house two months ago some city firms have already responded kindly to the chancellor s remarks with legal general the uk s biggest pensions manager plotting an expansion into china but gray sergeant of the henry jackson society a foreign policy think tank said he is concerned about efforts to forge a new partnership with beijing he said if deeper ties means deeper dependency then such an approach will only make it harder for britain to stand up to china s challenges to the existing liberal international order thecityuk said it wants london to grow the uk s share of key global financial markets as well as building new capabilities in areas such as data technology and international risk management the uk lost its crown as the world s leading international financial centre to the us in 2018 according to the global financial centres index stock market listings which are a key indicator of the strength of a financial centre plunged in the uk between 2010 and 2020 the number of international companies listed on the london stock exchange fell from 599 to 370 miles celic chief executive of thecityuk said one of the greatest risks for any successful financial centre is complacency europe is littered with cities that were once the leading international centre of their day the last decade has been one of growth for our industry yet global competitors have grown faster however with the right strategy in place and a clear focus on delivery the uk can pull away once again from its competitors it is an ambition that needs industry government and regulators to work together it will take sustained focus cooperation and determination
britain needs to ease taxes on banks and make it easier to hire staff from abroad its financial and professional services lobby said in a blueprint to help london unseat new york as the world s top international financial centre within five years the strategy paper on tuesday from thecityuk reiterated some ideas already aired in government backed reports and elsewhere in recent months as the city of london looks to recoup ground lost following britain s departure from the eu by some metrics the uk is losing ground london is currently slipping further behind new york each year while other centres are strengthening the paper said the u s financial capital overtook london in 2018 in a leading annual survey it said adding that new york dominated in stock market listings the uk therefore needs to adopt a relentless focus on strengthening its international competitiveness to win back the prize of being the world s leading international financial centre thecityuk lobby group which promotes the wider financial sector abroad paper added in the paper britain s departure from the european union effectively closed london off from its biggest financial services customer adding further pressure to catch up the finance ministry has already set out reforms to make london s capital market more competitive and thecityuk set a five year target for london to out compete its rivals by amending tax visa and other rules becoming the global hub for financial data sustainability investing and investment and risk management will also be crucial in helping britain overtake new york thecityuk said the total tax rate for a london bank is 46 5 13 higher than a new york based bank it added but persuading government to cut taxes on finance as it mends a hole in the economy from covid may be challenging as will having an open door on hiring given the brexit referendum pledged to crack down on high levels of international mobility the single most important issue for financial firms is being able to hire globally thecityuk ceo miles celic said in conversations we have had with government i think that is something that is absolutely understood he told reporters reuters

neuchatel switzerland business wire masimo nasdaq masi announced today the findings of a prospective blinded observational study published in annals of intensive care in which dr jean baptiste lascarrou and colleagues at the centre hospitalier universitaire in nantes france evaluated the ability of masimo ori to predict mild hypoxemia during endotracheal intubation eti in icu patients 1 they concluded that the time between decrease in ori and subsequent decrease in oxygen saturation spo 2 may allow preventive action and that a higher ori value during preoxygenation was independently protective against hypoxemia ori available outside the u s is a noninvasive and continuous trending index that extends oxygen monitoring on patients on supplemental oxygen enabled by the multi wavelength rainbow pulse co oximetry platform ori is provided alongside oxygen saturation spo 2 measured by clinically proven masimo set pulse oximetry noting the importance of optimizing preoxygenation in patients needing eti the researchers sought to evaluate whether ori could provide early warning of impending hypoxemia during the procedure because ori supplies information beyond the range explored by spo 2 of the 51 patients who met the inclusion criteria ori alongside spo 2 was monitored using masimo radical 7 pulse co oximeters and rainbow fingertip sensors when preoxygenation began values were recorded every two seconds and attending clinicians were not aware of these values the primary endpoint measured was the time between ori decreasing below 0 4 and the onset of mild hypoxemia defined as spo 2 97 secondarily the investigators evaluated whether a decline in ori during preoxygenation predicted the occurrence of mild hypoxemia during eti analyzing areas under the roc curve the researchers found that ori during preoxygenation predicted spo 2 97 during intubation 0 73 95 confidence interval of 0 58 0 88 by contrast spo 2 at the end of preoxygenation was poorly predictive 0 54 95 ci 0 40 0 67 using univariate analysis they found that a higher ori value during preoxygenation was associated with a less frequent occurrence of spo 2 97 odds ratio of 0 09 95 ci 0 01 0 69 p 0 0199 and that the highest ori value during preoxygenation remained significantly associated with a lower risk of spo 2 97 during eti after adjustment for eti duration and bmi odds ratio of 0 76 95 ci 0 61 0 95 p 0 0141 the researchers concluded the median time between the ori decrease below 0 4 and the spo 2 decrease below 97 during the apneic period was 81 seconds a higher ori during preoxygenation was independently associated with a lower risk of mild hypoxemia spo 2 97 the researchers noted that the median 81 seconds of forewarning may allow immediate intubation early face mask ventilation insertion of a supraglottic device or a call for help in the event of intubation difficulties in addition they noted that ori monitoring can help identify patients who do not increase their oxygen reserve despite preoxygenation and are therefore at risk of desaturation during eti these patients may benefit from a longer preoxygenation period and or a change in device the authors further noted that an ori decline might lead to the detection of a fault in the preoxygenation technique such as an insufficient oxygen flow rate or major leaks as a study limitation the authors noted that their findings cannot be generalized to icu patients who did not meet the inclusion criteria as those patient cohorts remain to be evaluated the inclusion criteria for this study were icu admission with a need for eti and an spo 2 fio 2 ratio above 214 the spo 2 fio 2 ratio was measured during noninvasive ventilation or high flow oxygen therapy for conventional oxygen therapy the fraction of inspired oxygen fio 2 was calculated as fio 2 0 21 o 2 x 0 03 ori has not received fda 510 k clearance and is not available for sale in the united states masimo masimo

the privacy once enjoyed by investors who finance other people s lawsuits was rarely questioned before hulk hogan brought a media spotlight onto the niche industry by winning a 140 million jury verdict that forced the gawker website into bankruptcy when terry jean bollea the professional wrestler s real name filed an invasion of privacy lawsuit against gawker entertainment in 2013 it was generally assumed that the existence of a litigation finance agreement was nobody s business other than the plaintiff and their counsel but after bollea reached a 31 million post judgment settlement agreement with gawker the press cited confidential sources to report that silicon valley tech billionaire peter thiel had funded the lawsuit since then tort reform advocates have made some progress toward requiring more disclosure when litigation funding agreements are used wisconsin in 2018 passed a law that requires disclosure of any litigation funding agreement that is in place west virginia passed a similar statute in 2019 but regulate only litigation finance agreements with individual consumers not corporations at least two federal court districts the northern district of california in 2017 and the new jersey district earlier this year have adopted rules requiring disclosure of the existence of any litigation funding contracts in a case in the meantime the american bar association has outlined best practices for attorneys who use litigation funders the california bar association has also issued guidance about ethical considerations jonathan h colman a los angeles area insurance defense attorney discussed those legal developments during the combined claims conference held in garden grove calif last month he said lawyers who aren t careful when they share information about a case with a litigation funder can potentially open a path for defense attorneys to compel disclosure the concern would be the trap doors for the plaintiff where they inadvertently provide information that violates the attorney work product privilege or attorney client privilege he said the case law is thin colman noted only two cases where judges considered whether the identity of litigation funders was relevant to the case which arguably would make them subject to disclosure through the discovery process in a patent lawsuit filed by cxt systems against several major retailers magistrate judge roy s payne for the eastern district of texas ruled in january 2020 that the identify of litigation funders was not relevant to the issue being tried and barred all testimony regarding the source of funding but in another patent lawsuit filed by continental circuits against intel corp and one of its supplier senior u s district judge david g campbell in arizona ordered the plaintiff to provide the defendants with the identity of all persons or entities who had a financial interest in the outcome of the lawsuit campbell rejected the defendants request to disclose the actual litigation funding agreement and the identities of litigation funders who declined to invest in the case there isn t a lot of precedent colman acknowledged it is certainly getting much more active when i first looked in 2018 i didn t have any of these cases he said even though the defense didn t get what it wanted in the texas case it is notable that a federal judge even considered whether a litigation funding agreement might be relevant to the issues at hand there was nothing like this three years ago he said abusive litigation the u s chamber of commerce institute for legal reform first sounded an alarm about litigation financing in a white paper published in 2012 the industry has only grown in size and legitimacy since then the chamber s paper cautioned that third party funding for lawsuits will increase the amount of abusive litigation because investors will buy an interest across an entire portfolio of cases including cases that are weak on merits but have a small chance of returning a significant award litigation funding agreements also compromise the attorney client relationship because the attorney will feel an obligation to maximize the return for investors which may not always be in the client s best interest the chamber said the white paper pointed to one especially seedy story about litigation funding that ended with a criminal contempt conviction of a plaintiff s attorney investors funded lawsuits against chevron by indigenous persons in ecuador for pollution to the lago agrio region of the amazon rainforest the funding agreement guaranteed a return of at least 55 million to investors even if the court awarded only 70 million according to the chamber the courts in ecuador awarded the plaintiffs 9 billion but in 2014 chevron persuaded u s district judge lewis kaplan in manhattan to bar enforcement of the award because of corruption in 2016 kaplan ruled that attorney steven donziger and attorneys for the investors had paid a 500 000 bribe to a judge in ecuador he sentenced donziger to house arrest for criminal contempt the 2nd circuit court of appeals in march affirmed five of the six criminal contempt charges against donzinger vacating one because it was ambiguous in the meantime donzinger was convicted of separate but related contempt charges and is scheduled to be sentenced for those violations on oct 1 donzinger had already spent nearly two years under house arrest at his new york city apartment he said on his twitter account that chevron is corrupt and told esquire magazine that he was targeted by the most vicious corporate counter attack in history empirical data a 2018 research paper published by cornell law review said third party litigation funding has been a part of the american legal system for more than two decades but the general public wasn t widely aware of the industry until the press reported about thiel s involvement in the gawker litigation media coverage of the metoo movement also increased public awareness stories that focused on alleged abuses by litigation funders attracted the attention of lawmakers according to the paper written by law professors ronen avrham and anthony sebok the new york times reported in one story that litigation funders were charging interest rates as high as 100 the researchers said reform legislation followed two streams avrham and sebok said the litigation funding industry generally supported the transparency approach taken by maine nebraska ohio oklahoma and vermont which passed laws that explicitly allow litigation funding but impose controls such as standardized contract language minimum cancellation periods and prohibition against attorney referral fees other states passed laws advocated by tort reform pressure groups such as the chamber of commerce the paper says arkansas indiana and tennessee imposed caps on the premiums charged to consumers but avrham and sebok said there was little empirical data available on which to base public policy seeking to fill that gap the researchers examined 191 144 funded and unfunded litigation finance applications submitted to a major funding firm in order to gain insight about the funders modus operandi the paper says agreements are typically structured in two ways for sophisticated litigants such as corporations the litigation funder typically takes a share of the proceeds from a lawsuit after the case is resolved but litigation funders who finance lawsuits by individual litigants typically structure the agreements as loans that charge a specific interest rate so the cost increases as long as the litigation remains pending the researchers said that on paper litigation funding agreements typically require the litigants to repay 115 of the amount of money advance for litigation but after defaults and discounts or haircuts taken by funders off of the amount owed the average annual interest rate amounted to 43 the authors noted that the rate of return is less than the average amount permitted by indiana s litigation funding statute which allows a maximum interest rate of 36 plus 10 in additional fees the authors said litigation finance investors employ a robust underwriting process 52 of the applications submitted were rejected either outright or after review for the cases that were accepted the funder was repaid more than the amount advanced to the litigant in 88 of cases and 12 of cases ended with a default litigation finance investors enjoyed a 91 return on investment on average the researchers said their findings suggest that there are reasons to be skeptical about claims that litigation financing contracts encourage frivolous litigation on the other hand they said litigation finance agreements were often complex and opaque and consumers may benefit from regulations to protect them for example more than eight out of 10 of the agreements require the plaintiffs to pay interest that compounded monthly that has the effect of turning a 42 simple interest loan into a 51 return for a typical case that takes 14 months to resolve with those kind of returns it is no wonder that litigation funding is a fast growing investment class westfleet advisors reported that from june 2019 to june 2020 46 active funds managed 11 3 billion in assets allocated to commercial litigation in the united states up 18 from the previous year total dollars committed to new litigation financing investments grew 6 to 2 47 billion despite court slowdowns caused by the pandemic westfleet said in january one litigation funder burford capital is listed on the new york and london stock exchanges and incidentally pays sebok one of the authors of the research report mentioned above as an ethics advisor the company said in its 2020 annual report that it recovered 1 6 billion in assets since its inception in 2016 and earned a 91 return on the capital invested burford said that court slowdowns caused by covid 19 caused business to slip in 2020 but a new kind of customer helped fill the gap the company said corporate clients are starting to see the benefits of paying attorneys based on the amount they recover rather than hourly fees but law firms typically don t have the balance sheet necessary to pay operating expenses without a steady stream of income legal finance has grown rapidly over the past decade to bridge this gap the report says the argument for disclosure rules requiring disclosure of litigation finance agreements are not necessarily an impediment to further growth michael mcdonald a finance professor at fairfield university in connecticut operates an investment consulting firm that carefully tracks the litigation finance industry in a series of articles he wrote in 2017 mcdonald said usery laws were the most important factor for states that landed on his list of the worst states for litigation finance mcdonald said usery arguments the concept that excessive charges for borrowers are improper can be used to invalidate litigation funding contracts colorado courts have held that litigation funding agreements are subject statutory limits while courts in other states have used different approaches some examples alabama courts have held that litigation financing agreements are a form of gambling or speculating in litigation and are therefore void as against public policy a kentucky statute renders litigation financing contracts void pennsylvania recognizes the doctrine of champerty which holds that it is improper for a party not involved in a suit other than attorneys to have a financial interest in the outcome in an email mcdonald said that the litigation finance industry generally resists rules requiring disclosure of funding contracts but in his view that attitude is short sighted he said he expects more jurisdictions to require disclosure in the future disclosure helps to bring transparency to the situation and is actually good for all sides it provides more insight for defendants on who they are up against and the motivations of plaintiffs and it has some marketing value and very little in the way of stigma for funders plaintiffs mcdonald said he agrees with colman that courts are increasingly seeing disclosure of litigation funding contracts as a reasonable step he also agrees that disclosure can create some landmines for attorneys on a case but that problem will sort itself out over time once attorneys understand what the requirements are around disclosure and have taken those steps a few times then mistakes or oversight is less likely to occur he said generally the existence of a litigation funding agreement is protected by the work product doctrine which holds that written or oral materials created to prepare for litigation do not have to be disclosed to the adverse party but that protection is not absolute it can waived if the other side shows an undue hardship or substantial need also an attorney can inadvertently waive the protection by disclosing the information to a third party such as a litigation funder ethics guidance the courts have been divided on when privilege is waived but professional organizations are urging lawyers to use caution in august 2020 the american bar association published a report that outlines best practices for attorneys to consider before entering litigation funding arrangements the report says that attorneys should assume that the litigation funding arrangement may well be examined by a court or the other party at some point in litigation the california state bar association also issued guidance on litigation funding last year in a formal opinion the bar reminded attorneys that their first and foremost duty of loyalty is to their client and the funder cannot be allowed to interfere with the litigation attorneys must obtain their clients informed consent before sharing any confidential information some courts are requiring disclosure even when privilege hasn t been waived the federal northern district of california was the first adopting a rule in 2017 that requires parties to disclose the identity of any person or entity that is funding any class action lawsuit a rule adopted by the u s district court in new jersey that took effect in june goes further a party who receives litigation funding must identify the funder and describe the funder s financial interest in the case the rule also requires disclosure if the litigation funding contract requires the funder s approval of any litigation decisions or settlement john j hanley a new york city attorney who represents litigation funders said about third of the federal district courts have adopted rules regarding disclosure of litigation funding agreements but they are not uniform he said a simple non disclosure agreement signed by the client and the litigation funder will usually protect a plaintiff s attorney from any argument that the work product privilege has been waived hanley said various disclosure requirements have been adopted by some courts and state legislatures but most don t require the actual litigation funding contracts to be disclosed the wisconsin statute is an exception hanley a partner with rimon law said he also agrees with colman that attorneys who don t tread carefully can open a door that would allow a defendant to require disclosure but he said most attorneys working the industry are aware of the pitfalls he said the courts have been adopting rules that require disclosure when a litigation funding agreement exists and may even require the plaintiff to identify the funder but typically the courts don t require anything more than that the trend is not in support of disclosure of the actual funding agreement he said the international legal finance association said in a statement that most courts have ruled that financing agreements are not generally discoverable materials created for and provided to a potential financer because of litigation are typically protected under the work product doctrine additionally the court in continental circuits ruled that such agreements in the case were work product and thus not subject to disclosure the association said finally while bar associations often issue guidance that exhorts attorneys to be mindful of their ethical obligations it is a vast overstatement to say that sharing information with funders can risk the privileges and protections that apply about the photo hulk hogan poses during the mtv video music awards forum at radio city music hall wednesday aug 30 2006 in new york

this rebroadcast originally aired on july 08 2021 something is happening in the workplace there s a massive shift in employment numbers and it has to do with people leaving their jobs more than 4 million americans quit their jobs in april that helped put job vacancies at a 20 year high so what s going on we ask the money ladies financial columnists michelle singletary and rana foroohar about our economy as it emerges from the pandemic this hour on point why americans are saying i quit guests rana foroohar cnn global analyst financial times global business columnist and associate editor author of don t be evil and makers and takers ranaforoohar michelle singletary personal finance columnist for the washington post author of the 21 day financial fast her column the color of money is syndicated in newspapers across the country singletarym jennifer kastelic she quit her job as a domestic support professional to adults with special needs and disabilities in may interview highlights on the increase in americans quitting their jobs michelle singletary what happened with the pandemic especially in the service industry many people realize i don t like this job i m not really making a lot of money and i m in jeopardy of possibly contracting covid and with so much competition even if they wanted to stay in a similar job they can look elsewhere for employers who are paying more i mean my son for example just graduated from college he s looking for a permanent position he applied for two jobs and one was paying him minimum wage and he is like forget that and so he s going to go be a lifeguard which is paying considerably more than a position where he d be a cashier at a supermarket because you know his mama said you got to get a job but i think that was a real good example of what people are doing and he s like listen i m going for a job that s going to pay me more even though that job may not guarantee him the hours that the other one was but he s pretty confident that he can get the hours and i think that s it i applaud those folks who called in and who are saying i am worth more and this market is showing me that on the history of the current job market rana foroohar there s big structural things in play here that have been going on through the pandemic but also for the last few years so if you go back pre pandemic and really even after the great financial crisis there were some policy decisions taken that were essentially meant to keep interest rates low bolster the asset prices we ve talked about that you know stocks went up housing prices went up but also part of that policy decision and this was really driven by the labor left was also to start raising wages at the kind of lower quarter of the socioeconomic spectrum so the fight for 15 you remember real activism around low paying retail and service jobs that was all part of this and indeed before the pandemic you were starting to see a tightening of the labor market in those lower paying jobs and you were even beginning to see certain retailers starbucks duking it out with other chains to get the best service workers so that was happening then you have the pandemic everything falls off a cliff and what s interesting in this country is unlike some other countries where when things fall off a cliff you see the state and the private sector and politicians and labor coming together to keep people in work this country does it differently we simply fire people you know we let them go but the downside of that is it creates these real boom bust cycles in the labor market where suddenly you have everybody that has left work some people are getting stimulus payments that tide them over for a certain time but the companies then have to ramp back up once things start to boom which you know looking around they really are in many parts of the country now you have to hire people from scratch that takes time it takes money it creates these choke points which is what you re seeing now companies all companies all of a sudden all at once need workers that puts labor in a stronger position and you see people taking advantage of that on trends in the labor market rana foroohar there s really two trends there s a short term trend and there s a longer term trend and when i said there was movement there was movement at the lower end of the spectrum which you know god knows was much needed because the idea of making a living on 15 an hour is just incomprehensible so i like the fact that you re seeing wage pressure at the lower end just as a quick note 34 of unemployment right now is people quitting their jobs because they feel confident finding other jobs so that s one of the things about the june report that i really like but to go back to your point yes there is still a huge bifurcation so you might have people who previously would have made 15 an hour or 12 an hour being able to get 21 an hour or 50 an hour in the case of the caller although to be honest let s look at that and say how many houses can she clean can she clean for eight or 10 hours i ll just tell you one personal story when the pandemic hit and we were unable to have anybody in the house and my normal lady who helps us cleaning couldn t come my husband and i said ok well she comes once a week and cleans for 10 hours a day we re going to divide that between the four of us in our household we re going to do this no problem after about three hours we all collapsed exhausted and i was thinking about how much of a raise i can give her when she comes back because these are hard jobs it s not like you re going to be able to work 10 hours a day seven days a week doing this so the wage is really you have to look at it in that context looking to the future of the job market rana foroohar we re in what i would call the post neoliberal world the last 40 years have been about corporate profits about cutting costs about devaluing human capital guess what human capital is the only thing that matters in the digital economy because it s all about what s in your head what s in your heart you know it s about caring and it s about intelligence it s about what people can do and in order to stay ahead of the machines we ve got to start valuing that so i do think that that s coming down the pike from the reading list financial times creative destruction is the silver lining of the covid 19 crisis if there is a silver lining to the covid 19 crisis it is the remarkable creativity shown by the many businesses that have thrived by transforming themselves in unexpected ways

cnn president joe biden must define the politics of this fall before they define him as he seeks to re establish the authority of an administration that often appeared overtaken by a relentless summer of challenges the weeks following labor day will reveal answers that will set the stage for next year s congressional elections they will also help decide whether biden has the potential for a historically significant presidency or gets swamped by the crises he was elected to conquer a crush of challenges and political battles are dominated by a pandemic biden hoped would now be history but the crisis is beginning to feel endless and as it batters national morale is denting his political standing the fallout from a chaotic exit from afghanistan that encapsulated the ignominy of a us defeat is meanwhile raising questions about biden s core promise of competency the internal democratic party tussle between progressives and moderates is highlighting the huge bet of the biden presidency that at a time of national crisis voters want a multi trillion dollar assault on climate change and the remaking of the social safety net reverberations still ring from the conservative supreme court s decision not to block the effective eradication of a woman s constitutional right to an abortion in texas which promises multiple political consequences the house republican party s radical turn to pro donald trump authoritarianism also underscores the deep peril still facing american democracy biden s critical few months will unfold with his presidency tested as never before his approval rating dipped over a brutal august and he often seemed obstinate and impatient at criticism of his performance but he has the tools of a political rebound at hand he s been underestimated almost his entire career including during a campaign for the 2020 democratic nomination that only his close family and most loyal aides believed he could win while all presidents endure rough patches only the most successful pull themselves out of political slumps capitol hill drama history sizes up presidents based on the transformative bills they passed so biden s legacy is on the line as soon as this week as the battle resumes over a bipartisan infrastructure bill and the 3 5 trillion companion spending blueprint that would transform climate social care and health care policy success on both will allow biden to claim one of the most significant legacies of any democratic president for half a century each bill is core to his entire political belief system in prioritizing working and middle class americans they are meant to show government can still work for regular citizens and to answer contempt for washington democracy felt by many blue collar americans who were wooed by trump s populist nationalism and his skill at corralling the resentment of millions of americans against distant elites biden is stoking his own populist sentiment as he calls on the most well off to bankroll the bills with higher taxes for those big corporations that don t want things to change my message is this it s time for working families the folks who built this country to have their taxes cut biden said friday and those corporate interests doing everything they can to find allies in congress to keep that from happening let me be as the old expression goes perfectly clear i m going to take them on biden s ambitious social spending plan is the price progressives in the house demand for voting for the infrastructure bill to repair roads bridges and railroads that would honor another biden promise to promote political unity in bitterly divided washington but west virginia moderate sen joe manchin a critical democrat vote in the 50 50 senate wants to pump the brakes on the spending bill his position could unravel the entire choreography of biden s domestic agenda and it highlights the knife edge between progressives and moderates on which his presidency stands the confrontation also underscores the huge gamble biden is taking with some of the most ambitious social engineering in decades if he fails to lock in fundamental reforms he could demoralize democratic voters and decrease their turn out next year but voters last year did not hand democrats the clear congressional mandate that would make this a risk free endeavor and republicans relish the thought of a midterm election campaign targeting liberal profligacy there are two possibilities it s quite possible democrats lose the house and senate next year if they fail to pass these bills but if republicans are right they might also lose control of congress because they did so biden defiant over afghanistan biden s foreign policy as well as his domestic plans is meant to appeal to working americans as critics of his mismanaged afghan withdrawal highlighted chaos biden repeatedly said he was right to end a costly foreign war he seemed to be speaking to hard working voters whose kids bore the brunt of casualties in the wars abroad triggered by the september 11 attacks the 20th anniversary of which the president will mark saturday yet the messy withdrawal highlighted some sides of biden s character not previously apparent during his presidency he often lacked candor along with empathy for afghans and the deaths of 13 us service personnel along and dozens of civilians in a kabul airport suicide attack raised questions about his self described foreign policy expertise republicans are vowing not to let biden pivot to his domestic agenda with around 100 americans still awaiting rescue in afghanistan and with potentially tens of thousands of afghans who aided us troops and officials over 20 years left behind after the massive us evacuation president biden desperately wants to talk about anything but afghanistan nebraska republican sen ben sasse said in a statement but americans who are hiding from the taliban isis and the haqqani network don t give a damn about news cycles long weekends and polling they want out the white house appears to be convinced americans are now ready to focus on their own problems but if biden s brittle demeanor and missteps highlighted in the afghan chaos spill over into other policy areas there will be fresh questions about his performance texas abortion law ignites new battle another stunning political development at the end of a turbulent summer was contained in the conservative majority supreme court s failure to block a texas state law outlawing abortion after about six weeks the law does not only undercut the constitutional protection to an abortion it is also written in a way that makes it hard to challenge in court the episode is likely to supercharge republican base enthusiasm since it is the culmination of a decades long bid by conservatives to remake the federal judiciary but it could also offer an opening to democrats since it may mobilize female and suburban women voters who have been crucial in recent elections to their cause still the power of the conservative justices could also renew frustration among progressives at biden s refusal to back abolishing the senate filibuster that prevents supreme court and voting rights reform channeling liberal fury biden has promised a full government response to the lone star s state s hardcore conservatism and attorney general merrick garland on monday pledged to use federal law to protect texas abortion clinics the magnitude of the texas controversy is only fueling a sense that the coming weeks are not just critical for biden but could define the character of america for years to come a discouraged national mood the worst reality of the pandemic for biden is that his options for suppressing it have already been used he pleaded for months with vaccine skeptics many of them republicans to save themselves now around 150 000 americans are getting infected every day and 1 500 are dying and the political blowback is hurting him a challenging fall looms as kids under 12 not yet eligible for shots resume in person classes the sense of national exhaustion is palpable and could brew wider perceptions that the country is heading in the wrong direction a damaging sentiments for incumbents biden s white house has not been blameless either recent pushback by medical officials over a white house announcement that covid 19 booster shots would be ready by september 20 called biden s vow to always put science before politics into question when he took office after trump s disastrous handling of the virus it was often said that biden s presidency would be judged on whether he restored normality that is still the case in a revealing aside last week biden mused imagine if the other guy was here he was speaking of course of trump and the former president s misleading penchant for cheering stock market records as proof of an equitable economy his comment also reflected the way in which in his first seven months in power biden s presidency has often been judged as a contrast to trump s tempestuous term but the time has come when he will be evaluated not against the malfeasance of his predecessor but on his own promises and decisions
