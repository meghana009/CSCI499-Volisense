u s consumers near term inflation expectations fell to a one year low in september and the outlook over the next five years also improved easing fears that the federal reserve could raise interest rates by a full percentage point next week the university of michigan s survey on friday followed in the wake of data this week showing a surprise increase in consumer prices in august which raised concerns that high inflation was becoming entrenched this more or less silences those calls for a 100 basis point hike next week said jennifer lee a senior economist at bmo capital markets in toronto the university of michigan survey s reading of one year inflation expectations dropped to 4 6 the lowest since september 2021 from 4 8 in august the survey s five year inflation outlook slipped to 2 8 falling below the 2 9 3 1 range for the first time since july 2021 the fed will likely find some reassurance that inflation expectations on this measure do not appear to have become unmoored said conrad dequadros senior economic advisor at brean capital in new york the fed s messaging on inflation expectations has shifted to the importance of keeping expectations anchored compared to relying on that to play down higher inflation rates u s stocks were trading lower while the dollar dipped against a basket of currencies u s treasury prices were mixed following the release on tuesday of strong august consumer price readings financial markets priced in the likelihood that the u s central bank would raise its benchmark overnight interest rate by 75 basis points at its sept 20 21 policy meeting with the potential for a 100 basis point hike according to cme s fedwatch tool the fed hiked its policy rate by three quarters of a percentage point at both its june and july meetings since march it has lifted that rate from near zero to the current 2 25 2 50 target range consumer sentiment improved moderately in september lifted by lower gasoline prices the university of michigan survey showed its preliminary reading on the overall index on consumer sentiment came in at 59 5 this month slightly up from 58 6 in august economists polled by reuters had forecast a preliminary reading of 60 0 in september with gasoline prices continuing to decline sentiment should rise further said scott hoyt senior economist at moody s analytics in west chester pennsylvania however recession concerns rising interest rates and the impending softening in the labor market could limit the improvement in confidence source reuters reporting by lucia mutikani editing by paul simao
fetuses exposed to pesticides often used on citrus and apple trees are up to 87 percent more likely to develop a rare type of eye cancer a study suggests scientists at the university of california los angeles compared the use levels of nearly five dozen farmyard chemicals near the homes of 335 children under five years old who developed retinoblastomas to healthy children from the same state they found four chemicals where exposed children were more likely to have the cancer which can permanently alter children s vision leading to problems reading and writing or lead to blindness one of them acephate is already banned in europe the others were bromacil which should not be used near homes pymetrozine and kresoxim methyl scientists behind the study warned pesticides are particularly dangerous for children because their organs are still forming raising the risk they are able to disrupt dna or inflame cells causing the cancer they called on farmers to be more aware of what chemicals they were spraying on their fields and urged the environmental protection administration epa to beef up its regulations on pesticide use the study found that exposure to four chemicals used as pesticides can raise their risk of retinoblastomas or a rare type of eye cancer stock image retinoblastomas a type of eye cancer can affect either one or both eyes and start when cells begin to grow out of control due to a genetic mutation says the american cancer association acs most likely in children under three years old symptoms include a white or pink pupil lazy eye or early signs of vision problems sufferers are offered radiation therapy or laser therapy to kill cancer cells as well as chemotherapy in certain cases but this can leave youngsters with life long vision problems blindness and raise their risk of suffering a second cancer later in life what is retinoblastoma retinoblastoma is a rare type of eye cancer that can affect young children usually under the age of 5 its symptoms include an unusual white reflection in the pupil a squint a red or inflamed eye and poor vision retinoblastoma happens when retina eye cells which are supposed to grow very quickly and then stop growing during a baby s early development continue to grow and form a cancer depending on the size of the tumour if it is small laser and freezing treatments that aim to destroy the tumour will be carried out if it is larger youngsters may undergo surgery chemotherapy and radiotherapy some children may suffer sight loss or need to have their eye removed between 40 and 50 cases of retinoblastoma are diagnosed in the uk every year the figure equates to one in 15 000 to 20 000 newborns around four in 10 cases are diagnosed in the first year of life and incidence rates drop to a very low rate after five years of age around two thirds of retinoblastomas are diagnosed in one eye only more than nine in 10 cases are detected early and cured before the cancer spreads outside the eyeball source nhs children with cancer uk advertisement in their study published last month in the international journal of hygiene and environmental health scientists trawled through california s cancer registry they extracted all cases of retinoblastomas in under 5s diagnosed from 1998 about a decade after the registry began until 2013 they then collected the addresses of these cases and those of 120 000 healthy children born in the state over the same period the latter were collected randomly next the scientists collected pesticide use reports on which pesticides were used around the children s homes in the months before they were born california has required since 1990 that all pesticide uses in agriculture are reported centrally results showed that children with the cancers were more likely to have been exposed to four specific pesticides compared to healthy youngsters those exposed to bromacil typically used on citrus plants as well as to clear weeds were 87 percent more likely to develop unilateral retinoblastoma or the cancer only in the eye acephate also used on citrus trees raised the risk of this type by 70 percent but kresoxim methyl exposed children used on apples to control a fungus were 60 percent more likely to have all types of retinoblastomas while those who had contact with pymetrozine which kills aphids and whitefly on field crops were 45 percent more likely the scientists did not look at what concentrations of the pesticides had a higher association with cancer no link was suggested for the other 54 pesticide chemicals included in the study lead author dr shiraya thompson an epidemiologist urged farmers to be more conscious about the potential health risks of pesticides they use she also urged the epa to consider limiting the use of harmful chemicals to reduce the risk of cancer you might have very little control over what s going on in the cornfields near you she said and you might not even be aware of what farmers near you are putting down this study was observational meaning it could not determine whether the chemicals had caused the cancer of it was down to another factor but scientists have been warning for years that pesticide exposure raises the risk of cancers in people scientists are not yet clear on what causes retinoblastomas but the acs says exposure to chemicals and radiation may raise the risk having mothers that eat too little fruit and vegetable could make the cancer more likely pregnant mothers could have been exposed to the chemicals either from run off from the farmyards or through work statistics show that around six to ten percent of rural dwellers in the state work in the agricultural sector

we along with other libraries across the country noticed last year that there were just lot of more reports of books being banned or challenged across the united states in school libraries and public libraries and the american library association even came out with report that there were 1600 over 1600 banned books reported to their office last year which was by far the most they ve ever had since the beginning of them keeping track of banned books and we wanted to do something more intentional to support young people across the country who were at the business end of these challenges and bands so we thought that one way to do this would be to offer free access to our over half million e books and audiobooks particularly for young people ages 13 21 who are literally seeing their experiences their narratives and their voices silenced in their communities the books that are being targeted for challenges or bands are representative of voices that are l g b t q voices or black indigenous voices so you have books like gender queer which is the most challenged and banned book of all of last year according to the american library association yeah it s really important to see myself reflected in narratives um such as um just books that talk about transgenderism and um l g b t q rights and queer people in general um just because again like we ve been silenced for centuries um i m transgender man uh i use pronouns um and you don t not often that you see that in especially works of fiction i grew up in very conservative place small town in georgia um and georgia the state and um i grew up around people who didn t see me as person uh didn t see me like for my race for my identity for my sexuality i was ostracized for long time until i came here um and i know what it s like to not have those resources available to you it s hard enough to find representation in the media for like minority groups like your underrepresented in lot of places underrepresented in like um schools sometimes um uh in the television um in like education like maybe your major there s not lot of people that look like you um that share your identity and background and like that can affect you deeply so like these books being taken off or like you can t even like see representation um at your local library i feel like that s um really bad advertisement book ban efforts surging in 2022 library association says share copy link copy the wave of attempted book banning and restrictions continues to intensify the american library association reported friday numbers for 2022 already approach last year s totals which were the highest in decades i ve never seen anything like this says deborah caldwell stone director of the ala s office for intellectual freedom it s both the number of challenges and the kinds of challenges it used to be a parent had learned about a given book and had an issue with it now we see campaigns where organizations are compiling lists of books without necessarily reading or even looking at them the ala has documented 681 challenges to books through the first eight months of this year involving 1 651 different titles in all of 2021 the ala listed 729 challenges directed at 1 579 books because the ala relies on media accounts and reports from libraries the actual number of challenges is likely far higher the library association believes friday s announcement is timed to banned books week which begins sunday and will be promoted around the country through table displays posters bookmarks and stickers and through readings essay contests and other events highlighting contested works according to a report issued in april the most targeted books have included maia kobabe s graphic memoir about sexual identity gender queer and jonathan evison s lawn boy a coming of age novel narrated by a young gay man we re seeing that trend continue in 2022 the criticism of books with lgbtq subject matter caldwell jones says adding that books about racism such as angie thomas novel the hate u give also are frequently challenged banned books weeks is overseen by a coalition of writing and free speech organizations including the national coalition against censorship the authors guild and pen america conservative attacks against schools and libraries have proliferated nationwide over the past two years and librarians themselves have been harassed and even driven out of their jobs a middle school librarian in denham springs louisiana has filed a legal complaint against a facebook page which labeled her a criminal and a pedophile voters in a western michigan community jamestown township backed drastic cuts in the local library over objections to gender queer and other lgbtq books audrey wilson youngblood who in june quit her job as a library

in bonners ferry idaho library director kimber glidden resigned recently after months of harassment that included the shouting of biblical passages referring to divine punishment the campaign began with a single complaint about gender queer which the library didn t even stock and escalated to the point where glidden feared for her safety we were being accused of being pedophiles and grooming children she says people were showing up armed at library board meetings the executive director of the virginia library association lisa r varga says librarians in the state have received threatening emails and have been videotaped on the job tactics she says that are not like anything that those who went into this career were expecting to see becky calzada library coordinator for the leander independent school district in texas says she has friends who have left the profession and colleagues who are afraid and feel threatened i know some worry about promoting banned books week because

the disastrous rail strike appears to have been averted yesterday which is good news but it may be short lived the chances that the federal reserve is going to be able to bring down inflation without sending the country into a recession seem to be declining the economist says the dream of a soft landing has been dashed and the worst is yet to come advertisement over the summer a wild hope took hold among investors inflation seemed to be falling gently even as america s economy stayed in rude health perhaps the worst bout of inflation since the 1980s would be easily quelled without interest rates rising much further or much economic pain now the dream has been dashed figures published on september 13th show that the pace of underlying inflation in august was fast and furious stockmarkets fell by the most since the early months of the pandemic the price of junk bonds dropped and short term treasury yields spiked america still has an inflation problem to fix it the federal reserve must go big the fed s job is to set interest rates so that inflation reaches its target with the economy still overheating its work is far from done although the central bank has raised interest rates faster than in past tightening cycles it has been so far behind the curve that every reminder of inflation s stickiness is jolting markets the opposite of what good monetary policy is supposed to achieve rather than continuing the cycle of tardiness and surprises the fed should act in bigger increments by bringing forward to this year the interest rate rises it had planned for 2023 the odds that a painful recession can be averted meanwhile look woefully long only in the rosiest of worlds will a mild rise in unemployment suffice to slow down price rises substantially the worst of the fight to tame inflation is yet to come advertisement yesterday the ny times published a story which came to basically the same conclusion here s the times describing the conditions for a wage price spiral as data this week showed prices continue to soar and while the job market has moderated somewhat employers are still hiring at a solid clip and raising wages at the fastest pace in decades that continued progress seems to be allowing consumers to keep spending and it may give employers both the power and the motivation to increase their prices to cover their climbing labor costs as inflationary forces chug along economists said the risk is rising that the fed will clamp down on the economy so hard that america will be in for a rough landing potentially one in which growth slumps and unemployment shoots higher it is becoming more likely that it won t be possible to wring inflation out of this economy without a proper recession and higher unemployment said krishna guha who heads the global policy and central bank strategy team at evercore isi and who has been forecasting that the fed can cool inflation without causing an outright recession in their economic estimates in june officials anticipated that interest rates would climb to a peak of 3 8 percent next year and that unemployment would rise only slightly from its current level of 3 7 percent economists increasingly project that both forecasts interest rates and unemployment could jump higher the most plausible scenario is that inflation won t come down unless unemployment goes up mr furman said it is possible that the labor market could cool down without additional unemployment it s just never happened that way before advertisement if you ve been watching the stock market this week then you ve already seen a preview of what it looks like when the fed gets aggressive goldman sachs took a look at where that might be headed in a new note to clients goldman sachs chief markets economist dominic wilson and global markets strategist vickie chang crunched the numbers on what it would mean if fed has to take a more aggressive path than the market is forecasting the results are not great if the fed has to hit the economy hard enough to get the unemployment rate up to 5 the s p 500 spx would have to fall 14 to below 3 400 in the more severe scenario where the jobless rate would have to hit 6 the s p 500 would fall 27 to below 2 900 our next chance to get an idea of how bad this might get comes next week when the fed releases another rate decision

the ontario line subway took an important step forward this week with a pair of contracts awarded for the line s construction this includes civil bits like tunnels and stations as well as a second contract covering the rolling stock that will carry passengers along the new route the latter contract offers some early hints into the type of trains that will serve the line upon its projected completion in 2030 infrastructure ontario announced on wednesday that the award for rolling stock systems operations and maintenance rssom was awarded to a consortium of companies collectively known as connect 6ix in somewhat of a surprise to experts the consortium includes hitachi rail the italian based rolling stock division of the major japanese conglomerate instead of the more familiar names with canadian connections like alstom so what does this mean well for starters it narrows down the possible list of rail vehicles to ones produced by this manufacturer metrolinx has previously stated that the ontario line will run automated driverless trains running shorter than standard trains on platforms only 100 metres long hitachi rail has produced driverless metro trains for lines in honolulu copenhagen lima milan riyadh taipei rome and thessaloniki many of these systems feature smaller trainsets than the specifications mentioned above though systems like thessaloniki and honolulu run longer trains more in line with what will run on the ontario line of course hitachi rail could be designing an entirely new variation of their driverless train system specifically to toronto standards but the embedded images of the thessaloniki and honolulu metros provide a glimpse into what toronto s new subway system might feature a few years down the line the selection of hitachi rail is a clear departure from the trend of purchasing subway trains from manufacturers with well established canadian operations toronto s existing line 1 2 and 4 subways all run bombardier t1 and toronto rocket trains manufactured in canada and previously cars manufactured by u k based gloucester railway carriage and wagon company as well as domestic companies hawker siddeley canada and montreal locomotive works

due to a recent agreement between the public company accounting oversight board and chinese securities regulators many us exchange listed companies audited by accounting firms based in mainland china and hong kong may be able to continue trading on us exchanges preserving liquidity for investors and ongoing access to us capital markets however this agreement could lead to an increased enforcement risk through more regulatory inquiries in recent years securities regulators us congress and the public have expressed concern about ensuring that certain public companies those that trade on us exchanges while being domiciled outside the united states abide by the rigorous regulatory requirements intended to protect american investors recent attention has been directed at public companies and accounting firms based in the people s republic of china prc and hong kong where the public company accounting oversight board pcaob has historically been limited in its ability to ensure that audits of companies listed on us exchanges are being conducted in accordance with pcaob standards and other applicable regulatory requirements this is not a small subset of companies as of september 14 2022 there were 249 chinese companies whose securities trade on us exchanges with a total market cap of approximately 915 billion partially as a result and against the backdrop of an increasingly fraught us prc relationship congress enacted the holding foreign companies accountable act of 2020 hfcaa to restrict access to the us capital markets by foreign public companies whose financial statements are audited by accounting firms that the pcaob is unable to fully inspect due to interference by a foreign government a growing number of prc and hong kong based public companies appear wary of continued listing on us exchanges or have transitioned their primary listings to the hong kong stock exchange other such companies with a primary listing on a us exchange have chosen to try to avoid potential delisting pursuant to the hfcaa by switching to us based auditors on august 26 2022 the pcaob announced a statement of protocol agreement sop with the china securities regulatory commission and china s ministry of finance regarding cooperation in the oversight of pcaob registered public accounting firms in the prc and hong kong which could prove to be a monumental step forward in the cooperation between the pcaob and prc regulators us securities and exchange commission sec chair gary gensler said this agreement marks the first time we have received such detailed and specific commitments from china that they would allow pcaob inspections and investigations meeting u s standards if the sop is fully implemented and adhered to by prc authorities then many public companies audited by prc and hong kong based accounting firms may be able to avoid the trading prohibition on us exchanges that the hfcaa would otherwise impose and preserve liquidity for their investors and ongoing access to america s deep capital markets pcaob is newly empowered to ensure audit quality in prc and hong kong congress established the pcaob through the sarbanes oxley act of 2002 sox to provide oversight of the audits of public companies listed on us exchanges its authority includes the registration inspection and investigation of audit firms including firms located in foreign jurisdictions that are engaged to conduct audits of foreign companies listed on us exchanges with respect to accounting firms headquartered in foreign jurisdictions the pcaob typically enters into cooperative arrangements with foreign regulators and it works with foreign regulators to address any concerns regarding data protection state secrecy or other sensitive substantive concerns for jurisdictions other than the prc and hong kong the pcaob has been able to address foreign regulators concerns in a way that is compatible with its core mission in the prc and hong kong however the road to the sop has been a long one in 2013 the pcaob entered into a memorandum of understanding mou with prc authorities that was intended to establish a framework for future cooperation despite the mou the pcaob has repeatedly stated that it has received insufficient cooperation to conduct full inspections and investigations of audit firms in the prc and hong kong the new sop seeks to establish a method for the pcaob to conduct inspections of pcaob registered public accounting firms in the prc and hong kong as contemplated by sox specifically the sop includes assurances from prc authorities on issues that have historically hindered the pcaob s ability to conduct its inspections and investigations the pcaob has sole discretion to select the firms audit engagements and potential violations it inspects and investigates with neither consultation with nor input from prc authorities pcaob inspectors and investigators can view complete audit working papers without redaction and the pcaob can retain information as needed the pcaob has direct access to interview and take testimony from all personnel associated with the audits that the pcaob inspects or investigates the pcaob can transfer information to the sec and the sec can use the information for all sec purposes including administrative or civil enforcement actions pcaob inspectors will begin their on site inspections in mid september 2022 which would include access to all necessary audit working papers by the end of 2022 the pcaob must determine whether it can complete inspections and investigations of public accounting firms headquartered in the prc and hong kong as required by sox and thus reassess whether such public accounting firms continue to present the concerns that the hfcaa was intended to address increased number of regulatory investigations and possible enforcement actions likely the sop is a significant sign of potential cross border cooperation as part of the pcaob s work to ensure that investors in public companies can rely on quality audits it will investigate the competency and conduct of accounting firms and professionals in the prc and hong kong the pcaob has settled disciplinary orders with accountants and accounting firms around the world based on information learned during inspections pcaob inspectors and investigators may also determine that there is reason for the sec and or the us department of justice doj to investigate not only the accounting firms over which the pcaob has jurisdiction but also the public companies whose audits the pcaob will now be able to thoroughly inspect if the pcaob inspections uncover material compliance issues enforcement actions by the sec and doj could result from pcaob referrals auditor working papers and an auditor s record of the accounting judgments made by the public company that could be memorialized in those working papers may also reveal possible accounting irregularities in a public company s financial statements and result in additional regulatory scrutiny or action over the last 15 years multiple prc companies have been subjected to enforcement actions and investigations by regulators relating to accounting issues these past issues may fuel ongoing skepticism from us regulators toward prc and hong kong based public companies thus an increasing number of investigations is likely especially given the emphasis on enforcement at both the doj and the sec indeed enforcement is an essential part of the mission statement of both organizations and the number of prc and hong kong based public companies whose accounting firms audits will now be subject to scrutiny such investigations can lead not only to enforcement actions but often are followed by securities class action and shareholder derivative lawsuits if a public company s auditor is subject to pcaob sanctions or the company is made aware of significant concerns about its auditor s quality control standards then the public company may want to consider conducting thorough internal investigations to address possible compliance shortfalls while regulators assess remediation in their enforcement decisions even if these investigations do not lead to enforcement actions prc and hong kong based us public companies and their executives should be prepared for the time expense and scrutiny of a potential us regulatory inquiry key takeaways and suggestions the sop is a breakthrough in cooperation between the two nations and should allow prc and hong kong based us public companies to avoid delisting pursuant to the hfcaa despite the extremely positive nature of this aspect of the sop for these companies the level of pcaob access that the sop entails warrants preparation by prc and hong kong based auditors and public companies for increased scrutiny and possible enforcement risk auditor considerations from the auditors perspective if actions by prc authorities match their commitment under the sop pcaob chair erica y williams has noted that the agreement at present is merely on paper the pcaob s improved access may require additional preparation and planning if an issuer chooses to engage a us based accounting firm that newly engaged firm will be expected to obtain prior year working papers and should still make inquiries of the predecessor accounting firm about certain matters including among other things integrity management disagreements audit committee communications unusual or significant transactions and the reason for the change in auditors on the other hand issuers who maintain non us based accounting firms should recognize that the firm s audit staff likely has not previously been subject to full pcaob inspections and investigations thus preparation for an inspection is advisable and could include coordination with us affiliates or secondments by us audit partners familiar with the pcaob s process to select and perform its inspections such as the level of engagement necessary from audit partners with inspectors and the types of informational requests made to audit personnel among other things these firms must ensure that their personnel cooperate with the pcaob inspectors and make all requested working papers available to them because the pcaob requires and takes into consideration cooperation during its inspections and investigations in addition the pcaob has signaled that it may seek to conduct inspections of prior years audits given the restrictions that it faced prior to the new sop as such prc and hong kong based accounting firms should be prepared for inspections of prior year audits and requests for accompanying working papers by the pcaob public company considerations from a public company s perspective pcaob inspections under the sop may result in regulatory and or disciplinary actions being brought against an accounting firm that the public company engaged and could result in heightened scrutiny of its financial statements and other public disclosures proactive engagement of international legal counsel is important to assist public companies when addressing concerns raised about its auditor and the quality of the audit performed as a result of pcaob inspections including seeking guidance in the event that the inspection results in a referral to the sec or doj and counseling on whether to self report issues to regulators counsel should be well versed in us securities laws and enforcement practices and trends but also have a significant presence in the prc and hong kong that informs a robust understanding of the business and legal considerations facing prc and hong kong based public companies in addition public companies should pay particular attention to three areas that remain a focus of sec and doj enforcement ensuring a robust set of internal controls and regularly confirming compliance with them maintaining a culture of compliance which includes among many other things open honest and fulsome communication and coordination with external auditors maintaining and regularly ensuring the maintenance of books and records that accurately and completely reflect the company s financial information finally prc and hong kong based companies should also be aware that the sec and doj like the pcaob expect and take into consideration cooperation if prc and hong kong based auditors and us exchange listed public companies proactively take steps to address the potential issues discussed they may be able to significantly limit the discomfort associated with a us regulatory inquiry

the decision by the 5th u s circuit court of appeals is likely to set up a supreme court fight that could shape how tech companies regulate content austin texas a federal appeals court friday ruled in favor of a texas law targeting major social media companies like facebook and twitter in a victory for republicans who accuse the platforms of censoring conservative speech but the decision by the 5th u s circuit court of appeals in new orleans is unlikely the last word on a legal battle that has stakes beyond texas and could impact how some of the world s biggest tech companies regulate content by their users the texas law signed by republican gov greg abbott last year has been challenged by tech trade groups that warn that it would prevent platforms from removing extremism and hate speech a similar law was also passed in florida and ruled unconstitutional by a separate appeal court the final say is likely to come from the u s supreme court which earlier this year blocked the texas law while the lawsuit played out today we reject the idea that corporations have a freewheeling first amendment right to censor what people say u s circuit court judge andrew oldham wrote netchoice one of the groups challenging the law expressed disappointment in a statement that pointed out the ruling was the opposite of the decision made in the lawsuit over the florida law we remain convinced that when the u s supreme court hears one of our cases it will uphold the first amendment rights of websites platforms and apps said carl szabo netchoice s vice president and general counsel republican elected officials in several states have backed laws like those enacted in florida and texas that sought to portray social media companies as generally liberal in outlook and hostile to ideas outside of that viewpoint especially from the political right justice samuel alito wrote in may that is not clear how the high court s past first amendment cases many of which predate the internet age apply to facebook twitter tiktok and other digital platforms the florida law as enacted would give florida s attorney general authority to sue companies under the state s deceptive and unfair trade practices act it would also allow individual floridians to sue social media companies for up to 100 000 if they feel they have been treated unfairly

toronto north american markets ended the trading week in the red with canada s main stock index down more than 170 points and u s stock markets falling amid inflation worries and a stark warning from fedex about worsening trends in the economy the s p tsx composite index was down 174 28 points at 19 385 88 dragged down by weakness in industrials technology energy and financials in new york the dow jones industrial average was down 139 40 points at 30 822 42 the s p 500 index was down 28 02 points at 3 873 33 while the nasdaq composite was down 103 95 points at 11 448 40 all the major u s indexes have now posted losses four out of the past five weeks fedex saw its biggest single day sell off on record friday falling 21 4 per cent after warning investors that profits for its fiscal first quarter will likely fall short of forecasts because of a dropoff in business the package delivery service is also shuttering storefronts and corporate offices and expects business conditions to further weaken i think that fedex s profit warning is kind of telling everybody the recession is here and certainly if not in north america it certainly is in other parts of the world said colin cieszynski chief market strategist at sia wealth management investors are going into the weekend concerned about the u s economy and are bracing for the u s federal reserve s interest rate decision next week which is widely expected to be a 75 basis point increase although the possibility of a 100 basis point hike is growing i m about 50 50 on that one it really is a coin toss he said cieszynski also expects interest rates to stay higher for longer i think right now people still have this idea that rates will go up quickly and come down quickly and i just don t think that s going to be the case he said cieszynski really had his eye on the energy sector and the price of oil friday noting that the two have decoupled a little bit energy is actually down a little bit on a day when the oil price is actually up a little bit and then we ve seen the opposite of that this week as well we ve seen energy stocks up on on days when oil is down so it s a funny thing he said when you see them decouple as we have over the last few days that suggests to me that there s a lot of confusion out there right now i don t think people are quite sure which way things are heading the canadian dollar traded for 75 27 cents us compared with 75 76 cents us on thursday earlier in the day the loonie fell to its lowest level in almost two years exchanging hands at 75 15 cents us as long as the u s dollar remains strong the canadian dollar is likely to continue to struggle against it if something happens like the oil price taking off then that might help us a bit he said but it s important to remember that while canada is struggling against the u s dollar it s actually doing really well against pretty much everything else the november crude contract was up 11 cents at us 84 76 per barrel and the october natural gas contract was down 56 cents at us 7 76 per mmbtu the december gold contract was up us 6 20 at us 1 683 50 an ounce and the december copper contract was up two cents at us 3 52 a pound this report by the canadian press was first published sept 16 2022 with files from the associated press companies in this story tsx gsptse tsx_cadusd x

the decision by the 5th u s circuit court of appeals is likely to set up a supreme court fight that could shape how tech companies regulate content austin texas a federal appeals court friday ruled in favor of a texas law targeting major social media companies like facebook and twitter in a victory for republicans who accuse the platforms of censoring conservative speech but the decision by the 5th u s circuit court of appeals in new orleans is unlikely the last word on a legal battle that has stakes beyond texas and could impact how some of the world s biggest tech companies regulate content by their users the texas law signed by republican gov greg abbott last year has been challenged by tech trade groups that warn that it would prevent platforms from removing extremism and hate speech a similar law was also passed in florida and ruled unconstitutional by a separate appeal court the final say is likely to come from the u s supreme court which earlier this year blocked the texas law while the lawsuit played out today we reject the idea that corporations have a freewheeling first amendment right to censor what people say u s circuit court judge andrew oldham wrote netchoice one of the groups challenging the law expressed disappointment in a statement that pointed out the ruling was the opposite of the decision made in the lawsuit over the florida law we remain convinced that when the u s supreme court hears one of our cases it will uphold the first amendment rights of websites platforms and apps said carl szabo netchoice s vice president and general counsel republican elected officials in several states have backed laws like those enacted in florida and texas that sought to portray social media companies as generally liberal in outlook and hostile to ideas outside of that viewpoint especially from the political right justice samuel alito wrote in may that is not clear how the high court s past first amendment cases many of which predate the internet age apply to facebook twitter tiktok and other digital platforms the florida law as enacted would give florida s attorney general authority to sue companies under the state s deceptive and unfair trade practices act it would also allow individual floridians to sue social media companies for up to 100 000 if they feel they have been treated unfairly

the_guitar_mann in a recent report i discussed the delivery flow and pace of the boeing company nyse ba 787 even at a somewhat moderate delivery rate it significantly increases revenues and will unlock fresh cash flows all of those things will gradually become visible on boeing s balance sheet one area where boeing has been lacking pace though is the inventory unwind of the boeing 737 max and the company is now making a big move to change that the boeing 737 max production rate hike fell through boeing 737 assembly line in renton the boeing company for the boeing 737 max investors and analysts have been watching two items in general the first one is the ramp up in production and the second one is the inventory unwind starting with the production rate ramp up boeing already had to tone down expectations widely it was anticipated that the u s jet maker would announce a step up in 737 max production to 38 or even 42 aircraft per month up from the current 31 aircraft per month the move would add 6 billion to 7 billion in annualized revenue however as deliveries in china had not commenced boeing was forced to postpone its production hike and de risked china from the production plan you can call it the china effect china is currently holding the boeing 737 max hostage against a backdrop of geopolitical tension with the u s first over trade and these days over taiwan boeing initially anticipated deliveries to recommence in the first quarter this year we are now 6 9 months later and very little has been achieved apart from a few test flights and there is no clear reason for max deliveries not having recommenced other than tension and concerns on future demand from china boeing to reassign chinese max orders to other customers cfm leap 1b turbofans ge aviation boeing s big move on china is that it will be assigning aircraft once destined for china to new customers if you think about it that decision while not without risk does make a lot of sense demand for new aircraft is there fuel prices are high and the newest batch of aircraft burn 15 less fuel than the previous generation aircraft so renewing the fleet is almost a no brainer at this point that is also where boeing runs into some issues cfm a joint venture between general electric ge and safran sa otcpk safrf is weeks behind on engine deliveries supporting the current rate so boeing cannot just increase the rate to meet demand during the second quarter earnings call in july ceo of the boeing company david calhoun said the following when asked about a rate decision if i thought i had an engine supply i d do it today so it is really about engines at this point airlines buy aircraft with a propulsion system not gliders the solution for that problem lies in the unfortunate fact that during the grounding of the boeing 737 max boeing built around 450 boeing 737 max aircraft leeham recently reported that boeing would be swapping engines from inventory to newly built jets it goes to show how big the challenges are to get the cfm leap 1b turbofans in renton in time to be installed under the wings of the max the aircraft that likely would have the engines removed would be the aircraft destined for china boeing 737 max 8 the boeing company boeing has been waiting for months to recommence deliveries to the chinese aviation market without much progress or a definite timeline on recommencing deliveries so removing the engines from jets destined for china to apply them to newly built aircraft makes sense boeing is now making a pretty bold next step by going ahead and remarketing jets that were built for china out of the 450 jets slightly less than a third was destined for chinese customers including lessors the inventory currently is 290 aircraft and around 120 are likely destined for chinese airlines that also explains why the delivery flow from inventory did not ramp us as fast as hoped out of the pool of jets there were always 120 aircraft that boeing could not deliver since the max was not cleared in china interestingly the 120 jets that are destined for china also match the annualized increase in max production had boeing been able to continue increasing production so there is 6 billion to 7 billion locked because the production was not ramped up and another 6 billion to 7 billion in the inventories boeing has waited months to be able to deliver those jets to china and they have been patient in the process but that patience wears out at some point we are not at that point boeing has tried not to harm the relation with its chinese customers but it is definitely fed up with china for slow balling the max return in that country and to some extent there most likely also exists frustration with the current and previous white house administration during the morgan stanley 10th annual laguna conference cfo of boeing brian west said the following so right now we are constantly communicating with our customers and the regulators and we stand ready when they re ready to pick up where they left off to finish that work we are ready i can t dictate the timing from we they take on but i won t tell you more broadly we have deferred decisions on those planes for a long time we can t defer that decision forever so we will begin to remarket some of those airplanes they were otherwise earmarked for our chinese customers and we don t do that lightly it is pretty clear that boeing s patience with china has waned significantly they recognize what the tension between the u s and china does to their business and market position and they have been losing out on sales for months waiting for chinese customers to come pick up the planes in those months boeing has not been able to sell those jets they are now moving away from that by remarketing a small number of jets to other customers without doubt it is a risky move as it might infuriate china but boeing has shown patience it didn t help them achieve their goal and they are now sending an extremely strong message to china if you don t take those jets we will find another customer who will initially the remarketing happens on a small number of aircraft to send the message and if china remains immobile on max deliveries more will follow conclusion boeing is making the right move for company and ba stock boeing has shown patience for a long time recognizing the importance of china to its business however that patience has brought them nothing as the company is simply the victim of the current geopolitical landscape and lack of desire for a constructive solution the u s jet maker previously decided to transfer engines from max aircraft inventory to newly built aircraft and it is now going a big step further by remarketing aircraft that were built for china not all airlines are fond of taking delivery of aircraft built to the specs of other airlines so that is why for some customers swapping engines to aircraft built to their standard rather than taking an already built plane makes sense by now also remarketing a number of aircraft for chinese customers boeing sends a message to the chinese government while benefiting from demand for these aircraft for sure it is a risky move by boeing but they cannot wait indefinitely for china while missing out on sales while the move will infuriate china purchase agreements allow boeing to swap engines and other equipment to smooth their delivery flow and even remarket aircraft so this was a move that you could expect at some point

in the 21st century it should be easy to manage your 401 k online but according to a new study most customers are finding it almost impossible to do so the research group j d power surveyed customers about their satisfaction or lack thereof with the websites and mobile apps of their retirement plans and ranked the firms based on that data the full list can be found at the end of this article the results were concerning only 22 of investors said the sites and apps gave proactive guidance and just 37 of users said they could complete digital tasks without calling up customer service a lot of these providers have built tools educational content and calculators and so on but there s a whole lot of folks who either aren t aware of those or just have never used them said mike foy head of wealth intelligence at j d power employer sponsored retirement plans are the most common savings vehicle in america with around 60 million active participants and scores more retired but they re surprisingly difficult for investors to keep track of the j d power study ranked 22 different plan providers in terms of their customers digital experience awarding a score for each firm on a 1 000 point scale but no one got close to 1 000 the top score was 704 held by both bank of america and charles schwab prudential financial was next with a score of 696 followed by fidelity investments with 690 at the low end alight solutions came in last with a score of 593 followed by voya financial with 619 and paychex with 632 the average score was a lackluster 663 retirement investors are under a great deal of financial stress right now and they are looking to their plan s websites and apps for information and guidance foy said unfortunately many are not finding what they need and end up having to call customer service for help upside potential foy pointed out that part of the dissatisfaction stemmed from a broader feeling of financial stress due to the recent volatility of the stock market inflation and other economic concerns but not every problem could be chalked up to the economy which in a way is good news for the firms because it means there are some factors they can control this is a moment of truth opportunity for plan providers foy said when they get the digital experience right they see a very significant lift in the likelihood to grow and retain participant assets long after they have left their current employer for example mobile apps were by far the most popular of the digital interfaces the trouble is few people use them only 22 of investors said they had used their provider s app in the last 12 months getting more customers to download these apps could make a huge difference for plan providers the mobile app is the least used and has the highest satisfaction foy said another area of opportunity is in making the apps and websites more user friendly customers satisfaction rose 178 points when they felt the digital channels gave proactive guidance and jumped 191 points when users could complete tasks on their own in some cases improving these factors could just require a few design tweaks customers found apps easier to use when they put the most sought after information for example their account balances in highly prominent visible places and to do better on proactive guidance apps can prompt users with alerts when they need to take action for example if they need to increase their contribution level or tweak their asset allocation off new technologies can help as well bank of america earned its top score partly thanks to erica its virtual financial assistant like siri or alexa erica is a voice activated program that literally listens to customers and tells them what they need to know instead of having to click through five or six links through a single voice command you can immediately uncover the information that you re looking for foy said rising expectations some of these high tech features may seem out of character for the retirement industry which fairly or unfairly has a reputation for being old fashioned but these days customers increasingly expect them the retirement industry and the financial services industry in general is not really known as a digital innovator foy said meanwhile the experiences that consumers are having with other brands whether it s amazon or netflix or google they re having better and better experiences and that really raises the bar and a smooth digital experience isn t just good for customers it also improves the reputations of both plan providers and the employers that work with them foy said not only that but when customers can digitally manage their plans on their own firms can rely less on customer service call centers which can be very expensive it s a win win foy said it s an important driver of a better experience for the participant and it s also a win for the provider j d power s 2022 u s retirement plan digital experience ranking 22

the world s 11th largest bank paid the clintons almost a million dollars while under investigation and now everything is falling apart the deutsche bank s stocks hit an all time low on friday before there were rumors that the bank had come to an agreement on a bailout then the stock shot up late friday now we are learning that things may be worse and how it could all be tied to the clintons over the weekend we learned that negotiations had not come to an agreement and did not even restart this news is surely going to bring the stock back down on monday we are also learning that the company is having a very coincidental it problem that isn t allowing people to get money from any atms deutsche bank is in a lot of trouble right now and experts think it is because of the their derivatives exposure a major exposure to spark a lehman brothers like collapse and we could see a crash like 2008 how is hillary tied into all of this mess much like her husband s housing policies during his time as president it looks like hillary might be involved in the fall of the deutsche bank hillary received 225 000 and 260 000 for two speeches she gave to the deutsche bank bill clinton was paid 200 000 and 270 000 for two speeches as well all the speeches were given during october 2012 and october 2014 they were paid just under a million for four speeches and this is while the bank was under federal investigation for reporting inaccuracies and self regulation a former president and a future candidate for president were paid almost a million to speak to a foreign company that was under federal investigation why would they do such a dumb thing like that when somebody released the panama papers a document dump showing the details of money laundering and tax evasion in panama they also released how hillary is connected to the bank a free trade agreement was put into place in october of 2012 called the panama united states trade promotion agreement hillary lobbied for this agreement despite being warned that it would make money laundering easier coincidentally that is the first year and month that the clinton s started getting huge speaking fees the panama papers prove that deutsche bank was skirting the laws and using loopholes to dodge taxes and potentially launder money hillary made that a lot easier for them in 2012 and they gave her and her husband a lot of money but that gravy train is about to run out deutsche bank is in real trouble and now that america knows about her connections to the failing bank it is clear that she potentially helped cause this mess by making it easier for the banks to continue operating in such dangerous ways deutsche bank s exposure could trigger the next major economic collapse and if that is the case then hillary is not beyond blame the irony is that hillary attacked donald for not paying any taxes but she has helped the wealthiest in the world do a lot worse when she supported the panama united states trade promotion agreement now we know why do you think this will be her october surprise let us know in the comments below

corrects to largely 2 1 ruling in second paragraph by daniel trotta reuters a u s appeals court on friday upheld a texas law that bars large social media companies from banning or censoring users based on viewpoint a setback for technology industry groups that say the measure would turn platforms into bastions of dangerous content the largely 2 1 ruling by the 5th u s circuit court of appeals based in new orleans sets up the potential for the u s supreme court to rule on the law which conservatives and right wing commentators have said is necessary to prevent big tech from suppressing their views today we reject the idea that corporations have a freewheeling first amendment right to censor what people say judge andrew oldham an appointee of former president donald trump wrote in the ruling the texas law was passed by the state s republican led legislature and signed by its republican governor the tech groups that challenged the law and were on the losing end of friday s ruling include netchoice and the computer communications industry association which count meta platforms facebook nasdaq twitter nyse and alphabet nasdaq inc s youtube as members they have sought to preserve rights to regulate user content when they believe it may lead to violence citing concerns that unregulated platforms will enable extremists such as nazi supporters terrorists and hostile foreign governments the association on friday said it disagreed with forcing private companies to give equal treatment to all viewpoints god bless america and death to america are both viewpoints and it is unwise and unconstitutional for the state of texas to compel a private business to treat those the same it said in a statement some conservatives have labeled the social media companies practices abusive pointing to twitter s permanent suspension of trump from the platform shortly after the jan 6 2021 attack on the u s capitol by a mob of his supporters twitter had cited the risk of further incitement of violence as a reason the texas law forbids social media companies with at least 50 million monthly active users from acting to censor users based on viewpoint and allows either users or the texas attorney general to sue to enforce the law texas attorney general ken paxton on twitter hailed the ruling as massive victory for the constitution and free speech because the 5th circuit ruling conflicts with part of a ruling by the 11th circuit the aggrieved parties have a stronger case for petitioning the supreme court to hear the matter in may the 11th circuit based in atlanta found that most of a similar florida law violates the companies free speech rights and cannot be enforced this story corrects to largely 2 1 ruling in second paragraph

per fix and that fee would be applied to any of the items the customer chose to buy prior to the class period in 2019 stitch fix announced a new direct buy retail component eventually named freestyle the freestyle program allowed customers to shop the site for specific products giving the customer more control over what items they received but also removing the curation element that differentiated

a metra conductor signals for all clear at the metra arlington heights station thursday sept 15 2022 in arlington heights ill president joe biden said thursday a tentative railway labor agreement has been reached averting a potentially devastating strike before the pivotal midterm elections ap photo nam y huh copyright 2022 the associated press all rights reserved the news about the proposed deal to avert a rail strike was big that s because a rail strike would have been bigger railroads transportation account for about 28 of freight transportation in the u s according to the federal railroad administration rail is a cost effective and efficient way to move almost any freight in the united states which benefits both producers and consumers the agency says each american requires the movement of approximately 54 tons of freight per year goods people use or components of the goods people use are largely shipped by rail if you think that supply chain problems were bad before they would have gotten significantly worse had rail bound freight transportation been shut down workers haven t agreed to the new contract yet if they do accept the announced deal workers whose pay had been frozen would win double digit increases and would be allowed to seek certain types of medical care without fear of being punished union leaders said according to a reuters report the agreement also includes an immediate 14 1 wage rise but they still might not especially with 12 different unions having to sign off leaders of the 12 unions involved in the talks must now sell agreements to members who will vote to ratify or reject them over the next several weeks reuters wrote and if wednesday s rejection of the agreement by one of the smaller unions and complaints online by numerous union members are any guide this won t be an easy sell many of the union members are deeply angry money is one issue but apparently the real holdup in the talks had revolved around attendance sick time and scheduling issues i had never realized how brutal on the body railroad work can be until i met someone a few years back who had retired from the industry because of the injuries he had sustained in difficult physical jobs and i ve done my share of hard blue collar work and injuries in the past there has to be time to get needed treatment time for recovery but even these other factors come down to money and what corporations are willing to spend often you ll hear a company cry poor in some industries businesses do work on short margins but in many they don t like in railways a trade publication the american journal of transportation ran an article claiming that railroads were the most profitable industry in the u s with average margins of 50 half of revenues going into profits the source of the data was an online site that calls itself the small business advice platform its post in question mentioned recent research has now revealed the profit margins for many industries perhaps but for a more practiced hand at this type of analysis instead move over to the site of aswath damodaran a professor who teaches corporate finance and valuation at the stern school of business at new york university he periodically updates his running analysis of corporate margins by industry it offers a fascinating look at who s really in the money his results show that the railroad segment of transportation has an average net margin profitability after all expenses and taxes accruing to stockholders in the firm of 28 9 for perspective the median value for all industries is 7 9 the heights the railroad industry reaches are the fifth highest of any industry only exceeded by money center banks the really big ones non bank financial services regional banks and entertainment software there are different ways to look at company profits another important one that damodaran tracks is pre tax pre stock compensation operating margin in other words before the company pays taxes or ladles out helpings of stock to employees probably mostly executives it shows how much money the company is throwing off before paying executives and governments their due it s after paying for parts and products worker pay offices lawyers and accountants travel and so forth this is a measure of who s really pulling in the money far and beyond expenses from that view tobacco is at the top at 44 7 and second highest railroads with their 42 4 take bnsf railway company owned by berkshire hathaway brk b and its ceo warren buffett last year its revenue was 22 5 billion according to data from s p global market intelligence profits before taxes were 9 3 billion or 41 or csx csx corp which had 2021 revenue of 12 5 billion and profits before taxes of about 5 billion which is 40 these are money printing presses on steel wheels that s why warren buffett is so heavily into rail it once was true that companies gave a much bigger part of increased profits to workers because those people made the profits possible by the 1980s that was passé executives egged on by the likes of the chicago school of economics and hangers on of ayn rand thought they were the motivating force behind success and that shareholders and execs should get the overwhelming benefits from increased profits it s time to move back and become aware of who makes all those profits possible
amazon started a building boom in 2020 amid soaring sales as the pandemic hit now the retail giant has too much space and is slowing or canceling several projects including at least five in michigan related businesses are affected including a novi based transport company that is closing and laying off delivery drivers amazon opened a 150 million regional fulfillment center southeast of grand rapids in march 2020 as the start of the covid pandemic propelled staggering growth for retail delivery across the united state the 850 000 square foot building in gaines township about four miles from the gerald ford international airport generated enough activity to employ 1 000 people as national e commerce sales soared 50 percent from 2019 to 2021 that s when amazon in the midst of its pandemic building boom sought to open two additional facilities across 68th street to sort and deliver online orders to front porches and officials expected hundreds more workers to join the retail giant s michigan workforce that hasn t happened one of the buildings isn t yet open and construction hasn t started on the other they are among at least five michigan amazon facilities that have been postponed or canceled as the world s largest online seller and one of michigan s biggest employers curtails its building footprint and staffing amazon isn t the only business behemoth scaling back plans in michigan as e commerce slides the reason american shoppers are increasingly willing to go back into stores said stanley lim an assistant professor of supply chain management at michigan state university as a result he told bridge michigan there s excess capacity among companies involved in e commerce just as inflation and supply chain costs are pressuring businesses the unexpected shift in shopping behavior and rising costs are triggering many companies to revisit their expansion plans that were made during the peak of the pandemic lim said examples besides amazon include fedex which announced cost cutting this week as global shipping fell and peloton the workout equipment star of the pandemic postponed opening a 400 million headquarters in ohio and laid off 300 workers in warren and detroit as sales plummeted online shopping represented 9 percent of u s retail sales in early 2019 according to the u s census bureau and it nearly doubled to 17 percent in 2020 but it started to drop in the third quarter of 2021 and is stabilizing at about 14 percent as it grows slowly coming in at 1 9 percent this summer compared to 5 3 percent a year earlier overall retail sales grew 0 3 percent in august after declining by 0 4 percent a month earlier over the last or three years many thought the shift to online sales was going to stick among consumers lim said but it s proven so far to be less sticky than many expected across the u s amazon is responding with layoffs program cuts and trimming how much building space it will open and operate reports indicate that at least 70 facilities across the country including 44 that have been closed or canceled are affected michigan sites include the two buildings in gaines township which would have totaled 400 000 square feet the one in progress has been stalled in part due to a lack of available electrical supplies township building officials said they have no date for a planned opening and there has been no work done in about three months the first mid michigan fulfillment center a one million square foot building under construction in delta township originally planned to open in spring it s now expected to open in 2024 township manager brian reed said two warehouse buildings in washtenaw county where construction in pittsfield township was postponed and plans for ypsilanti township were canceled according to mlive com combined the paused projects also postponed the creation of at least 1 000 new jobs estimated to accompany the developments more positively another site under construction for amazon s use in canton township is almost finished with the final inspection scheduled for next week said patrick sloan community planner in the township between detroit and ann arbor the 183 000 square foot building is almost up and running he said friday though information on when amazon could start operating there was not immediately available amazon is also shedding jobs with 100 000 fewer global employees reported in the company s second quarter filing than earlier this year the latest data for michigan indicated that the company had 26 000 full and part time workers at year end 2021 job losses also are extending to the state s last mile amazon drivers who deliver packages from shipping centers to consumers most amazon delivery drivers across the u s work for third party delivery companies about 150 contract workers in michigan will be losing jobs at second samuel transport inc a novi based delivery company that until this fall had only one client amazon the retail giant told the transport company last week they will not be renewing our contract thereby causing us to lay off all employees and cease business according to a worker adjustment and retraining notification letter the company sent the state sept 8 layoffs will affect second samule s 365 workers in four states with the michigan layoffs including 64 people in hazel park 46 in romulus and 35 in grand rapids amazon would not comment on how many michigan facilities or workers are affected by its changes so far amazon is constantly exploring new locations and weighing a variety of factors when deciding where to develop sites to best serve customers spokesperson austin stowe told bridge however we have a policy not to provide information on our future roadmap the end of amazon s building boom may have minimal impact on michigan s commercial real estate industry automotive companies and other industries that once competed with amazon for property are still seeking both buildings and industrial land to build facilities there is still demand for warehouse space said neal warling managing director of the ann arbor office of jones lang lasalle an international commercial real estate company while many office markets are struggling across the state the industrial market is strong in metro detroit the industrial vacancy rate is near historic lows of about 4 5 percent on 656 million square feet meanwhile amazon is valued at 1 25 trillion based on outstanding stock shares the stock price closed on friday at 123 down about 2 75 percent from a day earlier that represents a drop of about 26 percent this year at fedex the stock price slid 21 percent friday after the company reported first quarter earnings on thursday the company missed its earnings target by 500 million because macroeconomic trends significantly worsened ceo raj subramaniam said in the filing that includes global shipping volume along with inflation and transportation costs the company said it would close 90 office locations and five corporate office facilities among other cost cutting measures
russian president vladimir putin has underscored an inconvenient truth the sanctions that the west have imposed on russia that include freezing half of its own 640 billion reserves in gold and foreign exchange have boomeranged on them in a speech at the eastern economic forum in vladivostok which was attended by officials from 68 countries putin cited the effects that the sanctions have had on the west itself putin accentuating what he called the west s short sighted actions that have triggered a global inflation lamented too that many countries have seen more hardships hitting the poor communities even in many developed economies where the inflation rate has reached a record high level that had not been seen in many years he said everybody is aware of this but i will reiterate as of late july inflation in the united states reached 8 5 percent russia has just over 14 percent but it is declining unlike in western economies the inflation there is on the rise and in our country it is declining the inflation in germany has reached 7 9 percent in belgium 9 9 percent in the netherlands 12 percent latvia 20 8 percent lithuania 21 1 percent and estonia 25 2 percent and it is still on the rise the rise in prices in the global markets is to the russian leader a real tragedy for most of the poorest countries which are facing shortages of food energy and other vital goods citing data from the un in 2019 there were 135 million people in the world facing acute food insecurity and their number has soared by 2 5 times to 345 million by now putin said this is just horrible moreover the poorest states have completely lost access to the most essential foods as developed countries are buying up the entire supply causing a sharp increase in prices now the global economy is in turmoil with an inflation spike heretofore unheard of americans saw their gas pump prices rise and other prime commodities as well and this has persisted even with the optimism that greeted the opening of the global economy as a result there was a rout in the stock markets as the high inflation numbers arose from increased rents this week is seen resulting in another rate hike as the us tries to tame the rise in consumer prices that rob the ordinary citizens of their purchasing power the united states is set to again raise its interest rates after the european central bank has just pulled the rug on the federal reserve with a 75 basis point rise and the bank of england seems to follow next week with a raise of its own benchmark 1 5 percent and the cycle of interest rate rises is seen continuing still with the hawkish stance of the us fed and here at home another rate increase looms after the surprise 75 basis point rate increase was announced before its august policy meeting in a speech at the eastern economic forum held from september 5 to 8 in vladivostok that was attended by over 6 000 delegates from 68 countries in europe africa latin america and asia that include the philippines putin underlined why the sanctions have instead hit the west and contributed to raising the ranks of the poor globally he also cited the emerging consensus among nations to close ranks against the doings of the west the said forum for instance has resulted in the signing of 260 investment agreements amounting to 3 255 trillion rubles note here that the value of the investment pacts announced were made in rubles not in dollars a key takeaway that shows the perceived diminishing influence of the dollar in fact both putin and chinese leader xi jinping have agreed to pay their trades involving gazprom half in ruble and the other half in yuan this baby step towards jettisoning the dollar as the currency for global business affairs takes center stage in another two day event that follows the seventh staging of the eastern economic forum the 22nd meeting of the shanghai cooperation organization set in samarkand uzbekistan on the 15th and 16th the event will highlight the first foreign trip of xi jinping since the covid pandemic and is seen to provide the spotlight on the alternative to the west narrative in global trade uzbekistan president shavkat mirziyoyev hosts the regional cooperation agreement that will be attended by leaders of india pakistan russia china and four other soviet central republics it will be interesting to watch the proceedings of the said event that was last held in tajikistan in 2021 with the agenda set for eliminating trade barriers and peace and stability in the region the shanghai cooperation organization could provide the blueprint for a new way of trade dealings absent the dollar as medium of trade as we say in our language abangan image credits rawf88 dreamstime com

triblive s daily and weekly email newsletters deliver the news you want and information you need right to your inbox who s a threat to democracy president joe biden is a rubber stamp for the democrat controlled congress he has never vetoed a bill presented to him by congress thus as far as policy legislation and the direction of the country are concerned the de facto presidents are senate majority leader chuck schumer and speaker of the house nancy pelosi biden would join the illustrious group of 19th century presidents like millard fillmore zachary taylor william henry harrison and henry d hatfield who never vetoed a bill passed by congress oh wait a minute there was no president hatfield well as far as the democrats are concerned there is no president biden either biden acts by way of executive orders which is fine if a president uses them occasionally but not all the time for they are a customary practice of socialist dictators get this every president of the united states in the 20th and 21st centuries has vetoed bills all of them except biden the de facto presidents or maybe we can call them co presidents schumer and pelosi are loving this experience but the american people never signed up for this when they elected biden president we did not elect schumer and pelosi along with their lieutenants socialist sen bernie sanders and members of the house s radical socialists a contingent called the squad the latter are staunch advocates of the defund the police movement on the other hand president franklin roosevelt a democratic big spender who also had a democrat controlled congress vetoed 653 bills biden is a rubber stamp for the radical socialist democrats who are pushing congress and america s agenda this is reason enough to replace the current leadership of both chambers of congress with republican leaders during most presidencies the office holds clout it is respected and spearheads a direction for the country this is done not when a president acts on his own via executive orders but when he is willing to use his veto power that is the mechanism the founders put in the constitution so the legislative branch recognizes his power and the true purpose of the office this is all the more reason that the republican party should be highlighting this fact instead of biden and the democrats demonizing a portion if not all of the 74 plus million voters who supported the gop candidate for president in 2020 the true culprits in the country racing us toward the cliff are the two folks who run the two chambers of congress they are empowered by electing a majority of their respective members in the house and senate we have the oldest president of the united states ever biden turns 80 in november serving with the oldest speaker of the house ever pelosi is 82 and the entire house top leadership are all in their 80s even the greatest athletes lose a step or two lose a little on their fastball cannot quite jump as high in basketball so why should we think politics is any different biden is on a path of spending more money during peace time than any u s president in history however buying votes is not the answer as his approval rating is at a dismal 39 in a recent reuters ipso poll in a separate poll 74 of respondents believe the country is going in the wrong direction the liberal media has not helped shed light on this dismal situation biden has not had a one on one interview with a top journalist in well over 200 days of his presidency allowing him to duck serious questions america regardless of outside factors it s the economy stupid and your safety that must come first the grade for co presidents schumer and pelosi have come in their legislation has americans screaming wrong direction we cannot tax and spend ourselves into prosperity inflation continues to be at its highest in four decades at 8 3 yet biden schumer and pelosi recently threw a celebration at the white house the stock market however did not see it that way the dow jones and nasdaq just had their worst day since june 2020 losing 4 and 5 of their value respectively on protecting and securing america crime in our cities is rampant our borders are porous and the world is less safe democrats suggest that the republicans are either as bad as they are or if given control of congress could be worse that is the card they play and that s inane but they must use the cards they have dealt themselves and america democrats are confident they can beat the multiple aces the republicans have in their hands by strategically playing their trump card i e the big distraction card come november the american people will be quick to say fool me once shame on you fool me twice oh well you get it

us inflation came in a tad higher than expected this week which absolutely hammered markets in the us europe is in for a miserable winter of inflation too and australia is far from immune us inflation came in a tad higher than expected this week which absolutely hammered markets in the us europe is in for a miserable winter of inflation too and australia is far from immune but just how bad will inflation get the answer is i m not sure which doesn t sound very helpful until you read about why below but first let s explore something important that you should keep in mind governments and central banks are still causing inflation not fighting it sure central banks are hiking interest rates like never before australia s reserve bank hiked rates by half a percent last week the european central bank by 0 75 its biggest hike ever which would be impressive if the rate hadn t been 0 before the hike while inflation closes in on double digits the bank of england announced its largest rate hike in 27 years last month and in january bloomberg summed it up fed kicks off most aggressive global tightening in decades but do higher interest rates ease the cost of living or do they make the cost of living worse in austria and the us governments have launched stimulus spending to help people with inflation an oxymoronic policy of yes prime minister proportions bloomberg austria offers 1 000 euro handouts to quash inflation discontent this is like the old saying the beatings will continue until morale improves the government spending will continue until inflation improves in the us the inflation reduction act will not reduce inflation according to the government s own figures but it could increase it i think it ll increase it substantially the americans are also busy forgiving student loans a blatantly inflationary policy the monetisation of debt is pretty much the most direct way of expanding the money supply not to be outdone the bank of england is bailing out energy companies with their own balance sheet practically the definition of inflation causing inflation by lending to the government just isn t inflationary enough anymore the central bank is now lending to the private sector too in australia the government has been busily bidding up the property market in order to solve the unaffordable housing crisis read that again carefully if you re not weeping or laughing about it depending on whether you own a house enough journalists and economists called the government s first homeowner grant the home vendor grant for there to be no excuses everyone knows government programs are the cause of the unaffordable property in the first place but politicians tend to own homes having pushed property to an unaffordable new level with past programs the latest scheme from the australian government takes things to a whole new level they re offering to take a 40 equity stake in the homes of new buyers as if that won t just increase prices by the corresponding amount another good example was beautifully exposed in a milton friedman esque way when the inflation reduction act promised ev credits of us 7 500 for new cars car companies promptly raised prices by almost as much the energy crisis is behind a lot of the inflationary spike are governments making dramatic moves to allow more energy production or are they still constraining supply it seems to me that european governments are still busily waging economic war against the continent s key energy supplier price caps sanctions refusing to open nord stream 2 and plenty more no wonder energy isn t flowing from russia governments are also busy shutting down nuclear power plants in germany avoiding gas production from the groningen gas field in the netherlands and trying to stop places like hungary from securing energy deals with russia another problem has been producer price inflation the prices that industry pays for raw materials well is europe s shut down of its manufacturing base to save energy for winter going to make producer price inflation better or worse companies across europe that produce things like aluminium chemicals and steel are having to close their doors or reduce production because of energy costs which means less of what they produce is available and that means higher prices for those using the goods according to the european non ferrous metals association 50 of the eu s aluminium and zinc capacity has already been forced offline due to the power crisis it s not just industry though is shutting down dutch greenhouses over energy bills going to help food prices the dutch are the second largest exporter of food in the world what about reversing quantitative easing qe to bring down inflation have central banks reversed their policies that increased the money supply are they actively reducing that money supply quantitative tightening qt not really the ecb plans to end its qe program this month with a new one ready in the wings to bail out italy and such sovereign bailouts are historically speaking when inflation really gets out of hand bloomberg covers the us s attempts at qt the overall size of the fed s balance sheet isn t much different today at 8 9 trillion than when it started tightening monetary policy back in march it has since kicked in marginally the bank of england has announced its qt program will depend on market conditions it doesn t want to crash the government bond market by selling its vast holdings but it s crashing already strangely enough even central bankers admit that their rate hikes are not yet reducing inflation they re just pushing it up less than before we need to have somewhat restrictive policy to slow demand and we re not there yet federal reserve bank of new york president john williams recently said the fed chair himself called us rates neutral all this suggests two things first higher inflation in the future unless there s a financial crisis to crash everything secondly we can expect more tighter monetary policy until it causes a financial crisis central bankers may well be behind the curve on inflation but they ll be at the forefront of the next financial panic and that s why markets fell so badly on higher us inflation they re anticipating a crash the inversion of the yield curve only further proves the point markets now expect the federal reserve to cut interest rates in 2023 why would they do that well either inflation disappears or there will be a financial crisis within the next nine months which solves the inflation problem too take your pick until next time nickolai
