scarlett johansson is suing disney over its decision to release superhero movie black widow on streaming at the same time as in theaters alleging a breach of contract which cost the star millions of dollars johansson one of hollywood s biggest and top paid stars was entitled to a percentage of box office receipts from the much anticipated marvel film according to a lawsuit filed thursday at los angeles superior court the film was originally due for a big screen release last year but was delayed multiple times due to the covid 19 pandemic and was eventually released this month simultaneously in theaters and on disney box office analysts have cited the film s streaming debut as a major factor in a lackluster by marvel film standards release for a film that has grossed just over 150 million in domestic theaters in three weeks it s no secret that disney is releasing films like black widow directly onto disney to increase subscribers and thereby boost the company s stock price and that it s hiding behind covid 19 as a pretext to do so said johansson s attorney john berlinski in a statement to afp this will surely not be the last case where hollywood talent stands up to disney and makes it clear that whatever the company may pretend it has a legal obligation to honor its contracts he added a spokesperson for disney which owns superhero movie powerhouse marvel studios dismissed the lawsuit telling afp in a statement that disney had not breached any contract and that there is no merit whatsoever to this filing the lawsuit is especially sad and distressing in its callous disregard for the horrific and prolonged global effects of the covid 19 pandemic it said keep the revenues like many hollywood studios disney is increasingly prioritizing streaming as a source of future revenue a process accelerated by the closure of movie theaters upon the arrival of the pandemic in spring 2020 following the film s opening weekend disney issued a press release claiming black widow had earned over 60m on disney alone where it was available to subscribers at an additional 30 cost johansson s lawsuit says that to protect her financial interests ms johansson extracted a promise from marvel that the release of the picture would be a theatrical release which she understood to mean it would not appear on streaming until a traditional window of time had elapsed but disney wanted to lure the picture s audience away from movie theatres and towards its owned streaming service where it could keep the revenues for itself while simultaneously growing the disney subscriber base a proven way to boost disney s stock price it alleges disney wanted to substantially devalue ms johansson s agreement and thereby enrich itself it adds the disney spokesperson said the company has fully complied with ms johansson s contract and that the disney streaming release has significantly enhanced her ability to earn additional compensation on top of the 20m she has received to date the issue of compensation linked to box office receipts is a growing concern in streaming focused hollywood where such deals for top a listers are common rival studio warner bros was slammed last year for a similar decision to release all of its 2021 movies simultaneously in theaters and on its hbo max platform warner renegotiated many of its deals with stars and filmmakers reportedly paying out 200 million to compensate for the loss of box office earnings

aurora fatumo osman a 65 year old somali refugee who speaks limited english was in a bind she made too much money at a meal prep service job so she no longer qualified for medicaid but knee pain kept her from working so her income had dropped she could reapply for medicaid get her knee fixed and return to work at which point she d lose that safety net health coverage her first step was getting a note from a doctor so she wouldn t lose her job so osman came to mango house a clinic in aurora that caters primarily to refugees and turns no one away regardless of their ability to pay dr p j parmar designed the clinic to survive on the medicaid payments that many doctors across the u s reject as too low the clinic is just one part of a broader refugee ecosystem that parmar has built mango house provides food and clothing assistance after school programs english classes legal help and parmar even leads a boy scout troop there he leases space to nine stores and six restaurants all owned and run by refugees mango house hosts a dozen religious groups plus community meetings weddings and other celebrations when parmar needs an interpreter for a patient from any of a dozen languages spoken in the building he can easily grab one of his tenants this is what i call a medical home parmar said although it s not part of the formal u s refugee resettlement program mango house is in many ways emblematic of refugee health care in the u s it s a less than lucrative field of medicine that often relies on individual physicians willing to eke out a living caring for an underserved and under resourced population parmar finds creative ways often flouting norms or skirting rules to fit his patients needs as a result mango house looks nothing like the rest of the u s health care system and at times draws the ire of the medical establishment how do you deliver the quality of care necessary and that they deserve while still keeping the lights on it s a struggle for sure said jim sutton executive director of the society of refugee healthcare providers it s these heroes these champions out there these cowboys that are taking this on osman brought her son jabarti yussef 33 to interpret for her they have been coming to mango house for 10 years and said that parmar opens doors for them when they have trouble accessing care if we ask for an appointment to get medicaid p j makes the call yussef said if we call we re on hold for an hour and then it hangs up if we go to the er it s a three hour wait here the majority of people walk in and sit for 30 minutes it s good for the community as for osman s knee pain yussef asked parmar could they pay cash to get an mri at the hospital i can almost guarantee it s arthritis parmar replied you could do an x ray that will cost 100 an mri will cost 500 and if it shows a bigger problem what are you going to do it will cost you 100 000 parmar said he would connect them with someone who could help osman enroll in medicaid but that it s an imperfect solution most orthopedists don t take medicaid parmar said older immigrants need to have worked the equivalent of 10 years in the u s to qualify for medicare medicaid which covers low income people generally pays primary health care providers a third less than medicare which covers seniors and the disabled and both pay even less than commercial insurance plans some doctors paint medicaid patients as more difficult and less likely to follow instructions show up on time or speak english parmar said he realized back in medical school that few doctors were motivated to treat medicaid patients if he limited his practice to just medicaid he said dryly he d have guaranteed customers and no competition so how does he survive on medicaid rates by keeping his overhead low there are no appointments so no costs for a receptionist or scheduling software featured local savings he said his patients often like that they can drop in anytime and be seen on a first come first served basis much like an urgent care clinic and similar to the way things worked in their native countries because he takes only medicaid he knows how to bill the program and doesn t have to hire billing specialists to deal with 10 insurance companies it s also more cost efficient for the health system many of his patients would otherwise go to the emergency room sometimes avoiding care altogether until their problems get much worse and more expensive to fix really none of our innovations are new or unique we just put them together in a unique way to help low income folks while making money parmar said and then instead of taking that money home i put it back into the refugee community the son of indian immigrants parmar 46 was born in canada but grew up in chicago and moved to colorado after college in 1999 where he did his medical training at the university of colorado school of medicine he opened mango house 10 years ago buying a building and renting out space to refugees to cover the cost two years ago he expanded into a vacant j c penney building across the street there s a good three four year dip in the red here intentionally as we move from there to here parmar said but that red is going to go away soon the covid pandemic has helped shore up his finances as federal incentives and payment increases boosted revenue and allowed him to pay down his debt faster parmar must navigate a host of obstacles while working to overcome financial and language barriers a muslim somali woman needs dental care but is uncomfortable seeing a male dentist a nepalese woman needs a prescription refill but she lives in denver and so has been assigned by medicaid to the safety net hospital denver health parmar won t get paid but sees her anyway another patient brings paperwork showing he s being sued by a local health system for a year old emergency room bill he has no way to pay a nepalese man with psoriasis doesn t want creams or ointments good medicine he believes comes through a needle a lot of this is basically geriatrics parmar said you have to add 20 years to get their age in refugee years when one patient turns away momentarily parmar discreetly throws away her bottle of meloxicam a strong anti inflammatory he said she shouldn t be taking because of her kidney problems he began stocking over the counter medications after realizing his patients got overwhelmed amid 200 varieties of cough and cold medicines at the drugstore some couldn t find what he told them to get even after he printed flyers showing pictures of the products parmar s creative solutions however often rub many in health care the wrong way some balk at his use of family members or others as informal interpreters best practices call for the use of trained interpreters who understand medicine and patient privacy rules but billing for interpretation isn t possible so hospitals and clinics must pay interpreters themselves and that s beyond the capabilities of most refugee clinics unless they re affiliated with a larger health system that can absorb those costs it s a good thing to have the standards but it s another thing altogether to implement them said dr pat walker an expert on refugee health at the university of minnesota when mango house began providing covid vaccines residents of more affluent areas of town started showing up parmar tried to limit vaccinations only to those patients living in the immediate area checking zip codes on their ids the state stepped in to say he could neither require ids nor turn away any patients regardless of his refugee focused mission during a recent lull at the clinic parmar took stock of that day s inventory of patients six were assigned to denver health one patient s medicaid coverage had expired and two had high deductible commercial plans chances are he wouldn t get paid for seeing any of them of the 25 patients he had seen that day 14 had medicaid coverage that parmar could bill we see the rest of them anyway he said khn kaiser health news is a national newsroom that produces in depth journalism about health issues together with policy analysis and polling khn is one of the three major operating programs at kff kaiser family foundation kff is an endowed nonprofit organization providing information on health issues to the nation

is the market plunge in china a black swan american big tech has been pulling the broad american share indices higher in china big tech has been pulling the broad chinese share indices lower chinese regulators have been clamping down big time on big tech for the past few months and share prices have tumbled this week they crashed the chinese authorities scrambled to issue nothing to worry about statements and there was a dead cat bounce on thursday but prices turned lower friday chinese policymakers care about policies not share prices is the market plunge in china contagious even the most diehard bears have to acknowledge the strong correlation between the fed s expanding balance sheet and the rally in the american stock market their acknowledgement also has to include the notion that the stock market will crash if the fed tries to normalize monetary policy therefore the fed is trapped they have to stay easy forever and the stock market will keep rising if they do capital keeps flowing to the sure thing stock market all dips are buying opportunities passive investing recognizes that if you keep buying the indices month after month regardless of price you will come out ahead but what if the market plunge in china is contagious could the american equity market experience a gasp correction even as the fed maintains its current ultra easy policies who saw that black swan coming there will be consequences as noted last week american big tech is carrying the broad stock market higher the american stock indices are blowing away the rest of the world but there will be consequences if the american indices lose their leading position for instance soaring prices for american big tech draws capital into america and into the usd from the rest of the world the usd stays strong on account of this capital inflow despite record high trade deficits this condition is reminiscent of the late 1990s when the dotcom boom pulled capital into america and boosted the usd the usdx rose 50 from 1996 to 2002 and then a year after the dotcom bubble ended the usdx began a multi year decline and fell 40 over the next 6 years capital flows matter what would happen to the inflation deflation argument if the plunging chinese stock market took the american stock market down would it be another aspect of china exporting deflation to the rest of the world would this be a good time the s p and the dow rallied back from last week s early dip to make new all time highs again this week but the indices have really gone sideways this week and we are entering a seasonally weak time of the year for stocks the us dollar rose in early july and fell in late july the usd hit a 3 month high in mid july but was weaker into month end the fed s decision to maintain their existing easy policies at this week s meeting added to the soft tone speculators have been net short the usd since the covid panic in march 2020 and finally seven months after the usdx turned higher on january 6 speculators have covered all of their net short positions and have gone modestly net long gold loses correlation with real interest rates gold maintained a tight correlation with falling real interest rates from the 2018 lows through the 2020 highs but lately real interest rates have been setting new lows and gold has not rallied in this chart the tips treasury inflation protected securities rise as real interest rates fall i have noted in previous blogs that gold has had a very tight negative correlation with the usd this year commodity indices continue to sizzle commodity indices hit multi decade lows last year but the rally off those lows has been the hottest since the spectacular gains made from late 2007 to july 2008 when wti hit 147 and famous analysts were forecasting 200 or more by yearend actually yearend prices for wti were 32 the canadian dollar the cad has had a strong positive correlation with the commodity rally and the stock market rally from last year s lows until june 1 2021 the cad rose from 68 cents to 83 cents and speculators particularly since early november last year biden election and pfizer announcement kept increasing their net long positions the usd began a strong 6 week rally at the beginning of june and the cad began a strong 6 week decline speculators initially added to their net long positions they were buying the dip as the cad fell but they turned sellers by late june early july it seems that they exited most of their bullish positions as the cad dropped from 80 cents to 78 cents my short term trading i started this week with a short option collar on the bond market i was short 166 calls and short 16250 puts the options expired at the end of this week and i would collect 100 of the option premiums if the bonds were anywhere between my strike prices at expiry last week i had shorted 169 calls when the bond market reversed off its highs near 167 90 of the call premium evaporated within two days as the bond market tumbled as the stock market rallied the easy money i made on that trade got me looking for more opportunities to profit from shorting bond options hence the collar i became uncomfortable with the collar trade as early as sunday night when i realized i was trying to pick up nickels in front of a possible steamroller chinese markets were falling there was a fed meeting mid week compounding the problem i discovered i couldn t place gtc stops against my positions given the overnight risk when i was asleep i realized the positions were potentially much riskier than i had thought i exited both sides of the collar before the fed meeting i made a small net profit on the trade but left most of the option premium on the table the option premiums evaporated after the fed meeting if i had stayed with the trade i would have collected 100 of the option premiums the underlying sept bond contract never came near either of the strike prices you could say i chickened out by not staying with a winning trade i get it but bond vols were staying high and the tumbling stock market in china and the prospects of the fed surprising the market again both presented the opportunity for me to get smoked on the trade in exchange for a pretty modest max possible gain i bot and sold a few stock market positions small profits and small losses offset each other i bought the yen as it rallied on tuesday i thought it could catch a haven bid if the stock market weakened and i knew there was a huge spec short position on the yen so if it started to run those specs might become buyers i covered the position for a small gain on friday the yen had rallied thursday but started to fall back friday as the usd rallied against most currencies i decided to go flat rather than take the weekend risk on a trade closing near its friday lows i also shorted the cad at 7950 on tuesday around the same time i bought the yen the cad had rallied 1 5 cents off last week s lows and looked to be held down by resistance around the 80 cent level it had been trending lower for six weeks and might resume that downtrend especially if there was weakness in the american stock indices chinese tech indices were down hard at multi month lows on tuesday i hedged the short cad by selling 79 strike puts that expired in 10 days for 25 ticks the vol on the puts was 8 5 which i thought was high for the cad if the cad tumbled below 79 cents and kept going the max gain on the futures and options trade was 75 ticks i thought that if cad gained any downside momentum that i would probably sell more that this trade would be an initial short cad trade i placed the stop on the short futures position just below tuesday s high if the cad rallied above that level i didn t want to stay short my stop was hit early wednesday for a loss of 25 ticks i stayed with the short puts until friday and closed them for 3 ticks the net loss on the trade was 2 ticks the only trade i have on at the end of the week is a small size short s p the market looks tired here and the risk reward on the trade looks good my p l was about unchanged on the week i don t know exactly and it doesn t matter i executed on some trading opportunities i managed my risks and that s my job some weeks i make a few bucks some weeks i spin my wheels on my radar pro risk sentiment has driven stock and commodity indices on a relentless uptrend since last november i keep thinking we re way overdue for a correction but i won t short the market without some sign that a correction has started i ve been probing with initial small short positions thinking that i ll add if the market builds downside momentum and despite some winning trades my p l is small net down as a result the cost of having an opinion thoughts on trading ducking a bullet is as good as catching a winning trade as far as my p l is concerned when i put on a trade i almost always enter a stop if the market goes against me to the stop point i don t want to be in the trade the stop is my max risk point obviously the market might gap through my stop sometimes but my stop is at a point where i know i m wrong on the trade if i m buying some cheap options i probably won t use a stop if i m doing a limited risk spread i might not use a stop my stop is my backup line of defence if the market goes there i definitely want out i don t always wait for the market to hit my stop sometimes if the market is moving against me i ll just get out and cancel the stop if i ve been in a trade for a while and it isn t working especially going into a weekend i ll just get out there s no point hanging onto a trade that isn t working within the timeframe i chose when i put on the trade i know i don t know very much about any market i may have an opinion on where or why i think a market should go but it may go there for reasons i didn t even know existed it s easy to be right or wrong for the wrong reason i therefore try to pay more attention to how a market moves rather than on why i think it moved subscribe you have free access to everything on this site subscribers receive an email alert when i post something new usually 4 to 6 times a

the wake of the covid 19 pandemic this resolution illustrates the interconnectedness of the unhoused and public health crises she added bush said in a statement that the unhoused crisis in our country is a public health emergency and a moral and policy failure at every level of our government as someone who has lived in her car with my two infants while i was working a full time job i know the daily trauma and stress that comes with the perpetual instability of not having a safe place to live it is past time for the federal government to establish an unhoused bill of rights and make the desperately needed investments to guarantee housing healthcare and a robust social safety net for our unhoused neighbors she added we can end this crisis by 2025 if we as lawmakers and as a country finally dedicate ourselves to prioritizing those in our communities who have the least the unhoused bill of rights calls for drastic increases in affordable housing naming the unhoused crisis as a

expires in 3 days senior staff attorney lee camp joined repcori and national advocates this morning as the congresswoman introduced the unhoused bill of rights the pandemic has only worsened archcity defenders archcitydefense july 28 2021 lee camp senior staff attorney at the st louis based advocacy organization archcity defenders hailed the resolution as a crucial first step in ensuring that the rights of those experiencing homelessness in st louis and throughout the united states are not infringed upon simply because they re unhoused tent mission stl another st louis advocacy group noted that we live in a country whose approach to homelessness has been criminalization a state where harm reduction workers are forced into the shadows because it is still a felony to distribute clean syringes to iv drug users and a city that doesn t have a 24 7 emergency walk up shelter for its residents the time for the federal government to extend a hand to local communities who have always taken up the work of supporting their unhoused residents is long overdue tent mission stl added however it is crucial that in doing so they follow the lead of unhoused folks and local activists in order to mitigate harm and uphold the dignity of the unhoused community it s high time we take care of our unhoused neighbors and demand an unhoused bill of rights housing is a human right and it s damn time we started treating it like one blono tenants union bnrenters july 28 2021 eric tars legal director at the national homelessness law center said that with covid and the delta variant still raging evictions from rentals and homeless encampments will create public health disasters unless we get rental assistance to the 15 million people who need it and at the same time stop criminalizing homelessness this crisis will get much worse housing is a human right and rep bush s unhoused bill of rights is our guide map to making that right a reality in america the resolution was introduced on the same day that the los angeles city council voted to outlaw sitting sleeping or storing belongings on public property the same day the city of la passes 41 18 to further criminalize abuse

ever been to a chef s house for dinner me neither while they are unlikely to be doing the washing up afterwards they certainly have their uses when it comes to home entertaining but it s not mise en place and artful swipes of sauces just like us mere mortals they like to have time to relax enjoy a few drinks and listen to some good tunes here s the inside track on how some chefs entertain when they re off duty scott holder los chicanos scott holder has an impressive cv having worked in top end restaurants globally particularly in the us as is usual the chefs took turns to cook family meals for the team and the meals that stood out for him were those cooked by the mexican chefs in the kitchen he now brings a taste of mexico and the edgy feel of the streets of los angeles to dublin with his los chicanos taqueria food truck which is parked outside elliot s cash carry on camden row entertaining at home includes all the punchy mexican flavours he loves and with a bit of advance preparation there is no need to spend much time in the kitchen when your guests arrive i would set out a make your own taco night which is nice and casual and gets everyone involved he says some black bean tostados with avocado orange and our los chicanos taqueria peanut salsa macha read more carnitas the mexican taqueria dish traditionally made with pork is also perfect for prepping ahead he roasts the meat overnight in the oven so it s easy to serve with sides of guacamole salsa verde pickled red onions heirloom tomatoes with a lime vinaigrette and some roasted potatoes with a chipotle aioli to get the atmosphere going he suggests starting the night off with some funky music a margarita in hand some tortilla chips and guacamole then everything else will just fall into place i would start the night off with some rolling stones gimme shelter and as the night goes on get a little more funky with the sugarhill gang rapper s delight he says my go to drink would be paloma a grapefruit and tequila cocktail which was always a favourite of mine when hanging out in the mission in san francisco when i lived there and fantasy party guests they would be stevie nicks anthony bourdain and dr victor e frankl and snoop dogg he says charlotte leonard kane scéal bakery charlotte leonard kane and her partner shane palmer are the couple behind scéal bakery renowned for its san francisco style sourdough and inventive pastries which they sell at the fumbally stables on thursdays and saturdays not surprisingly with all of that access to 72 hour fermented sourdough pizza is a favourite if the rain appears leonard kane will simply pop up an umbrella as she oversees the pizza oven a pizza party hosted by charlotte leonard kane and shane palmer photograph shantanu starick as you can imagine the quality of ingredients is paramount the tomato sauce has to be made with san marzano tomatoes no exceptions we found the best brand is strianese which we buy from the lennox street grocer she says shane hunted far and wide for the right canned tomato many trial nights were had at home experimenting for the best consistency and acidity while the recipe for sourdough is basic it is all about the quality of the starter and not everyone has been slinging sourdough in their kitchen since the pandemic struck leonard kane says the hopsack in rathmines sells good cooked pizza bases and has reports from her mother that lidl and aldi are now selling raw pizza dough which you can roll out and shape yourself when we first started doing our pizza nights we would go all out with the toppings and we learned pretty quickly that less is more she says we do a neapolitan style pizza and we always use buffalo mozzarella good tomato sauce and basil you use them quite sparingly because it cooks quite quickly in the oven don t overdo it charlotte leonard kane and shane palmer learned pretty quickly that less is more when it comes to pizza toppings she also suggests buying fancy mushrooms from the grocer or fumbally café pan frying them to reduce the moisture content and scattering them on top they crisp and char in the oven adding an appealing contrasting texture a classic negroni is her cocktail of choice it s an easy one to remember 1oz campari 1oz gin and 1oz sweet red vermouth she says some nights we shake it up with some blood orange juice but you can t stray too

and garlic as well as any vegetables you have to hand his favourite is pak choi or choy sum he says it s well worth investing in a mandoline slicer to speed up vegetable preparation and minimise waste all of the necessary ingredients for pacit can be picked up in an asian grocery store the sauce is based on toyomansi a soy sauce mixed with calamansi a citrus native to the philippines and castillo says monika is the best brand for wheat flour noodles he also suggests buying a jar of good chilli oil his favourite is the lao gan ma brand for castillo the music starts when he s cooking i m a big vinyl head so there s already a record playing while i m in the kitchen i like to listen to hip hop while i m cooking he says i d recommend listening to pete rock lost and found hip hop underground

2016 it s got four hours of disco and house belters when it comes to drinks the weather influences his choice with the weather being so warm and sunny i d have to go for a bottle of pittnauer rosé by

aisling moore landed a michelin bib gourmand for goldie restaurant in cork in january this year and is one of the country s leading proponents for using sustainable fish ensuring that waste is minimised by using a gill to fin approach to cooking during lockdown she spent her time cooking indian and thai food which she says is perfect for entertaining what i m doing now which is super handy is making naan bread ahead of time freezing it and two or three hours before people come over i take it out of the freezer then all you have to do is flash it on the pan it really is the ultimate fast food she says i did a kashmiri fish curry with pollack recently and you can get everything ready in advance and as people are arriving you can literally add your fish in and it takes two minutes cockles and clams are another favourite much better than mussels she says as you don t have to clean them they just need to be purged in salted water but generally they re already filtered when you buy them to cook the clams moore heats some olive oil in a large pot adds plenty of sliced garlic ginger and lemongrass and allows them to infuse gently she then adds in the shellfish a good glug of white wine maybe some chillies puts the lid on and cooks it for two or three minutes she brings the pot to the table so people can serve themselves with the broth and crusty bread i d probably do some snacky bits first as well fried boquerones she says i buy the anchovies in toonsbridge i just toss them in cornflour although plain flour will do and some paprika and shallow fry them they are delicious it s the ultimate snack and i would definitely have them with a negroni she always finishes with a simple fruit based dessert at the moment it would probably be strawberries dressed in sugar and apple cider vinegar crème fraiche and meringue just put them all together like a fool she says and music r b soul or jungle soft electronic music

this article is more than 2 years old victoria s kitchen in early july restaurateur victoria tyson opened her philadelphia eatery victoria s kitchen for the first time since the first days of covid 19 as she cut a ceremonial ribbon in front of a crowd of reporters and well wishers she announced that she planned to overcome a lack of capital and staffing the obstacles that had kept her from re opening sooner by investing in e commerce technology and recruitment and retention training how would she do it with a 10 000 grant from the brand new black restaurant accelerator program a partnership between the pepsico pep foundation and the national urban league to give 500 black restaurant owners a total of 10 million over the next five years three weeks later she s already put her money to work this program and grant even out the playing ground for black business owners she says it also means me and people like me are given a fighting chance tyson is the first recipient of the grant part of a more than 400 million commitment pepsico made to support black communities in june 2020 noting that since february 2020 41 of black owned businesses have closed indefinitely or permanently compared with just 17 of white owned businesses national urban league executives say black restaurants help form the lifeblood of their neighborhoods restaurants are gathering places and hubs of the community that drive energy and activity says ceo marc morial and yet morial says only 2 of black owned businesses received funding through the first round of the federal pandemic response paycheck protection program like so many of her black business colleagues tyson applied but watched helplessly as funds designated for small businesses got used up by multinational corporations the racial reckoning that shook the globe a few months into the pandemic made many companies like pepsico realize they need to do much more to improve social and working conditions for their customers and employees of color morial says the drinks manufacturer approached him with the first offer of passthrough funding instead of programming support he s received in his decades long career this is different he says these are equity grants for helping restaurant owners get back on their feet they can use it to make payroll stock inventory buy a new stove or equipment anything to make the restaurant profitable while pepsico has set specific goals to further diversify its workforce and foster a more actively inclusive workplace culture its track record is already more impressive than most for example hispanic representation on the board is 23 1 which over indexes latinos 18 5 of the american population and at 15 4 black representation over indexes the overall african american population of 13 4 in 1989 pepsico became the first company to air a commercial entirely in spanish with no subtitles or dubbing during the grammy awards its hiring of an indian woman as ceo in 2006 made it the first multinational corporation to name a female to that position indra nooyi also chaired the board for a brief period and in the 1960s pepsico s promotion of a man named russell harvey from the all black sales force it created in the 1940s made him the first black vice president of a major corporation the company is not without its missteps in 2017 it apologized and pulled a commercial starring reality tv star kendall jenner that critics said made light of the black lives matter movement currently the website comparably says unverified users who claim to work at pepsico give it a b grade for diversity which the site says places it only in the top 40 of us businesses with more than 10 000 employees meanwhile morial says pepsico makes no business demands on grant recipients who are selected by the national urban league across the 12 cities it serves the urban league screens applicants for among other factors viability and willingness to accept business advice morial says his organization has counted approximately 1 000 black restaurant owners in those cities cooking and serving up everything from casual asian food to a white linen experience tyson emails black people are hustlers we can make a dollar out of fifteen cents lol but when it comes to the necessary business skills that will allow us to be bankable and competitive we lack those skills we just haven t been taught them but the black restaurant accelerator program will help to change that dynamic

toby babich owner of breckenridge resort managers poses for a photo on july 31 2021 in breckenridge babich leads the summit alliance of vacation rental managers and is working with summit county as part of the ongoing conversation about the county s lack of affordable housing photo by ashley low ashley low photography summit county has long had a housing issue but the problem was exacerbated in the last year partly by trends associated with the coronavirus pandemic some point to urban flight where residents from metropolitan areas flocked to rural areas in search of cheaper living or an enhanced lifestyle others point to the fact that summit county is largely built out and has limited land and a limited number of affordable housing developers to build upon more recently community members have pointed fingers at short term rentals some suggest that the number of short term rental units are exponentially increasing in the community leaving little housing stock for locals those within the industry believe the issue to be more complex what s causing the problem is multiple factors that have really exacerbated the issue as covid began to come to a close that s been a major issue that s really exacerbated the housing crisis is just the fact that people find this place desirable to live in work from and invest in said toby babich owner of breckenridge resort managers and president of the summit alliance of vacation rental managers during the ongoing conversation about housing many community members have suggested capping the number of short term licenses moving forward this potential strategy is being researched by summit county and its towns but it s one babich said won t produce the desired impact it hasn t been proven to be effective in any community it s been attempted in babich said tourist destinations like summit county usually have a higher number of short term rentals within the area and mary waldman owner of summit mountain rentals based in breckenridge said this is for good reason without these units the county and its towns would struggle to accrue much needed revenue we re a tourist destination our sales tax dollars are generated from overnight guests that spend money on 100 t shirts 200 spa treatments 300 bottles of wine at local restaurants and tipping 25 waldman said so if we cap short term rental licenses we reduce the number of people spending overnight here in the mountains then you lose sales tax dollars that are generated waldman s company manages about 250 short term rentals around the county as well as 37 long term units she said that in her opinion the county s housing issue has less to do with short term rentals and more to do with simple economics and recent trends from the pandemic i believe it s pure economics of supply and demand she said we have a labor shortage because of a housing shortage and we have a housing shortage because more people want to live here than what s available the zoom economy has exacerbated the desire for people to come up to the mountains as stated in a housing town hall on friday july 30 there are over 4 300 short term rental units in unincorporated summit county which does not include short term units in the towns of frisco breckenridge dillon and silverthorne a few short term rental units are owned by locals but many of them are owned by second home owners babich noted that the majority of these people rent out their properties when not in use which is why these properties are up for short term and not long term housing what runs up against the narrative that some sort of cap or restriction will create local workforce housing is the fact that most property owners purchase their properties for lifestyle reasons he said that means they want to come up and use it william fuller owner of summit county mountain retreats said the idea that a majority of owners aren t using their properties is completely false almost all of our clients spend a very significant time in summit county he said it is where they vacation most of the time it is in fact their second home we build projections for our clients for what we think their property will generate for a year and in those projections we project about six weeks of owner s use for the average use because of this babich said if a cap was implemented in the county or elsewhere many property owners would more than likely be content to let their properties sit vacant so that it s available for them when they visit babich said that only about about 5 of short term rental owners use their properties for investment purposes only the overwhelming majority do use their property for between one and 26 weeks babich said we ve had owners use their property the entire summer and rent it during the winter or vice versa in addition to researching what short term rental caps would look like summit county is researching other methods to turn some of the existing housing stock into long term workforce housing one such method is identifying opportunity zones or neighborhoods that are traditionally occupied by locals and providing owners of short term units with incentives to convert those properties into long term housing fuller said his company manages over 400 vacation rentals and that over 300 of these are located in keystone with the remaining units dispersed around the county some of which are located in these zones fuller said he does not support this move by the county first of all i think on a fundamental level i disagree with the idea that the government should or could come in and change people s property rights fuller said these people purchase their properties with certain ideas in mind and for the government to come in and say we re going to change the rules here and the thing you have your livelihood based on is no longer legal that doesn t seem to be the american way during the housing town hall on friday summit county housing director jason dietz said these opportunity zones and incentive packages would be voluntary and that the county knows not all short term rental owners within these zones will be interested in participating instead dietz said the idea behind these programs were to incentivize those who already expressed their interest in helping solve the local affordable housing issue babich said he and other members of the summit alliance of vacation rentals would like to be considered as partners in the affordable housing conversation moving forward recently the organization sent county staff a letter with insight from the industry as staff continues to develop incentives around the short term rental market

a los angeles police department report on the echo park closure and resulting protests in march found several shortcomings in the department s response including insufficient tracking of projectile weapons and poor communication with media in the field the report concluded that the closure and subsequent fallout which occurred after city officials determined that a homeless encampment in the park had grown out of control necessitating repairs might have been avoided if municipal park rangers had prevented the encampment s expansion advertisement had the encampment in echo park been adequately addressed in its early stages there never would have been a need for a full scale closure the lapd concluded in its after action report released friday currently park rangers are missing nearly half their allotted positions they simply do not have the resources to monitor every park in the city the lapd report states to prevent another encampment from establishing itself in a popular public space the city should make fully staffing the park rangers a top priority the report acknowledges few other mistakes in the department s response but does make several recommendations for how such incidents could be better handled in the future advertisement a spokeswoman for the park rangers did not immediately respond to a request for comment saturday the report is set to be discussed at the civilian police commission s weekly meeting tuesday the march events brought intense scrutiny to the lapd at a time when it was still taking stock of last year s protests after the murder of george floyd and came amid growing tensions in the city around the utilization of public space by people experiencing homelessness advertisement those tensions have only increased the city council this week passed a law that further restricts homeless encampments in the city and could lead to new clearance efforts activists who showed up to protest the clearing of the echo park encampment joined members of the media who were covering the event in criticizing the lapd response the police action resulted in more than 180 detentions and arrests including of journalists and cost the city and the police department millions of dollars in operational and overtime costs according to the report one protester had his arm broken by an officer swinging a baton protesters and members of the media were shot with hard foam projectiles and bean bag rounds at times at close range protesters and legal observers cried foul alleging excessive force reporters including the times james queally were caught up in the enforcement action and detained others were arrested advertisement in the days after the protests the bulk of which occurred over the course of two nights in late march lapd chief michel moore credited the department with maintaining safety in a volatile situation that saw people lobbing water bottles and firecrackers at officers and protesters locking arms to prevent officers from arresting those responsible moore said the department had done a better job than it had the previous spring at limiting the use of projectile weapons and processing detainees swiftly however moore said the department had received complaints about echo park including from the media and would be reviewing its operation and the circumstances that led up to it he said it was clear the city needs a better plan for addressing homeless encampments advertisement in a july 22 letter accompanying the report to the police commission moore said the department has made great strides in addressing weaknesses in its handling of mass demonstrations since the 2020 unrest but the events in echo park showed that there continues to be room for improvement the report noted that the closure of the park was scheduled to occur a year earlier in march 2020 after city councilman mitch o farrell who represents the area determined it was necessary for repairs to be made however the covid 19 pandemic put those plans on hold the report said efforts by the city to find housing for individuals who were living in the park failed with some expressing no desire to leave advertisement the report said the idea to close the park resurfaced in december but the lapd requested that the action be delayed because it was short staffed while experiencing a wave of coronavirus infections among officers between dec 1 2020 and jan 31 2021 1 684 lapd employees tested positive for covid 19 and were forced to quarantine for at least 14 days the department reported the loss of such a significant portion of the department s workforce created massive ripples across the organization that drastically effected the department s ability to conduct daily operations efforts were again made to house people in the park this time with the assistance of outreach company urban alchemy until a decision was made to move forward with the closure in march advertisement as the entity responsible for public safety and due to the sheer number of personnel that would be required to successfully secure such a large perimeter while the fence was being constructed the lapd took a leading role in operationalizing the closure the lapd report said on the night of march 24 the plan was put into action protesters responded and there were some clashes with police few arrests were made the night of march 25 protesters in the area used strobe lights police said to make it difficult for officers to see what was going on protesters again said the lapd was aggressive in staging across from protesters who were exercising their free speech rights advertisement that night the lapd declared an unlawful assembly kettled or surrounded protesters who did not disperse as ordered and arrested more than 180 people including journalists city atty mike feuer later determined that those arrested for failure to disperse would not be charged according to the new report the lapd had as many as 750 officers deployed to echo park during the march events and spent more than 1 1 million on regular salaries and more than 900 000 on overtime among other costs the lapd received 12 complaints related to its protest response including one from protester isaac scher whose arm was broken another complaint is related to the detention of queally an internal review found that a sergeant made an improper remark after the reporter requested to speak to a supervisor according to the report advertisement the report determined that the lapd should devise a better system for tracking the use of projectiles on crowds as there is a large gap between the level of documentation for such incidents versus similar uses of force in non protest settings which are better documented the report also found that the lapd needs to provide formal guidance to address the rise of independent journalists reporters and observers in today s culture as well as consider publishing a formal policy or specific guidance regarding what actions field supervisors and officers should take when detain someone at the scene of an unlawful assembly it also said the department should deploy more of its own personnel to film such encounters in order to preserve evidence

chief olatunde badmus the asiwaju musulumi of yorubaland is the founder and chief executive officer of tuns group of companies badmus who holds two honorary doctoral degrees from fountain university osun state and alex ekwueme university ebonyi state speaks to tofarati ige about his business the economy life at 75 and other issues at 75 what are you most thankful for my thanks go to the almighty allah for keeping me till this age the average lifespan of nigerians is believed to be about 60 years for one to attain 75 years and still be agile without a major sickness is a feat that is why anytime i pray i thank the almighty allah for his grace is there anything you would have loved to have done i would have loved to take my company to the greatest height because i want it to outlive me however i thank god i have children and workers who are sustaining the legacy the economy of nigeria is not stable so when one makes plans now by the next month such plans could be disrupted this is coupled with the fact that my properties were vandalised during the endsars protests in october 2020 which made me lose almost n250m that was a major setback how was the company able to bounce back from the loss the figure i mentioned is in both physical assets and raw materials but when you think about the total loss in terms of goodwill and low production it is staggering we were on about 80 per cent production level and we had to go back to about 20 per cent after the loss right now we are still struggling to get back to the level we were before the protests we are at about 50 per cent capacity now so we have still not been able to come back fully we are in a situation where one can hardly get any help so one has to look inwards to survive what do you think the government can do to ensure that the endsars protests are not repeated we have to look at the origin of the protests which was police brutality that should have been the focus of the protests but it was escalated it to other sectors this was most painful the organisers should have focused on eradicating police brutality but they committed all sorts of atrocities to the extent that policemen were killed at that stage it was no longer a protest in advanced countries protesters focus on eradicating a particular menace at the end of the day they endsars protesters started attacking everything what does my company have to do with police brutality everything is not about the government we should examine ourselves rather than focus on the reason for the protest the protesters practically shut down the economy of the nation some of those people who are not in the production sector don t know what people in that line are suffering in comparison to providing services any distortion of the economy has a negative effect on people in production as an elder statesman have you forgiven those who vandalised your business what can i do if i don t forgive what power do i have however we lost a member of staff during the attack who am i to go to the family of the deceased to ask for forgiveness for his killers you are a known philanthropist is there any event that inspired you to start helping others iam a muslim the religion enjoins one to help others it teaches one to be kind to one s family neighbours and others i have two role models chief mko abiola who i was very close to when he was alive and the late arisekola alao those were the greatest philanthropists that influenced me have you ever carried out a philanthropic act and the beneficiaries didn t show appreciation when one gives one should not look back one should do one s bit whether the person appreciates it or not the issue you mentioned is very common among politicians if one helps them and they eventually get into power it is one they would even come after but one should not stop helping people just because one beneficiary offended one you have a large organisation how are you able to keep track of the company and are you still directly involved in the day to day running of the business we directly employ about 500 people so there is no way i can be directly involved in the day to day running of the company s activities however there are hierarchies and they all give account of what they do daily the general manager will then summarise and send the report to me i don t have to be there physically to know what is going on we are in the modern age at my age i only advise or correct based on my experiences at times they take my advice and at other times i submit to their will if you don t want your blood pressure to be on the high side you have to overlook many things but make sure they staff are on the right track with the benefit of hindsight is there any business you regret going into and is there any business you wished you had gone into but didn t i can only say that one has to be very careful when dealing with banks because they can falsify figures however once they know one knows they would then be careful with one since i m still alive why do i have to regret going into any business life is full of ups and downs as a notable muslim do you pray before starting a new business or do you only look at things from a business angle one has to put everything before the almighty allah as a muslim the first thing one you should do every morning is to say the morning salat prayer when one does that one would have put whatever is in one s mind into the hands of god prayer should come first before one does anything what were the challenges you faced when you wanted to start tuns farm i faced a lot of challenges when was the farm established it was started about 40 years ago the farm was not my first business though i was initially involved in electronics trading i used to supply most television stations with cameras however at a stage a former military head of state ibrahim babangida made a decree that if one did not have a farm one would not get a license to import electronics or any other thing into the country that was what led me to start the farm i then acquired land and planted maize however instead of giving me the license to import broadcasting equipment i was given the license to import disinfectants and that was not related to my vision that was why i had to import those items disinfectants but i could not get a market for them someone then advised that i could mix the animal concentrate which i had bought with the maize i had harvested and start producing animal feed so that was how we started however some of the farmers refused to pay claiming that the feed was not good that then led us to rearing our own animals that would be consuming the feed after some time we took the animals to the slaughterhouse in ibadan and they were the ones that determined how much they wanted to pay that led me to having my own slaughterhouse basically the farm was a child of necessity because from one attempt to solve a problem to the other the farm became up to standard what changes would you like to see in the agricultural sector the central bank of nigeria is trying its best they recently released maize to all the important big farmers in the country at the market rate we use an average of about n50m worth of maize every month and it constitutes about 70 per cent of what we do do you think the poultry farming sector is better off without the influx of chicken from neighbouring countries even when we cannot meet local demands our neighbours don t produce chicken they take them there illegally from south africa and south america and they are not good for human consumption local producers can meet up with nigeria s demands the president major general muhammadu buhari retd recently said graduates were leaving white collar jobs for farming do you agree with that assertion the president depends on statistics given to him but as far as we farmers are concerned in our local farming environment i don t think so hardly does any graduate want to stay on the farm when you employ them they would hardly spend a year before quitting however i know the president has his statistics because the government has so many programmes for youth empowerment but i m yet to see the effect how can more youths be encouraged to participate in agriculture i don t have an answer because the youths of today want high profile jobs and quick money what i discovered from my experience is a lack of home training for some youths i am very proud of the way i brought up my children with the little training we gave them at home they are doing well wherever they are today i believe home training and religion should play better roles in educating the youth these days they are more interested in politics because there is a lot of money there what a local government councillor takes home every month a graduate cannot get it the majority of our graduates are into politics they see the way politicians live and that influences them if the money in politics is invested in farming we would see a lot of people going into it are you saying the government needs to do more to encourage the youth to go into farming what can the government do the work has to be done from the home front we must look for a way to make politics less attractive so that people can focus on other sectors at a time you were the national president of the poultry association of nigeria what would you consider your greatest contribution to that sector during that period when i came into the office there were a lot of imported chickens in the country but within four years we were able to stabilise the poultry industry in nigeria i can tell you authoritatively that we can export millions of feed from nigeria today we are also very good in terms of egg production also there are enough slaughterhouses in the country to meet up with the demand for chicken in nigeria in our case we are supposed to slaughter about eighty thousand birds in a week it is a small capacity when you compare it to some countries that slaughter about one million chickens in a day we don t have enough birds because people are not willing to join the sector we started a programme whereby farmers would get the birds and feed for free raise them and sell the birds back to us at an agreed price based on how well a farmer raised their birds they could make enough money unfortunately some farmers defaulted thinking it was a government project have you had any experience of herdsmen destroying your farm in osun state we have a way of managing herdsmen this is a business they have been doing for many years and if we decide to suddenly send them away they would fight back therefore we interact with the farmers and herdsmen the government set up a committee and we hold regular meetings if there is an attack anywhere or a foreign herdsman comes into the state it is the committee that would quickly handle that so we don t have that problem why are people saying they cannot release land for grazing reserves the beneficiaries would be the people in that area where the reserves are located perhaps indigenes are scared of herdsmen completely taking over their lands what do you think about that one cannot be too sure about that it has never happened in osun there was a time i was grazing cows i had about 100 cows and i put four fulani herdsmen there to graze them for me my land was about 500 hectares how would they herdsmen then turn around to say they are the owners of the land when i have the certificate of occupancy i am using myself as a practical example when the place was a bush they were there and now that it is becoming a town they are still there how can they claim my land being a private landowner the fg would not take your land but they can take community lands the state government would donate the land and it would be managed by people in the state cattle rearing is a private business why should the federal government invest in it i just mentioned that the cbn invested money in maize and rice farming what is wrong with investing in cattle you worked with the nigeria police force for some time what were the highlights of your law enforcement career and what took you there i don t have much experience in that regard so there is nothing to say that is inspiring i joined the police as a recruit why did you leave was your motive to make money my motive was not to make money i left because i wanted to practise journalism what is the most interesting thing you remember about your time at the western nigerian television and western nigerian broadcasting service it was a memorable time it gave me an insight into what life is about because immediately after i was employed i was deployed to the lagos office it was at the lagos office that i was able to garner the little contacts i made it was also in lagos that i had the inspiration to start buying and selling business my contact in lagos volunteered to send me to mecca saudi arabia so i went there and found out that they were more advanced than us in communication at that time we had very big midgets recorders it was there i discovered that we could have smaller ones and i bought about 100 pieces that was how i started supplying broadcasting equipment to broadcast stations did you keep in contact with the man after your trip to mecca yes i did he was actually my mentor but he died many years ago do you have any child who has taken after you in that regard i have a daughter who is into journalism she is studying for her third degree at the obafemi awolowo university ile ife osun state she studied mass communication went to the nigerian institute of journalism for a diploma programme and is now studying law in oau she is the only one of my children in that field others are doing different things you are an accomplished businessman but you never got involved in politics why we had been warned to be very careful when it came to politics it is not everybody that can go into politics it all depends on one s destiny however every human being is a politician at a certain level but i am not a member of any political party however they politicians are my friends and we relate well as a muslim my religion teaches me to obey and respect whoever is in authority it is god s will for them leaders to be where they are so i will give whatever support i can give what can you recall of your role in the establishment of fountain university the nasrul lahi li fathi society of nigeria came to me and said they needed my assistance to set up a secondary school in badagry lagos state i then advised them to set up a university instead since there were a lot of secondary schools already they came back after two months saying they had agreed to set up a university and because i was the one who advised them they said they would make my town a priority i then took them to the late king and he was also very passionate about it he asked them what they wanted and they said they wanted about 250 hectares of land between myself and the state government we were able to make that land available to them and ever since we have continued to maintain a good relationship with the university many family businesses in nigeria struggle and many of those founders have the pain of not having children that would run the business after them what is your experience in that regard if you look at successful businesses all over the world it is not inheritance that made them successful i try to encourage my staff members and make them shareholders in the company at the end of the day they would leave one i made sure my children learnt in a hard way and at the end of the day i gave them shares in my companies my children were taught that lesson and that made them to sit tight they also know that they can do better and they are doing that already what were your contributions at nigerian machine tools limited during my tenure we were able to build a foundry which was then the biggest in west africa we could manufacture spare parts but it has now been sold so i don t know the status of the company now what are the most important qualities an entrepreneur should have business is full of ups and downs the stability of a company would determine its success or otherwise the only line of business that survives in nigeria today if you take look at the stock market is the banking sector in the production sector i don t think anyone can say they are comfortable the nigerian economy has made a lot of company to be bankrupt because of its instability for example the price of flour has been increased more than 10 times this year consequently the prices of bread have been increased several times since the beginning of the year there is practically no company in nigeria that does not increase prices on a monthly basis what is the impact of that on businesses until there is stability in the economy things wouldn t change because nigeria is a consuming nation perhaps the cbn investing money in agriculture might reduce it instability but the impact would not be felt this year the little success we have now is because of the cbn s intervention in different sectors of the economy if not for that direct intervention i don t know what would have happened if things continue this way for another year what do you think will happen if you are eating thrice a day maybe you would reduce it to once or twice laughs like i mentioned earlier we are largely an importing nation and things change on a daily basis in a democracy the system of changing government is through elections but you see people protesting on the streets yet these people protesting are members of the same political party why can t they use the platform to change the government and not disrupt the economy does that mean you re not in support of the call for yoruba nation they should go through the electoral process from the countries we copied democracy from is it on the streets they demand their rights they vote the government out of power when they are not satisfied with the government how long have you been playing golf i have been playing golf for the past 15 or 20 years because i have to keep active my gym is also there we have the boxing ring swimming pool and others sporting activities it is important for one to keep fit medically one is advised to do one exercise or the other people say polygamous homes are not usually peaceful how have you been able to maintain unity in your family my religion permits me to marry as many wives as i did my number one priority has always been to train my children i did not look at their mothers rather i focused on the children they do everything together i usually woke them up to say our morning prayer together i dressed them and my driver would take them to school they all attended the same primary school for their secondary education one of them attended a navy school while majority of them attended federal government colleges for their university education they went to schools in maiduguri borno state ile ife and ogbomoso osun state it was after six of them had graduated that i started focusing on the business again i believed that if they were all independent they could take care of their mothers that is when i will now have to relax and enjoy myself when you were young how were you able to keep the romance between your wives my priorities were my children and business the issue of romance was secondary and not something to worry about if one wants to be a womaniser one would not be able to achieve anything i had things that engaged me and when my children returned from school their arabic teacher was always waiting for them they grew up without people noticing they were of different mothers the children their mothers and i have different apartments what are the memorable things you remember from your childhood the only thing i can recall is i had a focus you didn t dream to be a doctor lawyer or nigerian president no my ambition was to raise my children to a level that they would not suffer that was why i told all of them to pursue specific careers the first one studied electrical engineering because i told him there is no house without electronics i assured him he would never suffer i told the second one to become a lawyer even if it is charge and bail he would never suffer i told the next one to study computer engineering and the one after him to study medicine they are all professionals and that is why they are doing great today are you still open to marriage if you find a young god fearing muslim lady if i see someone like that it is for the person to take care of me it is not the sexual life that matters now i have types of food i am restricted to so i must have somebody to take care of me someone that would take care of whatever i m doing and remind me of my doctor s prescriptions

death from coronavirus has changed bringing that figure up related delta cases surge worldwide a coffin of a covid 19 victim is disinfected in piura peru picture sebastian enriquez afp previously a covid death was only recorded with a positive test but in a country with a large number of people living in poverty and with a stretched health system this led to a lot of under reporting looking at the increase of deaths year on year there were 150 per cent more deaths than expected despite this figure not being reflected in coronavirus statistics so the government changed the criteria counting a covid 19 death as any which took place within 60 days of a positive test or if coronavirus was suspected as the reason for death thus raising the figures to what is probably a more realistic number meanwhile the country has just sworn in a new left wing president pedro castillo after a nailbiting election with the slimmest of margins his campaign centred on distributing wealth more evenly winning him votes from the rural regions which are typically very poor early in the pandemic peru was quick to bring in restrictions to help curb the spread of the virus but case numbers continued to

article for the conversation adam taylor of the menzies health institute at queensland s griffith university wrote that the exact threat lamda poses is still unknown at this stage more research is required to say for certain how its mutations impact transmission its ability to evade protection from vaccines and the severity of disease he said preliminary evidence suggests lambda has an easier time infecting our cells and is a bit better at dodging our immune systems but vaccines should still do a good job against it it s that last point that the world is on edge about will vaccines work against lambda lambda has a few defining mutations to the spike protein according to dr taylor one mutation is associated with reduced susceptibility to virus generated antibodies this means antibodies generated from being infected with the original wuhan strain of covid aren t quite as effective at neutralising lambda he wrote in the conversation another mutation is similar to the delta variant this mutation in delta not only increases the ability of the virus to infect cells but also promotes immune escape meaning the antibodies vaccines generate are less likely to recognise it dr taylor wrote it is this mutation according to virologist ricardo soto rifo of chile s institute of biomedical sciences which may be the reason for the strain s high infection rate in research not yet peer reviewed dr soto rifo assessed the chinese coronavac vaccine on lambda it showed the variant could neutralise the antibodies created by the vaccine related blood clot risk higher in covid 19 patients a doctor prepares a vaccination to give to a health worker in february 2021 in lima peru picture raul sifuentes getty images these results were expected dr soto rifo told al jazeera the virus has changed and that can make the vaccine not as efficient as it was with the original virus but that doesn t mean the vaccine doesn t work any more in another non peer reviewed study nathaniel landau a microbiologist at the nyu grossman school of medicine showed a lab made lambda like virus was twice as infectious as the original coronavirus despite the results he still advised vaccines were imperative the key is that both highly transmissible viruses but if you get the vaccine you re most likely going to be protected dr landau told national geographic and the rate of infection with these viruses is going to go down in areas where people get the vaccine he said we believe that at least for the mrna vaccines moderna and pfizer that those vaccines will protect very well against lambda in the same way that they protect against the delta virus even though some of the antibody no longer works against the variants it s still enough that they will fight the virus and get rid of it pretty well

alternatives however emotions greatly influence and in many cases even determine our decisions as psychological lecture as it may sound there couldn t be a better way to describe what made me add this new off roader to my humble garage when i booked the car a while back i had never thought i d be this excited to own a mahindra and wasn t even sure if i ll go ahead with delivery and cancel it midway as i was thinking of saving the doughs for a couple of years and upgrade the discovery sport to something really nice i had a mixed opinion when it was launched due to its grille and the flat and curved wheel well fenders triggered my ocd and i was like why would a car have different style of wheel wells i thought m m has done it to avoid another lawsuit with fca but but but the moment i went a little deeper into jeep s history be it willys or m m the desire to own a jeep with these very characteristics uneven wheel well shot up like anything the made in india with pride badge the looks with the new grille and almost everything else about this car the machine its history had triumphed all other emotions and thoughts and the thar was booked in no time sharing with y all an interesting article excerpt below which might seem interesting to many as it did to me quoting jalopnik mahindra was one of the earliest 1947 remember jeep licensee and has had agreements with every one of the many companies that have been stewards of the jeep brand over history willys kaiser american motors renault chrysler daimler the cerberus group and now fiat that s insane it also means that technically mahindra has had the rights to the jeep design for decades longer than the current owner fiat chrysler has the point of all this is to say yes mahindra can damn well build a jeep if they want to so from non surety of buying it to browsing several hours a day while waiting for it and planning its mods this affair with jeep seemed deep and one that d stay for times to come dealership experience delivery once i fell in love with the thar the biggest challenge for which i needed ice buckets to take the edge off was how fast i can get it despite based in patna and the local dealer principal being a good friend he sounded a little helpless on being able to arrange the car in any other circumstances other than once allotted by m m against my booking which would mean 40 44 weeks i started making calls to the other dealerships in cities with which i have any kind of connection with office relatives close friends and finally the one that gave me a ray of hope was a dealer in kolkata they mentioned that they keep getting vehicles from the open pool and if the variant i m looking for comes into it there s a chance i can get it sooner after regular follow ups and requests i finally managed to get one allotted to myself the first step towards owning my first jeep especially after having a love and hate relationship with a ford gpw that i kept seeing since childhood being owned maintained by a relative overall i had a super smooth buying experience with no harassment for anything whatsoever yes they wanted me to take insurance from them but promised me to match it closely to the best deal i was getting outside yes they requested me to take accessories worth 25 30k which i was anyway going to take wheel arch cladding reverse camera door sill protector door side step snack tray sunshade and a few more small parts all in all the thar was booked over the phone with the general booking amount and a po which included all the accessories and other details and i wasn t asked for any further payment till the car arrived to the stockyard in march i decided to take a small loan on the vehicle owing to the interesting rate of interests popping up in my netbanking offers regularly which was further sweetened after speaking to the bank the process took a couple of days which had reached just 2 days prior to my delivery date but as i was firm that i wanted the car on a thursday they worked an extra bit and made sure that i got it delivered without any kind of inconvenience due to covid surge and the delivery being done late it was a usual affair and i probably had to just spend 20 mins at the showroom signing a few documents before i drove off to a new journey with the all new thar the honeymoon period and driving impressions i have driven the car for about 1000 kms by now and got used to its style and tantrums and i must admit i m mostly driving with probably 50 to 80 throttle input all the time and boy its fun the gearshifts in this amount of throttle input is near to perfect and it just pulls with no lag no drama yet fast like a bulky go kart the default mode is 2wd which is rwd in case of thar which i didn t know pre delivery and as amusing as it may sound the car is very tailhappy if you find the sweet spot of playing with the right amount of throttle traction control off which is just a click away unlike premium cars where you have to hold it for a few seconds shift the gear lever to the left and this wonderful jap gearbox will let you hold gears for as long as you want unlike many other cars which upshifts on your own and though there s not a great amount of top end rpm performance but this might be really beneficial off road the nvh level is best in 2wd mode super smooth and quiet but the moment you switch to 4h or 4l it does start getting audible and makes a different kind of sound which can hurt your ocd if you listen and feel your car deeply my refinement point mentioned in the pros above kinda goes for a toss when the car is delivering the power to all four wheels the steering is satisfactory and no left or right pulling issues as reported earlier and handling is as you d expect from a car that almost has half a feet of ground clearance weighs well and though could have felt more solid it is pretty acceptable and getting used to doesn t take a long time at the maximum legal speed limit in this country the steering is still at its best pretty solid and would get you out of most situations however probably because its a car that s made in india with pride it starts showing its consciousness from all its bits be it steering or windblast if you exceed this by say another 25 30 km hr the ride quality well the moment rough patches comes it starts seeming like riding a bull but even that itself is so different from the other cars i have that every mile covered was seeming like an amusement park ride fast bumpy yet handles drives well stays firm refer fun vee and i don t know if we would put this in the good or bad bit but you do feel the speed which adds to the adrenaline joy now to stop this half a feet high go kart the brakes does a decent job specially after run in period it used to feel scary for a while but the moment there were a few hundred kms on the odo it started bedding in and getting better and better less than a week post delivery the jynx that i have with the new cars heading back to the dealership what started with f30 continued when a friend took the car and a part of the plastic roof was hit in the second basement of the parking lot where he says he wasn t confident to enter but the guards didn t stop him so he couldn t judge the height luckily no damage to any other metal part and no parts will be repaired but the entire roof will be changed which is ordered and costed around 1 5l from the dealership and while i thought it d take time to reach i gotta appreciate m ms promptness to my surprise i hear that it in a week s time the new roof is at the dealership so will take the trip to kolkata sort it though initially heartbreaking for a couple of days one gotta digest what has happened and move on so ultimately i did i took it to office a couple of times and it to my colleagues it didn t fail to ooze excitement any less than other new cars that i had taken in past so that s all folks for now the car will be off to the workshop the coming

here s what you need to remember a lack of ammunition has made this collector s item difficult to shoot today in the 1960s an american engineer and his partner invented a gun that fired rocket propelled ammunition yes rocket propelled like a space launch only much smaller and way deadlier the gyrojet handheld rocket gun was a unique child of both the cold war and the space race meant for combat in vietnam it enjoyed a brief cameo in a james bond flick and was the object of some half hearted espionage but soon fizzled out the gyrojet was the brainchild of robert mainhardt an engineer who had worked at los alamos scientific laboratory and the u s atomic energy commission and his business partner arthur biehl much larger rocket weapons such as the bazooka and the soviet rpg 7 designed to destroy tanks were already in widespread use mainhardt and biehl wanted to scale down the concept for taking out individual human beings tiny rocket launcher it s important to think of the gyrojet not as a gun that shot rockets but rather a rocket launcher that looked like a gun the weapon which came in both pistol and rifle configurations was basically a tube with pistol or rifle like ergonomics and a simple firing mechanism like its larger cousin the rpg it had few moving parts certainly fewer than a conventional pistol or rifle a conventional gun fires a bullet pushed by a single explosion inside the weapon as the bullet travels farther away from the gun the speed of the projectile slows the gyrojet rocket on the other hand actually got faster the farther it flew from the gun there were problems for one thing the rocket traveled at a very slow speed at first at a distance of 60 feet it was going a pathetic 100 feet per second by comparison a nine millimeter bullet at the same distance will travel around 1 200 feet per second the gyrojet pistol was useless at the ranges to which pistols are best suited and also lacked the sights and optics to engage targets at a distance the rockets which were steel tipped for piercing armor were stabilized in flight by ported exhaust tubes designed to induce spin spinning gave the rocket stability in flight but not much stability because accuracy was still an issue at a distance of 100 yards it was supposedly 50 percent more powerful than a 45 caliber bullet the hard part was hitting anything at 100 yards literature published by mba associates upon the gyrojet s debut claimed that the new weapon never needs oiling or cleaning could be fired underwater or in outer space and that the rockets could be buried under dirt or mud and used as booby traps that can be set off automatically by time devices or trip wires since they launched rockets at initial low muzzle velocity the guns had no recoil the rocket gun attracted lots of attention not all of it welcome in 1966 shortly after the gyrojet was made available to the public a california gun shop owner was visited by soviet military attaches who attempted to buy one of the pistols the store owner wouldn t sell them the weapon but he did sell them ammunition more favorably the rocket gun played a cameo role in the james bond film you only live twice introduced as a japanese invention gyrojets were used by japanese spymaster tiger tanaka and his army of ninjas to stop a spectre plot to ignite world war iii i once had the opportunity to handle a gyrojet one day a new shipment of long guns arrived at the auction house where i worked i noticed one weapon that was shorter than the rest it didn t look like a hunting rifle a musket or a bolt action military rifle as an arms and armor auction house we were always getting weird stuff and none weirder than this it looked like a pistol with a shoulder stock a lengthened barrel and a flared muzzle resembling a hi tech blunderbuss it was strikingly lightweight possibly as little as three pounds with a stock made of a blonde wood and what appeared to be an aluminum barrel the gun was an odd blend of the organic and futuristic it would not have looked out of place resting next to a sofa in a scandinavian furniture catalog it slowly dawned on me what i was holding this i said to my befuddled coworker is a rifle that shoots rockets i held it carefully thinking it was probably quite rare but it was so lightweight and had such great pointability that i was soon swinging it around like a toy it didn t really have a balance point although i m sure stuffed with rockets it was balanced just behind the trigger combat trial a handful of gyrojet weapons saw combat in southeast asia with the u s military s secretive studies and observation group a cover name for a group of highly trained commandos that carried out top secret missions behind enemy lines as john plaster wrote in his book sog the secret wars of america s commandos in vietnam sog acquired a small number of the pistol version to try out in the field sog commandos were known to carry everything from swedish k submachine guns to crossbows so this was not surprising in one test a rocket round punched through an old truck door and into a water filled 55 gallon drum almost exiting its opposite side plaster wrote sog men also test fired it through sandbag walls and even tree trunks vietnam uncovered problems with the gyrojet weapons the rocket engines disliked the humidity of southeast asia and sometimes burned unevenly the need to achieve velocity at the expense of short range lethality plus poor rocket reliability and other performance issues doomed the gyrojet a full scale military contract was not to be and ultimately only a thousand or so were built today the gyrojet weapons are collector s items due to a lack of ammunition it is almost unheard of to actually shoot one there is at least one effort out there to restart research into gyrojet technology maybe 50 years later the time is right to try again to replace bullets with rockets or maybe this is still a sort of good idea whose time will never come image wikimedia commons

the views and opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author and don t necessarily reflect the press democrat editorial board s perspective the opinion and news sections operate separately and independently of one another west branch iowa for political geeks it was the perfect travel plan in consecutive days we were going to learn about the presidencies of dwight eisenhower harry truman and abraham lincoln we got herbert hoover instead covid 19 was to blame for our first extended travel in a long time we were determined to be careful wearing masks in indoor spaces slathering our hands with sanitizer eating from a box of groceries stowed in the back of the car enjoying takeout meals here and there this is not a stress free way of travel but after 16 months of confinement we needed to do something go somewhere pete golis the virus didn t care lower rates of vaccinations led to higher rates of covid 19 in kansas and missouri the dwight d eisenhower presidential library in abilene kansas and the harry s truman presidential library in independence missouri announced they would be closed until further notice after news reports said kansas city hospitals were turning away patients we canceled our hotel reservations there and started over eisenhower and truman and the lincoln presidential library in springfield illinois would have to come later we pulled out the map again and looked north it was time to give iowa a try and maybe later the rock roll hall of fame in cleveland mention herbert hoover and most americans will think of the great depression the stock market cratered during hoover s first and only term in the white house soon the encampments of unemployed americans would become known as hoovervilles yet here we were standing in front of the herbert hoover presidential library and museum in west branch iowa iowa notes to californians iowa is very green also they grow a lot of corn here the small home in west branch iowa where former president herbert hoover was born pete golis the press democrat our masks made us the great exception in middle america as we made our way across the country masks in restaurants hotels and other indoor spaces were few and far between social distancing what s that were we being unnecessarily cautious or had all these maskless folks decided to take their chances we didn t know but far from home we chose to err on the side of caution somewhere past reno we began to recognize the craziness of our scheme we were driving across a country that spent the past four years angry and divided and more than a little confused about its future and hadn t we heard there was pandemic going on more than 600 000 americans had died and more were dying every day what would we find it turns out there was more to herbert hoover than we knew despite the starched image in the photograph herbert hoover was not born into privilege he did live an extraordinary life he was born into a small quaker community in west branch an idyllic village a few miles east of iowa city by age 9 both his parents had died of illnesses he was sent to be raised by his uncle and aunt in oregon he would gain admission to a new university in california it was called stanford which today is home to the hoover institution hoover studied geology and went on to great success as a mining engineer and entrepreneur supervising mining operations in australia and later in china where he survived the boxer rebellion a san francisco chronicle story described him as the highest salaried person in the world at his age he was 28 by the time he settled in london in 1908 he owned a mining and consulting business with 175 000 employees from peru to siberia he was then recruited to administer international relief programs that served millions of starving people and he was more than up to the task before during and after world i the successes of the relief programs administered by hoover landed him among the most admired people in the world for his prodigious efforts he became known as the great humanitarian here s what one prominent american said in 1920 about hoover s humanitarian efforts he is certainly a wonder and i wish we could make him president of the united states there could not be a better one the prominent american was franklin delano roosevelt who would later run against and defeat hoover in the 1932 presidential election between 1921 and 1928 hoover would serve as secretary of commerce where he participated in the first television broadcast hoover won in a landslide in 1928 only to lose by a landslide in 1932 his name forever linked to the great depression was he alone to blame probably not as the library presentation attests he inherited many of the conditions that led to the economic collapse of 1929 hoover himself had warned of wall street s excesses revisiting his successes reminds us that history and our own memories can oversimplify the vagaries of politics economics and luck good and bad hoover will be forever linked to the depression because he was the president and because he proved incapable of identifying what would relieve the suffering of tens of millions of americans while he tried many solutions hoover for example remained adamantly opposed to direct relief for displaced workers his successor franklin roosevelt would have a different and more ambitious plan a strategy that came to define the american disagreement about the role of government in our lives the current president joseph robinette biden knows something about this pete golis is a columnist for the press democrat email him at golispd gmail com you can send letters to the editor to letters pressdemocrat com

the legal limit on how much debt the u s government can owe was reimposed sunday kicking off a high stakes battle over federal spending with dire implications for global financial markets a two year deal to suspend the debt ceiling lapsed at midnight following inaction from congress and president biden to give the u s more borrowing authority the treasury department will now begin taking what it refers to as extraordinary measures to prevent the u s from defaulting on its debt those steps are likely to avert a default until october or even november before biden will need to sign a bill to raise or suspend the limit again the expiration of the debt limit has triggered numerous partisan standoffs over the past decade most recently in 2019 each time congress has raised or suspended the debt limit but the weeks before a potential default have often been the most tense both for financial markets and administration officials i respectfully urge congress to protect the full faith and credit of the united states by acting as soon as possible treasury secretary janet yellen wrote in a letter to congressional leaders last week warning that they risked irreparable harm to the u s economy and the livelihoods of all americans by delaying action there is no clear path to a bipartisan agreement as republicans hold out for spending cuts that democrats refuse to consider while democrats have slim majorities in both the house and senate they will still need the support of 10 gop senators to avoid a filibuster on legislation to raise or suspend the debt ceiling republican leaders have told democrats that there can be no bipartisan debt ceiling agreement without a slate of debt reduction measures targeting the roughly 28 trillion national debt several gop lawmakers have floated a deal similar to the 2011 budget control act which ended a debt ceiling standoff shortly before the u s suffered its first ever credit downgrade democrats however argue that tying a debt ceiling increase to any controversial legislation is akin to holding the financial system hostage without help from republicans democrats would have to approve a debt ceiling hike through a budget reconciliation measure which only needs a simple majority to pass in each chamber but would require support from all 50 senate democrats the congressional budget office cbo estimated in june that congress likely has until october or november before the treasury department exhausts its extraordinary measures and the ability to pay government bills on time but both cbo and treasury have warned that the u s could be on the verge of default soon after lawmakers return from a planned summer recess in september when they will face a time crunch on passing legislation to avoid a government shutdown on oct 1 yellen has also said uncertainty driven by the coronavirus pandemic and the federal government s fiscal response has made it harder to pin down exactly how long the u s to avoid a default the debt ceiling does not directly prevent the government from spending money nor can it void any bills the u s has to pay the limit simply prevents the treasury from taking on any more debt to pay expenditures already authorized by the president and congress defaulting would likely cause a massive disruption to markets and the economy trillions of dollars in treasury bonds held by foreign governments and investors are underpinned by faith in the federal government s ability to pay its bills a default on the national debt could shatter that confidence and trigger a catastrophic financial crisis nonpartisan experts have urged lawmakers for years to consider alternatives to the debt ceiling warning that even the prospect of a default hinders the financial system in dangerous ways a 2015 report from the government accountability office analyzing the 2013 debt ceiling standoff found that investors reported taking the unprecedented action of systematically avoiding certain treasury securities which are considered almost as safe as cash causing widespread issues across credit markets industry groups emphasized that even a temporary delay in payment could undermine confidence in the full faith and credit of the united states and therefore cause significant damage to markets for treasury securities and other assets the report said
last week singapore airlines sia reported a dramatically narrower net loss of sgd 409 million usd 302 million in its first quarter results for the financial year 2021 22 this is an improvement of 63 6 per cent from the record loss of sgd 1 123 million it suffered at the height of the covid 19 pandemic last year as singapore reopens its borders is one of the most admired airlines in the world on its way to wiping away the red ink in its business update published on july 29 singapore s flag carrier revealed that for the quarter that ended in june revenue rose to sgd 1 295 million from sgd 852 million in the corresponding quarter last year an improvement of 52 2 per cent this was mainly led by robust cargo performance and the absence of impairment charges expenditure fell by sgd 319 million or 16 9 per cent to sgd 1 569 million the airline said in its statement that cargo flown revenue grew by sgd 214 million 32 4 per cent as the calibrated resumption in passenger flights contributed to an increase in cargo capacity 46 9 per cent and loads carried 68 2 per cent cargo load factor increased 11 3 percentage points to 89 1 per cent while yields moderated from the exceptionally high levels during the same period last year overall the strong cargo revenue performance for the first quarter reflected the healthy demand fundamentals and an ongoing capacity crunch in the sector sia has no domestic routes and with cross border travel restrictions around the world still very much in place passenger load factor increased at a more modest pace of 4 6 percentage points year on year to 14 8 per cent passenger capacity at the end of the reporting quarter rose to 28 per cent of pre covid levels resulting in passenger flown revenue of sgd 318 million up by sgd 277 million compared with the same period april to june last year when almost all flights were grounded the number of passengers carried by the group for the quarter which included low cost carrier scoot was 362 000 up from 38 000 a year earlier the airline added three new airbus a350s into service in the quarter that just ended and removed two airbus a330s that were on the lease as of june 30 the groups fleet consists of 164 passenger aircraft and seven freighters with an average age of five years and 11 months it has one of the youngest fleets in the airline industry sia projects that passenger capacity will reach 33 per cent of pre pandemic level and that it would serve at least 50 per cent of locations it did before the pandemic by the end of september as global covid 19 vaccination campaigns gather pace the airline hopes that international air travel demand will soon recover however new variants and fresh waves of covid 19 infections in key markets remain a concern it added the recovery trajectory will be dependent on government regulations vaccination rates and the risk profile of individual regulatory authorities sia s planned capacity increase will be helped by the singapore government s plan to treat covid 19 as an endemic disease and strategy to reopen the country to travellers although singapore entered the third lockdown on july 22 which is scheduled to end august 18 the government this week reiterated its plan to gradually allow its residents to return to their pre pandemic lifestyle in some form however this will only be for those who are fully vaccinated which it said are better protected against serious effects of the virus the plan will start taking shape once a high enough proportion of residents are vaccinated and will see a change of emphasis from case numbers to hospitalisation rate the latest lockdown was caused by a spike in covid 19 cases and to ensure a higher portion of its population are vaccinated especially those aged 70 and older the vaccination rate among the elderly was significantly below the national average the authorities expect that around 80 per cent of the population would have been inoculated by early september being fully aware that singapore s status as a business and tourism hub is at stake and dependent on international connectivity the government plans to reopen the city state to international travellers in the coming months it will allow vaccinated people quarantine free access to the country although covid testing may be required it will start by setting up travel corridors with countries or regions that have vaccinated a high percentage of their population and where the infection is under control the number of countries that singapore will open up to is expected to be small initially and based on its condition that vaccination rates must be high and the virus well managed these countries are likely to be in north america europe and the middle east it is also likely that in the early stages of reopening travellers to and from singapore will have to travel on a point to point itinerary given that travellers will not be allowed to transit in a covid hotspot sia will be a beneficiary from this as many singapore residents are keen to travel after having been cooped up on their tiny island for more than a year and a half furthermore many expat residents are keen to travel home to their friends and family having not seen them for some time on its part sia has been quick to add destinations back to its passenger network in spite of low load factor of around 15 per cent it is thus in a good position to capture any new demand as singapore opens as it can boost passenger numbers and revenue without having to increase flights if the flights are insufficient to meet demand it can add more flights as it has excess crew and aircraft capacity it is also ready to set up new nonstop destinations based on the countries the singapore government has set up travel corridors with including new long haul ones although the speed at which the airline will recover is not certain stock analysts at dbs have upgraded sia shares to a hold from fully valued confident that it will be able to ride out the covid downturn due to its strong balance sheet they reasoned that after multiple rounds of fundraising sia has about sgd 14 billion of pro forma cash balance and that this provides it with a firm buffer to navigate through the current crisis and fund the capital expenditure for its fleet renewal programme ani also read several rockets hit kandahar airport as taliban led violence rages

athletic apparel maker lululemon and two diabetes specialists are poised to get a long term tailwind from the covid 19 pandemic many people at least in developed countries have gained unwanted weight during the pandemic this isn t surprising given that stress and anxiety can cause overeating and cravings for so called comfort foods which tend to be fattening and can also cause some people to drink more alcohol moreover gyms and other places where many folks get exercise were temporarily closed about 42 of americans experienced undesired weight gain during about the first year of the pandemic with the average gain 29 pounds according to the american psychological association s annual stress in america report in that report angela fitch associate director of the massachusetts general hospital weight center and vp of the obesity medicine association was quoted as saying the apa s findings are alarming of course the numbers vary by source but the exact numbers aren t that important what s relevant is that a lot of people have gained undesired weight during the pandemic with much of the weight gain substantial three companies that should get a relatively long lasting tailwind from this pandemic driven weight gain phenomenon are athletic apparel maker lululemon athletica lulu 2 38 and diabetes management companies insulet podd 0 34 and dexcom dxcm 0 09 company market cap forward p e wall street s projected annualized 5 year eps growth 1 year return 10 year return lululemon athletica 52 1 billion 58 28 23 7 561 insulet 18 5 billion 390 111 38 8 1 320 dexcom 49 9 billion 225 18 19 5 3 540 s p 500 37 5 317 lululemon a potentially massive catalyst for growth on the horizon lululemon athletica describes itself as a healthy lifestyle inspired athletic apparel company for yoga running training and most other sweaty pursuits last year the company entered the home connected fitness business through its 500 million acquisition of mirror mirror makes full length mirror like screens that stream on demand and live workout classes and other content for a 39 monthly subscription fee users can also purchase personal training sessions for 40 a pop lululemon s business held up much better last year during the pandemic than those of others in the apparel industry that s thanks to its focus on athleticwear and athleisurewear and the fact that it had an established direct to consumer dtc business its fiscal 2020 ended jan 31 2021 revenue rose 11 to 4 4 billion and its adjusted eps fell just 4 7 to 4 75 with many economies around the world broadly reopening the company s performance has revved up in fiscal 2021 in fiscal q1 february through april lululemon s net revenue soared 88 year over year to 1 2 billion earnings per share eps according to generally accepted accounting principles gaap was 1 11 up from 0 22 in the year ago period and adjusted eps landed at 1 16 a five fold increase for full year fiscal 2021 management expects net revenue to be between 5 825 billion and 5 905 billion which translates to annual growth of 33 at the midpoint it also guided for adjusted eps between 6 73 to 6 86 which translates to annual growth of 43 at the midpoint lululemon has a potentially huge catalyst for growth on the horizon the launch of its own brand of athletic shoes ceo calvin mcdonald said last december that the company plans to introduce its first shoe or shoes in the second half of this year and begin selling them in early 2022 watch out nike the diabetes management companies insulet and dexcom diabetes was already a major health issue in the united states and the world before the pandemic started the coronavirus crisis unfortunately has probably exacerbated the diabetes epidemic because excess weight is a key risk factor for type 2 diabetes given the aforementioned weight gain statistics and other statistics available it seems likely to me that pandemic driven weight gain probably pushed some folks who were previously prediabetic into the diabetic category and pushed some people into the prediabetic category for the first time some of these people might not have ever moved into these worsening health condition categories had the pandemic never occurred fortunately treatments for diabetes have made great progress in recent years there are many companies in the diabetes management business though most are not pure plays among the pure plays insulet and dexcom are attractive stocks insulet makes the leading tubeless insulin pump the omnipod which people with types 1 and 2 diabetes have embraced for its ease of use and comfort dexcom which partners with insulet and others makes a continuous glucose monitoring cgm system its g6 system is currently commercially available though the company recently reported that it had presented strong preliminary data for its next generation g7 cgm system at the international conference on advanced technologies treatments for diabetes conference to be clear all three of these companies already had attractive growth prospects before the pandemic started the crisis has simply increased their growth potential in my view lululemon is probably the best bet for most investors which is why i more heavily focused on it while the medical device space is usually best left to investors with higher risk tolerances

these marijuana companies are entering new markets and making more money than ever before it s a fact of investing life that growth stocks are easier to find in growing industries than in mature or stagnating ones that s why the cannabis industry is one of the first places i look when i m scanning for potential new investments this trio of marijuana companies in particular is worth following in august each is facing a handful of new developments that will shake out over the summer while the stocks i ll discuss today might not be the safest investments in the market they re definitely worth investigating if you re eager for some exposure to growth in the near term 1 trulieve cannabis with its 83 dispensaries in florida and a small but growing number outside the state trulieve cannabis tcnnf 2 97 is one of the fastest growing medicinal cannabis operators in the u s and trulieve s growth is poised to accelerate thanks to its investment in new hubs outside the sunshine state its recent entry into the west virginia market and the scaling up of its wholesale operations in pennsylvania and massachusetts will provide a lot of new opportunities in the near future by the end of this year the company could be making as much as 850 million in revenue that s quite a bit more than its trailing 12 month revenue of 619 3 million and it d be just the start of what management has planned specifically trulieve has an acquisition pending for harvest health recreation another multistate cannabis operator the transaction could close in the third quarter and if it goes through it ll open up an entirely new hub in the southwest region of the u s where trulieve doesn t currently have a presence finally if cannabis is legalized nationwide trulieve is exceptionally well positioned to capture recreational use market share in florida using the same strategy it used in the medicinal market its medicinal cannabis dispensaries cover the vast majority of the state s largest population centers and its stores are already equipped to handle significant ongoing demand from their regular customers so the company doesn t face major barriers to serving additional demand when or if the recreational marijuana market comes online and its extensive retail presence acts as free advertising to build consumer awareness in advance of a change in legislation in short the next few years could be even better than the company s recent breakout from florida and that s worth paying attention to 2 planet 13 planet 13 holdings plnh f is another up and coming cannabis cultivator but unlike trulieve it s a small scale operator that s focused on building out individual superstores like its flagship location near the las vegas strip using the mountain of revenue 63 million generated by that store in 2019 planet 13 is now branching out with a new mega dispensary in santa monica calif which will be its third location in total it has one more in the vegas area as well the california store opened at the start of july so its first revenue should be reported in the company s third quarter update the investment thesis for planet 13 is that it s still extremely small so it will be able to grow very rapidly and make early investors rich over the next few years since the company s current plans call for expanding to reach at least eight superstores in the next five years it wouldn t be surprising if its revenue multiplied several times over before 2025 but even with its las vegas store alone planet 13 should be posting strong revenue growth compared to 2020 as tourism returns in q1 its revenue was up 41 8 year over year and there s a good chance that ll be the slowest growth it reports until 2022 3 tilray multinational cannabis giant tilray tlry 1 70 is perhaps the world s largest marijuana company with its cultivation and distribution footprint spanning north america south america and europe few of its competitors have as broad a reach and thanks to its recent acquisition of aphria it even has a craft beer business that operates in the u s generating 15 9 million in net revenue in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2021 tilray s appeal is that it might be able to leverage economies of scale and favorable tariff rates within the e u to grow and sell cannabis far more cheaply than its competitors likewise its extensive distribution network and supply chain could penetrate markets more rapidly and more deeply than smaller companies can right now it has a leading market share in canada where it reported 222 93 million in trailing revenue as of late may compared with planet 13 and trulieve tilray will likely grow its revenue a bit more slowly in the short term according to its latest earnings report q4 revenue rose to reach 142 23 million in 2021 an increase

singapore august 1 ani last week singapore airlines sia reported a dramatically narrower net loss of sgd 409 million usd 302 million in its first quarter results for the financial year 2021 22 this is an improvement of 63 6 per cent from the record loss of sgd 1 123 million it suffered at the height of the covid 19 pandemic last year as singapore reopens its borders is one of the most admired airlines in the world on its way to wiping away the red ink in its business update published on july 29 singapore s flag carrier revealed that for the quarter that ended in june revenue rose to sgd 1 295 million from sgd 852 million in the corresponding quarter last year an improvement of 52 2 per cent this was mainly led by robust cargo performance and the absence of impairment charges expenditure fell by sgd 319 million or 16 9 per cent to sgd 1 569 million the airline said in its statement that cargo flown revenue grew by sgd 214 million 32 4 per cent as the calibrated resumption in passenger flights contributed to an increase in cargo capacity 46 9 per cent and loads carried 68 2 per cent cargo load factor increased 11 3 percentage points to 89 1 per cent while yields moderated from the exceptionally high levels during the same period last year overall the strong cargo revenue performance for the first quarter reflected the healthy demand fundamentals and an ongoing capacity crunch in the sector sia has no domestic routes and with cross border travel restrictions around the world still very much in place passenger load factor increased at a more modest pace of 4 6 percentage points year on year to 14 8 per cent passenger capacity at the end of the reporting quarter rose to 28 per cent of pre covid levels resulting in passenger flown revenue of sgd 318 million up by sgd 277 million compared with the same period april to june last year when almost all flights were grounded the number of passengers carried by the group for the quarter which included low cost carrier scoot was 362 000 up from 38 000 a year earlier the airline added three new airbus a350s into service in the quarter that just ended and removed two airbus a330s that were on the lease as of june 30 the groups fleet consists of 164 passenger aircraft and seven freighters with an average age of five years and 11 months it has one of the youngest fleets in the airline industry sia projects that passenger capacity will reach 33 per cent of pre pandemic level and that it would serve at least 50 per cent of locations it did before the pandemic by the end of september as global covid 19 vaccination campaigns gather pace the airline hopes that international air travel demand will soon recover however new variants and fresh waves of covid 19 infections in key markets remain a concern it added the recovery trajectory will be dependent on government regulations vaccination rates and the risk profile of individual regulatory authorities sia s planned capacity increase will be helped by the singapore government s plan to treat covid 19 as an endemic disease and strategy to reopen the country to travellers although singapore entered the third lockdown on july 22 which is scheduled to end august 18 the government this week reiterated its plan to gradually allow its residents to return to their pre pandemic lifestyle in some form however this will only be for those who are fully vaccinated which it said are better protected against serious effects of the virus the plan will start taking shape once a high enough proportion of residents are vaccinated and will see a change of emphasis from case numbers to hospitalisation rate the latest lockdown was caused by a spike in covid 19 cases and to ensure a higher portion of its population are vaccinated especially those aged 70 and older the vaccination rate among the elderly was significantly below the national average the authorities expect that around 80 per cent of the population would have been inoculated by early september being fully aware that singapore s status as a business and tourism hub is at stake and dependent on international connectivity the government plans to reopen the city state to international travellers in the coming months it will allow vaccinated people quarantine free access to the country although covid testing may be required it will start by setting up travel corridors with countries or regions that have vaccinated a high percentage of their population and where the infection is under control the number of countries that singapore will open up to is expected to be small initially and based on its condition that vaccination rates must be high and the virus well managed these countries are likely to be in north america europe and the middle east it is also likely that in the early stages of reopening travellers to and from singapore will have to travel on a point to point itinerary given that travellers will not be allowed to transit in a covid hotspot sia will be a beneficiary from this as many singapore residents are keen to travel after having been cooped up on their tiny island for more than a year and a half furthermore many expat residents are keen to travel home to their friends and family having not seen them for some time on its part sia has been quick to add destinations back to its passenger network in spite of low load factor of around 15 per cent it is thus in a good position to capture any new demand as singapore opens as it can boost passenger numbers and revenue without having to increase flights if the flights are insufficient to meet demand it can add more flights as it has excess crew and aircraft capacity it is also ready to set up new nonstop destinations based on the countries the singapore government has set up travel corridors with including new long haul ones although the speed at which the airline will recover is not certain stock analysts at dbs have upgraded sia shares to a hold from fully valued confident that it will be able to ride out the covid downturn due to its strong balance sheet they reasoned that after multiple rounds of fundraising sia has about sgd 14 billion of pro forma cash balance and that this provides it with a firm buffer to navigate through the current crisis and fund the capital expenditure for its fleet renewal programme ani

predicting what the prices of oil and natural gas will be in the next few months requires the weighing of several factors besides just supply and demand oilmen kirk edwards and frosty gilliam economist ray perryman and professor dennis elam say fluctuations of the pandemic the whimsy of opec and opec plus and the policies of the biden administration and the environmental protection agency must also be considered the price of oil will do exactly what saudi arabia wants it to do edwards said for some reason during the pandemic they allowed themselves to keep oil off the market which reduced inventories and steadily let the price go up from 30 a barrel at this time last year to close to 70 today they re trying to limit how much product they put on the world market with all the covid setbacks that there have been in so many different countries and now with the new delta variant coming around we re seeing saudi arabia produce half as much oil as they were a year ago and make the same amount of money edwards said the mideast nation can drop the price right back down to 30 if they want to but luckily we have hedging instruments to protect ourselves with though only for a year or two he said gas prices have been just as volatile falling to minus zero last year but rebounding to around 4 per thousand cubic feet two years ago the price was 1 30 it s been so low for the last four or five years again because the world market was flooded said edwards whose latigo petroleum is heavily invested in gas production in the texas panhandle there s not a lot of gas coming onto the market now and that has caused its price to increase opec plus s july 18 announcement that it would bump monthly production by 400 000 barrels a day fomented a drop from the mid 70s to the upper 60s that had partly corrected to the low 70s by mid week anything they say is probably a lie edwards said they re just trying to keep the permian in check so we don t put out a bunch of rigs asked if the domestic industry has considered cutting production to exert more control on prices he said the texas railroad commission called a meeting of representatives in march last year to discuss prorations but before action could be taken the saudis did it for us they took two million barrels a day off the market thirteen nations belong to the organization of petroleum exporting counties opec plus has 10 more led by russia gilliam said the coronavirus factor will potentially continue to depress travel and projects and indirectly affect fuels and energy which would cause supply to outgain the demand opec always tries to play the role of the leader and they ll want to dictate what the price does he said the political realm certainly trumps a lot of the practical sciences of oil prices supply and demand should dictate it but historically attitude and the perception of what might happen end up weighing heavily all that adds up to a real likelihood of lower prices gilliam said the industry is very uneasy about the biden administration the standard democrat play is to limit drilling and increase regulations which make the cost of doing business increase the aghorn operating president said keeping drilling projects from occurring on federal lands and offshore adds up to a damper on supply and production perryman an odessan whose consulting company is based at waco said the recent oil setback stemmed from the opec plus announcement and a spike in coronavirus cases domestically and abroad as always there is a lot happening in oil markets that creates a lot of noise he said the virus is clearly the biggest wild card at the moment if it reaches the point of substantially slowing global demand growth then the price will likely fall for an extended period we cannot get the economy fully on track till the health crisis is manageable assuming we avoid another widespread surge demand is growing faster than supply even with the opec plus increase and prices should enjoy an upward trend for the next few months global demand is back to about 97 percent of pre pandemic levels and travel and production are both enjoying substantial growth perryman said a new consumption record will happen next year if there isn t another crisis with the virus although the domestic rig count has approximately doubled it remains below prior levels and oil field service employment despite impressive recent gains has only recouped about 20 percent of the lost jobs he said there s a lot of room for growth and the market outlook is positive but as we have said about so many things for so long it all depends on the virus elam is an associate professor of accounting and finance at texas a m university san antonio and an odessa american columnist who writes about the energy industry demand for natural gas in the far east is still on the rise making that market stronger elam said the fact that refiners like valero are turning away from carbon based oil to vegetable oil for so called clean diesel may keep gasoline prices fairly high i expect oil to stage a 50 percent recovery which is where it is today and then fall to the lower 60s in august elam said president biden s order to stop construction on the keystone pipeline from canada caused more expensive rail shipping from the dakotas the great irony is that biden forced gasoline prices higher by shutting down keystone not to mention the epa s general war mongering he said so gasoline goes above 3 just as america comes out of covid when people want to travel now he has to ask the mideast to export more oil and bang we re back to depending on that region again however elam said inflation and a rise in consumer prices may be held down if oil and stocks have peaked and are starting to decline that would be deflationary he said which will it be i m seeing headlines that the economy slows from here and i m guessing that stocks have topped referring to options contracts that give owners the right to sell a certain amount of their underlying assets at a set price within a specific time he said many had sold puts and they had to either buy the puts back or sell futures it looks like they sold futures financial shenanigans have a lot more to do with oil price volatility than supply and demand like this like loading related

without being the instant hit or a legendary wonder like its predecessor the fifth generation toyota supra is diligently working up the performance ladder with what is available from stock that would be a maximum of almost 400 horsepower thanks to the 3 0 liter turbocharged bmw mill but if that s not enough there s always the aftermarket route the greatness behind quarter mile encounters is that owners can easily conceal their modifications under fully stock appearances that seems to be the case with this black toyota supra and its driver who probably thought its turbo wasn t enough so he also went for a shot of nitrous unfortunately beyond that hint we are left without any palpable information during the latest series of drag races shown on the jmalcom2004 account on youtube on the other hand that black supra seemed a bit too familiar so we cross referenced its license plate with a previous encounter featuring a dark toyota and voila it s the same one that was previously showcased going against the ford mustang gt and chevy camaro zl1 on a little drag strip the latter didn t have any ets or trap speeds to relate to but given the easy victories it is easy to put two and two together and have a larger perspective as such we were a bit surprised when seeing the nitrous and turbo toyota supra fight its way up the quarter mile ladder at a more imposing venue it s the middle georgia motorsports park in jeffersonville georgia and even here we had no scoreboard the electronic aid remained mum during the recorded passes well ets and trap speeds be damned that won t stop anyone from having a great time and the victor is easy to make out just be on the lookout for the lateral green light shown next to the winning lane now onto the surprise part the gr supra went against an s197 ford mustang and the battles with the crimson blue oval took place from the 3 05 and 6 40 marks both during the day and late at night then in between came a second generation chevy camaro for an old school vs new age skirmish at the 3 45 mark yes in the end the supra prevailed across the board but the mustang and camaro looked so close to delivering an unexpected result or was it just the angle of the camera

they did in 2019 versus a brutal 2020 can we keep up the momentum and avoid a summer slowdown as the delta variant of the coronavirus spreads frankly that s hard to predict though full lockdowns like we saw last year are highly unlikely but even if we do see a summer swoon in the stock market there s one thing we can predict with a lot of confidence investing in top stocks is almost a lock to be the best way for individual investors to create wealth the key not getting caught up in what will happen next month next quarter or even next year and instead focusing on finding great companies you can buy now and own for years to come to help you get started we asked a panel of top motley fool contributors for their top stocks to buy that can deliver many years of big returns keep reading below to find out their best ideas right now this insuretech start up is no lemon jason hall lemonade if you already own shares of insurance start up lemonade lmnd 2 37 there s a broad range of outcomes you might have experienced including being up as much as 70 or being down more than half that s because by and large investors aren t really sure what to make of the company which only went public late last year is it an insurer is it a tech company frankly it s both but there s something lemonade is doing that s even more important than the technology it s building in short lemonade s biggest disruption is creating better alignment between its own financial incentives and those of its customers as a result the company says it has less incentive to delay paying or to reject claims resulting in faster payments and improved customer service while customers don t feel pressure to exaggerate claims as a certified b corporation lemonade is also a socially responsible company something that s attractive to many of its customers who skew younger as a result i think lemonade has enormous staying power customers show up to get insurance in minutes or even seconds but i expect they will stay for many years to come and in growing numbers due to the company s disruption of the traditional model and rebuilding the financial incentives so that it and its customers are more aligned than any other insurer on earth a winning movie theater stock for real anders bylund imax when larger than life cinema technologist imax imax 0 78 reported second quarter results near the end of july the analyst stumping business update cemented my earlier view of this company if you want to find a long term winner in the movie theater sector imax is your best bet imax saw second quarter sales of 51 million up from 8 9 million in the coronavirus burdened equivalent period of 2020 the company reported an adjusted net loss of 0 12 per share much stronger than the year ago period s 0 44 loss per share your average analyst would have settled for a deeper net loss near 0 30 per share on revenue in the neighborhood of 40 6 million ninety percent of all imax theaters are back in operation gross profit margin bounced back to 50 2 up from a negative 87 in the second quarter of 2020 and roughly comparable to imax s gross profit margin in the pre pandemic era that s the beauty of imax s asset light business model where most of the revenue comes from high margin technology license payments this company generally doesn t own the super sized screens and surround sound systems you experience in an imax theater the massive costs of building and maintaining those expensive assets fall to imax s customers usually as part of their normal multi screen theater venues i find it kind of funny that imax shares are underperforming the s p 500 market index over the last two years while the financial house of cards known as amc entertainment holdings more than tripled over the same period imax is a high quality business that should be able to move on and form new partnerships to fill the customer shaped void if and when amc finally goes bankrupt in short imax is spring loaded for great returns when market makers realize how rare it is to find a rock solid business in the crumbling movie theater sector the stock is a great long term investment right now a reit that could be a big winner of the reopening matt frankel cfp epr properties as we head into august one stock i m keeping a close eye on is epr properties epr 3 91 a real estate investment trust or reit that invests in experiential properties think movie theaters ski resorts waterparks golf attractions and more the company owns 354 properties leased to more than 200 tenants in 44 u s states and canada epr s future profitability was looking a little uncertain earlier this year as movie theaters account for 46 of its contractual rental income and amc entertainment is epr s top tenant but thanks to the massive reddit fueled run up in amc s stock price the company has been able to raise about 2 billion in fresh capital and its future and ability to pay rent is no longer in question in fact epr recently announced the resumption of its monthly dividend payments due to the increasing stability of its tenant base and the stock now yields nearly 6 going forward epr plans to resume growth as it has nearly 1 5 billion in liquidity including 538 million in cash a large amount for a company whose entire market cap is less than 4 billion management sees a massive 100 billion investable universe of properties it could add to the portfolio to take advantage of americans desire to get out and have experiences and i d have to imagine that given the stress of the pandemic epr is looking forward to increasing exposure to non theater properties in short there are many real estate stocks that stand to benefit as the pandemic continues to wind down in the u s but with the most experiential focus of any reit epr could be one of the biggest winners a winner in every outcome dan caplinger moderna rising biotech star moderna mrna 4 00 has been on a big roll over the past year as the rapid development of its mrna 1273 covid 19 vaccine was a game changer in the fight against the pandemic the success of the vaccine has helped moderna s stock more than quadruple over the past year and that earned the biotech company an invitation to join the s p 500 index going forward some investors had worried that once the pandemic was under control moderna s biggest revenue driver would disappear however many u s investors have underestimated the global demand for moderna s vaccines in areas that will be slower to get access moreover the emergence of the delta variant has made it more likely that vaccine booster shots might be necessary in the future which would be a new source of revenue for moderna most importantly moderna s experience with covid 19 has been a massive proof of concept of the science underlying its mrna treatment development strategy going forward moderna will have plenty of opportunities to make medical advances with other diseases the sky s the limit for moderna and even once the pandemic is under control worldwide the biotech s prospects aren t going away anytime soon the structural shortage of housing is real tyler crowe green brick partners the scars of the financial crisis over a decade ago still run deep in this economy particularly in wall street s attitude toward homebuilders there is constant chatter about whether we are in a housing bubble right now but that may not be the question we should be asking the question we should be asking ourselves right now is how can we make up for over a decade of underinvestment in the housing sector there is only one answer really build more houses for investors this could be an incredible time to buy an up and coming homebuilder such as green brick partners grbk 4 02 despite its smaller size a market cap of about 1 2 billion at the time of this writing green brick posts some incredibly impressive operating numbers with one of the best gross margins in the business as well as a low amount of debt this gives it ample room to continue to grow at its recent blistering pace over the past five years fully diluted earnings per share is up 478 there is always a reason why investors aren t big on

by lee kah whyesingapore august 1 ani last week singapore airlines sia reported a dramatically narrower net loss of sgd 409 million usd 302 million in its first quarter results for the financial year 2021 22 this is an improvement of 63 6 per cent from the record loss of sgd 1 123 million it suffered at the height of the covid 19 pandemic last year as singapore reopens its borders is one of the most admired airlines in the world on its way to wiping away the red ink in its business update published on july 29 singapore s flag carrier revealed that for the quarter that ended in june revenue rose to sgd 1 295 million from sgd 852 million in the corresponding quarter last year an improvement of 52 2 per cent this was mainly led by robust cargo performance and the absence of impairment charges expenditure fell by sgd 319 million or 16 9 per cent to sgd 1 569 million the airline said in its statement that cargo flown revenue grew by sgd 214 million 32 4 per cent as the calibrated resumption in passenger flights contributed to an increase in cargo capacity 46 9 per cent and loads carried 68 2 per cent cargo load factor increased 11 3 percentage points to 89 1 per cent while yields moderated from the exceptionally high levels during the same period last year overall the strong cargo revenue performance for the first quarter reflected the healthy demand fundamentals and an ongoing capacity crunch in the sector sia has no domestic routes and with cross border travel restrictions around the world still very much in place passenger load factor increased at a more modest pace of 4 6 percentage points year on year to 14 8 per cent passenger capacity at the end of the reporting quarter rose to 28 per cent of pre covid levels resulting in passenger flown revenue of sgd 318 million up by sgd 277 million compared with the same period april to june last year when almost all flights were grounded the number of passengers carried by the group for the quarter which included low cost carrier scoot was 362 000 up from 38 000 a year earlier the airline added three new airbus a350s into service in the quarter that just ended and removed two airbus a330s that were on the lease as of june 30 the groups fleet consists of 164 passenger aircraft and seven freighters with an average age of five years and 11 months it has one of the youngest fleets in the airline industry sia projects that passenger capacity will reach 33 per cent of pre pandemic level and that it would serve at least 50 per cent of locations it did before the pandemic by the end of september as global covid 19 vaccination campaigns gather pace the airline hopes that international air travel demand will soon recover however new variants and fresh waves of covid 19 infections in key markets remain a concern it added the recovery trajectory will be dependent on government regulations vaccination rates and the risk profile of individual regulatory authorities sia s planned capacity increase will be helped by the singapore government s plan to treat covid 19 as an endemic disease and strategy to reopen the country to travellers although singapore entered the third lockdown on july 22 which is scheduled to end august 18 the government this week reiterated its plan to gradually allow its residents to return to their pre pandemic lifestyle in some form however this will only be for those who are fully vaccinated which it said are better protected against serious effects of the virus the plan will start taking shape once a high enough proportion of residents are vaccinated and will see a change of emphasis from case numbers to hospitalisation rate the latest lockdown was caused by a spike in covid 19 cases and to ensure a higher portion of its population are vaccinated especially those aged 70 and older the vaccination rate among the elderly was significantly below the national average the authorities expect that around 80 per cent of the population would have been inoculated by early september being fully aware that singapore s status as a business and tourism hub is at stake and dependent on international connectivity the government plans to reopen the city state to international travellers in the coming months it will allow vaccinated people quarantine free access to the country although covid testing may be required it will start by setting up travel corridors with countries or regions that have vaccinated a high percentage of their population and where the infection is under control the number of countries that singapore will open up to is expected to be small initially and based on its condition that vaccination rates must be high and the virus well managed these countries are likely to be in north america europe and the middle east it is also likely that in the early stages of reopening travellers to and from singapore will have to travel on a point to point itinerary given that travellers will not be allowed to transit in a covid hotspot sia will be a beneficiary from this as many singapore residents are keen to travel after having been cooped up on their tiny island for more than a year and a half furthermore many expat residents are keen to travel home to their friends and family having not seen them for some time on its part sia has been quick to add destinations back to its passenger network in spite of low load factor of around 15 per cent it is thus in a good position to capture any new demand as singapore opens as it can boost passenger numbers and revenue without having to increase flights if the flights are insufficient to meet demand it can add more flights as it has excess crew and aircraft capacity it is also ready to set up new nonstop destinations based on the countries the singapore government has set up travel corridors with including new long haul ones although the speed at which the airline will recover is not certain stock analysts at dbs have upgraded sia shares to a hold from fully valued confident that it will be able to ride out the covid downturn due to its strong balance sheet they reasoned that after multiple rounds of fundraising sia has about sgd 14 billion of pro forma cash balance and that this provides it with a firm buffer to navigate through the current crisis and fund the capital expenditure for its fleet renewal programme ani

their underlying businesses are just as attractive as their dividends some stocks take a long time to make any money that s one reason many investors like dividend stocks they begin paying you back almost immediately not every dividend stock though provides both an attractive dividend and solid growth prospects the ones that do can give you returns over the short run and the long term here are three dividend stocks that could make you richer in august and beyond brookfield renewable brookfield renewable bep 4 11 bepc 4 65 offers a dividend that yields close to 3 the yield is a little higher if you buy shares of the limited partnership bep and a little lower if you buy shares of the corporation bepc but both stocks reflect the same underlying business and that business is going strong the company ranks as one of the world s leading providers of renewable energy brookfield renewable owns and operates hydroelectric wind solar and storage facilities on four continents delivering strong growth shouldn t be a problem for brookfield renewable countries and major corporations across the world are aggressively pushing to reduce carbon emissions these efforts should continue to drive demand for renewable energy brookfield renewable plans to take advantage of this increased demand it has a 27 000 megawatt development pipeline that s more than double its current capacity the company expects to generate average annual returns of around 15 over the long term i think brookfield renewable will be able to achieve that goal enterprise products partners you ll probably really love enterprise products partners epd 0 38 dividend the midstream energy company s dividend yield currently stands at nearly 7 8 enterprise has increased its distribution for 22 consecutive years i also think you might like the company s growth prospects enterprise products partners has seen its business rebound after getting hit hard by the covid 19 shutdowns last year in the company s recent second quarter conference call co ceo jim teague said that the company expects a very strong extended recovery cycle enterprise should complete two major projects in the fourth quarter of this year its gillis natural gas pipeline will connect the production of haynesville shale with liquid natural gas lng markets in southwest louisiana the company also anticipates wrapping up construction of a natural gasoline treatment facility in texas both projects should be growth drivers for enterprise over the near term but what about the long term while renewable energy sources will be key to reducing carbon emissions natural gas natural gas liquids and lower sulfur crude oil will also be important enterprise plans to take an all of the above approach that should keep revenue and earnings growing for years to come innovative industrial properties how would you like a dividend that has quadrupled over the past three years that s exactly what innovative industrial properties iipr 4 95 dividend has done iip s dividend yields close to 2 7 the yield would be a lot higher but the company s shares have skyrocketed even faster than its dividend has iip is a real estate investment trust reit that focuses on the u s medical cannabis market three years ago the company owned nine properties in seven states that were leased to medical cannabis operators today iip s portfolio includes 72 properties in 18 states there s still a lot of room for iip to grow many of the markets where the company currently operates continue to expand at a fast pace and iip doesn t yet own properties in nearly half of the states that have legalized medical cannabis some might worry that potential federal cannabis reform could increase competition for iip that could happen however i think it would also expand the market opportunity even more for this reit in my view iip is an ideal stock to buy if you re looking for great dividends along with robust growth
data and the vaccination timeline support the idea of a new jab now the big question these days is this do we need coronavirus booster shots right now u s health authorities weighed in with a no earlier this month the centers for disease control and prevention and the u s food and drug administration fda in a joint statement said those who are vaccinated are protected against severe illness even illness caused by the highly transmissible delta variant at the same time vaccine leader pfizer pfe 1 72 aims to apply for emergency use authorization of its booster in august the booster is a third dose of its authorized vaccine can regulators possibly change their minds and give pfizer the go ahead well four words from pfizer ceo albert bourla signal the authorization of a booster shot may be right around the corner in spite of health authorities recent statement january and february vaccinations the clock is ticking bourla said during the pfizer earnings call this week he referred to countries that vaccinated heavily in january and february pfizer considers a booster is needed six to 12 months after full vaccination for maximum protection against coronavirus especially considering the presence of the delta variant this means that for people vaccinated early in the year the ideal time for the booster is right now israel aggressively vaccinated early on and the country today is rolling out its booster program the plan is to offer third doses to everyone age 60 and older now let s look at u s vaccination trends vaccine administration peaked on april 8 with more than 4 million doses administered daily but vaccinations actually were already happening at a healthy rate as of late february by then vaccinations had reached more than 3 million doses administered daily it s fair to say a good share of americans went for a jab between february and april and that means they re due for a booster between now and october the data supports that timeline israel has relied on pfizer for its vaccination program and the country has been carefully tracking performance israel s most recent real world data show the vaccine s efficacy dropped to 39 in coronavirus prevention again it s important to keep in mind that most people received the vaccine early in the year the good news but here s the good news it looks like the booster can set things right pfizer estimates a 100 fold increase in neutralizing antibody levels after the third dose compared to before the third dose that s in people who received full vaccination more than six months earlier neutralizing antibodies are key to blocking the virus the u s vaccination timeline and booster data back up bourla s comment that means a booster should be imminent but there is one final factor that enters the mix and that s the word from u s health authorities as mentioned earlier they aren t yet ready to recommend a booster should pfizer and pfizer s investors worry not necessarily pfizer hasn t yet submitted booster data to the fda regulators may change their view on the timing of a booster after examining pfizer s trial results and the coronavirus situation is rapidly evolving for example the seven day moving average of cases was about 13 400 on june 30 today it s at more than 66 000 a statement made in early july might no longer apply a month later of course it s impossible to predict whether the fda will give pfizer the nod for a third dose booster but the overall picture supports pfizer s case so what happens if and when a third dose wins authorization the potential authorization of a booster isn t likely to add to revenue immediately the u s just placed an order for an additional 200 million pfizer vaccine doses to be delivered through april of next year that brings the total u s order so far to 500 million doses if the fda authorizes a third dose this existing supply likely will suffice for now but the need for three doses instead of two may lead to bigger orders down the road and that means pfizer s days of growing vaccine revenue have only just begun

ingredients dishes and treats to try the oriental pantry moore st dublin 1 i tend to go here for my caribbean ingredients caribbean cooking through the course of empire has fingerprints and echoes of west african food and culture under one roof you ll find numerous nations represented by their food the selection of fruits vegetables herbs spices and locally sourced fish and meat is unlike anywhere in the country in terms of variety and selection upon entry you re first greeted by a small but constant queue of patrons waiting for a snack from the brazilian hot food counter if you too are stopped by the sight of a trove of fried snacks try the pastel or coxinha forms of fried dough traditionally filled with meat and cheese and the brazilian soft drink guaraná is the perfect complement to wash it all down as for groceries plantains will always be on the shelves both ripe and unripe and are well worth experimenting with botanically similar to the banana the plantain has a high starch content which gives it a potato like quality however you cannot eat it raw my preference is unripe thinly sliced and sprinkled with salt if they re green and hard to the touch cook them as you would a potato fried like chips and crisps boiled roasted and mashed the ripened plantain is sweet yellow and squidgy you can make a really tropical purée from this by boiling it in some coconut milk and blending it diced and fried with some roasted meat would take the form of a more traditional meal polonez moore st dublin 1 in true polish tradition cheese these treasure troves have smoked meats and pickled

spices to add to your larder try sumac which has a lemon tang to it almost like a sherbet note to it and is perfect with chicken fish and vegetables all spice aka pimento is also worth trying and the

leaf but with a sweet tone i love to experiment with different types of vinegars and fermented seasonings i use a coconut vinegar in my cooking a lot as it has less acidic bite to it look out for

expectations quarterly revenue surpassed 1 billion at 1 11 billion and quarterly profits climbed according to the shopify press release net income for the second quarter of 2021 was 879 1 million or 6 90 per diluted share compared with net income of 36 0 million or 0 29 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2020 q2 2021 net income includes a 778 million unrealized net gain on our equity investments shopify earned 2 24 per share on an adjusted basis in the quarter ended june 30 including gains on equity investments up 113 from a year earlier shopify sets up e commerce websites for small businesses and also enables digital payments and shipping the company is number two in north america with respect to e commerce services behind the behemoth amazon it s estimated about 10 of all e commerce traffic in the u s goes through stores hosted by shopify second only to amazon com inc s 39 on my site i provided an example of how shopify enabled a canadian craft brewer not only to navigate and pivot during the early days of the pandemic the etobicoke ont company actually increased sales and profits thanks to shopify the company now has the greatest weighting on the toronto stock exchange it s the most valuable company in canada having surpassed royal bank of canada for that title given its incredible success that stock can certainly drive the market indices if you take a dividend approach you re missing out on this incredible growth story readers will know that i m a big fan of the juicy dividend slant for canadian stocks but we might also include the growth kicker of the burgeoning canadian tech sector that includes many incredible success stories although shopify almost dominates that index etf it has been reported that ceo tobias lütke is now the richest canadian according to the globe and mail paywall mr lutke s stake in the e commerce software provider is now worth us 13 3 billion or 16 7 billion in canadian dollars in addition stock sale records show mr lutke has generated gross proceeds of us 490 million since the beginning of 2020 by selling shopify shares his ownership stake likely makes mr lutke the richest canadian and it certainly makes him the wealthiest canadian company founder who has created his own fortune it has taken shopify and 40 year old mr lutke just 16 years to amass his billions his stake was worth around us 2 billion just over two years ago the stock fell 1 1 on the earnings release and continued to fall on thursday and into friday as i write this post in the bigger picture it s up some 355 from the beginning of 2020 will shopify be another tech darling flash in the pan canadians and canadian markets have been burned in the past by nortel and blackberry one crash and burn by nortel and a crash and fizzle by blackberry it remains to be seen if the company has sustainable moats canadian retail sales are back up after two monthly declines it may be no surprise that retail sales continued to struggle in may as much of the country continued with some form of in person shopping restrictions retail sales in canada declined for the second month in a row after two straight months of gains it has been more than a rocky road of recovery post covid canadian retailers have not been able to gain any traction as they ve had to experience an open and shut environment thanks to lockdowns put in place to battle the pandemic spread the 2 1 decline in retail sales in may came as many retailers continued to face those closures during the third wave of the pandemic ctv news reported for may the biggest drop was recorded at building material and garden equipment and supplies dealers which fell 11 3 sales in the clothing and clothing accessories category declined 11 2 with nearly a quarter shuttered for an average of six days during the month within the subsector clothing stores saw an 11 6 decrease in sales falling to their lowest level since may 2020 apparel sales have continued to languish throughout the pandemic and have been largely impacted by changes in consumer behaviour said we are hopeful that this sector will rebound in the months ahead as offices reopen and people return to work and as expected as restrictions were lifted we started to see some very positive retail numbers in the financial post based on preliminary estimates the good news is that provincial re openings mostly began in june with the positive impact on retail sales reflected in statistics canada s preliminary estimate rishi sondhi an economist at toronto dominion bank said in a report to investors as capacity constraints on retailers have further loosened in july another gain is likely in the cards and june mobility numbers offered a bright light for malls and retailers the june sales estimate is in line with positive employment numbers for the same month showing a gain of 230 700 jobs mobile phone data also showed foot traffic in clothing retailers was up 44 in june from 2019 levels suggesting canadians are eager for in person shopping but perhaps our spending patterns have changed forever here is a lighthearted post on what we re never spending money on again in some cases we might revolt against the forced covid spending patterns while on the other hand we ve learned to live without many of life s extravagant trappings it will be more than interesting to watch the spending patterns of canadians coming out of the pandemic i will be keeping score in this space this tweet suggests that the move is on to buy experiences and fun we can t wait to leave the house i write this post from charlottetown p e i we were out for a patio dinner last night and the restaurants were full inside and out and victoria row the vibrant restaurant and entertainment hub was bursting with energy and joy with canadians enjoying their freedom there was hardly a mask in sight masks are optional indoors it was a great feeling to get somewhat back to normal of course the east coast and especially p e i has done a great job of keeping the pandemic at bay here s my tweet as we entered the island we had to preregister provide proof of double vaccination and we were also tested at the checkpoint p e i covid checkpoint we get tested too pic twitter com nc21aip6d3 cutthecrapinvesting 67dodge july 29 2021 one step closer to earnings peak last week our look continuing at earnings season queried whether this one might deliver earnings peak growth rates here s another chock full report courtesy of schwab are we one step closer to peak earnings growth from that post in what shaped up to be a very impressive first half of the year for both the economy and stock market stellar earnings growth has been a key ingredient coming off stronger than expected s p 500 earnings growth of 53 year year in the first quarter second quarter earnings are currently anticipated to grow by 78 the highest since 2009 though less than half of companies have reported the expected growth rate is already higher than the initial consensus estimate of 65 as was also the case in the first quarter the beat rate the percentage of companies reporting earnings growth higher than analysts estimates remains quite high at 89 in a typical quarter since 1994 66 of companies beat estimates and over the past four quarters the beat rate has been 83 in that post you ll see a fascinating table with the recent earnings growth and the estimated earnings growth by sector moving forward for the quarter to the end of 2022 the table shows the overall earning growth rate by quarter and the estimated growth rate decline after this q2 reporting period even more interesting is the sector breakdown we see those cyclicals especially energy leading the charge over the next many quarters projections for the energy sector are at 1076 6 for the full year fy 21 and 29 6 for 2022 fy 22 industrials and consumer discretionary stocks also lead the projections for the remainder of 2021 and 2022 there might still be potential value in those sectors as for the overall u s market move that schwab post shows how stock prices can soften along with earnings growth and while the market is certainly more than expensive the post provides a chart demonstrating that robust earnings growth can help to bring down those excessive valuations but that is a tall order given the current valuation levels right now we have a negative real inflation adjusted earnings yield for u s stocks this tweet shows how the mega techs while expensive continue to deliver on the earnings front but they have reached what appears to be a near term

chinese stocks continue to fall as the chinese communist party ccp cracks down on many national and foreign business interests emerging markets led by china offer incredible diversification and growth

2021 22 this is an improvement of 63 6 per cent from the record loss of sgd 1 123 million it suffered at the height of the covid 19 pandemic last year as singapore reopens its borders is one of the most admired airlines in the world on its way to wiping away the red ink in its business update published on july 29 singapore s flag carrier revealed that for the quarter that ended in june revenue rose to sgd 1 295 million from sgd 852 million in the corresponding quarter last year an improvement of 52 2 per cent this was mainly led by robust cargo performance and the absence of impairment charges expenditure fell by sgd 319 million or 16 9 per cent to sgd 1 569 million the airline said in its statement that cargo flown revenue grew by sgd 214 million 32 4 per cent as the calibrated resumption in passenger flights contributed to an increase in cargo capacity 46 9 per cent and loads carried 68 2 per cent cargo load factor increased 11 3 percentage points to 89 1 per cent while yields moderated from the exceptionally high levels during the same period last year overall the strong cargo revenue performance for the first quarter reflected the healthy demand fundamentals and an ongoing capacity crunch in the sector sia has no domestic routes and with cross border travel restrictions around the world still very much in place passenger load factor increased at a more modest pace of 4 6 percentage points year on year to 14 8 per cent passenger capacity at the end of the reporting quarter rose to 28 per cent of pre covid levels resulting in passenger flown revenue of sgd 318 million up by sgd 277 million compared with the same period april to june last year when almost all flights were grounded the number of passengers carried by the group for the quarter which included low cost carrier scoot was 362 000 up from 38 000 a year earlier the airline added three new airbus a350s into service in the quarter that just ended and removed two airbus a330s that were on the lease as of june 30 the groups fleet consists of 164 passenger aircraft and seven freighters with an average age of five years and 11 months it has one of the youngest fleets in the airline industry sia projects that passenger capacity will reach 33 per cent of pre pandemic level and that it would serve at least 50 per cent of locations it did before the pandemic by the end of september as global covid 19 vaccination campaigns gather pace the airline hopes that international air travel demand will soon recover however new variants and fresh waves of covid 19 infections in key markets remain a concern it added the recovery trajectory will be dependent on government regulations vaccination rates and the risk profile of individual regulatory authorities sia s planned capacity increase will be helped by the singapore government s plan to treat covid 19 as an endemic disease and strategy to reopen the country to travellers although singapore entered the third lockdown on july 22 which is scheduled to end august 18 the government this week reiterated its plan to gradually allow its residents to return to their pre pandemic lifestyle in some form however this will only be for those who are fully vaccinated which it said are better protected against serious effects of the virus the plan will start taking shape once a high enough proportion of residents are vaccinated and will see a change of emphasis from case numbers to hospitalisation rate the latest lockdown was caused by a spike in covid 19 cases and to ensure a higher portion of its population are vaccinated especially those aged 70 and older the vaccination rate among the elderly was significantly below the national average the authorities expect that around 80 per cent of the population would have been inoculated by early september being fully aware that singapore s status as a business and tourism hub is at stake and dependent on international connectivity the government plans to reopen the city state to international travellers in the coming months it will allow vaccinated people quarantine free access to the country although covid testing may be required it will start by setting up travel corridors with countries or regions that have vaccinated a high percentage of their population and where the infection is under control the number of countries that singapore will open up to is expected to be small initially and based on its condition that vaccination rates must be high and the virus well managed these countries are likely to be in north america europe and the middle east it is also likely that in the early stages of reopening travellers to and from singapore will have to travel on a point to point itinerary given that travellers will not be allowed to transit in a covid hotspot sia will be a beneficiary from this as many singapore residents are keen to travel after having been cooped up on their tiny island for more than a year and a half furthermore many expat residents are keen to travel home to their friends and family having not seen them for some time on its part sia has been quick to add destinations back to its passenger network in spite of low load factor of around 15 per cent it is thus in a good position to capture any new demand as singapore opens as it can boost passenger numbers and revenue without having to increase flights if the flights are insufficient to meet demand it can add more flights as it has excess crew and aircraft capacity it is also ready to set up new nonstop destinations based on the countries the singapore government has set up travel corridors with including new long haul ones although the speed at which the airline will recover is not certain stock analysts at dbs have upgraded sia shares to a hold from fully valued confident that it will be able to ride out the covid downturn due to its strong balance sheet they reasoned that after multiple rounds of fundraising sia has about sgd 14 billion of pro forma cash balance and that this provides it with a firm buffer to navigate through the current crisis and fund the capital expenditure for its fleet renewal programme ani
in the five years preceding retirement a person will make more important decisions about how to maximize their retirement than at any other time why because these decisions are not easily altered and the impact will affect important income and expenses for the rest of their lives making the right decisions can provide substantially more income over a longer period of time which is the ultimate goal millions of people must make these decisions annually approximately 2 million baby boomers have been retiring every year since the oldest turned 65 in 2011 to effectively prepare for a retirement free of financial worry here are five important decisions pre retirees will need to master to be prepared for a confident retirement know how much you need to retire for most retirees this is the critical question they need to answer it drives all other decisions as your number depends on your spending level investment returns tax rate and how long you expect to live subscribe to kiplinger s personal finance be a smarter better informed investor save up to 74 sign up for kiplinger s free e newsletters profit and prosper with the best of expert advice on investing taxes retirement personal finance and more straight to your e mail profit and prosper with the best of expert advice straight to your e mail sign up to help determine your number start by projecting your spending needs in retirement make a list of all current expenses as well as anticipated future needs for example you may want to purchase a new car every five years or deposit 10 000 annually into a 529 college savings account for your grandchildren next take into consideration your sources of income in retirement income from sources such as pensions part time work and social security will first be applied to offset your expenses leaving a remaining portion to be covered by your savings and investments for example say a couple retiring at age 67 plans to spend 100 000 annually in retirement they will receive a pension of 25 000 annually and combined social security income of 25 000 annually to meet the remaining 50 000 of retirement needs our couple would need a portfolio of approximately 2 million in assets a portfolio of this size will cover their ongoing expenses at a conservative withdrawal rate of 4 while the remaining principal continues to grow and can be passed on to their heirs examine your asset allocation and fees to maximize your portfolio s long term potential to produce income it s critical that your investments are not too aggressive or too conservative as people grow older they tend to place more money in cash and bonds and less in stocks this can be a prudent strategy since a person nearing retirement has less time to recover from potential losses however by cutting back too much on growth investments like stocks retirees may cheat themselves out of the investment returns needed to preserve growth and maintain purchasing power most retirees plan to live off their investments for 30 years or more and the amount allocated annually for spending needs to be indexed for inflation i often advise clients to continue to invest 40 to 60 of their investment portfolio in stocks even after they retire to overcome the long term drag of inflation in addition excessive fees are a sneaky culprit eroding important returns to protect against this risk analyze all fees paid to your advisers custodians and mutual fund families and while fees are an important consideration make certain your financial adviser is providing the appropriate value for the services you receive optimize social security elections more than 64 million americans now receive social security optimizing these benefits can have a significant impact on your annual income during retirement while most retirees are aware of the reduction in benefits from taking them too early few understand the compounding impact of deferring social security benefits for each year your benefit is deferred beyond your normal retirement age your benefits will increase 8 annually for example one person scheduled to receive 25 000 annually in social security benefits at their full retirement age of 66 instead will receive 33 000 annually if they wait until age 70 for a married couple the benefit is even greater as a surviving spouse is able to retain the higher social security benefits for their lifetime as well there are hundreds of different filing strategies for social security astute financial advisers have the ability to triangulate the optimal strategy before the first person reaches age 62 review your social security options with a financial adviser and develop a plan to optimize these benefits project retirement outcomes for the rest of your life your money should last longer than you do before calling it quits from your career engage a financial adviser to develop a year by year cash flow projection we recommend to age 95 as well as the order each asset should be tapped this exercise will help you understand the impact of your sources of retirement income how expenses are allocated and where investment returns contribute to your long term success and here s another benefit by stress testing these projections against past results you will see the probability of your outcomes nothing is better than stepping into retirement with a high probability of trust to take the first step explore the final contributions to your retirement plan whether selling your business or looking to maximize the value of stock options the potential of facing a large one time tax bill exists at the onset of retirement to protect your hard earned retirement capital make sure to fully contribute to 401 k and other qualified aka tax deferred retirement plan s by your retirement date by accelerating things such as your 401 k deferrals you can top off your retirement savings and lower your income ahead of a taxable event for small business owners with these plans there is a unique opportunity to use some cash flow from their business to maximize their profit sharing and defined benefit contributions in the year they sell their business for example a dentist who sells their practice mid year can save a significant amount of money in taxes by making a 50 000 contribution to their profit sharing plan they can save close to 20 000 in taxes assuming a 40 combined federal and state tax rate no matter your situation taking the time in the five years before retirement to explore all possible options and make the right financial decisions can result in hundreds of thousands of dollars in extra income over the course of your retirement years that difference will enable a retiree to enjoy these years without worry while also leaving plenty of assets for their heirs

a surge of covid 19 patients is testing the staff and resources of hospitals in terrebonne and lafourche parishes officials say demand has sometimes exceeded the supply of available intensive care beds which are also occupied by patients with other ailments and staffing shortages at some hospitals have exacerbated the problem officials at the major hospitals in both parishes agree at least one thing would help them deal with the influx of covid patients i want to echo the fact that people get out and get vaccinated thibodaux regional health system ceo greg stock said in an interview friday it s a wise thing to do so far that has been a tough sell as of friday just under 30 of terrebonne residents and 33 in lafourche were fully vaccinated some of the lowest rates in the state and nation meanwhile the area has posted some of the country s highest increases in covid 19 infections fueled by the virus s more contagious delta variant state and federal data show over the past two weeks more than 1 200 cases have been reported in terrebonne and 1 500 in lafourche more gov edwards considering mask mandate as la sees fastest covid 19 spread yet many of those patients have ended up in local hospitals average daily occupancy exceeded 80 of the total beds at chabert thibodaux regional and terrebonne general medical centers for the week ending july 16 according to the most recent data from the u s department of health and human services pandemic of the unvaccinated across louisiana people who are unvaccinated or not fully vaccinated accounted for 90 of new covid infections and 85 of deaths from the virus for the week ending july 21 state health department figures show those not fully vaccinated accounted for 89 of the patients hospitalized statewide friday we talked with you a few days ago about the fourth surge and we are seeing that surge escalating ochsner health system ceo warner thomas said during a media briefing friday afternoon as we have said before this has evolved to a pandemic of the unvaccinated yes there are a few breakthrough cases but it s very small compared to the total number of folks that we re seeing at our hospitals last wednesday all 79 icu beds in the houma thibodaux region were occupied forcing some hospitals to send patients elsewhere some as far as baton rouge and rapides parish state health officials said region 3 includes assumption lafourche st charles st james st john st mary and terrebonne parishes thibodaux regional medical center has two critical care units one with 30 beds and the other with 16 at noon friday the hospital had 20 30 patients in those beds including 13 with covid 19 stock said turning away patients there have been instances in recent days however in which patients were in the emergency room waiting for a spot in the critical care unit he said there have also been occasions when the medical center was unable to accept transfers and had to divert those patients to other hospitals thibodaux regional has a high employee retention rate but has nonetheless had to bring in some contract workers to handle the covid influx stock said more what you need to know as covid 19 cases surge locally and across louisiana at midday friday terrebonne general health system officials said the houma hospital did have capacity in its critical care unit however challenges such as staffing have made keeping up difficult as some employees have tested positive for covid 19 not all of the icu beds are occupied with covid patients as other critical care patients need those beds too terrebonne general health system is taking a proactive approach and is continuously monitoring staffing and bed availability that allows us to handle a surge of patients a terrebonne general spokesperson told the courier and daily comet in a prepared statement we offer innovative solutions to our staff to encourage teamwork and support while they receive the rest they need to provide exceptional health care staffing shortages terrebonne general is short of both nurses and nurses aides covid 19 affects all staff because when a person is positive and has to be out they are quarantined for at least ten days the spokesperson said ochsner s bayou region which includes chabert medical center in houma and st anne hospital in raceland handled 74 new covid cases friday a 7 increase in two days thomas said ochsner saw 643 new covid patients across its louisiana health care system friday up 17 in two days we re well over a 700 increase in the past month thomas said more with pregnant covid 19 patients up ochsner experts dispel myths about vaccine meanwhile more than 520 ochsner employees are quarantined after testing positive for covid 19 creating more pressure on workers who are staffing the hospitals chief medical officer dr robert hart said ochsner hospitals are at or near capacity and are continuing to reschedule elective procedures we are putting off surgeries that require overnight stays hart said thomas said the covid influx is affecting the care hospitals can offer to other patients this was avoidable we are not seeing this in other areas with higher vaccination rates thomas said the situation is escalating it is not getting better it is getting worse emily enfinger and kezia setyawan are reporters for the courier and the daily comet email emily at eenfinger gannett com

2021 22 this is an improvement of 63 6 per cent from the record loss of sgd 1 123 million it suffered at the height of the covid 19 pandemic last year as singapore reopens its borders is one of the most admired airlines in the world on its way to wiping away the red ink in its business update published on july 29 singapore s flag carrier revealed that for the quarter that ended in june revenue rose to sgd 1 295 million from sgd 852 million in the corresponding quarter last year an improvement of 52 2 per cent this was mainly led by robust cargo performance and the absence of impairment charges expenditure fell by sgd 319 million or 16 9 per cent to sgd 1 569 million the airline said in its statement that cargo flown revenue grew by sgd 214 million 32 4 per cent as the calibrated resumption in passenger flights contributed to an increase in cargo capacity 46 9 per cent and loads carried 68 2 per cent cargo load factor increased 11 3 percentage points to 89 1 per cent while yields moderated from the exceptionally high levels during the same period last year overall the strong cargo revenue performance for the first quarter reflected the healthy demand fundamentals and an ongoing capacity crunch in the sector sia has no domestic routes and with cross border travel restrictions around the world still very much in place passenger load factor increased at a more modest pace of 4 6 percentage points year on year to 14 8 per cent passenger capacity at the end of the reporting quarter rose to 28 per cent of pre covid levels resulting in passenger flown revenue of sgd 318 million up by sgd 277 million compared with the same period april to june last year when almost all flights were grounded the number of passengers carried by the group for the quarter which included low cost carrier scoot was 362 000 up from 38 000 a year earlier the airline added three new airbus a350s into service in the quarter that just ended and removed two airbus a330s that were on the lease as of june 30 the groups fleet consists of 164 passenger aircraft and seven freighters with an average age of five years and 11 months it has one of the youngest fleets in the airline industry sia projects that passenger capacity will reach 33 per cent of pre pandemic level and that it would serve at least 50 per cent of locations it did before the pandemic by the end of september as global covid 19 vaccination campaigns gather pace the airline hopes that international air travel demand will soon recover however new variants and fresh waves of covid 19 infections in key markets remain a concern it added the recovery trajectory will be dependent on government regulations vaccination rates and the risk profile of individual regulatory authorities sia s planned capacity increase will be helped by the singapore government s plan to treat covid 19 as an endemic disease and strategy to reopen the country to travellers although singapore entered the third lockdown on july 22 which is scheduled to end august 18 the government this week reiterated its plan to gradually allow its residents to return to their pre pandemic lifestyle in some form however this will only be for those who are fully vaccinated which it said are better protected against serious effects of the virus the plan will start taking shape once a high enough proportion of residents are vaccinated and will see a change of emphasis from case numbers to hospitalisation rate the latest lockdown was caused by a spike in covid 19 cases and to ensure a higher portion of its population are vaccinated especially those aged 70 and older the vaccination rate among the elderly was significantly below the national average the authorities expect that around 80 per cent of the population would have been inoculated by early september being fully aware that singapore s status as a business and tourism hub is at stake and dependent on international connectivity the government plans to reopen the city state to international travellers in the coming months it will allow vaccinated people quarantine free access to the country although covid testing may be required it will start by setting up travel corridors with countries or regions that have vaccinated a high percentage of their population and where the infection is under control the number of countries that singapore will open up to is expected to be small initially and based on its condition that vaccination rates must be high and the virus well managed these countries are likely to be in north america europe and the middle east it is also likely that in the early stages of reopening travellers to and from singapore will have to travel on a point to point itinerary given that travellers will not be allowed to transit in a covid hotspot sia will be a beneficiary from this as many singapore residents are keen to travel after having been cooped up on their tiny island for more than a year and a half furthermore many expat residents are keen to travel home to their friends and family having not seen them for some time on its part sia has been quick to add destinations back to its passenger network in spite of low load factor of around 15 per cent it is thus in a good position to capture any new demand as singapore opens as it can boost passenger numbers and revenue without having to increase flights if the flights are insufficient to meet demand it can add more flights as it has excess crew and aircraft capacity it is also ready to set up new nonstop destinations based on the countries the singapore government has set up travel corridors with including new long haul ones although the speed at which the airline will recover is not certain stock analysts at dbs have upgraded sia shares to a hold from fully

scarlett johansson is suing disney over its decision to release superhero movie black widow on streaming platforms at the same time as in theaters alleging a breach of contract which cost the star millions of dollars johansson one of hollywood s biggest and top paid stars was entitled to a percentage of box office receipts from the much anticipated marvel film according to a lawsuit filed thursday at los angeles superior court the film was originally due for a big screen release last year but was delayed multiple times due to the covid 19 pandemic and was eventually released this month simultaneously in theaters and on disney box office analysts have cited the film s streaming debut as a major factor in a lackluster by marvel film standards release for a film that has grossed just over 150 million in domestic theaters in three weeks it s no secret that disney is releasing films like black widow directly onto disney to increase subscribers and thereby boost the company s stock price and that it s hiding behind covid 19 as a pretext to do so said johansson s attorney john berlinski in a statement to afp amid this ongoing legal and public relations battle between disney and scarlett johansson women in film los angeles reframe and time s up along with her talent agency caa have come out in support of the black widow actor the usd 319 8 billion entertainment media conglomerate had called johansson s black widow breach of contract lawsuit a callous disregard for the horrific and prolonged global effects of the covid 19 pandemic disney also disclosed her base salary of usd 20m for the marvel cinematic universe film exclaiming that the disney plus with premier access will compensate her well enough in response to this the advocacy organizations issued a joint statement the statement read while we take no position on the business issues in the litigation between scarlett johansson and the walt disney company we stand firmly against disney s recent statement which attempts to characterize johansson as insensitive or selfish for defending her contractual business rights calling out disney the statement further continued this gendered character attack has no place in a business dispute and contributes to an environment in which women and girls are perceived as less able than men to protect their own interests without facing ad hominem criticism

by lee kah whyesingapore august 1 ani last week singapore airlines sia reported a dramatically narrower net loss of sgd 409 million usd 302 million in its first quarter results for the financial year 2021 22 this is an improvement of 63 6 per cent from the record loss of sgd 1 123 million it suffered at the height of the covid 19 pandemic last year as singapore reopens its borders is one of the most admired airlines in the world on its way to wiping away the red ink in its business update published on july 29 singapore s flag carrier revealed that for the quarter that ended in june revenue rose to sgd 1 295 million from sgd 852 million in the corresponding quarter last year an improvement of 52 2 per cent this was mainly led by robust cargo performance and the absence of impairment charges expenditure fell by sgd 319 million or 16 9 per cent to sgd 1 569 million the airline said in its statement that cargo flown revenue grew by sgd 214 million 32 4 per cent as the calibrated resumption in passenger flights contributed to an increase in cargo capacity 46 9 per cent and loads carried 68 2 per cent cargo load factor increased 11 3 percentage points to 89 1 per cent while yields moderated from the exceptionally high levels during the same period last year overall the strong cargo revenue performance for the first quarter reflected the healthy demand fundamentals and an ongoing capacity crunch in the sector sia has no domestic routes and with cross border travel restrictions around the world still very much in place passenger load factor increased at a more modest pace of 4 6 percentage points year on year to 14 8 per cent passenger capacity at the end of the reporting quarter rose to 28 per cent of pre covid levels resulting in passenger flown revenue of sgd 318 million up by sgd 277 million compared with the same period april to june last year when almost all flights were grounded the number of passengers carried by the group for the quarter which included low cost carrier scoot was 362 000 up from 38 000 a year earlier the airline added three new airbus a350s into service in the quarter that just ended and removed two airbus a330s that were on the lease as of june 30 the groups fleet consists of 164 passenger aircraft and seven freighters with an average age of five years and 11 months it has one of the youngest fleets in the airline industry sia projects that passenger capacity will reach 33 per cent of pre pandemic level and that it would serve at least 50 per cent of locations it did before the pandemic by the end of september as global covid 19 vaccination campaigns gather pace the airline hopes that international air travel demand will soon recover however new variants and fresh waves of covid 19 infections in key markets remain a concern it added the recovery trajectory will be dependent on government regulations vaccination rates and the risk profile of individual regulatory authorities sia s planned capacity increase will be helped by the singapore government s plan to treat covid 19 as an endemic disease and strategy to reopen the country to travellers although singapore entered the third lockdown on july 22 which is scheduled to end august 18 the government this week reiterated its plan to gradually allow its residents to return to their pre pandemic lifestyle in some form however this will only be for those who are fully vaccinated which it said are better protected against serious effects of the virus the plan will start taking shape once a high enough proportion of residents are vaccinated and will see a change of emphasis from case numbers to hospitalisation rate the latest lockdown was caused by a spike in covid 19 cases and to ensure a higher portion of its population are vaccinated especially those aged 70 and older the vaccination rate among the elderly was significantly below the national average the authorities expect that around 80 per cent of the population would have been inoculated by early september being fully aware that singapore s status as a business and tourism hub is at stake and dependent on international connectivity the government plans to reopen the city state to international travellers in the coming months it will allow vaccinated people quarantine free access to the country although covid testing may be required it will start by setting up travel corridors with countries or regions that have vaccinated a high percentage of their population and where the infection is under control the number of countries that singapore will open up to is expected to be small initially and based on its condition that vaccination rates must be high and the virus well managed these countries are likely to be in north america europe and the middle east it is also likely that in the early stages of reopening travellers to and from singapore will have to travel on a point to point itinerary given that travellers will not be allowed to transit in a covid hotspot sia will be a beneficiary from this as many singapore residents are keen to travel after having been cooped up on their tiny island for more than a year and a half furthermore many expat residents are keen to travel home to their friends and family having not seen them for some time on its part sia has been quick to add destinations back to its passenger network in spite of low load factor of around 15 per cent it is thus in a good position to capture any new demand as singapore opens as it can boost passenger numbers and revenue without having to increase flights if the flights are insufficient to meet demand it can add more flights as it has excess crew and aircraft capacity it is also ready to set up new nonstop destinations based on the countries the singapore government has set up travel corridors with including new long haul ones although the speed at which the airline will recover is not certain stock analysts at dbs have upgraded sia shares to a hold from fully valued confident that it will be able to ride out the covid downturn due to its strong balance sheet they reasoned that after multiple rounds of fundraising sia has about sgd 14 billion of pro forma cash balance and that this provides it with a firm buffer to navigate through the current crisis and fund the capital expenditure for its fleet renewal programme ani
it s crucial for us to understand the scope of industrial civilization and its discontents a global mass movement building an ecological civilization is far from the only alternative to business as usual there are other trajectories ranging from maga partisans seeking a trumpist restoration to paleo anarchists for whom solar and fossil fuels are part of the same industrial nightmare as the washington consensus and business and pollution and pillage as usual reigned supreme two aggressive alternatives to the corporate capitalist dream populism and religious fundamentalism rose to global prominence as opponents to the way things are both represent a reactionary rejection of not just the inequities of business as usual but opposition to the disruption of traditional economic social and cultural patterns that the washington consensus wrought both within the rich countries of the oecd and upon the nations of the global south paths for the future four paths compete to define our future business as usual business as usual reflects the rise of a global netocracy in a world shaped by ever greater concentration of wealth ecological deregulation varying levels of climate denial and worsening ecological conditions this is a world of diminished democracies resource wars crop failure and famine collapsing states mass migration of the desperate and emergency attempts at geo engineering to slow climate disaster it is the evolutionary development of the neo liberal washington consensus authoritarian populism authoritarian populism is currently ascendant we are witnessing the continued rise of authoritarians and would be authoritarian leaders driven by anti immigrant nativist passions this is the kind of unifying sentiment by majority groups against designated others that socialists addressing anti semitism called the socialism of fools now stoked by economic disruption and worsening climate authoritarian populism is a quick road to fascism and collapse authoritarian populism will turn to ever more stringent and exclusionary authoritarian measures facing climate catastrophe populism defines immigration as an assault by designated others on an imagined golden age the improbable rise of donald trump to president of the united states speaks volumes about the depth of populist angst exploited by trump expressing a nativist passion populism is more than trumpism and more than anti immigrant racism it can be the venue for the rise to power of anti democratic leaders who reduce democracy to mere rituals populism can also be a force for reform against self serving elites populism expresses the legitimate concerns expressed by the yellow vests in france of downwardly mobile american rust belt workers left far behind by the increasingly wealthy elites it is telling that the rise of trump was potentiated by the response of the obama administration and republican elites to the financial collapse of 2007 8 trillions were spent by the federal reserve and the world s central bankers to save the bankers and speculators and allowed millions to be driven from their homes and jobs religious fundamentalism religious fundamentalism as a social movement has much in common with authoritarian populism religious fundamentalism is popularly identified with a variety of sunni and sunni state and non state actors with a diverse range of tactics and goals but there are also hindu nationalist movements like the bjp that have risen to power in modi s india the world s largest democracy similarly there are major christian fundamentalist movements with a strong theocratic orientation in the u s making their deal with the devil to support an amoral president trump in exchange for political favors the tendency of many of these groups is anti modernist with little interest or capacity to respond to climate issues resistance to modernity and the neo liberal washington consensus informed and shaped the jihadist movement that arose from long term ultra conservative strains of shia and sunni muslim belief for sunnis this was expressed by the muslim brotherhood in egypt in the 1920s and wahhabism in saudi arabia founded by mohammad ibn abd al wahhab in the early 18th century as well as by shias powerless minorities in many arab nations but not in iran where a powerful theocratic state challenges both sunni and u s power building an ecological civilization global ecological economic growth pursues sustainability ecological and social justice and makes economic growth result in ecological and social improvement the goal is to build an ecological civilization by stopping and reversing climate change and building sustainable social orders that strengthen and protects the local and global commons this is a path toward global prosperity peace democracy and survival it is in my view our only valid path forward an ecological social order in part is based on resolving the tension between individual and the group between freedom and community for the mutual benefit of individual and group the resolution of the tension between individual and group is resolved in ways that for some privileges the individual as opposed to the group or privileges the group as opposed to the individual this dynamic shapes and guides the social creation of reality and the psychological strengths and tensions manifest in the group s members a society organized around cooperation substantial common property and gifting for example will have vastly different dynamics and different psychology than a society based on competition private property and maximum personal accumulation for freud in his classic civilization and its discontents there s an inherent tension between personal limitless desires and the necessary limits required by a civilized order for freud unfortunately this world view was a generalization of late 19th century vienna under the austro hungarian empire that gave short shrift to the social creation of reality and prospects for a very different social order of an ecological civilization economic dynamics it s crucial for us to approach our futures by understanding the underlying economic dynamics that drive industrial civilization and its discontents leading to the four likely potential futures of business as usual authoritarian populism religious fundamentalism and ecological civilization the dominant future will over time emerge as the major organizing trajectory for our civilization first we must face the growing and worsening consequences of climate change in motion this is the drought that helped spark the syrian civil war against the assad regime it s crop failure in guatemala and honduras that is one of the primary drivers of desperate families seeking refuge in the united states it s the floods and rising sea levels in bangladesh driving millions inland and for neighboring india to build a border fence to stop the desperate it s now the regular flooding in miami and in the seaport district of boston from rising sea levels and in houston from gulf storms the global threat is of unfolding crop failure in one or more of the planet s primary rice or grain growing areas leading to famine on a massive scale and social and political collapse second is the ongoing global concentration of wealth as the rich get richer and a billionaire class emerges globally the context at the start of 2020 was the still ongoing global expansion the inevitable global downturn had severe global consequences that stretch beyond the pandemic recession even in the richest nation the united states both before and after the depth of the pandemic millions of people are one missed paycheck from financial panic unable to pay rent or mortgage mired in debt with no or minimal savings there is clearly an increasing convergence between the consequences of climate change and local and global economy that will shape the structure of the economic future third is the effects of ai robotization globalization of both production and service jobs on all skill levels fewer and fewer workers are required for many tasks capital investment in ever more competent and skilled machines replaces workers this is not just robotic welding machines producing cars at the supermarket scanning machines are replacing cashiers a robot washes the floors tirelessly circulating around the store and now scanning machines are being replaced by sensors that charge your bank account directly without the scanning and allow you to pick up and purchase the promise is of employee free retail from delivery of supplies from self driving vehicles to robot stocking of shelves a technology rapidly being developed to replace human workers in enormous amazon warehouses the global market means online ordering and shipment from producer to consumer at the lowest cost the 20 pillow i saw in a commercial was available online from ebay at 10 shipped direct from shenzhen china in three weeks there is relentless pressure on price and wages a race to the bottom in 1969 i went to work for banker s trust company on wall street my first full time job the bank was starting to computerize some operations a senior executive told me proudly that the bank was committed to retrain staff and not to fire anyone and in fact only one or two people lost their jobs who refused to be retrained this was still a paper world with handwritten notes with tickler files for follow ups with typists and secretaries and dictaphone machines of giant offices filed with hundreds of workers at their desks with in boxes and out boxes the inescapable trajectory of the 21stcentury and beyond is that there must be ways to share the social product to reduce hours to share jobs as part of a new social contract this must be addressed by all four potential dominant futures it can be imposed grudgingly from above by business as usual and by authoritarian populism and religious fundamentalism or it can be shaped expressed by a new democratic global ecological convergence on sustainable and just norms for all embracing in some fashion a basic income grant a negative income tax a living wage a life time opportunity for education and retraining a right to a fair share in exchange for the responsibility to contribute looking back reasons why it is stunning that the 20th century ended with belief famously advanced by francis fukuyama that in effect history had ended that our common futures would be a matter of themes and variation on corporate classically liberal market democracy western liberal democracy seems at its close to be returning full circle to where it started not to an end of ideology or a convergence between capitalism and socialism as earlier predicted but to an unabashed victory of economic and political liberalism the soviet union and its empire had collapsed the united states stood alone as irresistible and indispensable global leader democracy and capitalism seemed irresistible a democratic movement of color revolutions arose in 2003 2005 in former soviet republics street protests removed repressive regimes in the rose revolution in georgia the orange revolution in ukraine and the tulip revolution in kyrgyzstan an arab spring of democracy uprisings starting in 2010 toppled repressive regimes in tunisia libya egypt and yemen and challenged several others but in all but tunisia the democratic moment of the arab spring proved to be ephemeral the widely shared inference from the brittleness of new democracies was that it was not easy to create durable democratic orders in nations lacking the experience and social structures of political parties organized around ideas as opposed to religious or cultural identity democracy in egypt for example after the electoral success of the muslim brotherhood led to support or acquiescence to a military junta seizing power a rising china continued on a market path even after repressing the democracy movement the washington consensus democracy and capitalism american style was expressed by the so called washington consensus this was a road map for a neo liberal global order based on the free movement of capital but not labor of enforced structural adjustments imposed by the rich upon the poor and to protect the foreign investment by the rich in poor nations this structural adjustment imposed by the world bank and international bankers required cutting health care education privatization of social services and mandate export driven commodity production as opposed to high value added import substitution export of fossil fuel power plants as part of infrastructure development for the poor was standard fare and consistent with the general failure to take serious and focused action on climate by the rich who are responsible for the problem and who benefited by the generations of unrestrained pollution the washington consensus often made the rich become richer and the poor poorer the poor were mired in debt or if not constrained by the middle income trap in economies serving as low wage and low margin assemblers of products that would be sold at the high margin by the rich free trade was the mantra supported by a welter of bi lateral multilateral and international trade agreements and rules business as usual meant deepening inequality globally within rich and poor nations with the emergence of a billionaire class thomas piketty s work on deepening global inequality as a common feature of global market capitalism is definitive business as usual also meant global climate crisis threatening the future of civilization and the well being of the ecosphere and all it inhabitants as the financial masters of the universe attempt to manage and profit from global business and financial flows the uber rich were gifted by the 2018 tax reform with multi trillions of dollars by deep cuts in corporate income and estate taxes the benefits conferred upon capital have been extraordinary and have been often used for stock buy backs to push up stock prices and corporate bonuses business as usual also not incidentally meant resources wars for the control of oil and natural gas branded as an endless and limitless global war against terror business as usual even after the fall of the soviet union and its huge military establishment has meant the continued global conduct of a baroque global war system an american empire is classically waging endless war abroad for tribute and control to maintain peace and prosperity at home at least for the increasingly rich one percent of the population and especially for the tiny emergent billionaire class american counter terrorism forces were active in an astounding 85 countries in 2018 2020 without a declaration of war or even serious congressional debate or oversight globally the u s military has 800 bases u s counter terrorism action has served to effectively increase the strength of opposition groups most famously in iraq where isis was born in the torture cells of abu ghraib prison targeted assassinations drone air and missile strikes combat operations occur globally with air and drone strikes active in pakistan afghanistan syria iraq yemen somalia libya the assassination by drone fired missile of general qassem soleimani of iran s quds force at the start of 2020 is likely to be cause of more violence and many deaths in an endless global war against terror building an ecological civilization versus authoritarianism and populism what s most relevant to our concerns is that movements for building an ecological civilization through the pursuit of sustainability and social and ecological justice rests upon and arises from global dynamics potentiated and unleashed by business and pollution as usual namely worsening global inequality with deepening economic social and political consequences including resource wars for fossil fuels now with wars for strategic minerals water and food and viable agricultural land and aquaculture resources soon to come trade regimes that benefit corporate wealth not community wealth and community jobs global debt peonage of poor nations to benefit the rich through structural adjustment based on commodity export privatization slashing social services low wage production climate change and emergent global ecological crisis falling hardest on the poorest through drought flood super storms crop failure that pushes the suffering over the brink at the bottom an ecological civilization will turn a global war system into a peace system and global ecocide into sustainable regeneration of our planet the desperation that gave rise to populism and fundamentalism will be mitigated by the pursuit of sustainability social and ecological justice and strengthened communities in a global movement for climate sanity and climate justice in my view building an ecological civilization is the only path likely to allow us to escape climate catastrophe and build a sustainable and just future that transforms a war system into a peace system failure to aggressively respond to the threat of climate change will almost certainly usher in a world of resources wars for water food productive agricultural land and high ground as seas rise driving irresistible mass migration of the desperate a peace system is not a fanciful wish it s driven by the necessity for common survival in the face of looming planetary ecological catastrophe a necessary concomitant for building an ecological future fact check socialism of fools der antisemitismus

general electric in particular is already building desal plants in the u s they re calling it the megadrought seven years ago in this space i profiled the drought that was baking california and the companies working to combat it it was california s worst drought in 500 years experts said at the time but seven years later the worst has gotten even worse with 95 of the state experiencing severe drought conditions and 86 extreme things have gotten so bad that california s state water resources control board may vote on aug 3 to cut off water access to central valley farmers fires are breaking out across the parched state the crowdsourced firemappers map shows literally dozens of blazes including the dixie fire which reached megafire status on friday no wonder the american geophysical union now says this seemingly endless drought is the most severe in the last 1200 years and yet if you look at a map you ll see a very big indeed an ocean sized potential solution to california s drought problems if only we can get the salt out the desalination solution through desalination oceanic salt water can be transformed into potable fresh water in either of two ways you can boil it let the salt precipitate out and collect the condensation or you can filter the saltwater through a membrane to remove the salt it can be an expensive process a gallon of potable water produced through desalination costs about twice what it costs to provide water from other sources and yet this cost of desalination has fallen by half over the past 30 years meaning it s an increasingly viable solution what s more when you consider the losses from not investing in desalination california lost 5 billion in agricultural revenue from crops not grown during the last big drought from 2014 to 2015 that same 5 billion could have built five new desalination plants to help prevent the next drought in california nearly a dozen such desalination plants are already in operation and 10 more are planned the carlsbad desalination plant still under construction when i last wrote about this drought has now been up and running for five years filtering 50 million gallons per day it s the largest desalination plant in the western hemisphere and supplies 7 of san diego county s water poseidon water the company that built the carlsbad plant is now planning to open a similar sized plant in huntington beach albeit at a higher price carlsbad cost 1 billion but the huntington beach plant could cost 1 4 billion seven desalination companies to invest in speaking of which investors looking to support and profit from the growing use of desalination technology to cure california s chronic droughts might want to start their search with poseidon water according to data from s p global market intelligence it s a subsidiary of the giant brookfield infrastructure partners bip 5 30 with a 16 billion market capitalization but only 193 million in trailing profit brookfield may not look like an attractive investment at first glance but the company generated more than 1 billion in positive free cash flow fcf last year giving the stock an attractive valuation of 16 times fcf adding to the attraction brookfield currently pays a generous dividend yield of 3 7 brookfield is based in bermuda and foreign companies tend to dominate the water desalination field france s veolia environnement veoey 2 94 is the world s biggest desalination company having built more than 1 950 reverse osmosis desalination plants in 85 countries including the huge desalination plant in sydney australia that supplies 15 of that city s water france s suez environnement szevy is no 2 and earns a massive 23 4 ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization margin on its water business among u s companies general electric company ge 1 37 remains one of the world s biggest suppliers of water treatment equipment on catalina island southwest of los angeles ge built a 150 000 gallons per day desalination plant for southern california edison a division of edison international eix 2 78 ge says the desalination process costs between 3 and 6 per 1 000 gallons and that 70 of that cost is for fuel to operate the plants however solar powered desalination has the potential to cut that cost speaking of energy costs you might also consider energy recovery inc erii 2 97 which derives 77 of its revenue from reverse osmosis desalination services through efficient operation the company says its flagship px pressure exchanger saves water desalination customers approximately usd 2 billion annually in energy costs finally ecolab ecl 1 61 based in saint paul minnesota owns aquatech international a pennsylvania company specializing in water purification technology it s a small subsidiary within a big company but still the 10th biggest desalination company in the world and it s part of ecolab s largest and most profitable division global industrial where it contributes to that division s powerful 18 5 operating profit margin all of this goes to show even if drought poses a big problem in california desalination can be one very profitable way to solve it
by lee kah whyesingapore august 1 ani last week singapore airlines sia reported a dramatically narrower net loss of sgd 409 million usd 302 million in its first quarter results for the financial year 2021 22 this is an improvement of 63 6 per cent from the record loss of sgd 1 123 million it suffered at the height of the covid 19 pandemic last year as singapore reopens its borders is one of the most admired airlines in the world on its way to wiping away the red ink in its business update published on july 29 singapore s flag carrier revealed that for the quarter that ended in june revenue rose to sgd 1 295 million from sgd 852 million in the corresponding quarter last year an improvement of 52 2 per cent this was mainly led by robust cargo performance and the absence of impairment charges expenditure fell by sgd 319 million or 16 9 per cent to sgd 1 569 million the airline said in its statement that cargo flown revenue grew by sgd 214 million 32 4 per cent as the calibrated resumption in passenger flights contributed to an increase in cargo capacity 46 9 per cent and loads carried 68 2 per cent cargo load factor increased 11 3 percentage points to 89 1 per cent while yields moderated from the exceptionally high levels during the same period last year overall the strong cargo revenue performance for the first quarter reflected the healthy demand fundamentals and an ongoing capacity crunch in the sector sia has no domestic routes and with cross border travel restrictions around the world still very much in place passenger load factor increased at a more modest pace of 4 6 percentage points year on year to 14 8 per cent passenger capacity at the end of the reporting quarter rose to 28 per cent of pre covid levels resulting in passenger flown revenue of sgd 318 million up by sgd 277 million compared with the same period april to june last year when almost all flights were grounded the number of passengers carried by the group for the quarter which included low cost carrier scoot was 362 000 up from 38 000 a year earlier the airline added three new airbus a350s into service in the quarter that just ended and removed two airbus a330s that were on the lease as of june 30 the groups fleet consists of 164 passenger aircraft and seven freighters with an average age of five years and 11 months it has one of the youngest fleets in the airline industry sia projects that passenger capacity will reach 33 per cent of pre pandemic level and that it would serve at least 50 per cent of locations it did before the pandemic by the end of september as global covid 19 vaccination campaigns gather pace the airline hopes that international air travel demand will soon recover however new variants and fresh waves of covid 19 infections in key markets remain a concern it added the recovery trajectory will be dependent on government regulations vaccination rates and the risk profile of individual regulatory authorities sia s planned capacity increase will be helped by the singapore government s plan to treat covid 19 as an endemic disease and strategy to reopen the country to travellers although singapore entered the third lockdown on july 22 which is scheduled to end august 18 the government this week reiterated its plan to gradually allow its residents to return to their pre pandemic lifestyle in some form however this will only be for those who are fully vaccinated which it said are better protected against serious effects of the virus the plan will start taking shape once a high enough proportion of residents are vaccinated and will see a change of emphasis from case numbers to hospitalisation rate the latest lockdown was caused by a spike in covid 19 cases and to ensure a higher portion of its population are vaccinated especially those aged 70 and older the vaccination rate among the elderly was significantly below the national average the authorities expect that around 80 per cent of the population would have been inoculated by early september being fully aware that singapore s status as a business and tourism hub is at stake and dependent on international connectivity the government plans to reopen the city state to international travellers in the coming months it will allow vaccinated people quarantine free access to the country although covid testing may be required it will start by setting up travel corridors with countries or regions that have vaccinated a high percentage of their population and where the infection is under control the number of countries that singapore will open up to is expected to be small initially and based on its condition that vaccination rates must be high and the virus well managed these countries are likely to be in north america europe and the middle east it is also likely that in the early stages of reopening travellers to and from singapore will have to travel on a point to point itinerary given that travellers will not be allowed to transit in a covid hotspot sia will be a beneficiary from this as many singapore residents are keen to travel after having been cooped up on their tiny island for more than a year and a half furthermore many expat residents are keen to travel home to their friends and family having not seen them for some time on its part sia has been quick to add destinations back to its passenger network in spite of low load factor of around 15 per cent it is thus in a good position to capture any new demand as singapore opens as it can boost passenger numbers and revenue without having to increase flights if the flights are insufficient to meet demand it can add more flights as it has excess crew and aircraft capacity it is also ready to set up new nonstop destinations based on the countries the singapore government has set up travel corridors with including new long haul ones although the speed at which the airline will recover is not certain stock analysts at dbs have upgraded sia shares to a hold from fully valued confident that it will be able to ride out the covid downturn due to its strong balance sheet they reasoned that after multiple rounds of fundraising sia has about sgd 14 billion of pro forma cash balance and that this provides it with a firm buffer to navigate through the current crisis and fund the capital expenditure for its fleet renewal programme ani
by peter jacobsen earlier this month the us department of defense dod canceled a 10 billion joint enterprise defense infrastructure jedi contract awarded to microsoft in 2019 the goal of the contract was to modernize the department s it operations using cloud computing the jedi cancellation occurred following a lawsuit from amazon after the company was denied the contract amazon alleges that they were rejected because the department of defense was pressured by then president donald trump to screw amazon the motivation for this move it was claimed was driven by trump s personal animus for then ceo jeff bezos who also owns the washington post amazon claims insider sources responsible for the book holding the line inside trump s pentagon with secretary mattis provide evidence for trump s direct intent to screw amazon but you need not trust another book published by washington insiders for this story trump s personal problems with bezos valid or not are extremely public tweets targeted at bezos include the washingtonpost which loses a fortune is owned by jeffbezos for purposes of keeping taxes down at his no profit company amazon december 7 2015 if amazon ever had to pay fair taxes its stock would crash and it would crumble like a paper bag the washingtonpost scam is saving it december 7 2015 really sick to watch the fake and totally slanted news coming out of msdnc and cnn it bears no relationship to the truth or facts they are merely offshoots of the dnc much like the nytimes and the amazon washingtonpost just like 2016 but worse sad but we will win big june 3rd 2020 amazon is doing great damage to tax paying retailers towns cities and states throughout the u s are being hurt many jobs being lost august 16 2017 prompted by amazon s lawsuit the dod launched an investigation that yielded a 317 page report evaluating amazon s allegations the authors claimed that lack of cooperation from white house officials prevented them from reaching any clear conclusions the dod later canceled the jedi contract arguing it no longer suited the department s needs and it is pursuing a new multi vendor contract called joint warfighter cloud capability jwcc as cnbc reported the agency said it plans to solicit proposals from both amazon and microsoft for the contract adding that they are the only cloud service providers that can meet its needs although the jedi contract cancelation appears to be a unique case it brings to light a pervasive problem with the military industrial complex trump s uncharacteristically loud administration simply highlights this problem which is present in all administrations politics procurement and picking winners and losers although other president s are less vocal about their opinions about specific businesses and ceos their decisions are no less influential every year the dod under the direction of the president consumes billions of dollars in goods and services this presents a major problem for the government how can the world s most expensive military convince someone to produce what military bureaucrats demand there are two possible solutions to this problem the military can either hire someone to produce the goods and services or the military could produce them itself for the most part the military opts for the first option offering private companies the opportunity to produce military equipment and technology in exchange for billions of dollars every year private companies then submit bids detailing how they plan to complete the project with the billions they re awarded the problem inherent in this process is it distorts free market competition under the free market companies win by providing goods which are more valuable to consumers than what they cost to create when a business does this they earn what economists call economic profit any business that fails to do this will earn a loss and unless the owners turn things around they ll go out of business but when businesses seek government procurement contracts they no longer are seeking the favor of consumers instead businesses must compete for the favor of politicians and bureaucrats spending taxpayers dollars in other words politicians are in the position of picking winners and losers so how do they pick well perhaps as in the case of trump personal grievances will underlie their decisions but this is actually the least sinister method of competing for political favor alternatively companies seeking large procurements may be willing to pay politicians and bureaucrats with campaign contributions fancy lobbying dinners or outright under the table bribes so long as the company makes more money for the procurement than is spent on buying political favors they come out on top politicians and bureaucrats also come out on top being able to accept bribes this process of buying political favor is known to economists as rent seeking so who is worse off taxpayers and consumers taxpayer dollars are now being allocated in a way which serves the politician and bureaucrat rather than the public further these dollars now can prop up otherwise failing businesses that continue to use society s resources in a wasteful way since they aren t beholden to consumer values when a wasteful business wastes scarce resources but is allowed to operate on a windfall from political bribes the average consumer loses a fundamental flaw the ability of companies to engage in rent seeking is a fundamental flaw that springs out of the military industrial complex a military with a budget of billions will use that budget and when it does so this provides politicians and bureaucrats an opportunity to solicit bribes and favors the military can t engage in large scale purchases without this flaw because the incentives are generated by the system some may argue that the process could be fixed by having the military produce its own goods this suggestion is akin to arguing that military production should be nationalized or socialized if military technology is internally produced there is no problem of purchasing from politically connected corporations after all however this doesn t solve the problem at all this solution merely re draws the lines instead of a company being given the privilege of an excessive procurement contract an internal bureaucrat now is placed in that position if the government is expected to nationalize all military equipment production this will mean several high paid individuals will need to be hired after they re hired they ll have to go before congress and argue that their department needs more money in the end the result is the same taxpayer money is used to subsidize competition for political favor without regard for what consumers think is valuable so while trump may be uncharacteristically loud there is nothing uncharacteristic about politicians picking winners and losers to suit what they want in fact this sort of behavior is characteristic of the system itself peter jacobsen peter jacobsen is an assistant professor of economics at ottawa university and the gwartney professor of economic education and research at the gwartney institute he
