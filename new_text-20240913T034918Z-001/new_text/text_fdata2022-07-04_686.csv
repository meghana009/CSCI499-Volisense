well that was a terrible horrible no good very bad unprecedented precedent destroying week at the supreme court to help make sense of scotus reversal of roe v wade i spoke to dr gillian frank a historian of sexuality and religion this is the first of a series of skipped conversations on how roe fell and where we go from here dr frank writes on the intertwined histories of religion sexuality and gender in the us and is the co host of sexing history a podcast about how the history of sexuality shapes our present we chatted about the history of antiabortion laws the public health crisis that s assuredly about to arise and how the fight for abortion rights doesn t end now a condensed transcript edited for clarity is below if you d like the audio of the full conversation and or more skipped history in general you can try out life as a paying subscriber here i hope you learn as much as i did ben dr frank it s a pleasure to chat with you albeit under such disturbing circumstances gf thanks for having me ben to ground our conversation could you talk about the rise of the first anti abortion laws in the 19th century gf sure though before we get to the restrictions we need to note that abortion was widely practiced for most of american history up until the 1860s 70s and 80s but then a confluence of factors led to new restrictions on abortion the first factor was the professionalization of physicians with the founding of the american medical association ama and the regulation of physicians physicians tried to normalize and seize power over medical practices part of that meant stamping out what we would now call quacks or untrained unskilled physicians but it also meant seizing power from skilled medical practitioners such as midwives who offered competition and covered all the things an ob gyn would cover including abortion ben might i wager a guess that most of the members of the ama if not all were white men gf that would be correct yes ben well as long as we are consistent gf the second factor was the coincident rise of social purity movements people like anthony comstock and others had huge concerns about what they called the moral degradation of american society comstock was a religious fundamentalist and he like many white protestants feared that the arrival of catholic eastern europeans meant good protestant stock was declining ben it s just a pure coincidence that his name is comstock and he s worried about the population s stock gf i had never thought of it that way but yes pure coincidence and so comstock joined by others went from town to town city to city state to state to campaign for abortion restrictions their efforts succeeded in the 1880s state by state legislators pass what are called comstock laws banning information about abortion and contraception as well as banning abortion except to save the life of the mother by the late 19th century we see the completion of a shift from abortion being widely practiced to abortion being tightly restricted and in the domain of licensed male physicians ben after the comstock laws spread what options did women face when seeking an abortion gf of course the demand never stopped the question then is who did women go to where did they get abortions one answer is that as we fast forward to the 1920s and 1930s most cities and towns had a reliable full time abortion provider members of the medical establishment felt if our patient needs an abortion we can at least send them to the known provider and have them do the procedure and then we can tidy up the aftermath at the same time unskilled people knew there was a strong demand for abortion and many women turned to a black market that emerged newspaper headlines would regularly describe how people would seek out a gas station attendant or a trusted friend or someone who knew someone who said they could supposedly do an abortion skilled or not all of these practitioners operated outside the law as a result expenses went up safety went down and there were fatalities ben wow okay gf now post 1940s demand isn t ceasing in fact demand for abortion is growing as part of a post war sort of sexual loosening up ben the post world war ii orgy if you will gf i wouldn t phrase it that way but i m sure there were some and around the same time there s a strong push to establish the so called nuclear family as women are pushed out of full time work into part time or homemaking work we see a tightening of abortion restrictions not coincidentally in the 40s catholic physicians conduct a survey of how their hospitals are treating abortions what are the numbers of abortions that they re providing versus say hospitals like johns hopkins or others that are protestant secular or just non catholic and they find that there s a wide discrepancy suggesting that non catholic hospitals are providing a lot of illegal abortions this leads to another round of regulation that spurs hospitals to self regulate for fear of violating the law hospitals introduce hospital committees to review every abortion case that comes in these committees basically became a way of driving down the abortion rates that were legal and accessible and so entering the 50s we have what we might call a quiet sexual revolution going on and less access to safe abortions what happens again rising body counts ben in other words a public health crisis gf right a public health crisis emerges lawyers are aware of it police are aware of it the clergy is aware of it ben how does this growing mass awareness coalesce into a pro abortion movement in your work you describe a religious alliance that forms almost like a priest a minister and a rabbi walk into a bar and decide to support women s rights gf yes minus the priest at this point the early abortion rights movement is largely coming from professionals physicians lawyers and clergy who believe that they should have the autonomy to make decisions with their patients as for the clergy it s mainly ministers from mainline protestant denominations as well as rabbis from reform and conservative denominations they ve already been on board with contraception for decades and see family planning as an ethical duty and sex for pleasure within marriage as natural normal and desired one of the big galvanizing factors was german measles aka the rubella epidemic which was causing a lot of fetal deformities and there was a scare over thalidomide a tranquilizer that also led to birth defects so religious figures worried about the health of fetuses you can hear the ableist language of the decade male lawyers clergy and physicians begin to see it as a moral outrage that when women they deemed worthy i e women who were white middle and upper class and married needed abortions they had to either fly abroad or just couldn t get them meanwhile a growing women s liberation movement and second wave liberal feminist movement are also seeing sexual matters as essential to recognizing the politics of oppression and how to activate your own life to have full empowerment and social equality abortion becomes central to this conversation so by the mid 60s in california new york and other states legislatures are considering abortion law reform there s an emergent consensus about what does it mean if hundreds of thousands of people a year are violating the law and i haven t even gone down the full list of all the people who are concerned about abortion but long story short by 1970 new york has legalized abortion with no residency requirements hawaii does the same around the same time kansas comes next and then a whole other slew of states follow suit ben so over generalizing in a story that we ll explore another time this momentum leads to the supreme court s decision in roe v wade in 1973 something that occurred to me while reading your work and which has occurred to me throughout the conservative push to overturn roe is isn t it very clear that we re heading toward another public health crisis why wouldn t there be more momentum toward stopping this public health crisis gf your basic question is what happens next ben it is yes but i hate to be too explicit about that in front of a historian gf okay will this create a public health crisis inevitably by denying medical access by making abortion more expensive by trying to criminalize it by increasing the social stigma around it by empowering states to demonize those who seek and provide abortions and those who share information about the procedure all of these things will have repercussions the least of which is that for women who want to terminate a pregnancy in states with very restrictive laws it ll become more time consuming more expensive and more difficult these demotivating factors will be able to snare some but if the past is any indication many other folks are going to attempt self managed abortions now the past is not the same as the present we have new technologies new ways of getting information but will there be people left behind inevitably what will be the mental health economic or public health consequences of folks compelled to have children they don t want as many people are pointing out this oppression will have negative cascading effects on people s lives and for folks who inevitably end up traveling great distances taking lots of time and spending more money on abortion well all of these things wear on a person and make an ordinary medical procedure traumatic i can t predict body count i can t predict maternal mortality but i d emphasize that the difference between now and in the past was pre roe there was not a political party that uniformly made anti abortion its platform in the past both democrats and republicans were split over abortion ben as in until even a couple of decades ago members were split within both parties gf yes split within both parties but the ways in which the republican party has become radically conservative if not outright anti democratic and authoritarian make for a different situation today in the past you would almost never offer criminal penalties to someone seeking an abortion republicans are floating those penalties now and trying to expand a much greater punitive regime this is an anti abortion regime on steroids as compared to the past ben wow i suppose the increasing radicalization of this regime suggests there s no silver lining at the moment gf no i won t say there s a silver lining but i will say that it s not hopeless that for decades now there have been groups preparing for this day that there are many activists on the ground already creating infrastructures and they have been creating infrastructures this story doesn t stop with the decimation of roe v wade it s not a simple end of abortion rather it s a transformation of how it can be accessed it s part of an ongoing struggle to provide health and dignity to millions of americans ben thank you for that reminder and for your time today gf real pleasure to speak with you
as we gather with family and friends for this independence day celebration as we still hold the memories of how government responded to the covid 19 pandemic by dispatching liberty we remind ourselves that freedom is a valuable and precious gift worth fighting for there are many current anxieties frustrations and feelings of despondency as our july 4th 2022 celebrations take place however we would be well served to remember that we alone control our responses to events around us we can choose to put aside all of the challenges and issues that seem beyond our control and we can gather in joyful fellowship with our family and friends to celebrate the reason our forefather s defeated tyranny we americans come from solid stock we carry in our dna a fortitude of individual identity that is not dependent on government for affirmation or permission we are the beneficiaries of those who believed in stubborn independence what takes place at your picnic gathering or assembly of fellowship is your independent choice i am reminded of an article written more than two decades ago that still rings true to this day i am an american i was conceived at plymouth born in lexington and concord and reached maturity at philadelphia i went through the fires of shiloh gualdacanal the chosin resovoir khe sanh and a thousand other battlefields and emerged rededicated to the ideals on which america was founded i am an american ever ready to defend my liberty and independence to make any sacrifice and bear any burden still i seek no quarrel i march to the sound of the guns out of necessity alone i fight not for glory or territory or to make others bend to my will but to vindicate my rights and preserve my freedom i am an american i m proud of my past words like valley forge gettysburg address and pearl harbor names like washington jackson lincoln and teddy roosevelt make my blood stir glancing behind me i see generations of men and women who labored and struggled lived and died to let me stand where i am today who cleared the land planted the crops built the factories raised the cities and made the discoveries that created a civilization which all the silent suffering ranks of slaves serfs and subjects who came before them could never imagine i am an american while recognizing the errors that were made in nation building has a nation ever been built exclusively on light i proclaim america s past glorious indeed a boon to humanity and consider myself among the blessed of the earth to share this nation s destiny i am an american liberty is my birthright to speak my mind choose my leaders and legislators defend my home and family and worship the creator in my fashion these are not privileges but g od given rights governments can respect or deny them they cannot change them i am an american i have no rulers those who make interpret and enforce our laws are servants when they no longer recognize that verity their authority loses legitimacy i am an american my rights are a sacred trust to be exercised in the cause of justice and virtue they are not the playthings of a spoiled child or mechanisms of self indulgence i am an american english is my language our ancestors arrived on these shores speaking everything from chinese to yiddish it was english that united us that allowed us to overcome age old antagonisms from the mayflower compact to the latest piece of legislation introduced in congress our history and heritage are written in the tongue of the magna carta and the king james bible i am an american i have no distinctive race religion or ethnicity i am black white yellow brown and red catholic protestant jew and hindu i came here from the hamlets of old england the bogs of ireland napoli s sunny shore the pale of settlement and the villages of vietnam american isn t a color or creed but a state of mind i am an american i welcome immigrants who are here to work and build who identify with our past and ideals who were spiritual americans before they landed broken english is fine as long as faith remains unbroken an american speaks with the heart as much as the lips i am an american my ism is americanism i reject all dogmas and ideologies collectivism racism militarism and imperialism have no place here the rot that s eaten away at the soul of so many nations and cultures must be fiercely resisted i am an american i recognize only one loyalty higher than allegiance to our flag faith in god i acknowledge that america and god the physical and the spiritual are inseparable america was founded by people of faith and grew to greatness by his grace i pray that we will always be the instruments of his will i am an american i weep over the fact that american history is no longer taught in our schools in its place is a worldly cynical skepticism inculcated by authors and educators at war with our basic values i am an american i cringe at the collection of connivers cowards clowns and quacks that passes for our political leadership i wonder that so many of my compatriots have no idea what america means and show no gratitude for the blessings that are theirs i am an american my ranks grow thin the night closes in whether i will be the last of my kind or the vanguard of their resurgence only time will tell
weshop is launching itself as the world s first community owned social ecommerce platform offering shoppers shares in the group every time they make a purchase weshop pa british tech firm weshop is launching itself as the world s first community owned social ecommerce platform offering shoppers shares in the group every time they make a purchase it plans to give away up to 90 of its business to shoppers and aims to list on the nasdaq tech heavy index in new york within 12 months as it looks to take on the might of retail titans like amazon advertisement advertisement shoppers on the platform which lists retail chains including asos selfridges net a porter the body shop ebay b q and made com will earn 20 of every purchase price as investment shares chairman richard griffiths first had the idea of a community owned commerce platform 10 years ago weshop pa it is also offering 10 of the value of products in shares for purchases made through recommendations on the platform while shoppers will further boost their stakes when they introduce new members with 1 of the value spent by the new member given in stock chairman richard griffiths said weshop is a first of its kind venture pioneering the belief of share democratisation he told the pa news agency the idea would be disruptive on many levels in the retail sector he said the way we shop has changed dramatically in the last 10 years thanks to rapid advances in technology while we ve seen the dramatic growth of online shopping platforms and their profits none of them are designed to benefit the people who keep them going the shoppers that s why weshop was born building a totally shoppable platform that is owned by the community a private investor in many sectors and former chairman of music publisher greensleeves records mr griffiths said he first had the idea for a community owned shopping platform 10 years ago it strikes me as completely unfair that big tech and ecommerce have created enormous valuations for the benefit of a few people and their shareholders but all of that value has been built by their users he said allowing shoppers to own where they shop is fair and it s equitable and it s a redistribution of wealth into the hands of the people who created it he said with 20 million investment to date and heavyweight backers including alex chesterman the founder and boss of cazoo betfair co founder andrew black and former formula one driver nigel mansell and his son leo the group is gearing up for a stock market flotation by the end of the first quarter of 2023 imagine if amazon had done this when they started the wealth created by amazon would have been shared amongst the people who made it successful its users richard griffiths weshop chairman mr griffiths said he is not ruling out a dual listing in london but feels the nasdaq will be the right home for it story continues it has already signed up lawyers and advisers ahead of the float and investors will be able to start cashing in on their shares after 12 months of ownership mr griffiths said he is confident the float will go ahead as planned but said the group could offer to buy out shoppers shares in cash after the 12 month lock in if the listing is delayed although this would not be guaranteed the firm has already been running a trial with 4 000 shoppers on the app since earlier this year and aims to sign up about 100 000 members within the first two to three months after launch mr griffiths said imagine if amazon had done this when they started the wealth created by amazon would have been shared amongst the people who made it successful its users indeed the world might look very different now
if you look beyond the condescending sanctimonious and unintelligent questioning and pantomime from cbs news margaret brennan there are some very interesting aspects outlined by german chancellor olaf scholz i was looking for how cbs would inject the pending global food shortage into the interview and what narrative angle they would use the coordinated media political talking point russia starving the world comes up in the last third of the interview germany is the largest and most heavily industrialized economy in the european union eu as a result germany makes most of the decisions about how the eu operates former german chancellor angela merkel always played the role of supporting nato however her approach to government was one of the most closed controlling and nationalist hypocrisies within the european union if it was in germany s interest it was done if it was not directly beneficial to germany it was never done merkel s replacement olaf scholz is not that different from his predecessor in regard to the economics of nationalism the predominant view for any german leader however scholz is more of a collaborator an outward looking chancellor seemingly more globally and communally minded than merkel scholz is more accepting of biden usa influence than angela merkel was scholz is also spending more on german military than merkel would ever consider in this interview scholz outlines the conflict in ukraine while overlaying his perspective of russian president vladimir putin as an outcome of their discussions watch margaret brennan mr chancellor thank you so much for making time in your busy schedule for us olaf scholz good morning margaret brennan so i read your biographer says you don t often answer directly but i m going to try my best today you speak with vladimir putin do you think that russia is a terrorist state as president zelenskyy says olaf scholz russia started a very brutal aggression against ukraine a lot of people are dying in ukraine citizens men women children elderly people and this is what we call a really brutal unjustified war that has that russia started and we have to do all to support ukraine and to give ukraine the chance to defend its own integrity and serenity and that is what we are doing when we support the country margaret brennan but calling it a terrorist state in your view doesn t achieve anything olaf scholz it achieves something when we support ukraine with all the financial means we give to the ukraine with all the humanitarian aid with all the weapons we deliver and we will continue doing this as long as it is necessary for supporting ukraine and for avoiding that the outcome of this war is what putin is looking for a dictated peace and this is something that neither the ukraine nor we will accept so it is necessary that we continue with this very strong support and it is necessary that we also continue with all the sanctions we imposed on russia and this is an important aspect from my as i see it we impose sanctions against one russia after the election of crimea not too many but we did margaret brennan back in 2014 olaf scholz and they are still in place we imposed sanctions against russia when they organize the uprisings in the east of donbass in ukraine and they are still in place and all the very heavy sanctions we impose on russia now will be there if there is not a real fair piece from the perspective of ukraine and this is the message i sent to putin and many others do the same and we make it very clear you cannot look for a dictate piece against ukraine margaret brennan when you speak to putin does he acknowledge the sanctions does he acknowledge how much his economy has been hurt or does he just not care olaf scholz i think he cares but he will not really admit it so you get some margaret brennan because it hasn t stopped him olaf scholz idea you get some idea that it really is hurting him and that he understands the deep impacts of our sanctions on his economy and i m always mentioning it because it s necessary to say it just to give you a view on this question if a very advanced country like the united states or germany with a very progressive economy with high tech industries would go out of the world and would just stick to itself we would go down in economic growth very very soon but this is now happening to a country that is not that advanced that is really needing all the technologies from the rest of the world for having a similar standard of living and for having the chance to be part of growth in the world economy and this is now the real damage to the russian economy that they have no chance to do this and it s also hurting them because many of the things even the military weapons they produce themselves are in one or the other way just linked to the economic and technological progress of the world and so they will go back very very far margaret brennan when will russia know when will russia no longer have the ability to continue this fight when will putin run out of weapons run out of funds or can this continue for years olaf scholz no one really knows he has he has he is perhaps the leader of a very great country with a lot of people living there with a lot of means and he is really doing this brutal war with and he prepared for it for very long i think the decision to to do this war was taken one year before it started or possibly earlier because he prepared for it and so he will be able to continue with the war really a long time but this is the message we say to him we are able to support the ukraine as long as necessary for defending its serenity the democracy the rule of law and all the things the people in ukraine are looking for margaret brennan president zelensky has said that he would like to see the war end by the end of the year how does it end and is that realistic olaf scholz it is very difficult to judge whether this is realistic because this is something that is decided on the ground and even more is this one of the reason why we are so active supporting the ukraine with all the different means i already discussed on financial humanitarian support sanctions and delivery of weapons margaret brennan so russia s invasion of ukraine has been called a 9 11 moment for europe a big wake up call do you think that europe and do you think germany was just too complacent for too long olaf scholz i think too many in the world were hoping that we are living in a different world that is different to the experiences of the last century and the centuries before where might and power were deciding on the future of countries and not the rules and the agreements we have between states and we have had an agreement that there should be no attempt to change territory to to change borders to invade the neighbor and this agreement is now canceled by putin and this is what i called site and vendor in german a watershed moment of international politics peace is a danger and this is why it is absolutely necessary that we spend more for defense and germany is going in elite in this question in europe margaret brennan so it was too complacent olaf scholz i think we should have been prepared for that situation and but it is really a big big disaster for the expectations of all of us looking at peace the chances we have in the world are better if there s no attempt to change borders with war and things like that but now we are in that situation and we have to be realistic and this is why we have to do more margaret brennan what is the fundamental nature of this conflict because the head of the british army called it a 1937 moment is that how you see it is that the moment in history we are in right now olaf scholz i think this is a moment where we have to make absolutely clear that we are strong enough that no one should just think about attacking for instance nato territory and this is why i said to my parliament that we are ready and willing to defend any centimeter every centimeter of nato territory in in europe and that we are together with our allies and this is a very clear message to our eastern margaret brennan and that s a clear message that s a clear line but there are plenty of territories around russia that aren t members of nato do you think vladimir putin has his goal set as going into moldova or surrounding countries olaf scholz let me just stick one second to what i already said because of this i decided to to establish an extra budget for spending for military 100 billion euros and that we will increase our spending up to approximately 2 all the years to come and this will really create an army that has the strongest funding between the nato allies and europe and this is what we are sticking to and we will continue to do this margaret brennan which was a big change for germany olaf scholz this is something where we are acting realistically in a different time now and this is necessary to do it what is putin thinking of he is thinking like the imperialists in the 17th 18th 19th century he is thinking that all about the nation is power and that if you are mighty enough you can just take territory of your neighbors and this is an activity and an idea we cannot accept and we will not accept and this is why we are so strong on this question he was always very very critical about nato and the european union and when i talked to him i said you have to accept the european union and that a big alliance of democratic states is building a very strong federal group of states the union a union outside of you and he was very much thinking about nato and i told him nato is not aggressive it s just about defense but he thinks he has just to spend all the money he earns for the for his military abilities and sometimes using it and this is what should fail now and this is why we are doing the right thing when we support the ukraine margaret brennan do you believe that vladimir putin will stop at ukraine olaf scholz i think that all what we do will help to give him the view that this is not working and that he will not be successful margaret brennan so open question on that when it comes to nato territory you now have these two new members finland and sweden potentially joining the alliance it looks like they will will vladimir putin view that as provocative as more of a threat olaf scholz all wondered how he would react to the application of finland and sweden for nato but in the end he accepted it this is how i see it and he has to because it is the decision of these countries that they want to join and it is our decision that we take them because they are really much fitting to the concept of nato democratic states that are very strong with their own activities in defense and this will strengthen the alliance margaret brennan let me ask you about germany your country has earned this reputation of over promising and under delivering when it comes to ukraine you know that you ve heard that criticism ukraine received its very first delivery of german howitzers artillery last week why did it take that long we re in the fifth fifth month olaf scholz so we took a very very hard decision to change political strategies we followed for many decades margaret brennan right olaf scholz never to deliver weapons into a country that is in a conflict and when we decided when i decided to change that practice of our country a lot of other european countries followed and this made it that the group big group of countries are now supporting the ukraine with weapons and do the best germany sent all the weapons we had our our stocks in our military infrastructure and we decided also to deliver new weapons from our industry which takes a longer time because they have to be produced but we did all these things and we continue to do so and when we decide for instance to send the most modern howitzer which you can buy on the world market which is in use in germany it was very difficult to organize that this could be used in the war because you have to have some training and we had ukrainian soldiers in germany and when the training ended in the end they came with the weapon with with the howitzers to ukraine and the margaret brennan but united states is doing that they re providing weaponry within 48 hours sometimes of the president signing and carrying out training olaf scholz i think margaret brennan why did it take this long for germany olaf scholz i think you should understand that there is a difference if a country like the united states spends that much for defense which is a very big long pause investment and you have a lot of weapons at your stocks the howitzers many other countries delivered to ukraine were not the most modern one but they were the stocks so we had to do this and this is how we are continuing you should know we are doing right this things which are necessary for helping now in this very situation in the east of ukraine and this is why we sent the weapons that were necessary and that are necessary there together with the united states and the united kingdom we decided to deliver multi rocket launches to ukraine now which are mb interjects those haven t been delivered yet olaf scholz we are sending them and we are doing it with the means and ways we have and with the training and once again there are a lot of very experienced people who yesterday looked at google and today they know how to do things but i will tell you there are weapons but you have to have your training and you have to have to have it not in ukraine you have to have it here in our countries and so the soldiers have to come to get the training and they are doing it this is what we do with many other things and if you look at this what we are sending from the perspective on of two weeks three weeks four weeks from now we will always see that germany is one of the countries that is doing the most because what we are sending now is the most sophisticated technology you can use there is also long pause anti ballistic there are also weapons we give to the to the ukraine that they can defend the air margaret brennan the anti aircraft missiles you ve promised radar you ve promised olaf scholz that they can defend the city from against the rockets and missiles that were sent there from putin and this is very expensive and very effective technology but they will get it margaret brennan when olaf scholz and this will help a country like odes to support to to defend the country a city like odessa or kyiv margaret brennan but i ask you when because you know that the delays have led to speculation that it s not about getting the supplies it s about the will of the government to actually deliver them and whether there s fear of provoking putin or whether it s years of budget cuts to your defense industry and to your defense budget that have made it just not possible for the german military to act quickly how do you respond to that olaf scholz those who are looking to the facts see that we are doing what is feasible and that we are doing the same things as our allies are doing and that we are using all the means we really have and when you compare what we are delivered to the ukraine and compared with activities of others you will find that we are very much aligned with all the others but the most important thing is that we are not just now supporting ukraine we are changing the way how we spend money for defense and this is the big increase which will change the situation and will give us the chance to be more quick in reaction to a threat that is coming to nato the alliance or to our country and this is why i decided to do this to do this and i will continue to follow this policy making germany strong enough for being the partner all our alliance allies in europe are looking for and all our allies in the transatlantic partnership margaret brennan but you re moving as fast as you can olaf scholz we will move as fast as we can and we are doing margaret brennan i want to ask you about german finances do you know how much right now germany is spending on russian energy olaf scholz it s decreasing the money we are spending and this is why we are why we have decided to change all the imports we have from fossil resources different to the united states we are not producing them ourselves we have to import them and we get them from many places of the world but we change we decided to go out of the import of fossil resources from russia and we did so with the import of coal which is not that difficult because we already imported most of it from other places we decided so to do so with the import of oil and we will go out of this imports in the end of this year which is also something which is now we are preparing for and which is from some region if we just if we look at the whole country will be will be relatively easy because oil is shipped and we are also working on some refineries in the east of germany that are not getting the oil by ship so we are making this feasible for them also and then we are we decided that we will build pipelines to the shores of the north of germany for importing lng this is margaret brennan liquefied natural gas olaf scholz liquefied natural natural gas and this is something i was looking for even when i was the mayor of hamburg because i thought it could be useful to have always the ability to change the the suppliers of your of of what you buy from in case of gas and this is why we are now doing it margaret brennan when we looked at the numbers though when we looked at the numbers germany is providing about 2 billion in aid to ukraine that s roughly what you spend per month on gas from russia on coal on energy supplies so while you re helping the ukrainians financially you re also essentially giving vladimir putin a financial lifeline olaf scholz he cannot buy anything from the money he s getting from us because he will he has all these sanctions on imports for modern technologies and things he is looking for so this is what is making very angry but to be very clear when we decided on sanctions together and with all our allies we said always we will do it in a way that we harm putin more than us and many countries in europe are depending for historical reasons and because they are near to the place and it is the nearest place to get the gas on the inputs of gas and when now whole europe is deciding to go out of this dependence this will change the scenario even on the world market margaret brennan but vladimir putin can use that money elsewhere just not in the west olaf scholz but he cannot buy margaret brennan so is it still 2 billion a month that germany is sending to russia olaf scholz it is always decreasing and i once again say that we decided that we do the sanc that we draft the sanctions in the way that they hurt putin and this is what we do and once again we are now doing real investments into technology in pipelines imports and i know that there people that sometimes think that when you are having taken a decision one afternoon the next morning you have a port and a 40 kilometers pipeline margaret brennan no it takes time olaf scholz but in the real life this is not happening but what we did is deciding on legislation we already did which makes it easy to build these pipelines with the own without any legal restrictions in the shortest time to come and we really hope that the first of them will be able to work in the beginning of the next year and if you see that things like this usually take 2 3 4 5 years and we do it in possibly six months or a bit more in the first part in the first pipelines that are going to work you see that we are very very strong and doing the necessary things for making us independent and this also is and but let me add this when europe is deciding to go out of the import of of gas from russia this will have consequences margaret brennan it ll have huge i mean this is the equivalent of them declaring olaf scholz 100 margaret brennan war on you olaf scholz this margaret brennan by cutting gas supplies to germany this isn t just your choice they re using that as a weapon against you olaf scholz this is obviously the case and this is why i was starting to discuss the question what to do if the gas delivery will be reduced right when i entered office it was my political decision to say that i want to know exactly what we have to do for in case of that and this is why we are not prepared for years but prepared since i am the chancellor of this country and this is why i was able after the war started to go to the parliament and say we will build this pipelines we will build this new ports for liquid liquefied natural gas and just to repeat this when whole europe in some years will be not dependent on the gas from russia it will get gas from other places but this is all together more than 150 nearly 160 billion cubic meters of gas that is now as a new request coming to the world market and this is one of the reasons why we should be very much prepared that we will have high energy prices all over the world in all countries because of the fact that the gas that russia is now supplying will to a certain extent which we will understand in some years will not be able to be sold and so we have to get it from other resources but this is a very tough time for global economy when we did this change margaret brennan it is it is and you run the largest economy in europe what happens in germany matters to the rest of the world so if you are looking at gas supplies potential shortages you could have freezing homes you could have shuttered factories have you decided when and which industries you prioritize which factories get shuttered first olaf scholz we prepare for the situation of having the difficulties may come up because of the energy supply and this is why we decided to make new legislation on storage capacities for gas legislation that is forcing the participants of the market that there should be 90 in the storages storage capacities of germany in the at the beginning of winter and this is now already taking place and the storages are becoming are now filled more than they were one year ago at that time we also decided to change legislation that we make it possible to say we will not use that many gas at in the summer for instance and we will use coal plants for producing electricity and so a lot of decisions are already taking and we are preparing our selves for a very difficult situation as many other european countries do and obviously countries all over the globe are doing thinking about what might come up margaret brennan when will you have to start rationing natural gas and will you have to shut down factories in the months ahead olaf scholz i think we will see how things are now moving how things are how the development will be in the future what we can do at this time is preparing ourselves for being ready to take the necessary decisions and this is what we do and we are all the time preparing with the necessary legislation that we are able to do what is necessary and not just looking for what we could do if we would have the right legal framework we will have it when it s necessary margaret brennan so germany s heavy industry association bdi warned a halt in russian gas deliveries would make recession inevitable the world bank economists say it s going to be very hard to avoid a recession is it inevitable olaf scholz it is not it will be very tough if we will have a shortage of energy supplies obviously all our countries all our all our life is depending on the supply of energy and obviously a lot of countries the most countries of the world are depending on the supply from abroad and so we have to prepare for a difficult situation and as i explained to you very detailed we are preparing and we are prepared margaret brennan but you are still preparing for energy prices to stay high for years how long olaf scholz i m sure that this will be a time where the energy prices will be high all over the globe because of the request and this is one reason why we accelerate our way out of the use of fossil resources you should know that germany decided that we will be a co2 neutral country in 2045 which is less than 25 years and this means that we are now expanding the production of electricity and of en with offshore wind with onshore wind with solar energy that we are expanding the investment into our grid so that we are able to have a completely different industry doing steel doing chemistry doing producing cement with the use of electricity and hydrogen in the end and so we are just going faster into the better world we are already looking for margaret brennan right but inflation is crushing standards of living around the world vladimir putin is weaponizing inflation he s weaponizing food is he right to bet that he can fracture the western alliance by making it harder for europeans and americans and everyone else to afford food in these months ahead olaf scholz you re very right the shortages of food many people in the world are seeing now as a threat to them are the direct consequence of what russia s aggression against ukraine and the war he is imposing on the country you re right that all the rising energy prices are also a direct consequence of his doing and he is he is the one that is doing the wrong things and we are always discussing this with our partners on the globe we are starting an initiative to support countries that have not enough food with food we re supporting the general secretary in finding a way how to get out all the wheat out of ukraine margaret brennan how olaf scholz through the world war he is discussing intensely on ways how this could happen not just with trains what we are organizing together with the ukrainians but also with shipping because this is something where we will find in the next one or two weeks if an agreement between russia ukraine turkey the united nations will be feasible margaret brennan do you really think olaf scholz but coming back to margaret brennan that vladimir putin is going to allow grain to be shipped out of ukraine he s shut down the black sea ports this is a really powerful weapon against the west why would he give that up why would he agree to let the grain out olaf scholz there is one question the general secretary is asking to all and also to putin will you be responsible and the one that is responsible that there is the wheat that is necessary in africa and asia and other places is not going there and so this is why he is working so hard to find a solution and we are supporting him margaret brennan but you olaf scholz once again i think we will face a situation of high prices and we will face a very difficult situation but this we knew right from the beginning when we decided to support ukraine and now it is necessary that we stand united and the outcome of this nato meeting here in madrid the outcome of the g7 meeting we had in germany in weimar and the outcome of all the meetings we had in the european union is we stand united we are united and he will not be able to fracture us margaret brennan if you can t reopen the black sea ports if putin doesn t agree to let the food out of ukraine how do you lower global food prices olaf scholz we are now collecting money for supporting the poorest countries that they will be able to deliver food to the people and this is our international initiative we we organized together with others for food security and we will continue to do that margaret brennan but it risks global instability olaf scholz it is a real problem and it is a real consequence of putin s war and this is why it is even more necessary that we support the people margaret brennan so it also puts pressure to end this conflict sooner what is your timeline for when this can end olaf scholz the conflict will end when putin understands that he will not be successful with idea to conquer part of the territory of his neighbor margaret brennan he controls 20 of ukraine right now according to u s intelligence olaf scholz this is why we are supporting ukraine with financial means with humanitarian aid but also with arms deliveries and why we are doing our sanctions regime together on putin margaret brennan so it has been a hard lesson to learn but as you ve laid out here you know members of the german government have admitted it was a mistake to be so dependent on russia for so long i wonder do you look at that and wonder about china and see the same type of risk that the west is so financially intertwined with beijing that it poses a threat a direct threat olaf scholz coming back to the first aspect of your question i think it was not right that we were not prepared to have at any time the chance to change the one that is delivering gas oil and coal to us so we should have invested all over europe in infrastructure that gives us the ability to change the supply from one day to the other and i think this is the lesson that has been learned in europe and in many other places that you have to be prepared be prepared for a situation like this and this is also the answer to all the other questions coming up if for instance if you look to china it is more the answer just understand that you should have supply change imports not just from one or two countries but from many and that even your business is looking for many other countries so the answer to what we are discussing with china is not to go away from china the answer is to go to the other asian countries and there are very very big nations which i think we have to look at and it was very good when we at g7 came together with the leaders of indonesia and india for instance and they are representing two very strong nations nations with a good and important future in the world to come and if we look around them we find many others and so the answer we all together should give is just do your business with many countries so that you can live with a situation when trouble comes up with one margaret brennan and trouble may come up with china i mean the united states sees it as a threat does germany see china as a threat olaf scholz i think i think the world we are going to live in 2050 will be multipolar many countries will be important the united states long pause russia china the european union and the countries in this union but also indonesia and india or south africa countries from the south of america and the big task of all of us is to make this work not just multipolar with many influential countries looking to to have to looking for their own interests and what what is useful for them but making it the world that is working together so multipolar is not enough multilateral working together for a better future this is what we are should what we should aim for and it is now the time to work for that margaret brennan right olaf scholz better future when we are looking at the midst of this century we are in margaret brennan but you are being diplomatic there nato in this latest statement identified china as a as a threat the secretary general said it poses challenges to our values to our interest and to our security does that mean the west is on a path for a clash with beijing olaf scholz no and exactly if you look at the decisions we took here and we are working on it is that we are just aware of problems that might come up and we are aware of these problems because we are democracies and we are not an aggression to our neighbors to to the rest of the world and we are not aggressive against them margaret brennan and china might be towards taiwan olaf scholz and this is why we say that we are working for a world where aggression is not working and this is why we are making our alliance strong but this is also why we say developing a strategy this gives us the chance to be not dependent and i come back to what i said part of this answer is to look at many other countries in the world that will be strong in the future and make them their partner our partners especially when they are democracies and this is i think the strategy we should follow margaret brennan i m told we are running out of time before i let you go president biden also talks about this potential conflict between democracies and autocracies is that the biggest threat on the horizon what keeps you up at night olaf scholz first i i think the democracies are very strong and they because they have the support of their people they are really having also the future on their side we should be we should look at these things from this perspective but we should be clear about these threats that are coming to our future and this is coming from autocracies yes because they tend to be aggressive and this is an aspect we should be very much aware of and i am and this is why i organized our meeting we had in germany with the g7 group of democratic economically successful democratic states that we invite partners from all over the globe that are also democracies for making it happen that the democracies are strong margaret brennan and by strong it also comes with 100 000 u s troops in europe and 300 000 nato response forces in europe this isn t just diplomacy this is muscle olaf scholz this is and it s necessary margaret brennan mr chancellor thank you for your time this morning olaf scholz thank you
if you look beyond the condescending sanctimonious and unintelligent questioning and pantomime from cbs news margaret brennan there are some very interesting aspects outlined by german chancellor olaf scholz i was looking for how cbs would inject the pending global food shortage into the interview and what narrative angle they would use the coordinated media political talking point russia starving the world comes up in the last third of the interview germany is the largest and most heavily industrialized economy in the european union eu as a result germany makes most of the decisions about how the eu operates former german chancellor angela merkel always played the role of supporting nato however her approach to government was one of the most closed controlling and nationalist hypocrisies within the european union if it was in germany s interest it was done if it was not directly beneficial to germany it was never done merkel s replacement olaf scholz is not that different from his predecessor in regard to the economics of nationalism the predominant view for any german leader however scholz is more of a collaborator an outward looking chancellor seemingly more globally and communally minded than merkel scholz is more accepting of biden usa influence than angela merkel was scholz is also spending more on german military than merkel would ever consider in this interview scholz outlines the conflict in ukraine while overlaying his perspective of russian president vladimir putin as an outcome of their discussions watch margaret brennan mr chancellor thank you so much for making time in your busy schedule for us olaf scholz good morning margaret brennan so i read your biographer says you don t often answer directly but i m going to try my best today you speak with vladimir putin do you think that russia is a terrorist state as president zelenskyy says olaf scholz russia started a very brutal aggression against ukraine a lot of people are dying in ukraine citizens men women children elderly people and this is what we call a really brutal unjustified war that has that russia started and we have to do all to support ukraine and to give ukraine the chance to defend its own integrity and serenity and that is what we are doing when we support the country margaret brennan but calling it a terrorist state in your view doesn t achieve anything olaf scholz it achieves something when we support ukraine with all the financial means we give to the ukraine with all the humanitarian aid with all the weapons we deliver and we will continue doing this as long as it is necessary for supporting ukraine and for avoiding that the outcome of this war is what putin is looking for a dictated peace and this is something that neither the ukraine nor we will accept so it is necessary that we continue with this very strong support and it is necessary that we also continue with all the sanctions we imposed on russia and this is an important aspect from my as i see it we impose sanctions against one russia after the election of crimea not too many but we did margaret brennan back in 2014 olaf scholz and they are still in place we imposed sanctions against russia when they organize the uprisings in the east of donbass in ukraine and they are still in place and all the very heavy sanctions we impose on russia now will be there if there is not a real fair piece from the perspective of ukraine and this is the message i sent to putin and many others do the same and we make it very clear you cannot look for a dictate piece against ukraine margaret brennan when you speak to putin does he acknowledge the sanctions does he acknowledge how much his economy has been hurt or does he just not care olaf scholz i think he cares but he will not really admit it so you get some margaret brennan because it hasn t stopped him olaf scholz idea you get some idea that it really is hurting him and that he understands the deep impacts of our sanctions on his economy and i m always mentioning it because it s necessary to say it just to give you a view on this question if a very advanced country like the united states or germany with a very progressive economy with high tech industries would go out of the world and would just stick to itself we would go down in economic growth very very soon but this is now happening to a country that is not that advanced that is really needing all the technologies from the rest of the world for having a similar standard of living and for having the chance to be part of growth in the world economy and this is now the real damage to the russian economy that they have no chance to do this and it s also hurting them because many of the things even the military weapons they produce themselves are in one or the other way just linked to the economic and technological progress of the world and so they will go back very very far margaret brennan when will russia know when will russia no longer have the ability to continue this fight when will putin run out of weapons run out of funds or can this continue for years olaf scholz no one really knows he has he has he is perhaps the leader of a very great country with a lot of people living there with a lot of means and he is really doing this brutal war with and he prepared for it for very long i think the decision to to do this war was taken one year before it started or possibly earlier because he prepared for it and so he will be able to continue with the war really a long time but this is the message we say to him we are able to support the ukraine as long as necessary for defending its serenity the democracy the rule of law and all the things the people in ukraine are looking for margaret brennan president zelensky has said that he would like to see the war end by the end of the year how does it end and is that realistic olaf scholz it is very difficult to judge whether this is realistic because this is something that is decided on the ground and even more is this one of the reason why we are so active supporting the ukraine with all the different means i already discussed on financial humanitarian support sanctions and delivery of weapons margaret brennan so russia s invasion of ukraine has been called a 9 11 moment for europe a big wake up call do you think that europe and do you think germany was just too complacent for too long olaf scholz i think too many in the world were hoping that we are living in a different world that is different to the experiences of the last century and the centuries before where might and power were deciding on the future of countries and not the rules and the agreements we have between states and we have had an agreement that there should be no attempt to change territory to to change borders to invade the neighbor and this agreement is now canceled by putin and this is what i called site and vendor in german a watershed moment of international politics peace is a danger and this is why it is absolutely necessary that we spend more for defense and germany is going in elite in this question in europe margaret brennan so it was too complacent olaf scholz i think we should have been prepared for that situation and but it is really a big big disaster for the expectations of all of us looking at peace the chances we have in the world are better if there s no attempt to change borders with war and things like that but now we are in that situation and we have to be realistic and this is why we have to do more margaret brennan what is the fundamental nature of this conflict because the head of the british army called it a 1937 moment is that how you see it is that the moment in history we are in right now olaf scholz i think this is a moment where we have to make absolutely clear that we are strong enough that no one should just think about attacking for instance nato territory and this is why i said to my parliament that we are ready and willing to defend any centimeter every centimeter of nato territory in in europe and that we are together with our allies and this is a very clear message to our eastern margaret brennan and that s a clear message that s a clear line but there are plenty of territories around russia that aren t members of nato do you think vladimir putin has his goal set as going into moldova or surrounding countries olaf scholz let me just stick one second to what i already said because of this i decided to to establish an extra budget for spending for military 100 billion euros and that we will increase our spending up to approximately 2 all the years to come and this will really create an army that has the strongest funding between the nato allies and europe and this is what we are sticking to and we will continue to do this margaret brennan which was a big change for germany olaf scholz this is something where we are acting realistically in a different time now and this is necessary to do it what is putin thinking of he is thinking like the imperialists in the 17th 18th 19th century he is thinking that all about the nation is power and that if you are mighty enough you can just take territory of your neighbors and this is an activity and an idea we cannot accept and we will not accept and this is why we are so strong on this question he was always very very critical about nato and the european union and when i talked to him i said you have to accept the european union and that a big alliance of democratic states is building a very strong federal group of states the union a union outside of you and he was very much thinking about nato and i told him nato is not aggressive it s just about defense but he thinks he has just to spend all the money he earns for the for his military abilities and sometimes using it and this is what should fail now and this is why we are doing the right thing when we support the ukraine margaret brennan do you believe that vladimir putin will stop at ukraine olaf scholz i think that all what we do will help to give him the view that this is not working and that he will not be successful margaret brennan so open question on that when it comes to nato territory you now have these two new members finland and sweden potentially joining the alliance it looks like they will will vladimir putin view that as provocative as more of a threat olaf scholz all wondered how he would react to the application of finland and sweden for nato but in the end he accepted it this is how i see it and he has to because it is the decision of these countries that they want to join and it is our decision that we take them because they are really much fitting to the concept of nato democratic states that are very strong with their own activities in defense and this will strengthen the alliance margaret brennan let me ask you about germany your country has earned this reputation of over promising and under delivering when it comes to ukraine you know that you ve heard that criticism ukraine received its very first delivery of german howitzers artillery last week why did it take that long we re in the fifth fifth month olaf scholz so we took a very very hard decision to change political strategies we followed for many decades margaret brennan right olaf scholz never to deliver weapons into a country that is in a conflict and when we decided when i decided to change that practice of our country a lot of other european countries followed and this made it that the group big group of countries are now supporting the ukraine with weapons and do the best germany sent all the weapons we had our our stocks in our military infrastructure and we decided also to deliver new weapons from our industry which takes a longer time because they have to be produced but we did all these things and we continue to do so and when we decide for instance to send the most modern howitzer which you can buy on the world market which is in use in germany it was very difficult to organize that this could be used in the war because you have to have some training and we had ukrainian soldiers in germany and when the training ended in the end they came with the weapon with with the howitzers to ukraine and the margaret brennan but united states is doing that they re providing weaponry within 48 hours sometimes of the president signing and carrying out training olaf scholz i think margaret brennan why did it take this long for germany olaf scholz i think you should understand that there is a difference if a country like the united states spends that much for defense which is a very big long pause investment and you have a lot of weapons at your stocks the howitzers many other countries delivered to ukraine were not the most modern one but they were the stocks so we had to do this and this is how we are continuing you should know we are doing right this things which are necessary for helping now in this very situation in the east of ukraine and this is why we sent the weapons that were necessary and that are necessary there together with the united states and the united kingdom we decided to deliver multi rocket launches to ukraine now which are mb interjects those haven t been delivered yet olaf scholz we are sending them and we are doing it with the means and ways we have and with the training and once again there are a lot of very experienced people who yesterday looked at google and today they know how to do things but i will tell you there are weapons but you have to have your training and you have to have to have it not in ukraine you have to have it here in our countries and so the soldiers have to come to get the training and they are doing it this is what we do with many other things and if you look at this what we are sending from the perspective on of two weeks three weeks four weeks from now we will always see that germany is one of the countries that is doing the most because what we are sending now is the most sophisticated technology you can use there is also long pause anti ballistic there are also weapons we give to the to the ukraine that they can defend the air margaret brennan the anti aircraft missiles you ve promised radar you ve promised olaf scholz that they can defend the city from against the rockets and missiles that were sent there from putin and this is very expensive and very effective technology but they will get it margaret brennan when olaf scholz and this will help a country like odes to support to to defend the country a city like odessa or kyiv margaret brennan but i ask you when because you know that the delays have led to speculation that it s not about getting the supplies it s about the will of the government to actually deliver them and whether there s fear of provoking putin or whether it s years of budget cuts to your defense industry and to your defense budget that have made it just not possible for the german military to act quickly how do you respond to that olaf scholz those who are looking to the facts see that we are doing what is feasible and that we are doing the same things as our allies are doing and that we are using all the means we really have and when you compare what we are delivered to the ukraine and compared with activities of others you will find that we are very much aligned with all the others but the most important thing is that we are not just now supporting ukraine we are changing the way how we spend money for defense and this is the big increase which will change the situation and will give us the chance to be more quick in reaction to a threat that is coming to nato the alliance or to our country and this is why i decided to do this to do this and i will continue to follow this policy making germany strong enough for being the partner all our alliance allies in europe are looking for and all our allies in the transatlantic partnership margaret brennan but you re moving as fast as you can olaf scholz we will move as fast as we can and we are doing margaret brennan i want to ask you about german finances do you know how much right now germany is spending on russian energy olaf scholz it s decreasing the money we are spending and this is why we are why we have decided to change all the imports we have from fossil resources different to the united states we are not producing them ourselves we have to import them and we get them from many places of the world but we change we decided to go out of the import of fossil resources from russia and we did so with the import of coal which is not that difficult because we already imported most of it from other places we decided so to do so with the import of oil and we will go out of this imports in the end of this year which is also something which is now we are preparing for and which is from some region if we just if we look at the whole country will be will be relatively easy because oil is shipped and we are also working on some refineries in the east of germany that are not getting the oil by ship so we are making this feasible for them also and then we are we decided that we will build pipelines to the shores of the north of germany for importing lng this is margaret brennan liquefied natural gas olaf scholz liquefied natural natural gas and this is something i was looking for even when i was the mayor of hamburg because i thought it could be useful to have always the ability to change the the suppliers of your of of what you buy from in case of gas and this is why we are now doing it margaret brennan when we looked at the numbers though when we looked at the numbers germany is providing about 2 billion in aid to ukraine that s roughly what you spend per month on gas from russia on coal on energy supplies so while you re helping the ukrainians financially you re also essentially giving vladimir putin a financial lifeline olaf scholz he cannot buy anything from the money he s getting from us because he will he has all these sanctions on imports for modern technologies and things he is looking for so this is what is making very angry but to be very clear when we decided on sanctions together and with all our allies we said always we will do it in a way that we harm putin more than us and many countries in europe are depending for historical reasons and because they are near to the place and it is the nearest place to get the gas on the inputs of gas and when now whole europe is deciding to go out of this dependence this will change the scenario even on the world market margaret brennan but vladimir putin can use that money elsewhere just not in the west olaf scholz but he cannot buy margaret brennan so is it still 2 billion a month that germany is sending to russia olaf scholz it is always decreasing and i once again say that we decided that we do the sanc that we draft the sanctions in the way that they hurt putin and this is what we do and once again we are now doing real investments into technology in pipelines imports and i know that there people that sometimes think that when you are having taken a decision one afternoon the next morning you have a port and a 40 kilometers pipeline margaret brennan no it takes time olaf scholz but in the real life this is not happening but what we did is deciding on legislation we already did which makes it easy to build these pipelines with the own without any legal restrictions in the shortest time to come and we really hope that the first of them will be able to work in the beginning of the next year and if you see that things like this usually take 2 3 4 5 years and we do it in possibly six months or a bit more in the first part in the first pipelines that are going to work you see that we are very very strong and doing the necessary things for making us independent and this also is and but let me add this when europe is deciding to go out of the import of of gas from russia this will have consequences margaret brennan it ll have huge i mean this is the equivalent of them declaring olaf scholz 100 margaret brennan war on you olaf scholz this margaret brennan by cutting gas supplies to germany this isn t just your choice they re using that as a weapon against you olaf scholz this is obviously the case and this is why i was starting to discuss the question what to do if the gas delivery will be reduced right when i entered office it was my political decision to say that i want to know exactly what we have to do for in case of that and this is why we are not prepared for years but prepared since i am the chancellor of this country and this is why i was able after the war started to go to the parliament and say we will build this pipelines we will build this new ports for liquid liquefied natural gas and just to repeat this when whole europe in some years will be not dependent on the gas from russia it will get gas from other places but this is all together more than 150 nearly 160 billion cubic meters of gas that is now as a new request coming to the world market and this is one of the reasons why we should be very much prepared that we will have high energy prices all over the world in all countries because of the fact that the gas that russia is now supplying will to a certain extent which we will understand in some years will not be able to be sold and so we have to get it from other resources but this is a very tough time for global economy when we did this change margaret brennan it is it is and you run the largest economy in europe what happens in germany matters to the rest of the world so if you are looking at gas supplies potential shortages you could have freezing homes you could have shuttered factories have you decided when and which industries you prioritize which factories get shuttered first olaf scholz we prepare for the situation of having the difficulties may come up because of the energy supply and this is why we decided to make new legislation on storage capacities for gas legislation that is forcing the participants of the market that there should be 90 in the storages storage capacities of germany in the at the beginning of winter and this is now already taking place and the storages are becoming are now filled more than they were one year ago at that time we also decided to change legislation that we make it possible to say we will not use that many gas at in the summer for instance and we will use coal plants for producing electricity and so a lot of decisions are already taking and we are preparing our selves for a very difficult situation as many other european countries do and obviously countries all over the globe are doing thinking about what might come up margaret brennan when will you have to start rationing natural gas and will you have to shut down factories in the months ahead olaf scholz i think we will see how things are now moving how things are how the development will be in the future what we can do at this time is preparing ourselves for being ready to take the necessary decisions and this is what we do and we are all the time preparing with the necessary legislation that we are able to do what is necessary and not just looking for what we could do if we would have the right legal framework we will have it when it s necessary margaret brennan so germany s heavy industry association bdi warned a halt in russian gas deliveries would make recession inevitable the world bank economists say it s going to be very hard to avoid a recession is it inevitable olaf scholz it is not it will be very tough if we will have a shortage of energy supplies obviously all our countries all our all our life is depending on the supply of energy and obviously a lot of countries the most countries of the world are depending on the supply from abroad and so we have to prepare for a difficult situation and as i explained to you very detailed we are preparing and we are prepared margaret brennan but you are still preparing for energy prices to stay high for years how long olaf scholz i m sure that this will be a time where the energy prices will be high all over the globe because of the request and this is one reason why we accelerate our way out of the use of fossil resources you should know that germany decided that we will be a co2 neutral country in 2045 which is less than 25 years and this means that we are now expanding the production of electricity and of en with offshore wind with onshore wind with solar energy that we are expanding the investment into our grid so that we are able to have a completely different industry doing steel doing chemistry doing producing cement with the use of electricity and hydrogen in the end and so we are just going faster into the better world we are already looking for margaret brennan right but inflation is crushing standards of living around the world vladimir putin is weaponizing inflation he s weaponizing food is he right to bet that he can fracture the western alliance by making it harder for europeans and americans and everyone else to afford food in these months ahead olaf scholz you re very right the shortages of food many people in the world are seeing now as a threat to them are the direct consequence of what russia s aggression against ukraine and the war he is imposing on the country you re right that all the rising energy prices are also a direct consequence of his doing and he is he is the one that is doing the wrong things and we are always discussing this with our partners on the globe we are starting an initiative to support countries that have not enough food with food we re supporting the general secretary in finding a way how to get out all the wheat out of ukraine margaret brennan how olaf scholz through the world war he is discussing intensely on ways how this could happen not just with trains what we are organizing together with the ukrainians but also with shipping because this is something where we will find in the next one or two weeks if an agreement between russia ukraine turkey the united nations will be feasible margaret brennan do you really think olaf scholz but coming back to margaret brennan that vladimir putin is going to allow grain to be shipped out of ukraine he s shut down the black sea ports this is a really powerful weapon against the west why would he give that up why would he agree to let the grain out olaf scholz there is one question the general secretary is asking to all and also to putin will you be responsible and the one that is responsible that there is the wheat that is necessary in africa and asia and other places is not going there and so this is why he is working so hard to find a solution and we are supporting him margaret brennan but you olaf scholz once again i think we will face a situation of high prices and we will face a very difficult situation but this we knew right from the beginning when we decided to support ukraine and now it is necessary that we stand united and the outcome of this nato meeting here in madrid the outcome of the g7 meeting we had in germany in weimar and the outcome of all the meetings we had in the european union is we stand united we are united and he will not be able to fracture us margaret brennan if you can t reopen the black sea ports if putin doesn t agree to let the food out of ukraine how do you lower global food prices olaf scholz we are now collecting money for supporting the poorest countries that they will be able to deliver food to the people and this is our international initiative we we organized together with others for food security and we will continue to do that margaret brennan but it risks global instability olaf scholz it is a real problem and it is a real consequence of putin s war and this is why it is even more necessary that we support the people margaret brennan so it also puts pressure to end this conflict sooner what is your timeline for when this can end olaf scholz the conflict will end when putin understands that he will not be successful with idea to conquer part of the territory of his neighbor margaret brennan he controls 20 of ukraine right now according to u s intelligence olaf scholz this is why we are supporting ukraine with financial means with humanitarian aid but also with arms deliveries and why we are doing our sanctions regime together on putin margaret brennan so it has been a hard lesson to learn but as you ve laid out here you know members of the german government have admitted it was a mistake to be so dependent on russia for so long i wonder do you look at that and wonder about china and see the same type of risk that the west is so financially intertwined with beijing that it poses a threat a direct threat olaf scholz coming back to the first aspect of your question i think it was not right that we were not prepared to have at any time the chance to change the one that is delivering gas oil and coal to us so we should have invested all over europe in infrastructure that gives us the ability to change the supply from one day to the other and i think this is the lesson that has been learned in europe and in many other places that you have to be prepared be prepared for a situation like this and this is also the answer to all the other questions coming up if for instance if you look to china it is more the answer just understand that you should have supply change imports not just from one or two countries but from many and that even your business is looking for many other countries so the answer to what we are discussing with china is not to go away from china the answer is to go to the other asian countries and there are very very big nations which i think we have to look at and it was very good when we at g7 came together with the leaders of indonesia and india for instance and they are representing two very strong nations nations with a good and important future in the world to come and if we look around them we find many others and so the answer we all together should give is just do your business with many countries so that you can live with a situation when trouble comes up with one margaret brennan and trouble may come up with china i mean the united states sees it as a threat does germany see china as a threat olaf scholz i think i think the world we are going to live in 2050 will be multipolar many countries will be important the united states long pause russia china the european union and the countries in this union but also indonesia and india or south africa countries from the south of america and the big task of all of us is to make this work not just multipolar with many influential countries looking to to have to looking for their own interests and what what is useful for them but making it the world that is working together so multipolar is not enough multilateral working together for a better future this is what we are should what we should aim for and it is now the time to work for that margaret brennan right olaf scholz better future when we are looking at the midst of this century we are in margaret brennan but you are being diplomatic there nato in this latest statement identified china as a as a threat the secretary general said it poses challenges to our values to our interest and to our security does that mean the west is on a path for a clash with beijing olaf scholz no and exactly if you look at the decisions we took here and we are working on it is that we are just aware of problems that might come up and we are aware of these problems because we are democracies and we are not an aggression to our neighbors to to the rest of the world and we are not aggressive against them margaret brennan and china might be towards taiwan olaf scholz and this is why we say that we are working for a world where aggression is not working and this is why we are making our alliance strong but this is also why we say developing a strategy this gives us the chance to be not dependent and i come back to what i said part of this answer is to look at many other countries in the world that will be strong in the future and make them their partner our partners especially when they are democracies and this is i think the strategy we should follow margaret brennan i m told we are running out of time before i let you go president biden also talks about this potential conflict between democracies and autocracies is that the biggest threat on the horizon what keeps you up at night olaf scholz first i i think the democracies are very strong and they because they have the support of their people they are really having also the future on their side we should be we should look at these things from this perspective but we should be clear about these threats that are coming to our future and this is coming from autocracies yes because they tend to be aggressive and this is an aspect we should be very much aware of and i am and this is why i organized our meeting we had in germany with the g7 group of democratic economically successful democratic states that we invite partners from all over the globe that are also democracies for making it happen that the democracies are strong margaret brennan and by strong it also comes with 100 000 u s troops in europe and 300 000 nato response forces in europe this isn t just diplomacy this is muscle olaf scholz this is and it s necessary margaret brennan mr chancellor thank you for your time this morning olaf scholz thank you

desert sun editorial board good news for millions of california taxpayers the state is giving you a rebate thanks to a 97 billion budget surplus the largest in state history golden state lawmakers voted l week to send about 9 5 billion back to californians the rebates rightly are designed to give more to those who need it most 14 2 million tax filers who have incomes up to 75 000 single 150 000 joint those folks will get 350 per filer plus an additional 350 if they have at least one dependent so that means a couple making minimum wage with two kids would get 1 050 that s significant money especially when gas is over 6 a gallon but the legislature also appropriately is returning funds to people who earn more 2 1 million filers with incomes between 75 000 and 125 000 single 150 000 to 250 000 joint will get 250 per tax filer plus an additional 250 for a dependent s so a single working parent earning 76 000 with twins would get 500 in california 76 000 doesn t go so far especially if one is supporting a family taxpayers above that single filers making between 125 000 and 250 000 couples between 250 000 and 500 000 would get 200 per person plus 200 for any dependent s could they live without it certainly but folks in this bracket have been cut out of almost every other government rebate or credit recently and it s time they received something as well could lawmakers have done more maybe the budget is full of millions for important initiatives like homelessness not to mention pet projects around the state from palm springs plaza theatre to the csusb palm desert student center such line items can look like pork from far away but somehow when they re in your backyard the bacon smells pretty delicious some critics say by putting more money in people s pockets the move could stoke inflation at a time when the federal reserve is trying to fight it we re not worried about that at most it s going to cover 10 to 15 tanks of gas per family we do hope california can efficiently administer the rebates expected in october and prevent fraud if only we had the estimated 20 billion that state officials say was scammed from our employment development department during the covid 19 pandemic we could give everyone three times what they re slated to get by halloween politicians on the right have tried to make hay over the legislature s decision not to halt the scheduled 3 cent increase in the gas tax that went into effect on friday but do the math and you ll find out that s more about political points than actually helping california drivers the 3 cent per gallon increase would cost a motorist 200 once he or she had purchased 6 666 gallons the average american uses somewhere around 600 gallons per year so the rebates will help people much more quickly and the slight increase in the gas tax will help cover what are indubitably going to be more expensive road projects in the years ahead as inflation continues california s gravy train is unlikely to last long a good bit of this year s budget surplus was driven by outsized gains taxpayers reaped in 2021 as the stock market surged now that that s cooling off the state s fiscal picture could shift quickly for the worse so go ahead and spend your rebate if you need to or save it for a rainy day you just might need it to cover a tax increase not so far down the road

bruce conner has made films since 1958 america is waiting 1981 like conner s earlier films is a compilation a wacky assortment of bits and pieces of old newsreels educational films hollywood movies 50s tv commercials and hermetic fragments of industrial film features that one remembers dotting the devotional desert of sunday morning programming long ago conner s films are resurrections of sorts film and photography are perhaps the ultimate forms of mummification and like most resurrections there is something about them that is both ghoulish and uncanny certainly his sculpture and collages were both they are rarely seen now but it was as a maker of assemblages and collages that conner came to film as did joseph cornell whose earliest films were also compilations though it would be simplistic and even wrong to push the analogy too far both collages and compilation films bring disparate elements together within a common field destroying or using context to produce new unforeseen combinations the new unity elaborated by associative links presupposes the varying origins of individual elements and the viewer s memory of their former more familiar context america is waiting is about america about american culture in general and about american self image as articulated by attitudes toward national strength patriotism and a vanished golden age of cherished national ideals it is a film that articulates images of war death and disintegration in a way that pointedly challenges and subverts this legacy it calls to mind some of the stridently political art of the 20th century namely dada photomontage in the hands of raoul hausmann and john heartfield and like their work it makes you laugh conner s most recent films tend to be very short 3 1 2 to 5 minutes but to contain many shots some of which at one frame each are on the threshold of invisibility the welter of seemingly unrelated shots streaks past at a rate that preserves the discursive character of the image flow but thwarts any attempt to read the shots as narrative america is waiting is a black and white sound film whose title is taken from the sound track the david byrne brian eno song from my life in the bush of ghosts the sound track cues the editing in conner s film providing a running commentary on the image as a way of generating a complex of meaning and association the first two shots of the film a long shot of a desert radar installation followed by a close up of some sort of radar screen timed to correspond to the words america is waiting for a message of some sort or other the words of the song are supposedly the ravings of an anonymous san francisco radio announcer are defined as images of watchfulness and vigilance this deliberate descriptive relationship of sound to image is one possibility among other usually more oblique combinations the sound track may suddenly direct attention away from an obvious reading of an image or sequence of shots to favor a more remote interpretation just as it can transfigure an image that would be otherwise merely anomalous or opaque sound captions shots in a way that defines a subset of the larger range of associations the image might evoke sound image relationships presuppose other relationships among shots which have been constructed to complement or contradict the sound track editing is the most crucial problem of all compilation films and this is particularly true of conner s film due to its brevity and concentration the match between the film s first two shots bridges the gap between a long shot and a close up of the same subject this is a conventional type of transition familiar to us from watching movies whether we are aware of it or not conner repeatedly sets us up for image combinations which resist the traditional reading we are invited to attempt thus the next shot is another variety of establishing shot of the capitol building seen from above with an american flag fluttering in the foreground next come two frames of a minuteman statue silhouetted against the sky the linking of these three images does not conform to the editing practices of narrative sequences we learn from hollywood movies but the images do share a common iconography the radar device suggests the same notion of vigilance as the minuteman american ness thus spills over from the minuteman and the capitol onto the radar antenna because the links are less than conventional we are encouraged to substitute others of a more poetic nature we feel compelled to make narrative sense where there seems to be none as if we could make whole what has been irretrievably torn asunder if each shot did not evoke the whole of which it was once a part conner s juxtapositions would not seem as violent as they do the thematic core of america is waiting emerges out of a tangle of correspondences linkages between shots or groups of shots elaborate the film s discursive structure making use of both the images content and formal considerations there are immediate linkages between adjacent shots and global ones between isolated images or sequences that echo each other throughout the film global linkages are easy enough to spot the most common device is repetition the radar screen a close up of a gauge unreadable because its markings are not numbered or otherwise coded and a teardrop shaped cloud of white stars on a black ground become privileged images by virtue of their recurrence extending the notion of repetition into variations on a theme are shots of people firing guns soldiers parading and a shot of a mad doctor opening a coffin which recalls a single frame shot of a military cemetery a distinction must be made between the subject matter of a shot and those formal aspects that leap to the fore when one shot follows another this is necessary if only because all of the image combinations in conner s film are overdetermined they refer to other combinations remote from themselves or formally rhyme with other images and these formal linkages often mask contradictions between the content of adjacent shots contrast between two instances of the same category is a simple rhetorical device which conner uses often the minuteman is followed by modern soldiers running for cover in an elaborately choreographed scene which ends inside a fallout shelter the courage and simplicity of the minuteman is contrasted with the well equipped retreat of the contemporary soldier another kind of linkage spread out across a sequence of shots literalizes the psychoanalytic notion of dramatization setting up a theatrical situation within the film curtains appear to be flung open revealing an audience in a movie theater watching a western on a screen set back behind a proscenium this is followed by a medium shot of a cowboy on horseback captioned hero firing his six shooter at an unknown target the image within an image is a stage within a stage the picture comes to life projecting us into the space of the lone rider on the screen within the screen the next two shots are of horsemen falling presumably shot by rider no 1 a sense of narrative is revived only to be shattered by black frames shifting to a more symbolic mode where the context dictates that a black spot on white ground be read as a bullet hole and a cloud of stars as the departed soul frequently linkages evoke a train of thought a shot of mt rushmore is followed by one of broken rocks falling into a bin mt rushmore is thus reduced to a pile of rubble despite the abruptness of the cut we are able to recognize stone as the common element and to extend the juxtaposition to ideas about our crumbling national heritage the imminence of decline or the erosion of american values related to this strategy is the use of what noël carroll calls verbal images verbal images are images that can be reduced to a word or a sentence when placed within the appropriate context as with metaphor context is all important it is context that enables the suggested word or sentence to be extended easily to the broader thematic concerns of the film in one sequence the camera moves in on a world globe floating in black space as if the viewer were about to crash land on the united states and the film stock itself appears to disintegrate leaving only the white projector beam the message the world is falling apart or the country is going to pieces is clear and is supported by the images of war death and destruction that have been seen up to that point one of the most interesting things about conner s editing is the way one shot elicits a conventional reading such that it retroactively illuminates relationships of a host of preceding shots this works rather like a joke one sequence was what might be called a delayed reaction shot the pivotal image is of elsa lanchester in the bride of frankenstein at the climactic moment when the monster s bride to be beholds her betrothed for the first time in conner s film the shot is only two frames long and is set off by black and white frames that precede and follow it respectively this creates a flicker effect that gives the lanchester shot a negative or solarized appearance in between the first black frames and the lanchester shot is a single frame of a military cemetery with uniform rows of gravestones while just before the black frames there is a brief fade in to two men seated at a desk talking on the telephone whether or not one knows that the lanchester shot was a reaction shot her scream is so obviously a reaction to something that it is impossible to resist linking it with the two preceding shots backtracking still further the previous sequence showed mps marching soldiers on a battlefield shrouded in clouds of smoke and marines parading all of which when followed by the cemetery shot suggest that all the soldiers are dead and that lanchester is responding to this unfortunate piece of news such use of a conventional editing device forces a sudden shift of perspective the character of lanchester is made to mediate that shift cueing us as to what our response is supposed to be that we can be made to identify with the bride of frankenstein is the propagandistic strength of film more explicit causal connections occur as well the clearest instance of this is near the end where a close up of a detonator with wires trailing off it is followed just after a disembodied hand pushes the plunger by a shot of a girl running along an alley as bombs explode around her connections of this kind are commonplace in all movies but as in the delayed reaction shot conner s causal connections tend to generate others they radiate outward from a cognitive center elaborating a context in which other less conventional linkages can also be made the shot before the one of the detonator is implicated retroactively in the causal structure that produces the explosion a homely assortment of moms and dads and kids pledges allegiance to the flag as a superimposed question mark burgeons from the center of the screen the outcome of the act of pledging allegiance is depicted in the two shots that follow which create a causal link between the hand that pledges and the hand that presses the button the same group appears in the shot after the explosion this time dissolving into the silhouette of a hanged man whose body hovers briefly over the fading image of the american flag a second shot of the detonator conveys the results of what is now seen to be an image of mindless patriotism continuity vs discontinuity is another global structural device found in the organization of sequences the sequence in which two boys one outfitted with a walkie talkie the other sporting an oversize space helmet equipped with a communicating device and an all purpose grenade rocket pellet gun coordinate an attack upon an invisible opponent is a model of conventional shot reverse shot cross cutting obviously recut by conner this is a sequence in which match cutting and fluid camera movement are pursued to the point of parody as the only sustained narrative action in the film it affords an unexpected sense of release the climax is a synthetic cut in which a burst of toy gunfire explodes like fireworks into a cloud of stars over a pot full of an almond joy like mixture of milk chocolate and nuts this image of fertilization contradicts the principle of editing that presumes continuity of action within a given context of adjacent spaces conner reinstates the rules so that he may more forcibly suspend them the sexual content of the image is clear after this nutty transubstantiation a shot of what is ostensibly the finished candy bar materializes superimposed over the pot of chocolate as if the gunshot stars had fallen into the chocolate and produced a third thing as their literal offspring the transformation effected by the cut resolves into an end product making explicit this juvenile confused image of sexual intercourse in which the offspring is a turd the next sequence which is the most discontinuous in the film appears to be unleashed by the promise of oral and anal gratification it illustrates a kind of formal linkage which is basic to conner s editing technique as it addresses a subcontinent of imagery to which he is particularly attached encompassing images as diverse as those of an arrid extra dry cotton ball test a man in bed tormented by a nighttime cough a pair of scientists or shop teachers lost in thought and a serried array of dials this sequence is held together by schematic diagrams or titles which hover over the contents of each shot these serve as abstract representations of concepts or ideas thus a white line turning around a central point reads as a clock even in the absence of the rest of its face and signifies the familiar time lapse we know from tv commercials the white line turns and the cotton ball falls off the dry arrid hand the way in which these diagrams structure the shots meaning is analogous to the use of the words what can be done about larry s personal problems superimposed over the reflective gaze of one of the shop teachers the two forms of captioning verbal and diagrammatic merge in a shot of mysterious dials which a white x divides into quadrants filled with question marks the sound track refrain no will whatsoever further reinforces the unity of the series simpler formal devices in the film include reversals of black and white and of direction an air conditioner on a moving sidewalk in the foreground glides by a group of back lit musicians while in the next shot a top loading automatic washer passes in the opposite direction after the apparent disintegration of the film stock described earlier the world is born again as an image reassembles a star emerges from somewhere in the midwest enlarging to white out the screen this figure ground reversal is inverted when next teddy roosevelt s face grins out from a cut out of the same star in a white ground which spreads out as in the previous shot conner constructs a formal rhyme of great beauty in the process of metaphorically representing u s saber rattling by identifying america with rough riding teddy who becomes a star encapsulated space child the offspring of a nova born of some cosmic catastrophe one remarkable quality of many of conner s images is their didactic tone whatever their provenance they share a common purpose with educational films and tv commercials to convince to inculcate conner seeks to persuade us of the bankruptcy of the politics and way of life promoted by american public education hollywood and madison avenue he accomplishes this with the propagandistic images produced by those very institutions armed with madison avenue s secret weapon the subliminal shot conner emerges as a kind of popular mechanix propagandist of the unconscious among the many shots that possess a certain dreamlike improbability is one that is particularly arresting if only because it is so hard to decide what is going on in it the difficulty hinges upon an inscrutable apparatus in which a narrow black screen encased in a black box about the size of a console television set one of the larger models displays a single horizontal line of indecipherable characters moving across from right to left as the camera pulls back from a close up of the screen we see a woman at a microphone and a boy and girl seated quietly in a classroom is the woman at the microphone responding to a hidden interlocutor or is what she says rendered up in code by the receiving apparatus is this the message america has been waiting for we will never know what that message is but we are being told what kind of message conner s film might be it is a film whose message like the one on the luminous screen of the mysterious black box must be deciphered in order to be understood in this shot the attentive children recall the situation of the viewer confronted with the hermetic text of conner s film just as the microphone alludes to the annotative function of the byrne eno song like most movies conner s film is a dual text composed of sound and image that it must be read differently from most movies is a result of its peculiar structure because of that structure and its dependence upon complex contextual shifts much of the interpretive burden is born by the sound track which forms part of that context the sound track s irony is internal it undermines the rhetorical intent of its own lyrics which by themselves are little more than an appeal for old style gunboat diplomacy quick rearmament and a host of other americanisms that words like confidence will and integrity are meant to conceal the explicit irony of the song which is that of codewords and of the lyric s hortatory tone provides a clue to the hidden ironies of the film which are in turn compounded by specific sound image relationships it is after all the sound track that proposes the notion of a message of some sort or other which if properly understood will set america back on her feet again this message is constantly alluded to by shots of radar antennae gauges walkie talkies and finally the obscure telemetry of the black receiving device and the notion of waiting of expectancy that is inscribed in this film is a sad one indeed there is a sense albeit a limited one in which america is waiting structurally recalls dreams daydreams hallucinations and jokes the raw material of psychoanalytic theory the use of verbal images reminds us of freud s emphasis on language when analyzing the manifest content of dreams films unlike dreams do not require knowledge of the filmmaker s life and childhood experiences the collective consciousness of popular culture provides the equivalent of the individual unconscious freud compares the interpretation of dreams to the act of deciphering a rebus which he contrasts with treating the same rebus as a pictorial composition that on its own makes no sense the corpus of commercial cinema creates a set of ready made editing dos and don ts that provides contextual reference it is the context that comes from without that informs both conner s construction of the film and our reading of it retracing the filmmaker s steps forces us to reenact his discoveries this is film used as an instrument of discovery we are the active participants in conner s propagandistic spectacle even though we may at first feel ourselves merely to have awoken from a dream to understand it we must reconstruct it scott cook is a doctoral candidate in the department of cinema studies

stonington town officials have summarized the input they received from the approximately 70 residents who attended an initial public workshop last month on possibly regulating short term rentals and are now planning a second forum on july 20 from 5 30 to 7 30 p m at the velvet mill at the first meeting on june 20 residents wrote their comments on whiteboards about five topics such as what are the benefits and drawbacks of short term rentals later they were asked to put a star next to the ideas and or concerns that were most important to them first selectwoman danielle chesebrough said conducting the forum in this fashion helped avoid the confrontation of a traditional public hearing and made people more comfortable sharing their opinions at the july 20 meeting the plan is to have small group discussions about various aspects of regulating short term rentals and then offer each group a chance to summarize their discussion with the larger group maybe some consensus will develop on some of the items chesebrough said a third meeting will likely be held at which time town officials may present a proposed regulation for residents to consider and discuss a town meeting would be needed for residents to approve any regulation i think we can do better than what we are doing now which is nothing chesebrough said about overseeing short term rentals she said the town may be able to start out with some initial rules that can later be revised among the actions residents suggested at the initial workshop is that the town should ensure home capacity limits are not exceeded enforce current rules on noise and parking allow short term rentals only in an owner occupied dwelling provide property owners phone numbers to adjacent neighbors and limit the number of short term rentals in a certain area another suggestion as to restrict party houses coincidentally two weeks ago airbnb made permanent its temporary ban on what it calls party house properties which can result in owners and renters being removed from using the popular rental platform vrbo has a similar rule others at the workshop said the town should not ban short term rentals negatively impact rentals that have no record of disturbances require rentals to be owner occupied or restrict the time of a rental outside of the forum the town has received suggestions from numerous residents among these are defining short term rentals as businesses and therefore prohibited in residential zones if they occur more than twice in any year and creating an association of local short term rental operators that would work with the town develop best practices and communicate with operators about complaints and enforcement others include requiring off street parking for owners and guests limiting the number of rentals owned by an individual or business limiting the number of days per year that a unit can be occupied by short term guests and requiring all short term rentals to be registered and taxed one resident wrote that the state is an extremely expensive place to live and the town should not interfere with its residents ability to make money and definitely should not be putting regulations in place where we would have to pay for permits or pay some additional taxes for this no permits no additional taxes no regulations another pointed out the homes that i ve seen purchased for short term rentals have all been updated and look way nicer than they did before the yards have been cleaned up the homes have been painted or resided and all look much nicer one renter wrote we have built an extensive what to do guide for people to eat out shop and visit local sites supporting and stimulating the local economy with a special focus on small businesses to further support small businesses we give guests who stay a bottle of wine from saltwater farm vineyard and have stocked the house with local soaps from the main street soap emporium to name a few examples the town says it welcomes input ahead of the july 20 next meeting and that can be done by email phone or in person meetings anyone with input can contact director of economic and community development susan cullen at scullen stonington ct gov or chesebrough at dchesebrough stonington ct gov the town is among several others in southeastern connecticut such as groton waterford ledyard and noank that are deciding how to deal with short terms rentals listed on sites such as airbnb and vrbo the rentals have resulted in complaints from some residents about noise parties and traffic from what they say are commercial operations in residential neighborhoods other impacts include a reduction in long term housing stock and decreasing demand for hotel rooms but supporters of the increasingly popular practice say renting their properties help them pay tax and mortgage bills in december 2016 a large crowd of short term renters and opponents of the practice attended a planning and zoning commission forum to tell members how they felt about the practice two months later the planning and zoning commission decided that the town s zoning regulations do not regulate short term rentals and it would not enforce the violation notices the town had issued to people who rented out their homes former director of planning jason vincent said at the time it would be up to someone to propose an ordinance to regulate the practice that would then have to be approved by residents at a town meeting at the time planning staff had interpreted existing zoning regulations to mean that short term rentals of less than 30 days is not a permitted use in the town s residential zones complicating the issue is that for many years homes and cottages especially in waterfront communities such as lord s point and masons island have been rented to people during the summer months in recent years short term rentals in mystic have become popular

commentary as hong kong or perhaps more accurately its government prepared to celebrate a quarter century as a special autonomous region sar of china and the inauguration of a new chief executive beijing s hand picked candidate john lee the atmosphere was more one of manufactured gaiety than genuine joy district councils and sundry patriotic organizations put up gaudy decorations at the same time the media speculated about whether chinese leader xi jinping would or would not show up reminding this observer of the line from the nursery rhyme the stockings were hung by the chimney with care in hope that saint nicholas would soon be there if so commentators said it would be the first time in over two years that xi had appeared outside china though how much hong kong ought to be considered outside china is questionable and indeed sometimes the press added outside mainland china as clarification in any case xi was already on record for affirming his deep feelings for hong kong with a people s daily article headlined hong kong s development is always close to my heart presenting a compilation of his statements that highlighted his care for the sar over the decades putting an end to the suspense xi arrived though not by plane but via high speed rail greeted by an enthusiastic albeit carefully vetted group waving identical tiny flags he didn t stay long inspecting the city s high tech area attending a banquet and then taking the train back to the mainland he came back the next day for john lee s inauguration where he made a speech that in true orwellian fashion praised the one country two systems policy that he had brutally destroyed and declared that there is no reason to change such a good system and it must be adhered to in the long run hong kong s unique status and advantages must be maintained while upholding the central authorities jurisdiction and the administration of patriots xi quickly returned home after skipping the traditional flag raising ceremony due

pouring rain as the british flag was pulled down and the chinese flag raised typical was a statement by financial secretary paul chan mo po expressing confidence in the future development of what he described as a critical juncture of maintaining stability while seeking prosperity although delicately admitting that the city had experienced some turbulence in the past it had said chan quickly returned from chaos to stability with the passage of the national security law nsl to ensure future prosperity he advised hong kong must further integrate itself into china s overall national development in fact the 2019 demonstrations chan alluded to were but the culmination of escalating levels of popular protest ever since beijing soon after assuming jurisdiction began to erode the pledges it had given britain in the handover agreement in 1999 when china s rubber stamp legislature the national people s congress overruled the hong kong court of final appeals judgment on the right of abode in 2003 over a proposed national security law in the 2014 umbrella movement when beijing reneged on its promise for direct elections and finally in the 2019 uprising when up to 2 million people took to the streets to oppose a bill that would allow the extradition of hong kong residents to the mainland to be tried under its harsh and opaque legal system their efforts failed resulting in the 2020 nsl that punished advocates of secession subversion terrorist activities and collusion with a foreign country or with external elements to endanger national security conveniently ambiguous the law in effect allowed for prosecution for almost anything the authorities deemed to endanger national security including people whose only offense was that they had contributed to a fund to defray the legal expenses of those already arrested before the law went into effect as banners floated aloft the atmosphere at ground level was more somber the mood ranged from sullen to fearful apprehensive and resigned to indifferent many pro democracy activists had fled the country or been arrested the latter including the 90 year old cardinal joseph zen though he was later released on bail cardinal

exploiting the campus for political purposes dissolved the school s student union descending to the level of the absurd a stamp issued to commemorate hong kong s 25th handover changed the color of the students school uniforms from yellow to white presumably due to its association with the 2014 umbrella movement the bright yellow umbrellas that the protestors used to shield themselves from tear gas attacks resulted in the use of the color itself arousing suspicion in another example of historical nihilism school textbooks to be used from fall 2022 state that hong kong was never a british colony since the qing government did not recognize the treaties of cession the document of which original copies survive bears the government s signature and seal students will also learn in their new textbooks that external forces instigated the 2019 social unrest which threatened national security the president of the hong kong lawyers association chan chak ming declared that the nsl was not particularly harsh since it did not impose death penalties and despite the offices of hong kong s remaining independent media and human rights organizations being raided by police their files seized

news interpreted by hong kong watch ceo benedict rogers now living in london as a euphemism for any news the government dislikes the major question is whither hong kong carrie lam s and chan chak ming s views notwithstanding there is general agreement that hong kong s once vibrant civil society is dead in the words of a long time resident hong kong is being treated like a naughty pupil being made to stand in a corner as long as the teacher pleases people are leaving if they can although the numbers are not enormous she adds those who emigrate tend to be from the professional and intellectual strata with those remaining either apolitical or unable to move for personal or business reasons in a best case scenario for the government mainland professionals who have never had the rights that hong kong people enjoyed and therefore will not protest their absence will fill the places left by those who have emigrated how much this will affect hong kong s ability to further integrate itself with the mainland while simultaneously maintaining its status as a leading financial center remains to be seen hong kong has consistently declared itself open for business but how many investors will come is a major unknown many financial analysts see the hong kong stock exchange as overly dependent on chinese capital with chinese companies accounting for almost 80 percent of its market london s financial times quoted former hkex board member david webb saying they should ve done much more over the last 30 years to promote hong kong as the asian financial hub and not just a mainland chinese

district during sunset in hong kong china on march 11 2021 tyrone siu reuters although some businesses have left or have transferred assets elsewhere most seem willing to stay put and even cooperate these include corporations that style themselves champions of liberal values such as disney whose streaming service dropped an episode of the simpsons when it launched its platform in hong kong the offending segment showed a large sign in tiananmen square that read on this site in 1989 nothing happened when the government was concerned that few voters would go to the polls for a patriots only election whose results were never in doubt many big businesses hastened to cooperate for example big four accounting giant kpmg offered employees a day off after certifying that they had cast their ballots and the asia chair of the prestigious american law firm davis polk and wardell pronounced himself honored to speak at a hong kong government forum commemorating the passage of the nsl having publicly endorsed it a year before by saying that at the heart of everything hong kong government s success is the rule of law it is difficult to believe that an official of an internationally renowned law firm regarded the nsl as the rule of law the official was later shamed into withdrawing saying again incredibly that his agreement to participate did not reflect an endorsement or support of any topics discussed or individuals or organizations involved the latter is likely to triumph in a conflict between ethics and profit however there will be a cost homogenization with the mainland while somehow insisting that hong kong can remain unique is logically impossible blessed with scenic beauty an ideal geographic location and state of the art infrastructure hong kong will continue to

executive teams of large u s corporations are becoming increasingly partisan resulting in a political polarization of corporate america according to a new study from the national bureau of economic research this polarization has implications for the values of firms as well the study found while workplace diversity in recent years has received a lot of attention particularly in relation to gender and color political diversity is clearly moving in the opposite direction historically the workplace has been more politically diverse offering opportunity for cross party relationships compared to other settings such as the family neighborhood or voluntary organizations but it s no longer the case at the corporate leadership level according to researchers from boston college university of chicago and cornell university they conducted their study by analyzing voter registration records for senior executives at s p 1500 companies between 2008 and 2020 in contrast to previous studies the new study argues that voter registration data rather than political contributions is more reliable for inferring political preferences of executives partisanship is defined by the researchers as the extent to which a single political party dominates political views within the same executive team and they found that over the years c suites of public u s firms are increasingly dominated by one political party more specifically our measure of partisanship is the probability that two randomly drawn executives are affiliated with the same political party we find a 7 7 percentage point increase in the partisanship of executive teams over our sample period they wrote in a paper the rise in partisanship is mostly a result of executives increasing tendency to associate with those who share their political beliefs according to the authors our results show executives who share the same political party are 34 more likely to work in the same firm they wrote most business leaders vote republican the study also found that the majority of executives lean republican the average share of democratic and republican executives is 31 0 and 69 0 respectively the paper stated the researchers discovered that the proportion of republican executives climbed from 63 percent in 2008 to 68 percent in 2020 while the proportion of unaffiliated executives decreased this they feel is another reason why the executive population has become more politically homogenous additionally partisan division among executives is growing across states in other words executives in texas and ohio are becoming more republican whereas executives in california and new york are becoming more democratic only voter registration records from nine states including california colorado illinois massachusetts north carolina new jersey new york ohio and texas were used to measure the political affiliation in the study this is because many states limit access to voter registration data the researchers noted in their study they also examined if political affiliation may explain why ceos or top managers leave their positions and they discovered that executives whose political beliefs differ from the majority of the team had a greater likelihood of quitting the company than executives whose political views match with the team performance then do shareholders benefit from the exit of ceos who are politically misaligned to help answer this question researchers analyzed abnormal stock performances around the resignation announcements of the executives they observed trends that strongly indicate that the exits of politically mismatched leaders are detrimental to firm value hence some aspects of the rising polarization among u s executives have negative consequences for firms shareholders the study concluded voicing political opinions the authors also raised the question of whether governments should be worried about political discrimination in the workplace traditionally employment discrimination issues have centered on gender ethnicity sexual orientation and age in contrast u s federal law and many state laws do not ban private firms from discriminating against employees based on political opinions one of the authors of the paper elisabeth kempf a faculty research fellow at the university of chicago said democratic executives may have become more outspoken on progressive issues over the years for example the democratic executives are increasingly giving to the democratic party she said in a podcast referring to political donations she added that this is consistent with the notion that maybe executives have become more outspoken on progressive issues or are more openly democrat many businesses today don t hold back when it comes to making public statements about current political events large american companies for example have recently gotten involved in the abortion debate following the supreme court s decision to overturn roe v wade a growing number of executives announced that they are changing their health insurance plans to pay for employees out of state abortions political activism at the c suite level can sometimes have negative effects on businesses as witnessed in the example of the walt disney company the company lost its special privileges in florida after disney ceo bob chapek publicly criticized the state s new parental rights in education law that prohibits classroom instruction on sexual orientation or gender identity in kindergarten through 3rd grade

clinical study ibi112 may provide a more effective treatment option for patients with inflammatory bowel disease including ulcerative colitis and other autoimmune diseases about ulcerative colitis ulcerative colitis is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by mucosal inflammation of the colon and rectum with typical symptoms such as recurrent diarrhea mucus pus and blood stool with abdominal pain and urgency uc is a serious threat to physical health and has an impact on daily life and mental health for patients uc is common in europe and north america and in china the prevalence rate has been increasing gradually in the past 20 years with a prevalence rate of 11 6 100000 uc is more common diagnosed in young and middle aged people the clinical treatment of uc is mainly medication and surgical treatment thiopurine is the most traditional immunosuppressant however the incidence of adverse reactions is high in terms of biologics anti tnf α monoclonal antibodies have problems such as loss of response caused by immunogenicity in recent years drugs targeting il12 and il 23 have shown advantages in efficacy and safety in the treatment of uc at present there is no

the major central banks were slow to respond to price pressures as the economies emerged from the unprecedented depths of the covid crisis they have pivoted toward more aggressive rate hikes the conversion at the federal reserve has been stark in an unusual admission federal reserve chair powell acknowledged that the high may cpi and the rise in the university of michigan s consumer inflation expectations prompted the 75 bp hike rather than the 50 bp move that had been signaled the last minute change left the kansas city fed president george in a difficult position this noted hawk dissented at the june meeting favoring sticking with the 50 bp guidance which hardly makes her a dove powell pledged the fed s unconditional commitment to reining in inflation even though he acknowledged that a 75 bp increase is unusual powell indicated another one of that magnitude or 50 bp was likely this month given the link to the cpi and household inflation surveys that powell drew those reports july 13 and july 15 respectively may overshadow the employment report the expeditious move to neutrality and beyond seems to mean as fast as possible without surprising the market unnecessarily that said we expect the economic and price data to moderate encouraging the fed to signal a slower pace of rate hikes after the july hike the european central bank is widely expected to initiate its normalization cycle at its july 21 meeting although the meeting will not include updated forecasts making it an unusual move it has without a doubt signaled its intentions some are still making a case for a 50 bp move but it seems unlikely still the market will be looking for clues into how low a bar it is for a 50 bp hike at the september meeting in addition to the forward guidance the other important element of the ecb meeting is an update about the new tool to help combat an undesirable widening of the interest rate spreads among the members the central bank argues that widening spreads interrupts the transmission of its monetary policy in the previous sovereign debt crisis the ecb unveiled a facility open market transaction to do just that and neutralize the impact on the balance sheet however the strings attached or what is euphemistically called conditionality proved sufficiently onerous as to deter any member requesting it at the end of last year talks revolved around similar issues and the ecb secured extra flexibility discretion in reinvesting maturing proceeds the contrast between the us and europe on one hand and japan and china on the other is stark after many years of falling short japan s core measure of inflation has met the 2 target but the boj insists it is transitory for the record the market seems to agree with the boj s assessment the boj s forecast sees core inflation finishing the year slightly below 2 and falling to 1 1 next year and in 2024 the median forecast in the bloomberg survey puts japan s core inflation at 1 7 this year 1 2 next and 0 7 in 2024 the boj is committed to its current monetary stance and defending its 0 25 cap on the 10 year jgb bought a record 80 bln of government bonds one day in mid may the divergence of monetary policy is the main driver of the yen s weakness and as global rates rise and the yen weakens there is upside pressure on the japanese yields the 30 year yield has increased by more than 20 bp over the past month to 1 24 june was the seventh consecutive monthly increase while the 10 year is flat near its cap and is net net little changed over the past four months as the boj defends its cap it underscores the divergence in monetary policy weighing on the yen and trapping policymakers and investors in a vicious cycle it is not clear how japan exits its policy but others like the swiss national bank s cap on the swiss franc or australia s cap on the three year yield proved very messy we suspect it will exit its yield curve strategy after it is clear that us rates have peaked china s covid experience and extreme policy response have disrupted the economy beijing prefers fiscal regulatory and moral suasion and has used monetary policy sparingly china s economy is recovering from the extreme covid related lockdowns that had shut down areas that accounted for almost half of the country s gdp monetary policy has been brought to bear as much as one might be expected given the modest cpi 2 1 year over year in may china s producer prices have fallen for seven consecutive months through may and at 6 4 the year over year pace is less than half of its peak 13 5 in october 2021 fiscal and regulatory policy alongside moral suasion has been relied upon few if any expect china to reach its growth target of around 5 5 this year the world bank s updated forecast dovetail with market expectations median forecast in bloomberg s survey that see growth this gdp rising 4 3 this year and rising to 5 2 in 2023 more support for the economy may be forthcoming and many observers expect a reduction in reserve requirements and or another cut in administered rates however the zero covid policy continues depressing economic activity and disrupting supply chains anticipating a recovery has seen chinese stocks outperform in june the csi 300 rose by about 9 6 recovering about half of what it lost in the first five months of the year toward the end of june disappointing economic data the dramatic cut in russian gas shipments to europe and the tightening of financial conditions spurred concerns of a recession in most high income countries as a result the markets shaved the extent of tightening the major central banks would deliver this year while the tightening cycle is expected to extend into q1 23 the futures markets have discounted a cut by the federal reserve and the bank of canada by the end of next year at the risk of burying the lead this is the new new thing in the capital markets for the first time since the onset of the pandemic the fear of a recession is moving into ascendancy eclipsing inflation in all but the very short term to be sure the market continues to expect the major central banks but japan and middle income countries to continue to raise interest rates in the coming months however investors are strongly entertaining the possibility that the federal reserve s rate hiking cycle lasts around a year which is shorter than previously expected the us dollar trended higher against the euro and yen since bottoming on january 6 2021 yes that january 6 he rate differential story and the trajectory of monetary policy were a big part of the story in past cycles short term rate differentials often peak before the dollar although the news stream from europe is poor and the bank of japan appears committed to its extraordinary monetary policy the dollar s 18 month rally may be coming to an end all of the constituents of bannockburn s world currency index bwci but the russian rouble fell against the dollar in june however it appears to be forging a bottom which coincides with a broad dollar top interestingly most of the emerging market currencies fared better than most of the major currencies the russian rouble was strongest with a nearly 15 5 gain against the greenback we do not put much confidence in the price as a reflection of how the war is going or the domestic economy by its official figures the economy contracted by 4 8 in may after shrinking 2 8 in april it is experiencing a positive terms of trade shock and appears to have found some offsets to the bans being implemented by ukraine s allies capital controls forcing repatriating for earnings have been eased but have not been removed and restrictions on sales by foreign investors remain in place with a 2 1 weight in the bwci the rouble s appreciation was worth about 0 32 index points but instead the bwci fell by almost 0 90 points in june the chinese yuan with a 21 7 weighting slipped by 0 4 the least followed by the indian rupee 3 8 weighting which fell by almost 1 7 the mexican peso 1 5 was the third best performer with a 2 3 loss among the emerging markets that leaves the brazilian real which posted the sharpest decline almost 10 0 and the south korean won it fell by about 4 7 it turns out that the won s decline largely matched the japan s yen s 5 1 loss south korea is maintaining export competitiveness the won is the second weakest currency in asia this year it has depreciated by about 8 5 compared with the yen s 15 decline on the other hand the china seem less reactive to the drop in the yen to 22 year lows the yuan has fallen by about 5 this year among the major currencies in the bwci the australian dollar 1 9 weighting was the second worst performer after the yen falling by about 3 7 the euro 19 1 weighting was off 2 3 decline the canadian dollar 2 4 weighting eased by around 1 7 and sterling 4 weighting depreciated by about 3 4 dollar the federal reserve has been explicit it is determined to push inflation back to its target and hopes that a recession can be avoided to do so it aims at weakening demand to drive down price pressures through the tightening of financial conditions it already seems to be having an impact fed officials emphasize the strength of the labor market as an indication of the ability of the economy to withstand the reduction of monetary support however cracks are already materializing the foreign exchange market may be particularly sensitive to further deterioration the four week average of weekly initial jobless claims has risen by more than 30 over the past two months nonfarm payrolls are slowing the 250k increase expected in june july 8 would be the least since the end of 2020 the year over year increase in average hourly earnings is expected to have eased for the third consecutive month in june price pressures more generally may be coming off the boil core cpi has fallen for two months through may and the core pce deflator fell for the third month in may the accumulation of disappointing economic data saw the market for the first time price in a rate cut in q4 23 in the meantime the market is pricing in a little more than a 70 chance of another 75 bp rate hike at the july 26 27 fomc meeting euro the european central bank meets on july 21 it will hike its key rate for the first time since 2011 a 25 bp rate has been signaled but some officials still seem to be pushing for a 50 bp hike the swaps market has about a 15 chance of a 50 bp move by the end of the year the market is pricing in about 140 bp in rate increases down from 180 bp seen in mid june the ecb is expected to provide more details on the new tool it is devising to combat unwarranted widening of interest rate differentials that hamper the transmission of monetary policy the tightening of financial conditions the disruption from russia s invasion of ukraine and the energy shock europe s natural gas benchmark rose nearly 60 in june are leading to a sharp deceleration of growth the risk of a recession appears to be increasing the euro peaked in june near 1 0775 as the ecb s press conference following the june 9 meeting got underway it fell to about 1

by gayatri suroyo and stefanno sulaiman jakarta reuters a decade ago indonesia earned the unwelcome label of being among the so called fragile five emerging markets economies highly vulnerable to capital outflows and a currency slump whenever global interest rates rise but fast forward to a new round of monetary tightening led by the u s federal reserve southeast asia s biggest economy and its capital markets have shown remarkable resilience throwing a spotlight on whether the situation has fundamentally changed indonesia s central bank is among the world s least hawkish having given no hint of when it might lift rates while inflation has only just nudged above the 2 4 target range and the rupiah is one of emerging asia s best performing currencies this contrasts with 2013 when the fed s mere mention of plans to taper stimulus triggered destabilising capital outflows that saw the rupiah drop 20 forcing bank indonesia bi to hike rates by 175 basis points in indonesia there has been no year to date increase in the policy rate now that s extremely rare ivan tan ratings agency s p s financial institutions analyst told a seminar last week notwithstanding some political risks indonesia does appear to be weathering economic conditions better than the others lumped in the fragile five india turkey south africa and brazil policymakers say they have learnt lessons from past crises and devised policies such as setting up a domestic non deliverable forward foreign exchange market promoting greater use of other currencies in trade and investment rather than the u s dollar and selling more bonds to local investors to avoid over reliance on foreign hot money while there is debate about how much these policies have helped analysts agree record high exports amid a global commodity boom have helped indonesia shore up its economic resilience indonesia benefits as a net commodity exporter it is in a very good place to control some of the supply side inflationary pressures that some of the other economies are grappling with s p s tan said this has not only helped the resource rich country book current account surpluses it also helped the government reduce bond sale targets and fund energy subsidies to shield its 270 million population from high global oil prices moreover indonesia s stock market is up by more than 5 year to date compared with falls in other major asian equity markets after having southeast asia s busiest ipo schedules last year authorities hope financial market stability will allow the economy to grow by at least 6 per year so indonesia can achieve a goal of becoming a rich country by 2045 its 100th anniversary since independence indonesia s long term targets also include squeezing more out of its ample resources including minerals such as nickel ore by processing more at home bi governor perry warjiyo has said the government s focus on moving up the commodity processing chain would alter the structure of indonesia s external balance strengthening capital flows with foreign direct investment while diversifying exports for the whole year the current account deficit will be small and the balance of payments overall will book a surplus this means fundamentally foreign exchange supply is high and it will maintain the rupiah exchange rate stability warjiyo said at bi s latest policy meeting temporary improvement clouding indonesia s current outperformance are political risks to some of president joko widodo s key reforms and longer term ambitions to become a rich nation by 2045 these include a court challenge to his flagship job creation law aimed at cutting red tape and the european union s objections to indonesia s nickel export ban questions also remain over whether indonesia s stability can sustain with the fed still expected to aggressively raise rates further commodity prices cooling and global recession risks looming much of indonesia s improvement seems of temporary nature thomas rookmaaker head of asia pacific sovereigns at fitch ratings told reuters fitch which affirmed indonesia s investment grade ratings last week expects bi to hike interest rates by 50 bps this year and another 100 bps in 2023 to limit the rate differential with the united states and avoid a sharp rupiah depreciation he said s p s tan also expects pressures in the rupiah this year amid the global monetary tightening but some analysts do not see bi in a hurry to hike rates due to low core inflation damhuri nasution an economist at bni securities said exports should remain strong for a while giving bi time to focus on growth and monitor recession risks meanwhile some foreign investors are backing indonesia s growth story jupiter asset management s head of strategy for global emerging markets nick payne is overweight indonesian equities and anticipates continued recovery from the pandemic modest inflation a good current account position and strong commodity prices all contribute to the stability of the

federal reserve and other central banks are tightening their monetary policy said mark matthews head of research for asia pacific at bank julius baer in singapore one of the main themes thrown up by the data is selling of technology shares which account for more than half of taiwan s equity benchmark and about a third of korea s tech stocks have slumped around the world this year due to concern

you want to drink well but don t want to break the bank doing so i ve seen the situation over and over again everyone is looking for ways to save some hard earned funds and when it comes to wine shopping things are no different choosing a great bottle can be a daunting task for many even before considering the budget factor so how do you find the perfect pairing for your finances whether it s 10 or 100 a good option should not be too far out of reach here are a few tips for choosing a wine on a budget that i ve collected from a couple decades in the wine industry read also ranking arizona top 10 wineries for 2022 think outside the box how many times have you been told to think outside the box your first thought might be how can i find a cheaper chardonnay that is still palatable but what if you found a grape varietal that was just as delicious but cheaper because it s still fairly unknown to the masses push your boundaries past the usual and you can discover some inexpensive sips that will give the more well known grapes a run for their money a few suggestions instead of pinot noir try gamay or blaufränkisch chardonnay fans may enjoy godello or falanghina cabernet drinkers should seek out tempranillo or touriga nacional with over 10 000 different grape varieties in the world finding unique and inexpensive wine could easily become your journey and not your destination think inside the box now i know i just told you to think outside the box but what if you also looked inside the box i m talking about boxed wines that is there has been a recent resurgence in higher quality options from small batch artisan producers as well as higher end more recognizable names the larger format and convenience of a pour spout could be enough to convince some but this environmentally friendly packaging adds extra bonuses less waste here equals bigger savings compared to buying the same equivalent in glass bottles but the biggest factor for me is longevity many brands tout the freshness of a couple weeks perhaps you just want one glass and don t want to sacrifice an entire bottle the box has your back think of a bigger box now what if your box was bigger say a case of wine instead of just a bottle or two buying in bulk is a great way to save some cash in the long run this idea alone has made stores like costco a go to for the savvy shopper while warehouse stores can certainly save you some dollars i suggest skipping the middleman we all have our go to brands and bottles so why not stock up you know you re going to drink it eventually so go directly to the source and communicate with the winery whether you choose a wine club membership or just buy a case at a time both methods typically reward you with discounted wine insider tip stop at your local wine tasting room and ask about their case discounts at my shop you can save 10 on purchases of 6 bottles but if a large single purchase is beyond your current means a simple suggestion to friends or family members to pitch in on the purchase can go far don t feel boxed in if the thought of choosing something is still a bit overwhelming ask your local professional i m not suggesting this because i am one but because the person who stocks your local wine shop who runs your favorite tasting room or who chooses the wine list at your nearby wine bar understands their products in a way most of us cannot they devote their energy and resources to finding great tasting sips but also great values for you if you confide with them your go to styles and an idea of your price range they will in turn offer an educated answer and help you cut out a lot of guessing and wrong directions out of your decision still feeling boxed in and looking for something a little more festive than just asking host a tasting party give your wine party attendees a budget and a theme the combinations you come up with are limitless under 15 and an animal in the name or label 10 20 but only south american wines or up to 25 and local you might just discover your next favorite libation and have a great time doing so wine is meant to be enjoyed and the price of wine should not limit your experience hopefully now you can check off the budget box on your list of key wine factors the only downside to finding the perfect value wine you just might want to drink more drink well drink responsibly author jim cunningham is the general manager at merkin vineyards old town scottsdale merkin vineyards caduceus cellars make high elevation wines out of predominantly italian and spanish varieties from their 110 acres of estate vines in northern and southern arizona owner and winemaker mj keenan along with his wife jennifer and winemaker tim white are producing roughly 8000 cases a year in their tiny underground concrete facility known as the bunker for more information visit www merkinvineyards org
cavan images istock via getty images it s been a brutal two months for the gold juniors index gdxj and while many names have seen violent declines orla mining nyse orla shed more than 40 of its value in a nearly straight line fashion this can be attributed to gold price weakness and its recent announcement that it plans to acquire gold standard ventures gsv which often leads toshare price weakness for the acquirer overall orla appears to have got a solid deal and is undervalued following its recent decline however while i see long term upside from current levels i would view any rallies above us 3 55 before september as profit taking opportunities all figures are in united states dollars unless otherwise stated and any calculations use an exchange rate of 0 80 cad usd camino rojo operations company presentation orla mining had a solid start to the year ramping to commercial production at its new camino rojo mine on time and in line with its budget in a construction period plagued with supply chain headwinds labor tightness and inflationary pressures compared to companies that have failed miserably like argonaut gold otcpk arngf and iamgold iag in their construction process magino cote orla s performance was deserving of praise and made the company one to keep a close eye on unfortunately just three months later the stock has found itself down more than 40 taking a beating following its proposed acquisition of gold standard ventures gold standard let s take a closer look below gold standard ventures acquisition orla mining announced last month that it would acquire nevada gold developer gold standard ventures in an acquisition valued at 194 million for those unfamiliar gold standard owns the railroad pinion land package on the southern portion of the prolific carlin trend a 50 mile by 5 mile geologic corridor through southern nevada gold standard happens to be the second largest land owner in the prolific region with 21 700 hectares of land the company s focus has been on its south railroad project home to 1 60 million ounces of gold reserves at two key deposits dark star and pinion gold standard completed a feasibility study on south railroad earlier this year with the study showcasing a project capable of producing 152 000 ounces of gold over its first four years at all in sustaining costs below 1 000 oz over the 10 year mine life annual gold production is expected to come in at 124 000 ounces excludes pre production and residual leach years of operation a very respectable production profile just as important average all in sustaining costs were anticipated to come in below 1 050 oz over the mine life net of by product credits finally the initial capex should be more than manageable at just 190 million railroad south production profile company technical report outside of gold standard s valuation which allowed the company to acquire gold standard at less than 0 65x p nav 315 million at 1 650 oz which helped justify the takeover railroad south fits orla s business model nicely this is because it s a run of mine heap leach gold project similar to its camino rojo mine a relatively high grade heap leach gold project in nevada not only are these projects relatively inexpensive to build with just an adr plant lng facility and mobile equipment in gold standard s case but they benefit from industry leading costs if run properly assuming they have grades above 0 75 grams per tonne of gold given orla s size as a 1 0 billion market cap producer railroad south is a great fit with it able to get this project into production by 2025 assuming permits are granted with zero share dilution outside of the dilution to acquire gold standard the one negative is that railroad south will be margin dilutive to orla though this is only because camino rojo is such a robust project with all in sustaining costs below 800 oz for this reason it s not easy to find projects that can meet or beat camino rojo from a margin standpoint or are even in the same league still the jurisdictional upgrade is a huge deal with nevada ranking well above mexico especially with the issues some mexican miners have experienced over the past two years like equinox eqx and fortuna silver fsm exploration upside in addition to dark star and pinion which form the basis of the mine plan at south railroad gold standard has multiple targets and more than 600 000 ounces of resources outside of its mine plan some of the upside at railroad south involve sulphide resources which would require a separate processing plan and a toll milling agreement with nearby operators still similar to orla s camino rojo the upside opportunity on the property is significant suggesting that the current mine plan understates the project s true potential from a long term cash flow standpoint nevada targets gold standard ventures presentation finally it s worth noting that in addition to ounces not included in the mine plan gold standard holds the lewis project home to 21 square kilometers of land on the battle mountain eureka trend and adjacent to nevada gold mines phoenix mine the deposit is home to a small resource base of 7 74 million tons at 0 83 grams per ton of gold and 14 grams per ton of silver translating to just over 250 000 gold equivalent ounces this would likely interest nevada gold mines in the form of a layback agreement given its proximity to ngm s high margin phoenix mine hence while the resource is small 200 000 ounces it should have strategic value to orla industry leading growth following the acquisition of gold standard orla mining has gone from a company with a lean and mean growth plan cerro quema camino rojo sulphides potential to a gold producer on steroids this is because the company looked like it may have had a path to 200 000 ounces of annual production by 2026 at sub 800 oz all in sustaining costs and 350 000 ounces later this decade however with the addition of south railroad the company could have 500 000 ounce potential by 2029 translating to 400 growth from its fy2022 guidance 90 000 to 100 000 ounces this growth profile is based on cerro quema which could be an 80 000 to 100 000 ounce producer south railroad at 125 000 ounces camino rojo at 125 000 ounces and further upside from the camino rojo sulphides opportunity as it stands the main priority looks to have shifted from cerro quema to railroad south given that it will lead to immediate growth an improvement in the jurisdictional profile nevada vs panama and it s currently further advanced in fact south railroad could have all its permits by september 2023 with orla able to begin construction by october of next year orla mining comparisons projected growth profile company presentation while this growth profile is phenomenal the estimates put forth in the recent presentation look a little ambitious this is because orla is projecting a 231 growth rate from its estimated 98 000 ounces of gold production this year or growth to 325 000 ounces of gold in 2025 i don t see how the company expects to achieve this growth given that it should take at least 14 months to build railroad south and permits should take at least 13 15 months to be granted if we assume permits are granted in september 2023 construction begins in october 2023 and the first gold pour is in january 2025 i would be shocked to see a 140 000 ounce year out of railroad south in a shortened 2025 year hence even if camino rojo comes in above estimates from its mine plan at 130 000 ounces this would place orla at around 270 000 ounces for 2025 which while still an incredible growth rate is still quite a bit shy of a potential 325 000 ounce target in 2025 that said even if the company breaches the 300 000 ounce mark in 2026 this would be a very impressive feat giving it one of the most impressive growth profiles industry wide long term orla has considerable upside from its camino rojo sulphides project where we should get a better idea of the potential by year end in addition after building railroad south it would then likely look to build cerro quema an oxide project with copper potential in panama putting this all together there appears to be a clear path to at least 300 000 ounces of annual production at sub 900 oz costs by 2028 with further upside if the company can deliver on camino rojo sulphides as well given the diversification into nevada and assuming successful execution at railroad south this should allow orla to see a slight re rating with the potential for multiple expansion to 1 05x p nav after it sheds its single asset producer status valuation and technical picture based on an estimated 340 million fully diluted shares and a share price of us 2 90 orla trades at a market cap of 986 million this compares quite favorably to an estimated post acquisition net asset value of 1 90 billion with the stock trading at approximately 0 52x p nav based on the fact that i see a fair multiple for the stock being more than 0 80x p nav i see meaningful upside for the stock from current levels i believe the estimated net asset value to be on the conservative side given that i have valued railroad south at just 260 million to account for potential inflationary pressures i also assigned no value for a potential future layback agreement at lewis nor exploration upside on the vast land package so is the stock a buy while there s no disputing that orla is undervalued after its recent pullback the technical picture leaves much to be desired this is because the stock recently plunged through a strong support level dating back to q1 2021 with this area now becoming new resistance c 4 35 us 3 50 often major support levels once broken can become new resistance levels and given the parabolic run up in 2020 there s no clear support below the stock until c 2 60 us 2 08 orla mining chart tc2000 com the lack of support below does not mean that the stock has to continue its decline and it s certainly possible it could bounce to relieve oversold conditions however i prefer to buy small cap stocks only when there s a reward risk ratio of 5 0 to 1 0 or better support vs resistance and with orla having us 0 60 in potential upside to resistance and 0 82 in potential downside to support the current reward risk ratio comes in at 0 73 to 1 0 to summarize while this might present an attractive entry for a long term investor not worried about medium term share price performance i think there are more attractive bets elsewhere currently from a technical standpoint summary orla has significantly improved its organic growth profile with the addition of gold standards railroad south project and surrounding land while i don t think the deal was necessary given orla s development pipeline i can understand the rationale this is because it s certainly a market ripe for taking advantage of discounts gold developers are the cheapest they ve been in years however while this provides a nice boost to net asset value and diversification into a tier 1 jurisdiction the technical picture has degraded after the multi month support break after plunging to short term oversold levels last week orla could put together a sharp rally that said any rallies above us 3 55 before september should provide profit taking opportunities this is because some investors that bought at previous support us 3 50 and are underwater may sell if provided the opportunity to exit positions at break even given this potential short term ceiling on the stock i currently see more attractive opportunities elsewhere hence my hold rating

there was a tweet posted saturday from the president s twitter account the tweet took gas station operators to task for high gas prices biden implied that gas companies are price gouging at the gas pump as he demanded the cost they are paying for gas reflect the cost to the consumer he ended the tweet with an ominous four words and do it now advertisement my message to the companies running gas stations and setting prices at the pump is simple this is a time of war and global peril bring down the price you are charging at the pump to reflect the cost you re paying for the product and do it now president biden potus july 2 2022 there is much to criticize about that tweet first is the fact that it shows team biden thinks you are stupid does anyone believe that joe biden posts his own tweets some staffer or maybe ron klain did this they think it makes biden look like he s taking charge of the situation biden has tried to pass the buck for the causes of bidenflation on to putin big oil price gouging republicans and so on he blames everyone other than himself and his own bone headed policies and runaway spending that have created bidenflation so now he is going after gas stations you can t make this stuff up gas stations are often owned and operated by individuals not big oil companies they are often mom and pop operations and their margin of profit is very slim they do not have control over gas prices joe biden is threatening small business owners even the person who wrote this tweet knows it s complete bullshit and gas stations don t control what they ultimately can charge people aren t this stupid tim young timrunshismouth july 2 2022 advertisement imagine being a gas station owner operator and feeling the sting of the president demanding you lower your prices at the pump the reason so many gas stations have convenience stores is because those stores provide profits for the business they balance out the small amount of profit earned from selling gas that s a business decision joe biden has never been in the private sector he s never run a business faced meeting payroll or scrambled to remain competitive joe biden has lived off american taxpayers for his entire professional career he is clueless about how business works and obviously he has surrounded himself with people just like him how else is such a stupid and threatening tweet explained gas stations have to compete with the gas station across the street which sometimes sparks price wars one station lowers its price per gallon by a few cents and then the competitor does the same and counters with another cent or two a billionaire who supported joe biden spoke out after seeing the tweet enough is enough is the message from jeff bezos ouch inflation is far too important a problem for the white house to keep making statements like this it s either straight ahead misdirection or a deep misunderstanding of basic market dynamics jeff bezos jeffbezos july 3 2022 advertisement when joe biden s lost jeff bezos well don t get too excited bezos is an unabashed progressive who will support joe biden if he runs for re election i think he finally said something about biden s ridiculous flailing around on shifting blame about inflation because of the level of crazy it has risen to who knows the next group of people joe biden will blame for his failing presidency perhaps bezos spoke up because it was convenient to do so over such an obviously ridiculous tweet and because he is losing billions of dollars himself both jeff bezos and elon musk have taken a big financial hit from the stock market in biden s economy the world s two richest men elon musk and jeff bezos have lost at least 127 billion of their net worth so far this year from the recent selloff in the stock market according to the bloomberg billionaires index which is a daily ranking of the world s richest people musk ceo of tesla has lost 66 5 billion while amazon ceo bezos saw his fortune decline by 61 billion as of may 23 as the correction in the market brought down the valuations of their companies amazon s stock has fallen by 35 4 year to date while tesla s stock has declined even more at 36 1 bezos won t have to worry about purchasing groceries and filling up his gas tank like regular americans still financial losses of successful businessmen affect company employees employers lay off people when times get dicey they don t invest in future expansions if the economic market is uncertain advertisement it may be politically expedient to criticize small businesses during a long holiday weekend when travel will be heavy on highways across the country but it shows the fact that the basics of supply and demand are missing from biden s criticisms his administration has done everything possible to shut down the fossil fuel industry what did he expect would eventually happen he can talk about green energy and alternatives like wind and solar all he wants but the world isn t ready for a major transformation away from oil and gas as we see in europe too germany and other countries are firing up their coal plants after appeasing environmental extremists for too long nuclear energy is coming back the only solution to keeping the world including america up and running with energy is to use an all of the above approach the chinese government applauded biden s tweet now us president finally realized that capitalism is all about exploitation he didn t believe this before chen weihua 陈卫华 chenweihua july 2 2022 joe biden would rather go hat in hand to saudi arabia venezuela and other oil producing countries than to do what needs to be done domestically to produce more energy the administration missed a deadline on july 1 to plan future oil and gas lease sales they gave no explanation for the missed deadline senator barrasso calls it a disgrace advertisement president biden is hell bent on choking off american oil and natural gas production senate energy and natural resources committee ranking member john barrasso r wyo told fox news digital in a statement now he has failed to follow the law and prepare a final five year leasing plan by yesterday s deadline that means the federal government will not offer any new offshore oil and gas lease sales this year this will be the first year since 1958 that has happened instead the biden administration has spent its time courting overseas dictators he continued the white house has begged countries like russia iran and venezuela for oil it s an absolute disgrace under the 1953 outer continental shelf lands act the doi is required to periodically issue five year plans for offshore oil and gas lease sales historically the plans have been issued on time by democratic and republican administrations and have included more than 10 lease sales stretching across federal waters in the gulf of mexico pacific atlantic and off the coast of alaska president norms is failing to meet legal mandates and he doesn t care the goal of his administration is to end leases and shut down the oil and gas industry high gas prices are intentional in order to force more electrical vehicles on the road the problem with this is that regular american households can t afford electrical vehicles especially while they live with bidenflation advertisement a small amount of blame can be put on putin s invasion into ukraine but

a woman sitting next to president calvin coolidge at a dinner party once told him she had made a bet that she could get him to say more than two words you lose replied coolidge who served as president from 1923 until 1929 during a white house recital a nervous opera singer foundered through a performance before coolidge someone asked him what he thought of the singer s execution i m all for it he said coolidge was so taciturn that he was known as silent cal three u s presidents all of them founding fathers john adams thomas jefferson and james monroe died on july 4 only one was born on july 4 calvin coolidge was born in plymouth notch vermont 150 years ago on july 4 1872 he died in january 1933 getting to know coolidge fireworks rarely followed coolidge during his political career calvin coolidge the 30th president of the united states white house photo coolidge was balding 5 foot 9 with a slight build and he could walk into an empty room and blend in he rarely smiled or changed expression alice roosevelt longworth the daughter of president theodore roosevelt described coolidge s dour expression by saying he looked as if he had been weaned on a pickle such a description would not have offended coolidge i think the american public wants a solemn ass as a president he said and i think i ll go along with them best know for a laugh or two the 30th president remains a footnote in the history of u s presidents coolidge was preceded in the white house by warren harding whose administration was one of the most corrupt in u s history coolidge was succeeded by herbert hoover who was in office when the country fell into the throes of the great depression which began with the crash of the stock market in october 1929 several months after hoover took office coolidge is probably best known for his contributions to books of political humor i included him in a 2020 book i edited the art of the political putdown the greatest comebacks ripostes and retorts in history coolidge a republican who believed in small government low taxes morality thrift and tradition rose quickly but quietly in massachusetts politics where he became president of the state senate in 1914 while serving in this capacity two senators got into a bitter exchange of words in which one told the other to go to hell the recipient of the remark demanded that coolidge take his side i ve looked up the law senator coolidge told him and you don t have to go coolidge was elected governor of massachusetts in 1919 he soon earned a national reputation for being decisive by firing striking police officers in boston and ordering the state militia to bring calm to the city after the strike had left its inhabitants vulnerable to violent mobs in september 1919 warren harding the republican presidential nominee in 1920 chose coolidge as his running mate harding and coolidge won the election coolidge then became president when harding died in 1923 early in his term in december 1923 coolidge spoke to congress and pressed for isolation in u s foreign policy and tax cuts he believed in small government and also benefited from the country s strong economic position in the early 1920s this helped his popularity rise and he got more than 54 of the popular vote in the 1924 election a genius for inactivity if it was coolidge s decisive action that brought him to national attention it was his inaction as president that defined his presidency and won him the admiration of political conservatives newspaper columnist walter lippmann wrote this about coolidge in 1926 mr coolidge s genius for inactivity is developed to a very high point it is a grim determined alert inactivity which keeps mr coolidge occupied constantly historians however praise coolidge for presiding over low inflation low unemployment and budget surpluses during every year of his presidency he kept the country at peace and restored confidence in the government after the scandal plagued harding years but being president and taking daily naps still apparently left coolidge with a lot of free time coolidge reportedly liked to press the alarm buttons in the oval office and when the secret service agents ran into the office to see what was wrong he would be hiding coolidge decided not to run for reelection in 1928 when reporters asked him why he answered with characteristic succinctness because there s no chance for advancement he said if coolidge had been reelected he would have suffered hoover s fate of being president during the depression his political timing was as good as his comic timing social critic h l mencken once speculated on how coolidge would have responded to the collapse of the stock market and the collapse of the nation s economy he would have responded to bad times precisely as he responded to good ones that is by pulling down the blinds stretching his legs upon his desk and snoozing away the lazy afternoons mencken wrote and yet the iconoclastic mencken had this begrudging praise for coolidge there were no thrills while he reigned but neither were there any headaches he had no ideas and he was not a nuisance when american writer dorothy parker who like coolidge could say much with few words learned that the former president had died in 1933 she replied how could they tell
many americans have wrestled with this dilemma at some point during the pandemic yet it still seems to come up again and again when can you stop isolating after a covid 19 infection the question is especially vexing if you re feeling better but still testing positive on a rapid test even with the arrival of new subvariants the basic ground rules haven t changed since omicron first came onto the scene the centers for disease control and prevention says someone can stop isolating after five days if they re fever free for 24 hours and are starting to get better as long as they keep wearing a mask around others for another five days some researchers have criticized these rules pointing to research that shows some people may remain infectious after day five and many experts advise waiting until you test negative on an at home test before venturing out but if you feel fine it can be frustrating to wait especially if you re in the subset of those who test positive past 10 days james hay who studies infectious disease dynamics remembers earlier this year when his sister continued testing positive for two weeks their family had plans to get together over the holiday a gathering that included an older relative who was vulnerable to covid to us that was just not worth the risk says hay who s a research fellow at the harvard t h chan school of public health going to the shops with a mask on that s a different kind of risk consideration testing to get out of isolation is tempting because it promises a straightforward answer unfortunately and perhaps unsurprisingly the science is not entirely settled we don t have anything that says definitely you are contagious or definitely you re not says dr emily landon an infectious disease specialist at uchicago medicine the best thing we have are these rapid antigen tests unlike pcr tests which search for genetic material from the virus rapid antigen tests work by looking for the proteins that are packed inside the virus a positive test generally correlates with the presence of infectious virus scientists can determine that by taking samples from someone who s been infected and trying to grow the virus in a lab what s known as a viral culture generally most people who get infected are not still testing positive on an antigen test 10 days after symptom onset if you have enough virus in your system to be turning one of these tests positive that means your body probably hasn t yet fully cleared the infection says hay but there is no perfect study that shows how likely it is that a positive test on a rapid test translates into shedding enough virus that you could actually infect another person says dr geoffrey baird chair of the department of laboratory medicine and pathology at the university of washington school of medicine the answer to that is clear as mud he says indeed infectious disease experts tend to differ about how much stock to put in a rapid test result when someone knows they re infected and deciding whether it s safe to rejoin the outside world after all baird points out that these tests were never designed to function as get out of isolation cards relying on the result to tell whether you re truly still infectious is dicey he says there s actually a lot more discrepancy than anyone would be happy with he says a positive antigen test could essentially be picking up leftover viral garbage which can include dead viruses mangled viruses viruses that are 90 packed together but not really going to work says baird and the amount can vary depending on each person s immune system the variants the stage of the infection and so on this is partly why baird did not bother to take a rapid test when he had covid recently and had to decide when it was ok to return to work after a week when he was feeling better he came back to the office where everyone s required to wear an n95 mask even if it is an imperfect tool not everyone is down on using a rapid antigen test landon says it s extra information that can give you a sense of how to proceed especially if people are banking on the cdc guidance to determine whether to end isolation that s because some people will still be infectious after five days she says in fact a studyco authored by landon followed health care workers at the university of chicago who had been infected but were feeling mostly better and went to get tested after five days they found that more than half of them still tested positive on antigen tests after six days this tracks with other research for example one studyanalyzing data from a testing site in san francisco during the january omicron surge suggests that many people were still testing positive after five days and research done by the cdc shows about half of people were still testing positive on the antigen test between five and nine days after symptom onset or diagnosis you d be erring on the side of caution if you followed the test and said i m not going to leave my isolation until after my test is negative she says preliminary datafrom scientists at harvard and mit shows that about 25 of symptomatic people with covid 19 had virus that could be cultured after eight days after symptom onset or their first test but hay cautions there is considerable variation in the studies because of small sample sizes differing populations how the rapid tests are done the vaccination status of who s being tested and how healthy they are among other factors that explains a lot of the variation across studies but i think it s still pretty consistent as an overall finding that if you re antigen positive then you re quite likely to be infectious he says some research has aligned more closely with the cdc isolation guidance which assumes most people will no longer be infectious after five days a preprint study of close to 100 vaccinated college students at boston university suggests that a majority were no longer infectious after five days only about 17 of those who we looked at still had what looks like viable covid out past five days says dr karen jacobson an infectious disease specialist at the boston university school of medicine and one of the study s authors a very small number did have virus that could be cultured eight days after symptom onset her study found that a negative rapid antigen test on day five is a perfect indicator of whether the virus could be cultured in a lab in other words anyone who had a negative test on day five or later after their initial diagnosis had no more detectable virus the flip side was that if you had a positive rapid about half of the people still had culturable virus and half did not says jacobsen the way that we ve started to frame it and i think many others have is that if you re positive you particularly need to take this very seriously at the end the day if you re still testing positive but you feel fine and are symptom free the decision to go out in the world comes down to context if you re going to spend time with people who are high risk think twice says landon if you are thinking about going to the nursing home to visit your grandmother this is not the time to do it she says but if there s something essential you need to do don t feel trapped in your house go do it but keep your mask on she adds copyright 2022 npr to see more visit

by lu yanchun and zhao gongzheng china daily updated 2022 07 04 09 33 consumers shop for meat at a safeway grocery store as inflation continues to grow in annapolis maryland may 16 2022 europe and the united states are experiencing the most serious inflation in 40 years high inflation lowers people s living standards weakens corporate vitality overshadows prospects of economic growth intensifies social tensions and raises concerns about the possibility of global stagflation we believe protectionism in some western countries is largely responsible for this round of global inflation which is expected to continue for some time to come in may the consumer price index in the us germany and france hit levels not seen since the 1980s and that of the eurozone also hit highs for six consecutive months the influence of the record high producer price index in the us and the eurozone has spread to developing countries and newly emerging markets the inflation rate in countries like brazil egypt and russia rose from 10 percent to 20 percent year on year in may while that in turkey argentina and iran reached 73 percent 60 percent and 40 percent respectively over the same period a sign of runaway inflation by contrast prices remained within a reasonable range in china with the country s cpi up 2 1 percent year on year in may some western countries protectionism is the main culprit behind inflation protectionism in various ways pushes supply costs higher and eventually raises prices rising tariffs and nontariff barriers such as those imposed on china amid sino us trade disputes have led to costlier imports in the us protectionism hinders the free flow of production factors across the globe and results in the loss of comparative advantages some western countries in order to attract transnationals back home have begun to encourage localization of production thus interfering with the optimum allocation of production factors the frequent imposition of sanctions by washington against various enterprises and industrial chains disrupts and distorts these chains resulting in turbulence in supply and demand and the loss of control over costs costs and prices are no longer priorities in decision making as a result of protectionists political pressure and propaganda campaigns simply put protectionism impedes international trade debilitates the specialization and division of labor lowers productivity and is the archenemy of unfettered global industrial chains and is therefore a chief culprit behind inflation the global computer chip crisis is a case in point the fight against the covid 19 pandemic due to the existence of the vaccine divide has not become an opportunity for global cooperation and collaboration but rather exposed the weaknesses of global governance strengthened the hand of protectionism and furthered the spread of inflation the us and europe are destroying expired vaccines while poverty stricken countries are still waiting for their first doses the imbalance between economic recovery and epidemic prevention and control has aggravated the disruption of global supply chains diverted flows of goods and services and led to higher costs in international trade the ongoing russia ukraine conflict has sparked a surge in food and energy prices an important contributing factor to inflation that cannot be underestimated because both russia and ukraine are key suppliers of bulk commodities such as energy metals and agricultural products on which some countries are highly dependent the sanctions imposed by the west and the counter sanctions implemented by russia have spread to the abovementioned sectors and have shown signs of intensification the russia ukraine tensions have begun to affect the global economy and prices of bulk commodities surging food prices in particular have raised major concerns extremely loose monetary policies have added to inflationary pressure in order to mitigate the impact of the covid 19 pandemic the us federal reserve once lowered its federal fund rate to zero and ushered in a period of uncapped quantitative easing the fed s total assets rose from 4 21 trillion at the end of february 2020 to 9 trillion at the end of march 2022 particularly noteworthy is that wall street and the big firms were the major beneficiaries of this inflation the profits of well known petroleum corporations mining conglomerates big food suppliers major shipping companies and traders with the big wall street firms behind them are mounting for example the net profit of goldman sachs registered a record 21 6 billion in 2021 these huge profits amplified undersupply revealed the fragility of supply chains and aggravated inflation in summary the chief culprit behind this round of inflation is us protectionism washington politicians taking advantage of public opinion raised the flag of protectionism and launched a trade war but the trade war was only the starting point on top of that the covid 19 pandemic and geopolitical conflicts became additional catalysts loose monetary policies provided enough ammunition and major enterprises were heavily involved and are reaping huge profits all these factors revolve around protectionism and drive up prices in other words this round of global inflation is man made and the us is the chief culprit generally as protectionism spreads in the coming years prices of bulk commodities surge disrupted industrial supply chains restructure and the russia ukraine conflict inflates food and energy prices economic growth constrained by so many factors lacks strong support and therefore this round of inflation is expected to continue for a longer period the fed s interest rate hike is in the interests of the us and wall street but is no cure for inflation and therefore is expected to have little effect over the short term when the fed announced an interest rate rise in march the us dollar quickly began to appreciate and rose nearly 5 percent year on year in april the biggest increase since 2012 the us dollar appreciation brings money back to the us benefits its financial market leads to cheaper imports and thus can ease the pressure of long term inflation but as the theory that inflation will peak and then fall falters the fed radically hiked its rate by 75 basis points last month which might cause risks to spill over the radical move will not produce more positive effects on production and supply instead it will infuse instability into the global financial markets accelerate the flow of capital and the fluctuations of exchange rates spill over the risks and thus pose new challenges to unimpeded global industrial supply chains and efforts to lower inflationary expectations the escalation of the russia ukraine conflict and the surge in food and energy prices will contribute to long term inflation over the long term the conflict will cause substantial damage to russian and ukrainian exports intensify the global commodity supply crunch due to the pandemic and push prices even higher us election politics has made inflation a partisan tool energy prices have been the primary factor for the rising cpi for 13 consecutive months obviously easing the russia ukraine conflict is the most effective way to lower oil prices instead washington took advantage of the conflict in ukraine and shifted the responsibility onto russia but the us public doesn t think that way according to a recent nbc opinion poll 38 percent of interviewees believe that the us government is responsible for inflation while a mere 6 percent attribute the inflation to the russia ukraine conflict we believe that protectionism in some western countries is the primary reason for this round of global inflation this is the hidden but primary reason for this and all other reasons are secondary and less important therefore if we want to contain inflation we need to with joint efforts abandon protectionism and build unimpeded industrial supply chains all countries the big powers in particular should shoulder their due responsibilities the world should move together with the trend of globalization abandon protectionism and all unreasonable tariffs levied on chinese goods should be abandoned efforts should be made to end the russia ukraine conflict settle their differences through peaceful negotiations and allow them as soon as possible to export their energy resources and food in an unimpeded manner all countries should cooperate and collaborate in our fight against the covid 19 pandemic and help less developed countries integrate themselves into the world economy the world should also build an unimpeded global marketplace and fix global industrial supply chain problems especially disruptions

the american cancer society of michigan state authorities say was a fake charity and not even a good fake it was not in michigan for one thing when the group applied to the irs to become a tax exempt nonprofit in 2020 it listed its address as a rented mailbox on staten island in new york city it was not the american cancer society either in fact the real american cancer society had already warned the irs that the leader of the sound alike group ian hosang was running a fraud the irs approved the group anyway soon after it also approved another operation run by hosang the united way of ohio also registered to the staten island address hosang 63 is now accused of operating a long running charity fraud that has astounded nonprofit regulators and watchdogs and raised concerns about the irs ability to serve as gatekeeper for the american charity system not because the alleged scheme was so good because it was terrible and it worked hosang a convicted stock market fraudster got the irs to approve 76 nonprofits often despite glaring red flags of potential fraud his operations stole the names of better known charities they claimed to be located where they obviously were not but the irs kept saying yes and in doing so the agency has attracted scrutiny of its new fast track system for approving charities an innovation implemented to deal with backlogs and budget cuts that now denies only one application in 2 400 nobody s watching the store said nina olson who was the irs in house national taxpayer advocate from 2001 to 2019 and warned repeatedly about the decreased level of vetting they re the gatekeeper to this whole universe of charitable subsidies and if the irs is not doing its job as a gatekeeper then you ve got real problems the agency declined to answer questions about hosang s case citing taxpayer privacy laws it also declined to make officials available for in person interviews but it released a statement saying that the fast track approval system continues to reduce taxpayer burden and increase cost effectiveness of irs operations hosang was indicted in brooklyn in may on charges of grand larceny identity theft and conducting a scheme to defraud he has pleaded not guilty the brooklyn district attorney said he stole about 152 000 in donations that flowed through 23 of his nonprofits hosang did not need to do much to promote the groups the money came in through online platforms that let users choose among irs approved charities hosang prosecutors said spent the money on mortgage payments credit card bills and at liquor stores i did very wrong i know that hosang said in an interview at his staten island home his voice breaking hosang said he had changed his life after a near death spike in blood sugar in 2020 which he took as a sign from god he said he wants to make restitution but hosang pointed out every one of his charities had been approved if you file something with an agency he said and they approve it do you think it s illegal hosang was born in trinidad grew up in brooklyn and graduated from new york university in 1984 with a degree in finance he wound up on the ugly side of wall street accused of running pump and dump operations that conned customers into paying high prices for low quality stocks prosecutors later said hosang and his associates recruited salesmen on the subway rewarded them with marijuana and worked with an associate of the gambino crime family once when a rival visited to complain investigators said hosang and the mob associate dangled him out the window of the ninth floor office in 1997 he was barred from the industry by a self regulatory body then called the national association of securities dealers in 1999 he pleaded guilty to federal charges of fraud and money laundering hosang s attorney yusuf el ashmawy said hosang cooperated with authorities and helped convict 150 people he spent about two years in federal prison after his release hosang focused on a new business in 2014 federal records show he asked the irs to approve tax exemption for a new nonprofit the american cancer society for children inc it wasn t connected to the american cancer society i got sidetracked my son passed away hosang said explaining how he had turned to setting up charities it was not a stable mind at the time he began running the operation at a time when the agency was already ill prepared to detect signs of fraud in new applicants the first problem according to former irs officials tax law does not prohibit nonprofits from impersonating better known nonprofits by using sound alike names the second there are no systematic checks for a history of fraud the irs in its written statement said that employees reviewing new applications have been trained to identify fraud hosang still got through between 2014 and 2018 the agency approved 17 of his applications for groups with american cancer society in their names according to irs records hosang switched to the fast track system in 2019 according to agency records his mailbox in staten island was the same the red flags were still red but despite the warning from the american cancer society hosang was even more successful than before in two years of using the fast track system hosang got the irs to approve 56 new charities

economynext sri lanka is on the fast track to the korea path with interventionist soft peggers getting their wish using a us built central bank with false monetary policy independence and extreme stimulus to target an output gap sri lanka has printed over 2 3 trillion rupees since the january 2020 rate cut and lost 9 3 billion us dollars in reserves including 4 0 billion in borrowed reserves up to march 2022 the rupee has collapsed from 182 to 365 to the us dollar in the same period now inflation is going up monetary stability has not yet been restored and there signs that the central bank could lose control of reserve money in the 2012 2016 and 2018 currency crises the central bank floated and got control of reserve money and there was typical deflationary style collapsed with a small spike in inflation however this time an inflationary blow off is the outcome with monetary stability yet to be restored food prices are rising and people are finding it difficult to eat even if there are no actual shortages the high prices will reduce the calorific intake of the poor particularly children and put protein out of the reach of many the hardest hit would be children of poor families for whom protein and dairy products will be a super luxury which can harm their growth for years to come sri lanka s central bank printed the money from 2020 saying the new administration was going to create a developmental state similar to korea unlike countries like hong kong singapore malaysia thailand and taiwan korea was one country which had severe monetary troubles trade controls and near starvation due to its us built central bank like ceylon if monetary stability is not restored sri lanka will become more of a korea spam a luxury food during lunar new year in south korea spam a canned ham considered junk food in the us is a valued gift found in premium gift hampers hormel foods which invented the canned food in 1937 and became a component of military rations reportedly has the biggest sales outside america of over 200 million dollars in korea when the bank of chosen joseon and later the bank of korea was printing money in the immediate post independent period from japn spam was one of the foods available from post exchange px stores which served us soldiers and other american officials and their families as money printing triggered import controls spam and meat became luxury foods related sri lanka chicken egg production plunge amid soft peg collapse one of the foods that were invented during that time was budae jjigae or amy base stew army base stew was made from food trash thrown away from military eateries and officer s messes the saying goes that cigarette butts were removed pieces of sausages and others were rescued and mixed with spices and kimchi and vegetables it was boiled in to a tasty soup for the starving koreans another food that was reportedly invented at the time dwaeji gukbap which is a culture food in busan it was invented in the early 1950s by refugees and poor families and made with discarded pork bone from us military kitchens gamja tang a traditional dish was made with discarded pork bone from military kitchens when central banks buy treasury bill to pay state workers or to keep rates down and the currency collapses it is not only banks that collapse but the nutrition of people in sri lanka in the 1970s beggars died on streets there are those who remember how they used to scavenge discarded food from offices in colombo after the lunch hour collect the leftover rice wash and then boil them on the roadside in a pot with some vegetables again and eat them a central banker will never admit to their mistakes not only in sri lanka but anywhere in the world but will use big words to confuse bamboozle the helpless public using the same rhetoric used by western mercantilists and escape accountability the korean central bank s wish for japan reform the bank of chosen was originally private bank it was forced to print money in the latter stages of world war ii under japanese occupation by purchasing japanese government bonds the officials inside the bank of chosen however did not want to print money since they had a long history before american academic central banking they wanted to change the law they pointed out that the bank of japan act was changed in 1948 by joseph dodge a us banker who had worked with ordoliberals of germany and was involved in killing inflation and setting up the new deutsche mark one of the first things joseph dodge who was helicopter dropped into japan did was to close the reconstruction development bank which fukkin bank was financed with bonds sold to bank of japan which was firing 700 percent inflation and triggering multiple parallel exchange rates the fukkin bank among other keynesian interventions was the product of the keynesian new dealer economic co operation agency of the us japan was a victim of the agency which was rescued by dodge who fixed the yen at 360 and banned deficit finance chalmers johnson who wrote about japan in a misleading way was a naval officer working out of japan during the korean war and was protected from the consequences in korea in any case they had the us officers had the benefit px stores the yen held till the break up of the bretton woods and appreciated while sri lanka printed and closed the entire economy in the 1970s based on soft pegging ideology dodge ended up in japan on the intervention of us president harry truman and the us military which saw the stability and monetary reform in germany and was able to undo the damage caused by the eca fed experts in 1948 had failed to arrest the monetary problems in japan people were starving and the military feared a revolt when the military administration took matters in hand and brought in dodge according to the official history of the bank of korea the korean government and bank of chosen reached a consensus that it was necessary to invite international financial experts to examine the government s central bank bill at the proposal of the eca the minister of finance requested in june 1949 that the board of governors of the federal reserve send experts to korea in response the federal reserve dispatched arthur i bloomfield chief economist of the balance of payments division a prominent authority in financial theory and john p jensen assistant chief of the auditing division from the federal reserve bank of new york korea gets argentina cookie cutter the federal reserve board had been sending staff to countries including paraguay guatemala the dominican republic the philippines and sri lanka since 1943 to support their monetary and banking reforms the dispatch of two experts to korea was in line with this trend picture to use the bank of chosen officials who wanted to arrest inflation of course had no idea that us academic economists has been completely corrupted by keynesianism and the fed was exporting a cookie cutter argentina style central banks and dodge followed classical discipline arthur bloomfield a fed official later set up a bank in the style of one s set up in latin america in a previous decade and in ceylon by fellow federal reserve official john exter the south korean won the first version had depreciated from 15 to the us dollar in 1945 to 6000 by 1953 the new bank printed a brand new currency called the hwan the new currency was born at 100 old won per hwan predictably the new central bank was unable to halt inflation political upheaval sygman rhee who had opposed japanese occupation and was considered an independence leader returned to the country and won presidential elections and headed what was called the first republic however the country continued to experience inflation and by 1960 the hwan had fallen to around 1250 to the dollar the first republic collapsed and rhee was disgraced as usually happens when currencies collapse as can be seen in sri lanka now following what was known as the april revolution he resigned the second republic lasted only one year general park chung hee came to office through a coup promising to end corruption and tackle big business after central bank reform a second won which is now found in korea was set up with 1 won for 10 hwan about 135 to the us dollar the new was much better and held for long periods though the country experienced bop troubles and high interest rate and inflation from time to time the currency troubles led to import controls spam smuggling became a popular sport and was criminalized by the military administration and authoritarian rule prevailed the korea central bank law was reformed about a dozen times the won collapsed in the early 1980s as paul volcker tightened and latin america went into default however the last reform reduced monetary and exchange policy conflicts and stability started to come around the mid 1980s as the currency was stabilizing after the final collapse people came to the streets in great workers struggle the dictatorship also collapsed in a massive strike a liberal government came to power officials of the bank of korea busan branch went on strike demanding further tightening of the law which was allowed by the liberals the currency stabilized and appreciated interest rates and inflation collapsed as a consequence and the korea became an oecd country within a decade all kinds of new economic activities came which interventionists could imagine korean music which developed partly as opposition to authoritarian rule took japan and the rest of asia by storm k drama and other culture products followed with the film industry being liberalized and facing competition in 2020 hallyu exports were estimated to have topped 10 billion dollars about the same as total exports of sri lanka k drama found big markets in china and japan the government got interested in hallyu when it realized one year that culture exports topped the revenues many of the biggest industrial groups and it started funding drama schools the democratization reforms of the 1980s also created private tv channels which led to an explosion of the

in hallyu k pop bands have stars from japan thailand and china music is developed by in collaboration with sound studios in the us and europe and producers in the us and eu by and by foreign mercantilists will write about the trend and say it is happened as a result of some state intervention by the government of korea however sri lanka can expect no such prospects in the current situation almost all the economists in the country are interventionist soft peggers who want to manipulate interest rates with no thought of the consequences on the currency with the notable exception of w a wijewardena classical monetary theory is unknown in sri lanka a deadly flexible exchange rate awaits a deadly central bank monetary law that institutionalizes monetary and exchange rate conflicts flexible exchange rate with flexible inflation targeting and gives independence to soft peggers is waiting in the wings it will probably be enacted under the imf program there is little prospect of a clean floating regime starting under any imf program while the imf is good at smashing economies and stabilizing currencies it cannot prevent the next one that is because the seeds of the next crisis is contained in the discretionary and anchor conflicting flexible and sterilizing central bank laws it supports imf is replete with arthur bloomfields and robert triffins david groves and the like who set up sterilizing supposedly counter cyclical soft pegs they prescribe to the third world what was discarded by the fed and the bank of england in the reagan thatcher era after their own currencies collapsed the bigger problem is washington in now against strong pegs unlike during the bretton woods era the treasury believes falsely that strong east asian stable currencies are undervalued and they become export power houses at the expense of the us trade deficit monetary instability will continue and the economists mercantilists will continue to blame imports the current account deficit and external shocks instead of their own flexible discretionary and independent policies backed by central bank credit instability will continue until a currency board is brought to tame the mercantilists or the country goes into spontaneous dollarization prospects of a clean float are almost zero under an imf program which requires pegging to repay its loans sri lanka earns about a billion dollars in exports about 500 to 600 million in remittances part of it diverted to food until recently through informal markets more as it and bpo exports while food imports are around 100 to 200 million dollars a month it is a relatively simple thing to keep the nation fed as long as people have some income even there are no price controls and no shortages food prices will be high like in korea food will be will be out of reach of the poor in particularly proteins will become expensive as in korea malnutrition will go up young children will be stunted sri lanka s interventionists and academic economists have got their korea wish but there is there is no spam no pork bones or px stores to bring relief

price growth i remember back in 2010 when starbucks sbux sbux initiated its dividend at the time a few pundits said starbucks new dividend program meant the coffee chain had run out of ways to grow rather than plunk money into r d and new stores it was just trying to keep investors complacent but that s typically not the case a dividend is a statement of confidence about its ability to generate consistent and likely growing earnings with tons of room left over to continue spending on future growth and when a company hikes dividends it s doubling down expressing even more confidence about its ability to maintain a robust bottom line in fact here s a look at what starbucks did since announcing its first dividend it returned 657 the secret order was sbux s dividend growth watch how its payout pulls its stock price higher the second quarter earnings season will soon be upon us and companies typically pair dividend announcements with their quarterly results so if we want to front run

a woman sitting next to president calvin coolidge at a dinner party once told him she had made a bet that she could get him to say more than two words you lose replied coolidge who served as president from 1923 until 1929 during a white house recital a nervous opera singer foundered through a performance before coolidge someone asked him what he thought of the singer s execution i m all for it he said coolidge was so taciturn that he was known as silent cal three u s presidents all of them founding fathers john adams thomas jefferson and james monroe died on july 4 only one was born on july 4 calvin coolidge was born in plymouth notch vermont 150 years ago on july 4 1872 he died in january 1933 getting to know coolidge fireworks rarely followed coolidge during his political career coolidge was balding 5 foot 9 with a slight build and he could walk into an empty room and blend in he rarely smiled or changed expression alice roosevelt longworth the daughter of president theodore roosevelt described coolidge s dour expression by saying he looked as if he had been weaned on a pickle such a description would not have offended coolidge i think the american public wants a solemn ass as a president he said and i think i ll go along with them best known for a laugh or two the 30th president remains a footnote in the history of u s presidents coolidge was preceded in the white house by warren harding whose administration was one of the most corrupt in u s history coolidge was succeeded by herbert hoover who was in office when the country fell into the throes of the great depression which began with the crash of the stock market in october 1929 several months after hoover took office coolidge is probably best known for his contributions to books of political humor i included him in a 2020 book i edited the art of the political putdown the greatest comebacks ripostes and retorts in history coolidge a republican who believed in small government low taxes morality thrift and tradition rose quickly but quietly in massachusetts politics where he became president of the state senate in 1914 while serving in this capacity two senators got into a bitter exchange of words in which one told the other to go to hell the recipient of the remark demanded that coolidge take his side i ve looked up the law senator coolidge told him and you don t have to go coolidge was elected governor of massachusetts in 1919 he soon earned a national reputation for being decisive by firing striking police officers in boston and ordering the state militia to bring calm to the city after the strike had left its inhabitants vulnerable to violent mobs in september 1919 warren harding the republican presidential nominee in 1920 chose coolidge as his running mate harding and coolidge won the election coolidge then became president when harding died in 1923 early in his term in december 1923 coolidge spoke to congress and pressed for isolation in u s foreign policy and tax cuts he believed in small government and also benefited from the country s strong economic position in the early 1920s this helped his popularity rise and he got more than 54 of the popular vote in the 1924 election a genius for inactivity if it was coolidge s decisive action that brought him to national attention it was his inaction as president that defined his presidency and won him the admiration of political conservatives newspaper columnist walter lippmann wrote this about coolidge in 1926 mr coolidge s genius for inactivity is developed to a very high point it is a grim determined alert inactivity which keeps mr coolidge occupied constantly historians however praise coolidge for presiding over low inflation low unemployment and budget surpluses during every year of his presidency he kept the country at peace and restored confidence in the government after the scandal plagued harding years but being president and taking daily naps still apparently left coolidge with a lot of free time coolidge reportedly liked to press the alarm buttons in the oval office and when the secret service agents ran into the office to see what was wrong he would be hiding coolidge decided not to run for reelection in 1928 when reporters asked him why he answered with characteristic succinctness because there s no chance for advancement he said if coolidge had been reelected he would have suffered hoover s fate of being president during the depression his political timing was as good as his comic timing social critic h l mencken once speculated on how coolidge would have responded to the collapse of the stock market and the collapse of the nation s economy he would have responded to bad times precisely as he responded to good ones that is by pulling down the blinds stretching his legs

consumers businesses and investors are demanding more digital innovations and greener options from their financial services providers the financial sector is on the cusp of yet another transformation customers emerging from covid 19 are demanding new and better sets of services to meet their new consumption patterns be it how they shop eat work or transfer money it s a dramatic shift that is compelling banks to transform or risk being left behind the traditional business model of banking has changed because customers expect more from banks it s not just lending and taking deposits but customers expect them to be an adviser for what they re doing says bambang moerwanto regional vice president of the germany based enterprise software corporation sap in the past customers were the ones going to brick and mortar banks but as digitisation is becoming the norm the bank is becoming more invisible and a service more like a utility now it s time for banks to go after the customers he said at think 2022 a recent technology conference sponsored by ibm in singapore to reach out to current and potential customers banks want to be present everywhere and one way for them to do that is the adoption of open banking said kunaciilan nallapan vice president for asia pacific china and japan of f5 an american technology company specialising in application security multi cloud management and online fraud prevention open banking is a system that gives banks the ability to connect with third party providers to offer a wider range of services because consumers generally place high trust in banks they are more likely to be receptive to third party providers offering some services in conjunction with or on behalf of their banks this is technically called an open application programming interface api in any case banks need to continually adapt to new technologies and trends to stay relevant many are now embracing digital assets including cryptocurrency non fungible tokens nfts or even various metaverse linked applications for example and as with many other organisations more and more of what banks do will be done in the cloud to take advantage of the speed and agility that is not possible with conventional data centre infrastructure i think that adopting the cloud by banking and financial services organisations is inevitable said mr nallapan cloud services are also scalable as demand arises a lot of banks realised as the pandemic set in that they were not quite prepared for the scale of remote working the scale of customer access or online access he pointed out the only way to scale is through adoption of cloud the move to the cloud is also being hastened by competition from fintech which was born in the cloud he added the challenge for traditional banks seeking to move to the cloud is that they are part of a highly regulated industry and therefore not everything can be transformed at the same speed front end technologies such as internet banking apps and apis are better cloud candidates because they are not as heavily regulated as core banking and back office operations cloud adoption also differs across countries mr nallapan noted he named australia new zealand singapore and hong kong as examples of jurisdictions where banks are more ready to move to the cloud because the regulatory framework is very clear about what banks can and cannot do the financial services industry is also making more use of artificial intelligence ai according to the global ai adoption index 2022 by ibm ai is being used to detect fraud and cybercrime as well as to create hyper personalised services for customers it can also address labour shortages as it helps to automate tasks about one third of companies worldwide are now deploying ai applications such as natural language processing for fields such as marketing sales and customer care thirty percent of global it professionals say employees at their organisation are already saving time with new ai and automation software tools the report added ai is a backbone in the industry and it is driven by data said tuhina singh chief executive officer and co founder of propine a licensed digital asset custodian based in singapore however finding the right data is what banks and financial institutions are struggling with ninety percent of the data today is unstructured it s not in any way usable to get to the right reliable outcomes having the right data in place is very important ms singh said one solution is the use of data fabric what data fabric essentially does is it allows any organisation to use and access data that is sitting in silos across the distributed environment without needing to copy or move it privacy and governance are also embedded in it in ms singh s view with changing consumer behaviours and advanced technologies the nature of banking regulation across different jurisdictions which has long been a strength is becoming a weakness innovations that take place only at the margins may not be enough if banks are not innovating at the core in her view banks are going to get disintermediated extremely fast she said as many of the services they have typically offered will be provided by fintech banks are aware of this so they are moving to a mixed model where they outsource services that they don t have the speed and scale to do while forming strategic and collaborative partnerships to integrate new infrastructure where needed sustainability will become a race that banks have to embrace says bambang moerwanto regional vice president of sap supplied cybersecurity a priority the nature of a bank is that it has a large and sensitive repository of personal and financial data now with more touch points such as cashless transactions digital banking and open apis cybersecurity risk is a number one concern authorities are getting a lot more stringent said kp unnikrishnan vice president of marketing for asia pacific and japan of palo alto networks a us based multinational cybersecurity company they re putting a lot more pieces of the puzzle in place which is making banks more and more accountable and responsible to ensure that they are investing in the right cybersecurity postures the bad news is banks are prime targets of cyber attacks the good news is they are the most prepared mr unnikrishnan said his company surveyed 500 asean based organisations in five key industries and found that those in financial services 79 and fintech 76 are more focused on cybersecurity than the average of 74 with malware identified as a top concern cybersecurity budgets have also increased the most for organisations in financial services 81 and fintech 75 compared to the 68 average they want to make sure that while they re giving the customer a high level of personalised banking services it should not be at the expense of security cybersecurity is not just a product that a company buys off the shelf mr unnikrishnan explained it needs to be a resilience factor that they can build in at every step for example when talking with customers logging into the network or securing data centres with remote working now a fact of life for countless organisations cyber risk is growing because more things are getting done on unsecured networks this is causing companies to adopt a zero trust approach in which no device should be automatically trusted and every device must be verified even if connected to a secure corporate network mr unnikrishnan described cybersecurity as a journey we re nowhere near to completion because we always have to be a couple of steps ahead of the adversary to make sure that we re all safe banks want to be present everywhere and one way for them to do that is the adoption of open banking says kunaciilan nallapan vice president for asia pacific china and japan of f5 supplied embedded sustainability another growing priority for financial services providers is sustainability as more consumers and investors favour businesses with a purpose driven agenda when it comes to economic social and governance esg issues as more industries integrate sustainability plans into their business models banks can serve as enablers mr moerwanto noted for example many banks have already announced plans to stop or phase out lending for activities that pollute the environment such as coal fired power plants sustainability will become a race that banks have to embrace as part of the origination process he said a study by oxford economics and the ibm institute for business value which interviewed 3 000 chief executives in banking and financial markets found that 80 expect sustainability investments to improve business results in the next five years banks now are developing and launching products to meet green demand including green bonds climate targeting industrial investments personal loans that encourage consumers to be more environment friendly and sustainability focused exchange traded funds etfs amid pressure from board members investors partners regulators and governments bank ceos are engaging with their leadership teams to make the right investments in sustainability initiatives however the report also noted that 60 of respondents believed unclear return on investment roi and economic benefits followed by a lack of reliable data was hindering their ability to develop their sustainability strategies a bank s approach to the cloud strategy can be an important part of its sustainability strategy the report noted it sees a multi hybrid cloud infrastructure as essential as it allows for more energy efficient usage of data centres and computing environments banks are going to get disintermediated extremely fast if they cannot produce more digital innovations says tuhina singh ceo and co founder of propine supplied talent hunt transformation cannot happen effectively without talent finding the right gems in the workforce pool is a challenge these days when demand outstrips supply for many crucial skills the reality is there are not enough people with the right skill sets with the right mindset with the right working attitude who are adopting and adapting to the new ways of working said chun yin mak managing partner for business transformation services with ibm consulting asia pacific talent skills culture and adoption are the biggest challenges as well as opportunities for any organisation to successfully transform he added so the talent war is not only about fighting over the same people but in terms of exponential increases in costs said mr chun how you actually retain engage and really inspire people to leverage your company as a career platform as a life platform as well because most people spend most of their living hours at work the banking and financial industry requires some specific skills as it moves to be more digitised in ms singh s view every candidate she would hire today has to be thought of in terms of what they can bring to the organisation in 2030 these people have to be very comfortable with the use of technology because routine tasks are going to get fully automated she said that means that the talent that will be in demand in 2030 is going to be people who will have the ability to drive business decisions and business analysis second we need people who understand tech and business better third we need talent and people who will be able to drive end to end processes across disciplines cross disciplinary knowledge will be in very high demand because that s how we need to develop our own workforces to prepare for doing that soft skills are also as important as technical skills she noted collaboration skills a growth mindset and the ability to work across the enterprise are all sought after because innovation cannot happen if everyone is in their own silos

was the irs in house national taxpayer advocate from 2001 to 2019 and warned repeatedly about the decreased level of vetting they re the gatekeeper to this whole universe of charitable subsidies and if the irs is not doing its job as a gatekeeper then you ve got real problems the agency declined to answer questions about hosang s case citing taxpayer privacy laws it also declined to make officials available for in person interviews but it released a written statement saying that the fast track approval system continues to reduce taxpayer burden and increase cost effectiveness of irs

cancer society for children inc it wasn t connected to the american cancer society i got sidetracked my son passed away hosang said in the interview at his home explaining how he had turned to setting up charities it was not a stable mind at the time he began running the operation at a time when the agency was already ill prepared to detect signs of fraud in new applicants advertisement article continues below this ad the first problem according to former irs officials tax law does not prohibit nonprofits from impersonating better known nonprofits by using sound alike names the second there are no systematic checks for a history of fraud you could be jesse james or john dillinger said marcus s owens who headed the agency s tax exempt section until 2000 and now represents charities at the law firm loeb loeb there s nothing that says you can t apply for tax exempt status from a jail cell having been convicted of charity fraud still former officials said the irs bureaucracy once offered a powerful weapon against potential fraudsters examiners who suspected fraud could slow down applications by asking for financial records plans for the future or information about their officers the requests were often a bluff of sorts intended to deter applicants from proceeding even though the agency had little power to block them if they pressed ahead advertisement article continues below this ad congress hasn t given the irs authorization to issue rules to make sure charities are not run by crooks owens said the agency in its written statement said that employees reviewing new applications have been trained to identify fraud hosang still got through between 2014 and 2018 the agency approved 17 of his applications for groups with american cancer society in their names according to irs

jurisdictions that worked in north dakota washington and california but the state by state approach was slow advertisement article continues below this ad in 2018 the american cancer society decided it needed a national approach it wrote to the irs laying out the pattern it had identified in hosang s groups it feels a little like scooby doo said meghan biss a former irs lawyer who represented the american cancer society it shouldn t have been that hard to figure out who the bad guy was using the exact same mailing address i am the american cancer society of like 19 different cities she said adding that didn t raise flags to anyone american cancer society officials said they never heard back from the irs advertisement article continues below this ad but then in 2020 the agency approved four new groups connected to hosang the american cancer society of michigan and of detroit and of green bay and of cleveland same staten island mailbox sometimes you can get away with things biss said not because you were so smart but because the people who were supposed to be watching out were not as it turned out hosang had switched to using a new irs process for smaller charities the new program was established in 2014 in response to budget cuts and a scandal in which the agency was accused of targeting conservative groups for undue scrutiny the new ez application stripped 11 pages of questions down to three nine boxes to check and a small blank for groups to describe their mission there was little room for irs officials to mire suspected scammers in bureaucracy the denial rate for new charities which had been as high as 1 in 53 applicants in the old system fell to 1 in 2 400 in this one advertisement article continues below this ad one 2019 study by the agency s taxpayer advocate found that 46 of the applicants it approved were not actually qualified usually because their charters did not conform to charity law it also noted that the mission statements were often so vague as to be useless in 2021 federal records show the irs approved groups whose mission statements were in their entirety charitable activity non profit and need to fill in possibly a forgotten note to self hosang switched to the fast track system in 2019 according to agency records his mailbox in staten island was the same the red flags were still red among the directors listed in these supposed charities there was a long dead classmate from nyu a long estranged friend from wall street and at least one person who appeared to be imaginary living on a street in brooklyn that does not exist but despite the american cancer society s warning hosang was even more successful than before in two years of using the fast track system hosang got the irs to approve 56 new charities zachary weinsteiger at the nonprofit rating group charity navigator said his group s analysts had noticed the pattern in the irs data and said it became almost comic like a single miscreant fooling the same border guards with bad disguises advertisement article continues below this ad one guy coming in in a bunch of dollar store costume pieces weinsteiger said he keeps crossing the border and everyone keeps thinking he s a different person but weinsteiger said hosang s success highlighted an unsettling problem the entire regulatory system for u s charities rests on the irs vetting process its approval signals to state governments and potential donors that a charity is legitimate it signals to internet giving platforms that a charity is worth including it would be very expensive to do background checks on all the charities the irs has already approved since there are 1 4 million of them said ted hart ceo of charities aid foundation america one of several online giving platforms that allowed donors to give to hosang s groups after they were approved hosang stole more than 3 000 through their platform according to the indictment in may we need to be able to trust this list of charities approved by the

south lake tahoe calif with california s new state budget awaiting an imminent signature from the governor lake tahoe community college ltcc is poised to bring affordable student residential living to its south shore campus ltcc will receive nearly 40 million in the new state budget to construct a 100 bed housing facility serving california residents who are low income full time college students construction for on campus housing could begin as soon as summer 2023 with students moving in no later than fall 2025 provided that appropriate construction approvals are granted in a timely manner ltcc has been working on bringing housing to south lake tahoe for nearly a decade said ltcc superintendent president jeff defranco until now the high cost of construction in the tahoe basin has made this project infeasible this funding allows ltcc to fulfill its vision of bringing affordable student housing to campus and will help students enroll and succeed in their educational mission ltcc applied for consideration for this funding in october 2021 and worked diligently to secure the support of community partners the california community colleges chancellor s office the california legislature and governor gavin newsom the project will include semi suite units providing 100 beds approximately 90 beds will be constructed in a double occupancy configuration and 10 units will be retained for single occupancy to support non traditional students including military veterans older adults and students who have privacy or mental health needs that can best be accommodated in a private unit plans call for an approximately 32 000 square foot housing facility that provides separate living units shared community spaces and close proximity to the college s existing student center this center already houses a commercial grade kitchen a cafeteria style serving area with grab and go food options and a large open space to accommodate sit down dining service each bedroom will include a small area with a refrigerator microwave countertop cupboard and sink allowing students to prepare small meals and snacks in their rooms ltcc will establish maximum rental amounts to ensure that low income students can access these facilities specifically rents will start at 500 bed per month for double occupancy rooms and 795 bed for single occupancy rooms when the facility opens in order to access residential living on campus students will be required to register and maintain a fulltime load of 12 units minimum each quarter this supports students being able to complete their degrees and transfer to four year institutions in a timely fashion securing the funding needed to plan for and construct on campus student housing has been nearly 10 years in the making residential living has been championed by president defranco since his arrival on campus in 2012 and it was first formally included in ltcc s master plan in 2014 in november of that year ltcc included ballot language as part of the measure f bond to pay for a feasibility study to assess the need for on campus housing this feasibility study and subsequent planning efforts positioned ltcc to compete and ultimately secure this funding the benefits of local taxpayers supporting our measure f bond keep coming said defranco we would have struggled to come up with the study costs without local voter support this is yet another example of the importance of this bond and what it is bringing to our community this small investment is leading to big gains after measure f was approved by a majority of local voters ltcc contracted with a vendor to complete the feasibility study in 2016 student demand was gauged through focus group meetings and a survey in 2019 ltcc contracted with the concourse group to develop a residential living concept and explore different project scopes the considerable task of finding the funding to construct housing remained a hurdle with skyrocketing california construction costs further complicating ltcc s ability to pay for such a large and expensive project in 2020 ltcc hired a senior director of government relations and grant development to focus on securing funding for ltcc projects last year senate bill 169 was passed creating a 1 billion investment for the construction of student housing at community colleges ltcc submitted its student housing application with the california department of finance in october 2021 requesting just over 39 million in december staff from california s community college chancellor s office visited ltcc college leadership to discuss this funding request construction plans and the south shore community s critical housing need that visit combined with a focused effort by college leadership members to advocate with state legislators directly in sacramento with approved plans in hand got ltcc included on a list of community colleges to be considered for housing funding the approved state budget provides additional money beyond sb 169 adding 542 million in construction funding for 11 community colleges to help address affordable student housing needs around the state it s part of a record 300 billion budget made possible by growth in tax revenues fed by income gains among california s wealthiest residents it contains significant funding to support college and university student housing and campus expansion projects it also expands financial aid for older students by increasing the cal grants tuition coverage program the tahoe basin is facing an affordable housing crisis with 15 million visitors coming to the basin annually a large percentage of lake tahoe s housing stock is being used as second homes or as short term rentals the covid 19 pandemic and the opportunity some had for remote work exacerbated existing housing shortages average home prices have increased by 35 percent since 2020 and the rental vacancy rate is regularly below 2 percent making finding an affordable rental quite difficult the 2019 south shore region housing needs and opportunities study conducted by the tahoe prosperity center found that 48 percent of renters and 34 percent of owners in the south shore area are housing cost burdened including 85 percent of households making under 40 000 per year the study also indicates a shortage of rentals at any price in the area and of those available there is a shortage of units in good condition

if you are looking for a one and done reit you should be thinking about getting as much bang for your buck as possible the idea of buying just one real estate investment trust reit is hard to get my head around because there are so many different property niches but if you are looking for a one and done reit to provide you with a solid and growing stream of passive income you should put w p carey wpc 1 75 on your short list here s why i own this landlord and why you might want to as well spreading its bets long term investors know that diversification is important because it helps to reduce volatility over time it s why you should own a couple dozen stocks so that some will be doing well while others are struggling property sectors are similar since some will be doing well as others are not good examples of this today are offices which are struggling as employees are still avoiding a return to normal work patterns and warehouses which are seeing historically high rent increases and elevated demand w p carey interestingly enough has exposure to both areas but that s not all it has in its portfolio to put some numbers on the reit s property exposure it generates 26 of rents from industrial assets 24 from warehouses 19 from offices 18 from retail and 5 from self storage facilities the remainder is classified as other which is actually a pretty big catch all meanwhile roughly 37 of w p carey s rent roll is located outside the united states mostly in europe it is easily one of the most diversified reits you can own using what it s got one of the more interesting things here is that w p carey has always been opportunistic in the way it invests for example it prefers to buy properties in sale leaseback deals that let it get an insider look at a company s finances with this extra insight into a company s rent paying ability it can comfortably take on lessees that others might deem too risky doing direct deals also allows w p carey to have more control over rent terms so it can include things like inflation indexed rent increases roughly 58 of its leases have these currently desirable built in hikes those are more subtle benefits of the company s approach a more obvious one is w p carey s ability to switch between property types and geographies as it looks for the best deals for example most of its retail exposure is in europe where management believes retail is less overbuilt than in the united states and during the early days of the coronavirus pandemic the reit announced it was looking to invest in industrial and warehouse space sectors that have done particularly well since that point this is a huge benefit that shouldn t be overlooked noting that the broad other category even provides w p carey the leeway to do one off deals in sectors where it doesn t have a broader focus the proof is in the dividends the big question however is whether the reit has been able to turn these positive traits into positive results for investors on that score it has increased its dividend annually since its 1998 initial public offering ipo the dividend growth rate hasn t been huge of late but slow and steady is really what you would expect for a landlord of this size in fact overly rapid growth could indicate that the management team is perhaps taking on additional risk that you may not want if you are only going to own one reit with a generous dividend yield of 5 or so w p carey is the type of reit that you could set and forget knowing that you ve covered the broader real estate basket pretty well
the king of rock n roll has always been a fixture in pop culture with the release of baz luhrmann s biopic elvis presley is officially back in the building at least in spirit get our free mobile app the number one movie in america right now is elvis which dives into the rise and fall of one of the world s most iconic musicians described on rotten tomatoes the film delves into the complex dynamic between presley and parker spanning over 20 years from presley s rise to fame to his unprecedented stardom against the backdrop of the evolving cultural landscape and loss of innocence in america colonel tom parker played by tom hanks in the film was presley s manager who in this film is made out to be the villain the nearly 3 hour long picture has garnered 31 2 million at the u s box office it is certified fresh on rotten tomatoes with a 94 audience approval rating for the music flick this movie is getting mostly positive reviews like a musical biopic as filtered through the lens of a superhero epic sonny bunch and some very spicy comments like baz luhrmann photobombs this elvis portrait with over extravagant filmmaking that dwarfs the iconic rock and roller and that ain t easy dwight brown most of the praise is going towards austin butler s performance as the american legend elvis has never been a stranger to harsh critics the legendary musician has had his fair share of wild comments after a performance that presley did in iowa one critic had a creative and fiery response the singer made several stops in iowa in 1956 one of those shows was in sioux city at the municipal auditorium on may 23rd according to the sioux city journal this performance came nearly five months before his iconic first appearance on the ed sullivan show back then tickets for his show were 1 50 2 or 2 50 an ad in the sioux city publication reads elvis the nation s only atomic powered singer will bring his all star variety show to the auditorium he is said to be the favorite of teen agers journalist marjorie howe of the sioux city journal covered the event and clearly had some issues with elvis presley she seemed to have disliked it so much that she titled her review of the show teen agers like presley s antics but others do not in the article she described a hysterical crowd of about 5 000 people coming to see the king of rock n roll that wednesday evening his performance was the most disgusting exhibition this reporter has ever seen okay clearly not a fan but she had to find something that she liked about it right maybe she didn t like the performance but still enjoyed elvis wrong for presley is the male counterpart of a hoochee koochee dancer in a burlesque show can we bring back describing things as hoochee koochee you don t hear phrases like that anymore howe went on to completely obliterate elvis and his iowa performance he wears long sideburns and is beginning to get fat marjore going for the jugular here then she writes the single greatest and wildest sentence i ve ever read in my entire life she describes the way elvis dances the act was merely variations on a single theme except that every new wiggle was a little more low down in presley s own words and quite soon the orgy was ended not only did she hate this young man s guts but she also was adamant that he wouldn t last in the music industry for that long the only consolation is a prediction that elvis presley s sensational popularity will be short lived you can read the full review here while we don t know the full setlist for this show it is confirmed that the singer did perform two of his biggest hits blue suede shoes and hound dog did you know these absurd baby names are banned in iowa these baby names are not only banned in iowa but banned throughout the entire united states these are stock baby photos none of these babies have these names

4million or 1 75 per cent to close at 39 16billion in june 2022 the decline in external reserves is coming on the backdrop of a steady increase in global oil prices as gas costs soar amid fears of a global economic shock from russia s invasion of ukraine according to the cbn daily crude oil price in six months of 2022 appreciated by 70 3 per cent or 53 62 per barrel to 129 87 from 76 25 per barrel reported on december 31 2021 experts expressed that the current crisis in niger delta relating to oil theft might be responsible for dwindling production a major contributing factor impacting on external reserves growth on the backdrop of increase in global oil prices they noted that the increasing cbn s intervention in the foreign exchange market is also a contributing factor the international monetary fund imf had warned that nigeria s external reserves could fall to 29 1billion by 2024 on the back of lower oil prices restricted eurobond market access and higher capital outflows according to the report the country s foreign position is weaker as foreign buffers are limited the washington based lender said high interest payments relative to fiscal revenues expose nigeria to interest rate and growth shocks a member of the cbn s monetary policy committee mpc mike obadan who is a professor of economics university of benin during the may 2022 meeting in his personal statement noted that in light of the foregoing the nigerian economy has continued to exhibit features which make monetary policy choices difficult for the policy makers in particular the monetary authority two of these features are fragile economic growth and escalating inflation others are high and unstable exchange rate uncomfortable external reserves levels the stock at 38 61 billion in april 2022 covers 7 2 months of import of goods and services crude oil export regime which does not yield accretion to external reserves weak capital inflows and balance of payments position bourgeoning fiscal deficits and associated high domestic and external debt both of which gulp a significant proportion of government revenue in debt servicing among others mr robert asogwa who is a member in his personal statement at the end of march 2022 meeting had said the large oil thefts in the niger delta region has diminished the possible benefits to the country as oil production level has dropped consistently however the current level of reserves is still adequate to shield the economy against external vulnerabilities he added the former president chartered institute of bankers of nigeria president prof segun ajibola noted that the dwindling external reserves to the crisis in niger delta and sustained foreign exchange interventions by cbn he said nigeria is having a peculiar oil theft challenge in the niger delta and that is affecting our daily production quota government is still trying to confront pipeline vandalises causing confusion at the points of production which is expected to have a negative impact on the country s ability to meet the opec quota allocated to nigeria he explained further that most of nigeria s oil transactions are paid for most times in 90 day times it is called forward transactions in some cases we go into a swap agreement whereby those that refined products for nigeria are paid back through crude oil it means we are not selling but exchanging through crude oil when we do forward transactions the money does not reflect in the external reserve immediately those are the complicated issues in the global market that most people will not understand common man on the street will expect the steady hike in global oil price to impact on our external reserve but the underline challenges might delay it

how you can approach social media for analysing financial markets therefore it is important that at first you have a firm understanding of the fundamental drivers for the assets that you trade and are also constantly up to date with the current themes narratives with this knowledge of key market drivers alongside current market positioning sentiment as a trader this will better prepare you as to how markets will react to new information keep in mind that the current price of an asset reflects all available information or so it should according to the efficient market hypothesis subsequently whenever new information is released whether that be economic data or central bank rate decisions the price of an asset will typically move to find a new price which reflects that information however there is an argument that a lot of macro news is simply noise and does not have a significant impact on the assets you trade and i do sympathise with that view to an extent when incoming newsflow is flashing on your screen you can break it down by asking two questions is this information new and if so does it deviate from the market narrative consensus expectations is this information noteworthy if your answer to both questions is no then you can say with good authority that the new information is not market moving i appreciate that this is a skill that will not be mastered immediately and quite frankly may never be completely mastered as is usually the case with anything you do in life experience over time is what counts which will go a long way in helping you digest key macro newsflow efficiently as i mentioned above dailyfx has covered this topic in great detail so for a complete comprehensive guide on trading the news click on the link below the role of twitter whether you re a millennial on tiktok hoping to become the next viral sensation or someone who scrolls endlessly through instagram social media has fundamentally changed the way that we interact with each other and disseminate new information since the creation of twitter in 2006 the micro blogging platform has seen its user base grow significantly becoming arenowned source of breaking news updated instantly by those who are closest to the event ranging from journalists government officials company executives or even a bored multi billionaire looking at you elon who may end up owning the platform twitter in numbers monthly active users 330mln daily number of tweets 500mln when did twitter become important for traders ap fake tweet april 23rd 2013 djia 1 in minutes before retracing source bloomberg for me this is a tough one to pinpoint given that i have only been in markets since 2014 although looking back a key moment that provided a stark look at twitter s growing importance on financial markets came after the hack crash in 2013 according to the associated press a false message stated that there had been two explosions at the white house with the president at the time barack obama being injured this saw around 130bln temporarily wiped from us indices before retracing in a matter of minutes shortly after the false tweet the white house spokesman noted that the president was fine while ap later stated that they had been hacked consequently with the impact seen by all that a tweet can have on financial markets this had sped up the process of traders adopting twitter as a means for monitoring breaking news however this example also highlights the fact that twitter is an unfiltered newswire where the authenticity of news can often come into question which i will delve into later in this report examples twitter ahead of traditional newswires over the years and more recently given notable political events namely brexit and us china trade wars there have been numerous occasions where twitter has been quicker to report breaking macro and company news than traditional newswires bloomberg and refintiv when this occurs i judge this as providing traders with an edge over the market what i mean by the market is algo s trading off bloomberg and refinitiv headlines but to save column inches i will go through a few noteworthy examples where twitter has provided an edge case study 1 oil market april 2020 oil prices had collapsed as traders responded to the onset of the coronavirus crisis with the first wave of global lockdowns prompting oil demand to plunge by 1 3 matters had been made worse for the oil market with oil plummeting to an 18 year low after russia and saudi arabia had engaged in a price war on april 2nd 2020 at 15 30gmt cnbc published the tweet below in the following 42 seconds bloomberg had published the original tweet while a flashing red bbg headline occurred at 15 34 49 refinitiv on the other hand had run the full tweet at 15 32 39 in an 8 minute period from tweet to peak brent crude oil rose over 37 source ice dailyfx case study 2 trade war august 2019 in the tradition of politics in the age of social media market participants had grown accustomed to monitoring former us president donald trump s twitter account for market moving political announcements which largely centred around trade wars with china on august 1st 2019 us president trump escalated trade war tensions with china by announcing that the us will put on 10 tariffs on 300bln worth of chinese products prior to the tweet hitting traditional newswires usd jpy fell from 108 14 to 108 00 while the subsequent move after bloomberg reported the tweet saw usd jpy extend its move lower to hit a low of 107 26 in the following 30 minutes source bloomberg dailyfx case study 3 brexit october 2020 during the brexit saga the first point of communication for many political correspondents had been via twitter this meant that traders who followed high ranking journalists that typically received the latest scoop from the halls of westminster had a speed advantage over bbg refinitiv owners the example below shows one of many occasions where twitter had been quicker to report breaking brexit news of course the risk was the authenticity reliability of the headlines however this was largely dependent on the journalist who tweeted the report on october 1st 2020 a political correspondent tweeted that the probability of a brexit deal had shifted from 30 to 70 as such in the near 4 minutes before the tweet crossed the wires refinitiv gbp usd rose from 1 2841 to 1 2871 before taking a fresh leg higher from 1 2871 to 1 2976 in 36 minutes after the tweet had been picked up by refinitiv source bloomberg how to spot fake news the one obvious drawback to twitter is the spread of misinformation or as donald trump likes to say fake news newsflow across twitter is typically less credible than more traditional news sources wsj sky news bbc cnbc however there are several steps you can take to help identify fake news is the account verified in other words does the account have a blue tick if so this increases the authenticity of that account s tweets following follower ratio an account providing news will typically have a low following account relative to followers erroneous spelling in the profile name and bio is common for fake accounts particularly those that impersonate other accounts with letters replaced with numbers o and 0 twitter join date a fake account is typically on twitter for a short period of time as they tend to be suspended rather quickly this also ties into the number of tweets which are considerably lower in fake accounts than official news accounts that tweet 24 7 how can traders effectively monitor twitter an efficient way to

if you look beyond the condescending sanctimonious and unintelligent questioning and pantomime from cbs news margaret brennan there are some very interesting aspects outlined by german chancellor olaf scholz i was looking for how cbs would inject the pending global food shortage into the interview and what narrative angle they would use the coordinated media political talking point russia starving the world comes up in the last third of the interview germany is the largest and most heavily industrialized economy in the european union eu as a result germany makes most of the decisions about how the eu operates former german chancellor angela merkel always played the role of supporting nato however her approach to government was one of the most closed controlling and nationalist hypocrisies within the european union if it was in germany s interest it was done if it was not directly beneficial to germany it was never done merkel s replacement olaf scholz is not that different from his predecessor in regard to the economics of nationalism the predominant view for any german leader however scholz is more of a collaborator an outward looking chancellor seemingly more globally and communally minded than merkel scholz is more accepting of biden usa influence than angela merkel was scholz is also spending more on german military than merkel would ever consider in this interview scholz outlines the conflict in ukraine while overlaying his perspective of russian president vladimir putin as an outcome of their discussions watch margaret brennan mr chancellor thank you so much for making time in your busy schedule for us olaf scholz good morning margaret brennan so i read your biographer says you don t often answer directly but i m going to try my best today you speak with vladimir putin do you think that russia is a terrorist state as president zelenskyy says olaf scholz russia started a very brutal aggression against ukraine a lot of people are dying in ukraine citizens men women children elderly people and this is what we call a really brutal unjustified war that has that russia started and we have to do all to support ukraine and to give ukraine the chance to defend its own integrity and serenity and that is what we are doing when we support the country margaret brennan but calling it a terrorist state in your view doesn t achieve anything olaf scholz it achieves something when we support ukraine with all the financial means we give to the ukraine with all the humanitarian aid with all the weapons we deliver and we will continue doing this as long as it is necessary for supporting ukraine and for avoiding that the outcome of this war is what putin is looking for a dictated peace and this is something that neither the ukraine nor we will accept so it is necessary that we continue with this very strong support and it is necessary that we also continue with all the sanctions we imposed on russia and this is an important aspect from my as i see it we impose sanctions against one russia after the election of crimea not too many but we did margaret brennan back in 2014 olaf scholz and they are still in place we imposed sanctions against russia when they organize the uprisings in the east of donbass in ukraine and they are still in place and all the very heavy sanctions we impose on russia now will be there if there is not a real fair piece from the perspective of ukraine and this is the message i sent to putin and many others do the same and we make it very clear you cannot look for a dictate piece against ukraine margaret brennan when you speak to putin does he acknowledge the sanctions does he acknowledge how much his economy has been hurt or does he just not care olaf scholz i think he cares but he will not really admit it so you get some margaret brennan because it hasn t stopped him olaf scholz idea you get some idea that it really is hurting him and that he understands the deep impacts of our sanctions on his economy and i m always mentioning it because it s necessary to say it just to give you a view on this question if a very advanced country like the united states or germany with a very progressive economy with high tech industries would go out of the world and would just stick to itself we would go down in economic growth very very soon but this is now happening to a country that is not that advanced that is really needing all the technologies from the rest of the world for having a similar standard of living and for having the chance to be part of growth in the world economy and this is now the real damage to the russian economy that they have no chance to do this and it s also hurting them because many of the things even the military weapons they produce themselves are in one or the other way just linked to the economic and technological progress of the world and so they will go back very very far margaret brennan when will russia know when will russia no longer have the ability to continue this fight when will putin run out of weapons run out of funds or can this continue for years olaf scholz no one really knows he has he has he is perhaps the leader of a very great country with a lot of people living there with a lot of means and he is really doing this brutal war with and he prepared for it for very long i think the decision to to do this war was taken one year before it started or possibly earlier because he prepared for it and so he will be able to continue with the war really a long time but this is the message we say to him we are able to support the ukraine as long as necessary for defending its serenity the democracy the rule of law and all the things the people in ukraine are looking for margaret brennan president zelensky has said that he would like to see the war end by the end of the year how does it end and is that realistic olaf scholz it is very difficult to judge whether this is realistic because this is something that is decided on the ground and even more is this one of the reason why we are so active supporting the ukraine with all the different means i already discussed on financial humanitarian support sanctions and delivery of weapons margaret brennan so russia s invasion of ukraine has been called a 9 11 moment for europe a big wake up call do you think that europe and do you think germany was just too complacent for too long olaf scholz i think too many in the world were hoping that we are living in a different world that is different to the experiences of the last century and the centuries before where might and power were deciding on the future of countries and not the rules and the agreements we have between states and we have had an agreement that there should be no attempt to change territory to to change borders to invade the neighbor and this agreement is now canceled by putin and this is what i called site and vendor in german a watershed moment of international politics peace is a danger and this is why it is absolutely necessary that we spend more for defense and germany is going in elite in this question in europe margaret brennan so it was too complacent olaf scholz i think we should have been prepared for that situation and but it is really a big big disaster for the expectations of all of us looking at peace the chances we have in the world are better if there s no attempt to change borders with war and things like that but now we are in that situation and we have to be realistic and this is why we have to do more margaret brennan what is the fundamental nature of this conflict because the head of the british army called it a 1937 moment is that how you see it is that the moment in history we are in right now olaf scholz i think this is a moment where we have to make absolutely clear that we are strong enough that no one should just think about attacking for instance nato territory and this is why i said to my parliament that we are ready and willing to defend any centimeter every centimeter of nato territory in in europe and that we are together with our allies and this is a very clear message to our eastern margaret brennan and that s a clear message that s a clear line but there are plenty of territories around russia that aren t members of nato do you think vladimir putin has his goal set as going into moldova or surrounding countries olaf scholz let me just stick one second to what i already said because of this i decided to to establish an extra budget for spending for military 100 billion euros and that we will increase our spending up to approximately 2 all the years to come and this will really create an army that has the strongest funding between the nato allies and europe and this is what we are sticking to and we will continue to do this margaret brennan which was a big change for germany olaf scholz this is something where we are acting realistically in a different time now and this is necessary to do it what is putin thinking of he is thinking like the imperialists in the 17th 18th 19th century he is thinking that all about the nation is power and that if you are mighty enough you can just take territory of your neighbors and this is an activity and an idea we cannot accept and we will not accept and this is why we are so strong on this question he was always very very critical about nato and the european union and when i talked to him i said you have to accept the european union and that a big alliance of democratic states is building a very strong federal group of states the union a union outside of you and he was very much thinking about nato and i told him nato is not aggressive it s just about defense but he thinks he has just to spend all the money he earns for the for his military abilities and sometimes using it and this is what should fail now and this is why we are doing the right thing when we support the ukraine margaret brennan do you believe that vladimir putin will stop at ukraine olaf scholz i think that all what we do will help to give him the view that this is not working and that he will not be successful margaret brennan so open question on that when it comes to nato territory you now have these two new members finland and sweden potentially joining the alliance it looks like they will will vladimir putin view that as provocative as more of a threat olaf scholz all wondered how he would react to the application of finland and sweden for nato but in the end he accepted it this is how i see it and he has to because it is the decision of these countries that they want to join and it is our decision that we take them because they are really much fitting to the concept of nato democratic states that are very strong with their own activities in defense and this will strengthen the alliance margaret brennan let me ask you about germany your country has earned this reputation of over promising and under delivering when it comes to ukraine you know that you ve heard that criticism ukraine received its very first delivery of german howitzers artillery last week why did it take that long we re in the fifth fifth month olaf scholz so we took a very very hard decision to change political strategies we followed for many decades margaret brennan right olaf scholz never to deliver weapons into a country that is in a conflict and when we decided when i decided to change that practice of our country a lot of other european countries followed and this made it that the group big group of countries are now supporting the ukraine with weapons and do the best germany sent all the weapons we had our our stocks in our military infrastructure and we decided also to deliver new weapons from our industry which takes a longer time because they have to be produced but we did all these things and we continue to do so and when we decide for instance to send the most modern howitzer which you can buy on the world market which is in use in germany it was very difficult to organize that this could be used in the war because you have to have some training and we had ukrainian soldiers in germany and when the training ended in the end they came with the weapon with with the howitzers to ukraine and the margaret brennan but united states is doing that they re providing weaponry within 48 hours sometimes of the president signing and carrying out training olaf scholz i think margaret brennan why did it take this long for germany olaf scholz i think you should understand that there is a difference if a country like the united states spends that much for defense which is a very big long pause investment and you have a lot of weapons at your stocks the howitzers many other countries delivered to ukraine were not the most modern one but they were the stocks so we had to do this and this is how we are continuing you should know we are doing right this things which are necessary for helping now in this very situation in the east of ukraine and this is why we sent the weapons that were necessary and that are necessary there together with the united states and the united kingdom we decided to deliver multi rocket launches to ukraine now which are mb interjects those haven t been delivered yet olaf scholz we are sending them and we are doing it with the means and ways we have and with the training and once again there are a lot of very experienced people who yesterday looked at google and today they know how to do things but i will tell you there are weapons but you have to have your training and you have to have to have it not in ukraine you have to have it here in our countries and so the soldiers have to come to get the training and they are doing it this is what we do with many other things and if you look at this what we are sending from the perspective on of two weeks three weeks four weeks from now we will always see that germany is one of the countries that is doing the most because what we are sending now is the most sophisticated technology you can use there is also long pause anti ballistic there are also weapons we give to the to the ukraine that they can defend the air margaret brennan the anti aircraft missiles you ve promised radar you ve promised olaf scholz that they can defend the city from against the rockets and missiles that were sent there from putin and this is very expensive and very effective technology but they will get it margaret brennan when olaf scholz and this will help a country like odes to support to to defend the country a city like odessa or kyiv margaret brennan but i ask you when because you know that the delays have led to speculation that it s not about getting the supplies it s about the will of the government to actually deliver them and whether there s fear of provoking putin or whether it s years of budget cuts to your defense industry and to your defense budget that have made it just not possible for the german military to act quickly how do you respond to that olaf scholz those who are looking to the facts see that we are doing what is feasible and that we are doing the same things as our allies are doing and that we are using all the means we really have and when you compare what we are delivered to the ukraine and compared with activities of others you will find that we are very much aligned with all the others but the most important thing is that we are not just now supporting ukraine we are changing the way how we spend money for defense and this is the big increase which will change the situation and will give us the chance to be more quick in reaction to a threat that is coming to nato the alliance or to our country and this is why i decided to do this to do this and i will continue to follow this policy making germany strong enough for being the partner all our alliance allies in europe are looking for and all our allies in the transatlantic partnership margaret brennan but you re moving as fast as you can olaf scholz we will move as fast as we can and we are doing margaret brennan i want to ask you about german finances do you know how much right now germany is spending on russian energy olaf scholz it s decreasing the money we are spending and this is why we are why we have decided to change all the imports we have from fossil resources different to the united states we are not producing them ourselves we have to import them and we get them from many places of the world but we change we decided to go out of the import of fossil resources from russia and we did so with the import of coal which is not that difficult because we already imported most of it from other places we decided so to do so with the import of oil and we will go out of this imports in the end of this year which is also something which is now we are preparing for and which is from some region if we just if we look at the whole country will be will be relatively easy because oil is shipped and we are also working on some refineries in the east of germany that are not getting the oil by ship so we are making this feasible for them also and then we are we decided that we will build pipelines to the shores of the north of germany for importing lng this is margaret brennan liquefied natural gas olaf scholz liquefied natural natural gas and this is something i was looking for even when i was the mayor of hamburg because i thought it could be useful to have always the ability to change the the suppliers of your of of what you buy from in case of gas and this is why we are now doing it margaret brennan when we looked at the numbers though when we looked at the numbers germany is providing about 2 billion in aid to ukraine that s roughly what you spend per month on gas from russia on coal on energy supplies so while you re helping the ukrainians financially you re also essentially giving vladimir putin a financial lifeline olaf scholz he cannot buy anything from the money he s getting from us because he will he has all these sanctions on imports for modern technologies and things he is looking for so this is what is making very angry but to be very clear when we decided on sanctions together and with all our allies we said always we will do it in a way that we harm putin more than us and many countries in europe are depending for historical reasons and because they are near to the place and it is the nearest place to get the gas on the inputs of gas and when now whole europe is deciding to go out of this dependence this will change the scenario even on the world market margaret brennan but vladimir putin can use that money elsewhere just not in the west olaf scholz but he cannot buy margaret brennan so is it still 2 billion a month that germany is sending to russia olaf scholz it is always decreasing and i once again say that we decided that we do the sanc that we draft the sanctions in the way that they hurt putin and this is what we do and once again we are now doing real investments into technology in pipelines imports and i know that there people that sometimes think that when you are having taken a decision one afternoon the next morning you have a port and a 40 kilometers pipeline margaret brennan no it takes time olaf scholz but in the real life this is not happening but what we did is deciding on legislation we already did which makes it easy to build these pipelines with the own without any legal restrictions in the shortest time to come and we really hope that the first of them will be able to work in the beginning of the next year and if you see that things like this usually take 2 3 4 5 years and we do it in possibly six months or a bit more in the first part in the first pipelines that are going to work you see that we are very very strong and doing the necessary things for making us independent and this also is and but let me add this when europe is deciding to go out of the import of of gas from russia this will have consequences margaret brennan it ll have huge i mean this is the equivalent of them declaring olaf scholz 100 margaret brennan war on you olaf scholz this margaret brennan by cutting gas supplies to germany this isn t just your choice they re using that as a weapon against you olaf scholz this is obviously the case and this is why i was starting to discuss the question what to do if the gas delivery will be reduced right when i entered office it was my political decision to say that i want to know exactly what we have to do for in case of that and this is why we are not prepared for years but prepared since i am the chancellor of this country and this is why i was able after the war started to go to the parliament and say we will build this pipelines we will build this new ports for liquid liquefied natural gas and just to repeat this when whole europe in some years will be not dependent on the gas from russia it will get gas from other places but this is all together more than 150 nearly 160 billion cubic meters of gas that is now as a new request coming to the world market and this is one of the reasons why we should be very much prepared that we will have high energy prices all over the world in all countries because of the fact that the gas that russia is now supplying will to a certain extent which we will understand in some years will not be able to be sold and so we have to get it from other resources but this is a very tough time for global economy when we did this change margaret brennan it is it is and you run the largest economy in europe what happens in germany matters to the rest of the world so if you are looking at gas supplies potential shortages you could have freezing homes you could have shuttered factories have you decided when and which industries you prioritize which factories get shuttered first olaf scholz we prepare for the situation of having the difficulties may come up because of the energy supply and this is why we decided to make new legislation on storage capacities for gas legislation that is forcing the participants of the market that there should be 90 in the storages storage capacities of germany in the at the beginning of winter and this is now already taking place and the storages are becoming are now filled more than they were one year ago at that time we also decided to change legislation that we make it possible to say we will not use that many gas at in the summer for instance and we will use coal plants for producing electricity and so a lot of decisions are already taking and we are preparing our selves for a very difficult situation as many other european countries do and obviously countries all over the globe are doing thinking about what might come up margaret brennan when will you have to start rationing natural gas and will you have to shut down factories in the months ahead olaf scholz i think we will see how things are now moving how things are how the development will be in the future what we can do at this time is preparing ourselves for being ready to take the necessary decisions and this is what we do and we are all the time preparing with the necessary legislation that we are able to do what is necessary and not just looking for what we could do if we would have the right legal framework we will have it when it s necessary margaret brennan so germany s heavy industry association bdi warned a halt in russian gas deliveries would make recession inevitable the world bank economists say it s going to be very hard to avoid a recession is it inevitable olaf scholz it is not it will be very tough if we will have a shortage of energy supplies obviously all our countries all our all our life is depending on the supply of energy and obviously a lot of countries the most countries of the world are depending on the supply from abroad and so we have to prepare for a difficult situation and as i explained to you very detailed we are preparing and we are prepared margaret brennan but you are still preparing for energy prices to stay high for years how long olaf scholz i m sure that this will be a time where the energy prices will be high all over the globe because of the request and this is one reason why we accelerate our way out of the use of fossil resources you should know that germany decided that we will be a co2 neutral country in 2045 which is less than 25 years and this means that we are now expanding the production of electricity and of en with offshore wind with onshore wind with solar energy that we are expanding the investment into our grid so that we are able to have a completely different industry doing steel doing chemistry doing producing cement with the use of electricity and hydrogen in the end and so we are just going faster into the better world we are already looking for margaret brennan right but inflation is crushing standards of living around the world vladimir putin is weaponizing inflation he s weaponizing food is he right to bet that he can fracture the western alliance by making it harder for europeans and americans and everyone else to afford food in these months ahead olaf scholz you re very right the shortages of food many people in the world are seeing now as a threat to them are the direct consequence of what russia s aggression against ukraine and the war he is imposing on the country you re right that all the rising energy prices are also a direct consequence of his doing and he is he is the one that is doing the wrong things and we are always discussing this with our partners on the globe we are starting an initiative to support countries that have not enough food with food we re supporting the general secretary in finding a way how to get out all the wheat out of ukraine margaret brennan how olaf scholz through the world war he is discussing intensely on ways how this could happen not just with trains what we are organizing together with the ukrainians but also with shipping because this is something where we will find in the next one or two weeks if an agreement between russia ukraine turkey the united nations will be feasible margaret brennan do you really think olaf scholz but coming back to margaret brennan that vladimir putin is going to allow grain to be shipped out of ukraine he s shut down the black sea ports this is a really powerful weapon against the west why would he give that up why would he agree to let the grain out olaf scholz there is one question the general secretary is asking to all and also to putin will you be responsible and the one that is responsible that there is the wheat that is necessary in africa and asia and other places is not going there and so this is why he is working so hard to find a solution and we are supporting him margaret brennan but you olaf scholz once again i think we will face a situation of high prices and we will face a very difficult situation but this we knew right from the beginning when we decided to support ukraine and now it is necessary that we stand united and the outcome of this nato meeting here in madrid the outcome of the g7 meeting we had in germany in weimar and the outcome of all the meetings we had in the european union is we stand united we are united and he will not be able to fracture us margaret brennan if you can t reopen the black sea ports if putin doesn t agree to let the food out of ukraine how do you lower global food prices olaf scholz we are now collecting money for supporting the poorest countries that they will be able to deliver food to the people and this is our international initiative we we organized together with others for food security and we will continue to do that margaret brennan but it risks global instability olaf scholz it is a real problem and it is a real consequence of putin s war and this is why it is even more necessary that we support the people margaret brennan so it also puts pressure to end this conflict sooner what is your timeline for when this can end olaf scholz the conflict will end when putin understands that he will not be successful with idea to conquer part of the territory of his neighbor margaret brennan he controls 20 of ukraine right now according to u s intelligence olaf scholz this is why we are supporting ukraine with financial means with humanitarian aid but also with arms deliveries and why we are doing our sanctions regime together on putin margaret brennan so it has been a hard lesson to learn but as you ve laid out here you know members of the german government have admitted it was a mistake to be so dependent on russia for so long i wonder do you look at that and wonder about china and see the same type of risk that the west is so financially intertwined with beijing that it poses a threat a direct threat olaf scholz coming back to the first aspect of your question i think it was not right that we were not prepared to have at any time the chance to change the one that is delivering gas oil and coal to us so we should have invested all over europe in infrastructure that gives us the ability to change the supply from one day to the other and i think this is the lesson that has been learned in europe and in many other places that you have to be prepared be prepared for a situation like this and this is also the answer to all the other questions coming up if for instance if you look to china it is more the answer just understand that you should have supply change imports not just from one or two countries but from many and that even your business is looking for many other countries so the answer to what we are discussing with china is not to go away from china the answer is to go to the other asian countries and there are very very big nations which i think we have to look at and it was very good when we at g7 came together with the leaders of indonesia and india for instance and they are representing two very strong nations nations with a good and important future in the world to come and if we look around them we find many others and so the answer we all together should give is just do your business with many countries so that you can live with a situation when trouble comes up with one margaret brennan and trouble may come up with china i mean the united states sees it as a threat does germany see china as a threat olaf scholz i think i think the world we are going to live in 2050 will be multipolar many countries will be important the united states long pause russia china the european union and the countries in this union but also indonesia and india or south africa countries from the south of america and the big task of all of us is to make this work not just multipolar with many influential countries looking to to have to looking for their own interests and what what is useful for them but making it the world that is working together so multipolar is not enough multilateral working together for a better future this is what we are should what we should aim for and it is now the time to work for that margaret brennan right olaf scholz better future when we are looking at the midst of this century we are in margaret brennan but you are being diplomatic there nato in this latest statement identified china as a as a threat the secretary general said it poses challenges to our values to our interest and to our security does that mean the west is on a path for a clash with beijing olaf scholz no and exactly if you look at the decisions we took here and we are working on it is that we are just aware of problems that might come up and we are aware of these problems because we are democracies and we are not an aggression to our neighbors to to the rest of the world and we are not aggressive against them margaret brennan and china might be towards taiwan olaf scholz and this is why we say that we are working for a world where aggression is not working and this is why we are making our alliance strong but this is also why we say developing a strategy this gives us the chance to be not dependent and i come back to what i said part of this answer is to look at many other countries in the world that will be strong in the future and make them their partner our partners especially when they are democracies and this is i think the strategy we should follow margaret brennan i m told we are running out of time before i let you go president biden also talks about this potential conflict between democracies and autocracies is that the biggest threat on the horizon what keeps you up at night olaf scholz first i i think the democracies are very strong and they because they have the support of their people they are really having also the future on their side we should be we should look at these things from this perspective but we should be clear about these threats that are coming to our future and this is coming from autocracies yes because they tend to be aggressive and this is an aspect we should be very much aware of and i am and this is why i organized our meeting we had in germany with the g7 group of democratic economically successful democratic states that we invite partners from all over the globe that are also democracies for making it happen that the democracies are strong margaret brennan and by strong it also comes with 100 000 u s troops in europe and 300 000 nato response forces in europe this isn t just diplomacy this is muscle olaf scholz this is and it s necessary margaret brennan mr chancellor thank you for your time this morning olaf scholz thank you
singapore will be renewing the 10 voluntary commitments previously submitted at the first united nations oceans conference unoc and undertaking nine new ones for marine protection three of the island state s new commitments involve environmental research projects these are related to sustainable management of marine fish populations the use of solar energy to facilitate coral growth and a marine climate change science programme other new commitments seek to spearhead the shipping industry s green transition for example by incentivising ship owners to become more sustainable the country wants to lead the charge on the maritime industry s transition to energy efficient technologies and low or zero carbon fuels said its foreign minister vivian balakrishnan delivering an official statement at the unoc in lisbon portugal this week the challenges facing the ocean have increased with each passing year we need to urgently scale up actions to collectively protect the ocean and mitigate the impacts of climate change dr balakrishnan told member states what are voluntary commitments at the first un ocean conference which took place in new york in 2017 member states agreed to create a list of commitments to further the implementation of sustainable development goal 14 life below water ocean governance experts that eco business spoke to however have expressed doubts about the efficacy of the voluntary commitments the non binding nature of these commitments raises questions about their ability to drive ambitious action for marine protection in singapore and beyond dr michelle voyer a researcher on ocean governance at australia s university of wollongong said that there can be problems evaluating whether the commitments have been implemented as planned or if countries are succeeding in meeting their objectives there is no mechanism that i am aware of at present which tracks the performance over time she said while submitters can update their commitments with a progress report on the registry this is not mandatory globally over 1900 voluntary commitments have been registered on the ocean conference registry these have primarily been made by governments and non governmental organisations but also include other stakeholders like united nations entities academic institutions and the scientific community based on the registry data the singapore government has submitted a total of 33 commitments since 2017 including the nine new ones a check by eco business found that progress updates have been submitted for at least 23 commitments and seven commitments have been completed to date ho xiang tian co founder of environmental advocacy group lepak in sg is confident that implementation would not be an issue for singapore the real question is whether the voluntary commitments can fulfill the needs of what the oceans require to thrive he said there is a global target to protect 30 per cent of earth s oceans by 2030 but i don t think we are anywhere close to that the 30 by 30 initiative seeks to designate 30 per cent of the world s land and ocean as protected areas by 2030 more than 100 countries have publicly committed to this goal to date land reclamation and dredging practices need better management youth activists kathy xu a marine conservationist from singapore and founder of social enterprise the dorsal effect said she was happy to see the focus on research on ocean species and sustainability in singapore s new commitments the areas of the research sound promising and i m all for science based methods she said however the devil is in the details that we do not have ms xu noted she added that she hopes the government will tap on the diversity of marine expertise in singapore including civil society stakeholders not just academic ocean conservationists alice soewito a member of environmental group singapore youth for climate action said that while singapore has made advances in the maritime shipping industry the government could better manage land reclamation and dredging practices these practices can result in chronic sedimentation that harm and kill corals thereby impacting the rest of the marine ecosystem she said since the 1960s singapore has adopted an aggressive approach of land reclamation to accommodate industrial activities and a growing population the island s land area has expanded by nearly 25 per cent over the last two centuries the national university of singapore s reef ecology lab has said that many coral reef ecosystems were smothered by past reclamation practices these environmental impacts extend beyond singapore s borders a 2010 report by international ngo global witness claimed that sand mining practices in cambodia s koh kong province from which singapore imported sand up till 2016 severely depleted local fish and crab stocks malaysia and indonesia banned sand exports to singapore in 1997 and 2007 respectively due to environmental concerns on a global scale dr voyer pointed out that many current commitments have a strong emphasis on research and science as well as capacity development of course we always need to be improving the knowledge base she said but i would like to see greater emphasis on recognising the existing capacity within many coastal communities and amongst ocean stakeholders this includes engaging with local knowledge and being bold in trying ideas put forward by the communities said dr voyer negotations underway for new global ocean treaty this year s ocean conference which took place from 27 june to 1 july sought to scale up ocean action with a specific focus on science and innovation member states adopted a political declaration reaffirming their commitment to ocean conservation while this declaration is not binding it lays the political foundation for an upcoming legally binding instrument the intergovernmental conference on marine biodiversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction colloquially known as the bbnj treaty singapore serves as the current president of the intergovernmental conference and will help to facilitate the fifth round of negotiations taking place in august this year in his speech dr balakrishnan called on all delegations to work towards the conclusion of an ambitious and future proof bbnj treaty as soon as possible

microstockhub istock via getty images introduction after struggling for half a decade cvr partners nyse uan saw a game changer from eastern europe during early 2022 as russia invaded ukraine thereby seeing prospects for their strong operating conditions of 2021 to persist well into the future as my previous article highlighted since publication it seems that their units have been caught in the recent broad market sell off that has left their unit price down by around one third but thankfully this actually provides an opportunity to double down with their fundamentals up executive summary ratings since many readers are likely short on time the table below provides a very brief executive summary and ratings for the primary criteria that were assessed this google document provides a list of all my equivalent ratings as well as more information regarding my rating system the following section provides a detailed analysis for those readers who are wishing to dig deeper into their situation author instead of simply assessing distribution coverage through distributable cash flow i prefer to utilize free cash flow since it provides the toughest criteria and also best captures the true impact upon their financial position detailed analysis author when conducting the previous analysis their operating cash flow of 68 5m during the fourth quarter of 2021 seemed very impressive at the time but after their results for the first quarter of 2022 the former now pales in comparison to their latter result of 166 9m which is so high that describing it as very impressive no longer does it justice apart from being many magnitudes higher year on year versus their previous result of 25 6m during the first quarter of 2021 it also almost matches their full year result of 188 7m during 2021 that at the time was already a record whilst this massive result was aided by a sizeable 40m working capital draw even if removed their underlying operating cash flow of 126 9m still easily surpasses anything they have ever seen in the past following this unbelievable strong financial performance unitholders may have felt disappointed to only receive a quarterly distribution of 2 26 per unit which represents a decrease of 56 87 versus their previous quarterly distribution of 5 24 per unit attributable to the fourth quarter of 2021 when reviewing their available cash for distribution reconciliation their variable distribution policy utilizes a methodology of matching cash inflows with cash outflows which therefore saw their result being weighed down significantly by a 65m debt repayment as per their first quarter of 2022 results announcement if not for this cash outflow their available cash for distribution would have been 88 8m instead of 23 8m and as a result seen a new record quarterly distribution attributable to the first quarter of 2022 of 8 40 per unit given their latest outstanding unit count of 10 570 000 it should also be mentioned that they also conducted 12 4m of unit buybacks which diverted the equivalence of a further 1 17 per unit of cash away from their quarterly distribution to help slightly boost their future distributions thankfully this backward step was expected within my previous article as management had flagged this debt repayment was forthcoming during their fourth quarter of 2021 conference call very excitingly this was also only temporary and the final hurdle because as subsequently discussed they have finished deleveraging and thus this means no more debt repayments thereby unlocking their full distribution potential that stands to see higher distributions even if operating conditions soften back to their levels during 2021 throughout 2021 their available cash for distribution of 96 6m was weighed down by 30m for debt repayments and a further 50 6m for interest expenses as per their fourth quarter of 2021 results announcement if not for the former their available cash for distribution would have automatically jumped significantly higher to 126 6m to make matters even better given their remaining debt is 550m with a 6 125 interest rate as subsequently discussed this should see their interest expense dropping to only 33 7m and thus save a further 16 9m going forwards on an annual basis when combined this means that even if operating conditions soften back to their levels during 2021 their available cash for distribution should still be 143 5m and thus a very impressive 48 55 higher which on their latest outstanding unit count translates into quarterly distributions of 3 39 per unit and thus a very high yield of almost 14 on the current unit price obviously if their booming operating conditions thus far into 2022 persist this would grow much higher and likely surpass a massive 20 distribution yield whilst already positive and shows that their fundamentals have improved throughout the first quarter of 2022 given the rapidly different geopolitical situation seeing operating conditions return to their 20221 levels seems unlikely within the foreseeable future after fertilizer prices retracted lower in the early days of 2022 they rallied upwards of 30 during march and april following the russian invasion of ukraine with both countries once being major fertilizer and food exporters thereby sending shock waves across the globe and offering a game changer for producers in the united states unlike fertilizer producers in europe who are now battling higher gas prices which is an important feedstock for the production of their ammonia and urea based fertilizers as a producer in the united states they have cheaper access to gas and thus a competitive advantage as was discussed within my previously linked article throughout the subsequent months after publication fertilizer prices have once again retraced lower but still remain well above their levels during 2021 as the graph included below displays green markets via bloomberg data the recent sell off in fertilizer prices is not the first time nor will it be the last time but even more importantly the fundamentals have improved and thus have reduced the downside risk of prices returning back to their levels during 2021 let alone plunging even further back to their suppressed levels during 2020 the supply of gas in europe was already tight but recently russia reduced its gas exports even further likely in retaliation to sanctions in support of ukraine this now sees the international energy agency warning that they should brace for their gas flows to completely cease and thus creates the scary possibility that europe could run out of gas during the coming winter or more likely force them to ration supply whilst it remains to be seen how any potential rations would be applied it seems reasonable to expect residential power and heating would likely be higher priorities than industrial usage which creates a very scary outlook for their fertilizer producers who may have to scale back or even halt their production even though there have been concerns of demand destruction for fertilizers at these record prices i personally suspect this will only be minor as food supply is the number one priority for every human because regardless of the price or economic conditions we all have to eat and without fertilizers crop yields suffer despite this situation remaining anything but desirable from a humanitarian point of view objectively speaking this sees a fundamental improvement for them as united states fertilizer producers whether these geopolitical issues in europe drive fertilizer prices to new heights remains uncertain but if nothing else they further help reduce the downside risk and given their very high double digit distribution yield further gains are not necessary for unitholders to enjoy very desirable returns author even though their variable distribution policy effectively aims to match their cash inflows to their cash outflows as they utilize an accrual based approach it means that their working capital draw was still retained and thus saw their cash balance increase during the first quarter of 2022 to land at 137 4m versus 112 5m at the end of 2021 when combined with their debt repayment this saw their net debt pushed down to 409 1m and thus a very impressive 17 87 lower during just this one quarter and excitingly once again confirms they have finished deleveraging with their debt target reached as per the commentary from management included below as dane mentioned we completed our targeted debt pay down by retiring the remaining 65 million of the 2023 senior notes in february our total debt now stands at 550 million and with an interest rate of 6 125 we are comfortable with our debt level and interest cost through a full market cycle cvr partners q1 2022 conference call author the combination of insanely strong financial performance and materially lower net debt made dramatically lower leverage inevitable which now sees their respective net debt to ebitda and net debt to operating cash flow at 0 83 and 0 81 versus their previous respective results of 2 38 and 2 64 at the end of 2021 these both now sit beneath the threshold of 1 00 for the very low territory but when looking ahead they will continue fluctuating with their financial performance that is driven by inherently volatile commodity prices whilst not necessarily ideal it remains par for the course when it comes to those operating with commodities regardless of whether we are talking about oil copper or in this instance fertilizers author quite unsurprisingly their strong liquidity persisted during the first quarter of 2022 with their current ratio seeing a minor fluctuation to 1 46 versus its previous result of 1 62 at the end of 2021 meanwhile their cash ratio increased to 0 79 from 0 70 on the back of their higher cash balance whilst not necessarily required they still retain another 35m of availability under their credit facility thereby providing an emergency backstop now they have repaid their expensive 9 25 senior notes their nearest debt maturity is not until 2028 and thus allows plenty of time to focus upon rewarding their unitholders as the table included below displays cvr partners q1 2022 10 q conclusion even though their unit price is down by one third during the past couple of months it seems that their fundamentals are actually up with their deleveraging finished thereby unlocking their full distribution potential meanwhile russia continues to play hardball with europe by further restricting gas supply and thus creates the very scary prospects of forced gas rations come wintertime since they are a united states fertilizer producer they stand to benefit at the expense of their european peers which if nothing else reduces the downside risk of operating conditions plunging back to their suppressed levels during 2020 following the recent board market sell off it seems that their unit price dropping is not necessarily driven by fundamentals and by extension provides an opportunity for investors to double down and thus i believe that upgrading to a strong buy rating is now appropriate given the prospects for a very high 14 distribution yield notes unless specified otherwise all figures in this article were taken from cvr partners sec filings all calculated figures were performed by the author
