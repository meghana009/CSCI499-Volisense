thursday capped off the 15th and final trading day of 2021 featuring one of the u s department of agriculture usda reports that have sparked extreme volatility for chicago corn and soybeans over the last year or so while the impact was calm as expected this month a potentially chaotic day looms just a few sessions into the new year most of the report surprises since last year have been rooted in the global drawdown of grain and oilseed supplies partially driven by two straight years of short u s corn and soybean production that among other factors has caused analysts to periodically misjudge u s and global inventories u s corn and soy supplies by next august are seen rising from the previous year s levels but remaining below recent averages that is supported by a record u s corn yield forecast which makes the recent trend in cbot corn futures unique most active corn cv1 on thursday settled up 0 8 at 5 91 3 4 per bushel the contract s highest finish on usda report day since june 10 it is uncommon for corn futures to build in the second half of the year when u s harvest expectations rise from the first survey based estimate in august the last few years have been mixed in terms of corn yield changes from november to january but last year s unusually large yield cut in january spurred the first of several limit moves in futures in 2021 an unprecedented miss in u s corn stocks also played a large role usda s january data dump is due jan 12 and will highlight u s corn and soy production u s quarterly stocks and potential changes to the prior quarter s stocks u s winter wheat seedings south american production and other global supply and demand best year usda reports are notorious for potentially quashing market narratives and that often works against bulls but corn optimists struggled less than usual this year when it comes to price freefalls cbot corn s worst report day of 2021 was oct 12 when most active futures fell 2 the best worst outcome in more than 16 years one of the biggest corn losses in recent years was 6 on aug 12 2019 as analysts were blindsided by the u s crop outlook corn futures gained 7 3 on june 30 when u s acres and stocks fell short of predictions that was the biggest by percent since the same report in 2015 and that day featured the third limit up corn move on report days in 2021 though there were a handful of other sessions where limit moves also occurred although corn futures did not fall by large degrees on 2021 report days the most active contract settled lower on six of the 15 days versus four in 2020 eight reports in 2019 were associated with corn price declines government updates led to a drop in most active soybeans sv1 in four of the 15 instances versus three in 2020 and six in 2019 oct 12 was also soybeans worst report day of the year with a 2 4 decline and that immediately followed a 2 2 loss on sept 30 the extreme miss in u s ending stocks and healthy yield improvement in october were the culprits those price declines were larger than anything observed following 2020 or 2019 reports but the previous two years both featured larger setbacks both in august most active soybeans ended thursday at 12 64 1 2 per bushel the highest settle following monthly usda estimates since sept 10 the contract ended up the daily limit on march 31 with smaller than expected u s plantings corn demand strong global grain demand despite the lighter supplies has been a major factor in price strength over the last year china continues to run the board as the top soybean and corn importer but the country s recent absence in the u s corn market has been disappointing the usda report focus on thursday may have caused some traders to overlook the data published earlier that day showing china bought its first full u s corn cargo for shipment in 2021 22 since may gross new sales totaled 68 507 tonnes in the week ended dec 2 the net sales included 133 600 tonnes of corn switched to china from unknown destinations something that had also happened two weeks earlier that signals that china had previously bought a bit more u s corn than reflected in official records and although these recent volumes are relatively small it is a step in the right direction another likely distraction from chinese demand was wednesday s huge daily sale announcement of 1 84 million tonnes of u s corn to mexico the sixth largest single day u s corn sale since records began in 1977 and the largest ever to mexico the sale was a combination of bookings for both the current and next marketing year and the demand is routine as large sales with similar timing can be found in most recent years source reuters editing by kenneth maxwell

she found him lying on the ground i m sorry whhhhaaattttt mr big just dies like that in the first f episode i did not see that coming one twitter user wrote carrie could have called a f ambulance wtf i am so shocked right now another wrote that they were floored by his death noting that after 17 years waiting to see how would be their life together he died just like that and carry don t call the ambulance seriously and a third simply wrote this is going to ruin a lot of people in the aftermath peloton stocks fell 11 percent noth was one of the names set to reprise his role on the reboot but was told by series developer michael patrick king early on that they had planned to kill off his character the death scene had featured mr big played by chris noth on the peloton talking to his favorite instructor allegra during his exercise mr big first appeared in the hit hbo show in 1998 and was eventually married to main character carrie bradshaw played by sarah jessica parker the company can now sue the show s network over its product placement agreement intellectual property and entertainment lawyer nancy c prager said she said that under the principle nominative fair production companies are allowed to use the product or its brand if it is being used for its intended purpose nominative fair use does not to apply though when you use the protected mark in a way that disparages the mark or the brand prager told the new york times peleton had been portrayed in such a way that was said to have tarnished the brand and what they stand for as seen by the decline in the company s shares a rep for peloton has since come out to reveal that the company approved instructor jess king s appearance on the show but didn t know anything about the plot including big s demise by way of a heart attack hbo procured the peloton bike on their own peloton spokesperson denise kelly told buzzfeed adding peloton was aware that a bike would be used in the episode and that jess king would be portraying a fictional peloton instructor and dr suzanne steinbaum a preventative cardiologist who serves as a member of peloton s health and wellness advisory council told the los angeles times satc fans like me are saddened by the news that mr big dies of a heart attack mr big lived what many would call an extravagant lifestyle including cocktails cigars and big steaks and was at serious risk as he had a previous cardiac event in season 6 these lifestyle choices and perhaps even his family history which often is a significant factor were the likely cause of his death riding his peloton bike may have even helped delay his cardiac event several viewers took to twitter to express their outrage about the character s death with many fans still in a state of shock series developer michael patrick king revealed in a recent interview that the idea around killing mr big off so early on was to give the show a new look and feel which includes doing the unexpected through the perspective of carrie bradshaw dying was the origin story king confessed vanity fair adding nobody wanted to come back if was not going to be different but with so much time invested in his character considering he made his debut in 1998 noth wanted to sit down with king to have him explain how mr big s death pushes the storyline forward when i told chris that mr big dies in the first episode he definitely knew it wasn t same and we had to talk about it king confessed he really wanted to talk about why he s dying and what it does for this series the more we talked about it the more he understood that it was for carrie and carrie s storyline is it s better to have loved and lost than never have loved at all eventually king said noth came to understand that his death would open new doors to carrie s story all while helping build the mystic that has always surrounded mr big since he made his way into her life in the late 1990s the legacy of that character wouldn t diminish but would increase his legend by leaving he explained advertisement if you can find someone who loves you that s fabulous but this really lets us test out that thesis the voiceover we end the series with in sex in the city that the most significant challenging difficult and rewarding relationship of all is the one you have with yourself coud your peloton kill you after bike was at the centre of a shocking death in and just like that femail reveals how the pricey home gym equipment has been linked to several real life tragedies and how to use it safely the safety of pelotons the immersive home

machine and picks up a big pink ball he holds the ball toward the back of the treadmill and the ball is seen being pulled under the machine dragging the boy s arms with it this appears to cause the treadmill to stop moving as the boy s arms lift the machine slightly off the ground the little girl gets off the treadmill and dashes off out of view while the boy appears to be stuck the treadmill moves again slowly at first as it appears the boy is trying to resist it moving and pulling him further under the equipment at this point the power of the machine appears to cause the little boy to shake and suddenly the treadmill resumes a faster speed dragging the boy further underneath to his head he continues to be pulled under more and more until only his legs are sticking out as he appears to thrash his legs in an attempt to free himself the boy manages to pull himself back out from underneath the treadmill which continues to move and he is seen walking out of view away from the machine

a usa today suffolk university poll placed vice president kamala harris approval ratings at 28 10 points below that of president joe biden the u k telegraph tweeted with kamala harris looking unelectable the democrats are considering the nuclear option whispers in washington suggest joe biden s camp has a plan to find a more popular replacement ahead of the 2024 battle when harris ran for president she dropped out before the iowa caucus the first contest in the primary she garnered little support from her home state california harris got called out for hypocrisy during a debate by rival rep tulsi gabbard d hawaii for among other things prosecuting marijuana crimes only to make light in an interview about smoking marijuana when harris quit the race she said i ve taken stock and i ve looked at this from every angle and over the last few days i have come to one of the hardest decisions of my life my campaign for president simply doesn t have the financial resources we need to continue but the party s presidential nominee picked her as his running mate when harris became vice president biden announced her role as a border czar and also asked her to be his point person to push the passage of a proposed voting rights law the border remains a mess and the john lewis voting rights advancement act was stalled in the senate her staff grumbled off the record calling these two jobs lose lose and even suggested racism at play given the growing stature of transportation secretary pete buttigieg and then there is the cackle critics say harris resorts to this kind of phony uncomfortable laughter when she struggles to answer questions for which she is not prepared all of this raises the question why did biden choose her in the first place the answer is simple the woke identity democratic party could not and would not abide another presidential and vice presidential ticket with two white males the party s most loyal constituency is black females according to pew research center data released in 2020 in 2018 and 2019 48 of white women identified as democrats compared with 35 of white men among hispanic women 67 identified as democrats vs 58 of hispanic men black women 87 were more likely than black men 77 to identify as democrats so harris checked the necessary boxes a female person of color who identifies as black but this also presents a problem if the biden administration tossed her overboard it would face a withering attack of sexism and racism consider naacp president and ceo derrick johnson s response to the acquittal of kyle rittenhouse the teenager on trial for killing two white men and injuring a third in kenosha wisconsin we have seen this same outcome time and time again this verdict is a reminder of the treacherous role white supremacy and privilege play within our justice system in addition while harris may be broadly unpopular she enjoys a 72 approval rating among black voters and her approval among black female voters is likely even higher so the only possible way out is for biden and the party to swap her for another black female but the bench is shallow michelle obama she hates politics and has repeatedly said she has no interest oprah winfrey ditto domestic policy adviser susan rice tainted by the falsehoods about benghazi that she peddled as former president barack obama s national security adviser rice was not put forward as obama s secretary of state because she would not have gotten senate confirmation rep maxine waters d calif too offensive former georgia gubernatorial candidate stacey abrams she claims despite a lack of evidence that she actually won but her race was stolen this would rob democrats of their attack line against former president donald trump who makes the same claim about the 2020 presidential election for himself virginia lt gov elect winsome sears and former secretary of state condoleezza rice wrong party no the dems are stuck with harris

the treatment of patients with relapsed refractory multiple myeloma rrmm presentation title a phase 1 2 study of a novel fully human b cell maturation antigen specific car t cells ct103a in patients with relapsed and or refractory multiple myeloma with professor chunrui li md phd from tongji hospital tongji medical college huazhong university of science technology hust in china as the oral presenter the updated data is based on a single arm open label multi center phase 1 2 study being conducted in china the study mainly enrolled patients with bcma positive rrmm who had an eastern cooperative oncology group ecog performance score of 0 1 and received 3 lines of prior therapy the study s primary endpoint is objective response rate orr with secondary endpoints including duration of response dor progression free survival pfs overall survival os safety tolerability pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics pk pd as the data cutoff date of oct 12 2021 this study included 79 subjects treated with the recommended phase ii dose rp2d of 1 0 106 car t cells kg 9 from the exploratory investigator initiated trial and 70 from the registrational study study results showed that ibi326 has excellent safety and efficacy profiles as corroborated by long in vivo persistence indicating that ibi326 has the potential to be a breakthrough therapy for patients with rrmm ibi326 demonstrated a favorable and manageable safety profile among the 79 patients 75 94 9 experienced cytokine release syndrome crs the majority of them experienced 1 2 crs only 2 experienced grade 3 crs all occurred during the iit phase of the study while the 70 patients in the registrational study did not report any grade 3 or higher crs the median time to crs onset was 6 0 days after infusion and the median duration of crs was 5 0 days only 1 patient experienced grade 2 immune effector cell associated neurotoxicity syndrome icans manifested as transient decrease in consciousness and soon resolved without intervention all patients with crs or icans have resolved among which 20 and 34 7 were treated with tocilizumab and steroids respectively ibi326 showed favorable and durable efficacy of the 79 patients the orr was 94 9 and the complete response stringent complete response cr scr rate was 58 2 with a trend suggesting a correlation between deeper responses and longer follow ups pfs at 6 9 and 12 months after infusion was 78 0 76 0 and 71 0 respectively ibi326 also demonstrated favorable efficacy in 11 patients with emm achieving an orr of 100 and a cr scr rate of 72 7 in all 79 patients 93

demonstrated robust expansion and prolonged persistence the expansion of ibi326 in peripheral blood reached the peak at a median of 12 days with a median c max of 92 000 copies ug dna ibi326 was still detectable in 10 55 6 of the 18 patients who completed 12 month follow up after infusion the first enrolled patient still had detectable ibi326 transgene 4 040 copies ug dna 34 months 1 030 days after infusion and remained in scr during this time soluble bcma in peripheral blood of patients rapidly declined after ibi326 infusion and persistently remained below the detectable limit ibi326 has low immunogenicity only 1 3 1 79 of patients were tested anti drug antibody ada positive within three months after ibi326 infusion at a median follow up duration of seven months only 12 7 10 79 of patients tested ada positive while a high rate of relapse remains a major clinical challenge in rrmm bcma targeted car t has thus far showed great promise in its treatment ibi326 is a fully human bcma specific car t therapy that can reduce relapse by bypassing potential anti car immunogenicity in the host this ibi326 study demonstrated favorable efficacy safety pk pd and low immunogenicity signifying enormous therapeutic value for the treatment of rrmm as potentially a clinical breakthrough said the two principal investigators at the primary centers of the study prof lugui qiu md from the chinese academy of medical science hematology hospital and prof chunrui li md phd from tongji hospital tongji medical college huazhong university of science technology dr wen maxwell wang chief executive officer and chief medical officer of iaso bio said this is our second time reporting ct103a results during an oral session at ash meeting and this year s new data for safety and efficacy of ct103a is particularly exciting it includes some of the results from the registrational study at 11 sites which is worth emphasizing since it s globally the first registrational study that enrolled patients who had failed prior car t treatment for these patients who have no approved treatment options ct103a also demonstrated favorable and durable efficacy once again highlighting the enormous therapeutic potential of this innovative candidate at present we are also advancing the clinical development of ct103a for early line treatments in combination therapies and autoimmune diseases while expanding the development program globally we ll submit the new drug application nda soon and look forward to launching this cell therapy to benefit even more patients in the future dr hui zhou senior vice president of innovent said multiple myeloma mm is a common hematology malignant disease with high incidence rate and relapse and refractory are inevitable after current treatments there s an urgent unmet need requesting a treatment with well tolerated and long persistence for patients we are glad the results from the phase i ii study of ct 103a innovent r d code ibi326 were announced in an oral presentation at this year s ash annual meeting these results looks very promising as they have demonstrated favorable and durable efficacy and manageable efficacy of ibi326 we will further accelerate this clinical development of ibi326 to bring forth a treatment option that will bring new hope to patients with mm about multiple myeloma mm multiple myeloma is a deadly blood cancer that often infiltrates the bone marrow causing anemia kidney failure immune problems and bone fractures for multiple myeloma patients common first line drug treatments include proteasome inhibitors immunomodulatory drugs and alkylating agents while treatment may result in remission most patients will inevitably enter the relapsed or refractory stage as there s currently no cure as a result there is a significant unmet need for patients with relapsed refractory multiple myeloma in the united states mm accounts for nearly 2 of all cancer cases and more than 2 of cancer related deaths according

ibi326 bcma car t ibi326 bcma car t is an innovative therapy co developed by iaso bio and innovent biologics previous studies indicate subjects with relapsed refractory multiple myeloma rrmm who received high dose bcma targeting car t cells may achieve better remission but have worse adverse events moreover once the disease progresses again the re infusion of car t cells will not be effective

san francisco u s and suzhou china dec 12 2021 prnewswire innovent biologics inc innovent hkex 01801 a world class biopharmaceutical company that develops manufactures and commercializes high quality medicines for the treatment of oncology metabolic autoimmune and other major diseases and iaso biotherapeutics iaso bio a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering developing and manufacturing innovative medicines today jointly announced the latest data from the phase 1 2 clinical study of a fully human b cell maturation antigen bcma chimeric antigen receptor car t cell therapy in an oral presentation at the 63rd american society of hematology ash annual meeting abstract 547 bcma car t therapy was co developed by the two companies iaso bio ct103a innovent ibi326 for the treatment of patients with relapsed refractory multiple myeloma rrmm presentation title a phase 1 2 study of a novel fully human b cell maturation antigen specific car t cells ct103a in patients with relapsed and or refractory multiple myeloma with professor chunrui li md phd from tongji hospital tongji medical college huazhong university of science technology hust in china as the oral presenter the updated data is based on a single arm open label multi center phase 1 2 study being conducted in china the study mainly enrolled patients with bcma positive rrmm who had an eastern cooperative oncology group ecog performance score of 0 1 and received 3 lines of prior therapy the study s primary endpoint is objective response rate orr with secondary endpoints including duration of response dor progression free survival pfs overall survival os safety tolerability pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics pk pd as the data cutoff date of oct 12 2021 this study included 79 subjects treated with the recommended phase ii dose rp2d of 1 0 106 car t cells kg 9 from the exploratory investigator initiated trial and 70 from the registrational study study results showed that ibi326 has excellent safety and efficacy profiles as corroborated by long in vivo persistence indicating that ibi326 has the potential to be a breakthrough therapy for patients with rrmm ibi326 demonstrated a favorable and manageable safety profile among the 79 patients 75 94 9 experienced cytokine release syndrome crs the majority of them experienced 1 2 crs only 2 experienced grade 3 crs all occurred during the iit phase of the study while the 70 patients in the registrational study did not report any grade 3 or higher crs the median time to crs onset was 6 0 days after infusion and the median duration of crs was 5 0 days only 1 patient experienced grade 2 immune effector cell associated neurotoxicity syndrome icans manifested as transient decrease in consciousness and soon resolved without intervention all patients with crs or icans have resolved among which 20 and 34 7 were treated with tocilizumab and steroids respectively ibi326 showed favorable and durable efficacy of the 79 patients the orr was 94 9 and the complete response stringent complete response cr scr rate was 58 2 with a trend suggesting a correlation between deeper responses and longer follow ups pfs at 6 9 and 12 months after infusion was 78 0 76 0 and 71 0 respectively ibi326 also demonstrated favorable efficacy in 11 patients with emm achieving an orr of 100 and a cr scr rate of 72 7 in all 79 patients 93 7 achieved minimal residual disease mrd negativity with a sensitivity of 10 5 at least once after infusion ibi326 also demonstrated favorable efficacy in patients who had received prior car t therapy among the 13 patients who previously received car t therapy the orr was 76 9 with 61 5 of those patients achieving very good partial response vgpr or deeper responses and 46 2 achieved cr scr ibi326 demonstrated robust expansion and prolonged persistence the expansion of ibi326 in peripheral blood reached the peak at a median of 12 days with a median c max of 92 000 copies ug dna ibi326 was still detectable in 10 55 6 of the 18 patients who completed 12 month follow up after infusion the first enrolled patient still had detectable ibi326 transgene 4 040 copies ug dna 34 months 1 030 days after infusion and remained in scr during this time soluble bcma in peripheral blood of patients rapidly declined after ibi326 infusion and persistently remained below the detectable limit ibi326 has low immunogenicity only 1 3 1 79 of patients were tested anti drug antibody ada positive within three months after ibi326 infusion at a median follow up duration of seven months only 12 7 10 79 of patients tested ada positive while a high rate of relapse remains a major clinical challenge in rrmm bcma targeted car t has thus far showed great promise in its treatment ibi326 is a fully human bcma specific car t therapy that can reduce relapse by bypassing potential anti car immunogenicity in the host this ibi326 study demonstrated favorable efficacy safety pk pd and low immunogenicity signifying enormous therapeutic value for the treatment of rrmm as potentially a clinical breakthrough said the two principal investigators at the primary centers of the study prof lugui qiu md from the chinese academy of medical science hematology hospital and prof chunrui li md phd from tongji hospital tongji medical college huazhong university of science technology dr wen maxwell wang chief executive officer and chief medical officer of iaso bio said this is our second time reporting ct103a results during an oral session at ash meeting and this year s new data for safety and efficacy of ct103a is particularly exciting it includes some of the results from the registrational study at 11 sites which is worth emphasizing since it s globally the first registrational study that enrolled patients who had failed prior car t treatment for these patients who have no approved treatment options ct103a also demonstrated favorable and durable efficacy once again highlighting the enormous therapeutic potential of this innovative candidate at present we are also advancing the clinical development of ct103a for early line treatments in combination therapies and autoimmune diseases while expanding the development program globally we ll submit the new drug application nda soon and look forward to launching this cell therapy to benefit even more patients in the future dr hui zhou senior vice president of innovent said multiple myeloma mm is a common hematology malignant disease with high incidence rate and relapse and refractory are inevitable after current treatments there s an urgent unmet need requesting a treatment with well tolerated and long persistence for patients we are glad the results from the phase i ii study of ct 103a innovent r d code ibi326 were announced in an oral presentation at this year s ash annual meeting these results looks very promising as they have demonstrated favorable and durable efficacy and manageable efficacy of ibi326 we will further accelerate this clinical development of ibi326 to bring forth a treatment option that will bring new hope to patients with mm about multiple myeloma mm multiple myeloma is a deadly blood cancer that often infiltrates the bone marrow causing anemia kidney failure immune problems and bone fractures for multiple myeloma patients common first line drug treatments include proteasome inhibitors immunomodulatory drugs and alkylating agents while treatment may result in remission most patients will inevitably enter the relapsed or refractory stage as there s currently no cure as a result there is a significant unmet need for patients with relapsed refractory multiple myeloma in the united states mm accounts for nearly 2 of all cancer cases and more than 2 of cancer related deaths according to frost sullivan the number of new mm cases in the united states rose from 30 300 in 2016 to 32 300 in 2020 and is expected to increase to 37 800 by 2025 the total number of patients diagnosed with mm in the united states increased from 132 200 in 2016 to 144 900 in 2020 and is expected to rise to 162 300 by 2025 the number of new mm cases in china rose from 18 900 in 2016 to 21 100 in 2020 and is expected to increase to 24 500 by 2025 the total number of patients diagnosed with mm in china increased from 69 800 in 2016 to 113 800 in 2020 and is expected to rise to 182 200 by 2025 about ibi326 bcma car t ibi326 bcma car t is an innovative therapy co developed by iaso bio and innovent biologics previous studies indicate subjects with relapsed refractory multiple myeloma rrmm who received high dose bcma targeting car t cells may achieve better remission but have worse adverse events moreover once the disease progresses again the re infusion of car t cells will not be effective

a remote jewel of land off the coast of canada fogo island floats in the northeast corner of the northeast province of newfoundland and labrador the outstretched right fingertip of this continent the place might be drop dead gorgeous but it wasn t immune to the fate befalling so many small and isolated communities in north america its one and only industry went into steep decline and so in turn did its population then about a decade ago a local returned home fresh off making a fortune in the tech sector her pockets were deep so was her desire to lift up the place and bring people back so she unleashed a sort of economic experiment we took two planes a long drive and a ferry to reach fogo island and check on the early results the saying here goes you ll know the newfoundlanders in heaven they ll be the ones who want to go home and the adage comes to life on fogo island a 90 square mile patchwork of 10 miniscule fishing villages where clapboard houses the color of jelly beans cling to rock 400 million years old among its quirks newfoundland has its own time zone half an hour ahead of the mainland but wander through fogo island s villages and you might as well set your watch back to the 18th century fogo island back then all you needed to get by here was a pig a potato patch and something called a punt a small wooden fishing boat used in pursuit of north atlantic cod the species that once kept this place afloat seemingly every structure on the island was built in service of catching and preserving fish with one gleaming exception a 40 million luxury inn part edge of the earth destination part economic engine on stilts the inn is the brainchild of eighth generation fogo islander zita cobb and locals gave her a funny look when she first floated the idea jon wertheim what kinda reaction did that get zita cobb why would anyone come here we love this place but it wasn t obvious when you know there are fancy places in the world that people go our assumption is everybody wants to go where it s warm laugh jon wertheim someone suggested to us it looked like a ship zita cobb the architecture of the inn was obviously a topic of much conversation i think about it as a metaphor it s about people from here and people from away it s about the future and the past the past looms large on fogo island to fully appreciate the inn even as a metaphor you have to understand fogo s history jon wertheim it s just something zita cobb took us through dozens of tiny islands that dot fogo s waters to a place called little fogo island and for those keeping track that s an island off an island off an island her ancestors landed here from ireland and south england they came for one reason zita cobb fish fish and fish jon wertheim when you say fish is it just a given zita cobb it s a given so when yes when we say fish we mean cod jon wertheim is it possible to exaggerate the importance of cod to this place zita cobb no it s not possible because everything that you need to know about someone from here you can figure it out by just studying that lowly fish it s actually quite a noble fish jon wertheim a noble fish zita cobb it asks very little and gives so much they exist on almost anything i mean i think a cod could eat a rubber boot if it had to zita cobb not unlike the noble fish zita cobb s family survived without fuss in cod they trusted families worked side by side here trading their fish for goods no bank accounts no cash cobb s parents could neither read nor write she and her six brothers grew up in a house with no electricity she says it was a happy childhood until it wasn t jon wertheim what happened zita cobb the worst of the 20th century came down on top of us very quickly in the form of the industrialization of the fisheries so these enormous factory ships showed up here all along the coast of newfoundland and fished day and night until just about every last fish was gone with one small punt launched from this one dock cobb s father couldn t compete with commercial vessels that had come to the north atlantic from all over the world jon wertheim how bad did things get for him zita cobb things got he would go out and come back with nothing but one day in particular he came back with one fish and he brought the fish into the house and he slapped it down onto the kitchen floor and said well it s done and it was the next day he burned his boat jon wertheim he burned his boat zita cobb he burned his boat jon wertheim it s almost like a sacrifice zita cobb it was he did it as a statement he did it as an expression of pain and anger lambert cobb made this sacrifice once he realized that those big boats were in his words turning fish into money zita cobb he said to me as a ten year old you have got to figure out how this money thing works cause if you don t it s gonna eat everything we love he wasn t wrong as fish stocks dwindled so did the island s population from 5 000 to 2 500 the cobbs left grudgingly for the mainland in the 1970s zita cobb s father died shortly thereafter but she heeded his advice she got a business degree worked in fiber optics landed in silicon valley and before long was the third highest paid female executive in america in her early 40s she cashed out tens of millions in stock options dropped out of the winner take all economy and took her business savvy home determined to revitalize fogo island instead of writing a check she posed a question zita cobb what do we have and what do we know and how can we put that forward in a way that s dignified for fogo islanders and creates economy and connects us to the world spend one night at what the locals call a shed party and the answer emerges zita cobb when you think about the people of this place if there s one thing we re really good at it s hospitality jon wertheim what does hospitality mean here zita cobb hospitality in its purest form is the love of a stranger we didn t get a lot of strangers and when they arrived as my mother used to say it s always better to see a light coming into the harbor than a light going out the fogo island inn so in 2013 cobb built the biggest beacon in the harbor she made the fogo island inn the centerpiece of a charitable trust called shorefast with profits reinvested in the island at 2 000 a night the inn does turn a profit but there were other considerations zita cobb we re gonna put a 29 room inn on an island that s never had an inn what are the consequences of that well more people will come well how many more people as one woman said well you know we re only 2 500 people we can only love so many people at a time shorefast and the inn employ more than 300 islanders but the real payoff is the ripple effect for starters all the furniture at the inn is locally made same for the pillows and quilts it so happens the women of fogo island have been making them for their own homes for 400 years lillian dwyer we re getting there we got half done word is out now this quilt is destined for a customer in baltimore we joined the quilting bee lillian dwyer watch him millicent but didn t last long jon wertheim it was all very nice except for this one square dwight budden this is our lettuce room shorefast puts up seed money for new businesses too a quarter of a million dollars so far hayward budden and then you put your plant in dwight budden and his father hayward with correspondent jon wertheim a 7 500 microloan went to dwight budden and his father hayward a former fisher who left fogo island when the industry collapsed he s back now as a hydroponic farmer growing greens for the inn dwight budden yeah there s our kale jon wertheim does hayward eat kale hayward budden not too much laughter beyond the kale new culture is taking root futuristic looking studios now speckle the landscape part of shorefast s ambition to bring artists in residence to fogo and back at the inn a chef turns cod into haute cuisine jon wertheim if your dad saw cod with magnolia oil and sea foam zita cobb and porcini jon wertheim and porcini zita cobb cini yes laugh jon wertheim what would he say zita cobb yes first thing he d say can you really eat that you can do more than eat cod you can fish for it again now that a decades long ban has been eased fogo island s fishers are back hauling cod we ventured out of fogo harbor with brothers glen and jerry best the fifth generation of their family to harvest these waters glen best you go east your next stop is ireland jon wertheim ireland glen best we re not going there today laugh the best brothers showed us the traditional newfoundland way of fishing with a handline 150 feet down no rods reels or nets jon wertheim now we re talkin glen best that s a beauty up comes cod without much of a fight glen best now that s a nice cod that s probably a 20 pound fish cod is making a comeback in the north atlantic canada still imposes catch limits but when the bests get down to business they use an automated system to drop thousands of hooks in the water at a time we watched them offload 20 000 pounds of cod from a single trip what s more shellfish has done the unthinkable and dethroned cod as king crab and shrimp now make up eighty percent of glen best s business and he s never had a better year jon wertheim you told me you caught 400 000 pounds of snow crab at 7 60 a pound glen best yeah it s pretty good jon wertheim 3 million bucks glen best it adds up jon wertheim that s pretty good glen best yeah it was a good year glen best but a thriving fishery isn t always enough to keep the kids around best s three children have moved away from fogo to pursue other careers jon wertheim your family s been doing this for generations you named this boat after your dad glen best so the sad part about it is that jerry and myself we probably could be the last generation that will fish within our family when the day comes that that happens that will probably be a sad day still fogo island s population has stabilized there s hope the next census will show an uptick babies are the island s biggest celebrities but as ever with growth come growing pains it s already become one of those islands where you have to pray to get a spot on the ferry jennifer sexton spent summers on fogo island visiting her grandparents she recently moved here from western canada to open this coffee joint where locals mix with those who come from away jennifer sexton everybody asks about the inn jon wertheim what do you tell them jennifer sexton well it s a blessing and a curse her regulars grumble that not long ago they could get a home for 25 000 thousand canadian now homes cost ten times as much jennifer sexton for somebody from away that wouldn t be a lot but for somebody from here that is a lot of money zita cobb the woman who turned this tide says she doesn t want unchecked growth either zita cobb as the economy grows we will be smaller as a percentage of the whole economy jon wertheim a rare business leader that wants less market share laugh zita cobb we want less market share exactly jon wertheim you say that with a smile on your face but there s a lotta responsibility here zita cobb yeah i mean the consequences are huge because as my brother says yes our our parents will get out of the graveyard and wring our necks if we if we mess this up jon wertheim what s your response to the the capitalist who would say why are you limiting your growth zita cobb that is the techno economic question but i start with a different question what are we optimizing for we are optimizing for place we re optimizing for community the pillars of this community have been won over if cobb s experiment helps diversify the economy glen best says he s all in glen best it s not like we re overrun by tourism that s not the way it works here we re not you know we re not the venice of newfoundland you know we re not out of patience with people yet on our last night at the shed party we got the full sweep of fogo island its hospitality and its contrasts laid out on the table cod and crab young and old warmth wit and a traditional song delivered with a handshake a kind of hope that comes tempered by history zita cobb the undoing of this traditional way of making a life was very painful i think i still carry those broken hearts i think that kinda pain doesn t go away jon wertheim to what extent has that been repaired by the work you ve done since you ve come back zita cobb yeah i think it actually does help you can heal a broken heart produced by nathalie sommer and kaylee

in a major supermarket in washington dc usa the seafood section includes a product that comes from far away the blue swimming crab imported all the way from sri lanka the packaging proudly announces that the product is committed to sustainability and is a product of sri lanka about 9 000 miles 14 500 km or nearly 24 hours by air counting transit times away in the island country of sri lanka close to one million people are engaged in the fisheries sector on a full or part time basis including those fishing and processing blue swimming crabs fish make up about 50 per cent of sri lankans annual animal protein intake a ratio three times higher than the global average thus sustainable management of sri lanka s fisheries is essential for continued food security and livelihoods and for providing opportunities for new jobs and exports in the country blue swimming crab efforts to sustainably manage sri lanka s blue swimming crabs began in 2013 with the launch of the blue swimming crab fishery improvement project as a joint initiative of the national fisheries institute crab council an association of north american crab importers and the seafood exporters association of sri lanka seas it is being carried out in collaboration with the ministry of fisheries and more than 70 small scale fishing communities in four districts in sri lanka the project aims to improve the biological and ecological status of crab fisheries and their management in the palk bay and the gulf of mannar and make them sustainable in and for the future a well managed fishery forms the basis for consistent catches and steady incomes for fishers as well as the many women working along this labour intensive value chain alternatively overfishing would erode incomes creating greater vulnerability among sri lanka s coastal fishing communities sri lanka has a 1 340 km coastline the analysis first assessed the blue swimming crabs stock status using an innovative simple but robust methodology that relies on measuring the length of crabs harvested the assessment helped determine sustainable catch levels and is repeated periodically to gauge the stock status and adjust the catch levels accordingly in january 2018 the blue swimming crab fisheries achieved a good alternative recommendation from the monterey bay aquarium s seafood watch a recognition of the progress made towards improved management this recognition allowed the taprobane seafood group sri lanka s top exporter of pasteurized crab products to access new premium markets in the united states for eco labelled high quality seafood products it is noteworthy that at the height of market disruptions induced by the covid 19 in april may 2020 taprobane s only orders in north america were from premier markets for sustainably sourced seafood sustainability lessons the success of the blue swimming crab project led to new questions can sri lanka adopt a similar approach for other fisheries and seafood products can similar projects achieve sustainable resource management and better revenue in sri lanka and elsewhere considering the importance of the fisheries sector for sri lanka the world bank carried out an analysis between 2020 and 2021 with the sri lanka ministry of fisheries and its agencies the national planning department fisheries and processor organisations ngos and academia the study priorities for sustainably managing sri lanka s marine fisheries coastal aquaculture and the ecosystems that support them includes an analysis of coastal and multiday fisheries coastal aquaculture and coastal ecosystem services that support these fisheries partly funded by world bank administered trust fund problue the study s main recommendations for coastal fisheries centre around data based and participatory management for example it recommends that the ministry of fisheries allocate more resources to regular stock assessments including developing methods for data poor fisheries and create sustainable management plans based on these assessments in close consultation with fishers and other local stakeholders these plans should incorporate measures to conserve and where feasible restore ecosystems such as coral reefs and mangroves that support the fisheries and increase coastal communities resilience to weather events and climate change to ensure these plans are implemented it will be crucial to provide support to diversify the livelihoods of fishers and their families as well as transmit to fishers part of the sustainability premiums achieved through exports to premium markets world bank engagement the study report will be launched at a public event with high level participation from the sri lankan government and the world bank which will feature policy and technical discussions these discussions are an integral part of the exchanges to develop the next country partnership strategy for 2022 2026 and will hopefully help sri lanka build back better towards a sustainable blue economy

by chuck collins america s billionaires have grown 2 1 trillion richer during the pandemic their collective fortune skyrocketing by 70 percent from just short of 3 trillion at the start of the covid crisis on march 18 2020 to over 5 trillion on october 15 of this year according to forbes data analyzed by americans for tax fairness atf and the institute for policy studies program on inequality ips not only did the wealth of u s billionaires grow but so did their numbers in march of last year there were 614 americans with 10 figure bank accounts today there are 745 the 5 trillion in wealth now held by 745 billionaires is two thirds more than the 3 trillion in wealth held by the bottom 50 percent of u s households estimated by the federal reserve board the great good fortune of these billionaires over the past 19 months is even starker when contrasted with the devastating impact of coronavirus on working people almost 89 million americans have lost jobs over 44 9 million have been sickened by the virus and over 724 000 have died from it to put this extraordinary wealth growth in perspective the 2 1 trillion gain over 19 months by u s billionaires is equal to 60 percent of the 3 5 trillion 10 year cost of president biden s build back better plan the entire 2 1 trillion in new revenues over 10 years approved by the house ways and means committee to help pay for president biden s build back better bbb investment plan sixty seven national organizations have sent a letter to congress expressing concern that neither the ways and means committee plan nor president biden s plan will adequately tax billionaires they recommend that billionaires income tax bit legislation under development by sen ron wyden chairman of the finance committee be included in final bbb legislation president biden also supports this tax reform don t like ads become a supporter and enjoy the good men project ad free most of these huge billionaires gains will go untaxed under current rules and will disappear entirely for tax purposes when they re passed onto the next generation under wyden s bit billionaires will start paying taxes on their increased wealth each year just like workers pay taxes on their paychecks each year the tax will apply only to taxpayers whose wealth exceeds 1 billion about 700 households it will be assessed annually on tradable assets such as stocks where the value of the asset is known at the beginning and end of the year for non tradable assets such as ownership in a business or real estate holdings taxes will be deferred until the asset is sold public support for the billionaire income tax is very strong when proposed as a way to pay for president biden s 3 5 trillion investment package it increases support for that package by 20 to 40 points among voters in battleground districts and states among the individual stories behind the big numbers elon musk of tesla and spacex fame is not only beating jeff bezos in space he has rocketed past him in

tax rate on 9 billion in profits has nearly doubled his fortune from 29 5 billion to almost 58 billion maybe that s in part because nike didn t pay a dime of federal income taxes in 2020 on its 2 9

increase by 19 5 billion or 54 percent since the pandemic began even after giving away 8 6 billion of her wealth to charity billionaires are undertaxed america s billionaire bonanza demonstrates the structural flaws in our current economic and tax systems president biden and democrats in congress are trying to remedy by advancing a 3 5 trillion package of investments in working families and communities paid for with fairer taxes on the rich and corporations on average billionaires pay an effective federal income tax rate of about 8 percent when the increased value of their stock is counted according to the white house this is a lower rate than that paid by many middle income taxpayers including teachers nurses and firefighters billionaires pay such low tax rates because most of their income comes from the increased value of their investments such as stocks a business or real estate rather than a paycheck like most people and they don t have to pay taxes on that increased wealth unless they sell the assets but the ultra rich don t need to sell assets instead because of the size of their fortunes they can borrow money at low rates from banks and live lavishly tax free when they sell their assets they pay a top capital gains tax rate of 20 percent plus a 3 8 percent net investment income tax niit far below the current 37 percent 40 8 percent top rate they would pay on an equivalent salary this is why many ultra rich pay a lower tax rate than people in the middle class according to propublica s analysis of irs data billionaires have paid no federal income taxes in some recent years including jeff bezos elon musk michael bloomberg and george soros the country s 25 top billionaires paid a tax rate of just 3 4 percent on a 400 billion increase in their collective fortune between 2014 18 poll after poll shows that americans of all political persuasions and by large majorities believe that the wealthy and big corporations need to start paying their fair share of taxes a june poll by alg research and hart research shows 62 percent of voters support biden s proposed 4 trillion at the time investments in healthcare childcare education clean energy and more paid for by higher taxes on the rich and corporations a note on data we draw on data from forbes research on billionaire wealth thanks to kerry dolan and her team why march 18 march 18 2020 is used as the unofficial beginning of the coronavirus crisis because by then most federal and state economic restrictions responding to the virus were in place march 18 was also the date that forbes

charlotte latvala special to the times my husband looked up from his ipad it s just the two roads right yep the turnpike and then 76 west it s easy you cannot possibly get lost we were discussing the route to our daughter s college because we were headed there for her weekend dance performance because of our work schedules i was going up a day early ergo we would be driving separately ergo much discussion which turnpike entrance do you usually get on he asked because i was thinking cranberry might be quicker than chippewa i shook my head nope it s not quicker trust me i have made this trip 1 000 times and driven every possible configuration of roads to do so to take our older daughter to college and now the younger one and for decades before that to travel to my mom s house west of cleveland i grew up in northern ohio and even though i haven t lived there since the mid 1980s it still feels like home and this particular route i know every bump in the road i know which fruit stands are worth stopping at and i know exactly how long it takes at a normal rate of speed well i usually go up 65 i said slowly with firm and meaningful emphasis on the i then i take the back roads into ohio to route 7 and then the ohio turnpike coming back that way is also a lot cheaper because you miss the pennsylvania tolls it s the best way my husband pondered my words allowing them to soak into his consciousness like a fine wine carefully considering my sage advice i nodded graciously you re welcome i may have said he frowned i m thinking cranberry might be quicker and i don t want to take any convoluted back roads i have to say i saw it coming this stubborn inability to see reason here i was offering my hard earned pearls no more like giant rocks of wisdom and he was blatantly disregarding them it s happened before i washed my hands of it well just allow yourself plenty of time and it doesn t matter which way you go i sighed and why are we even talking about this just put on your gps i must admit this conversation went on for about 15 minutes after this which is 15 minutes longer than it should have frankly it never should have taken place at all but at the very least the phrase gps should have come up earlier how did we end up here sometime in the last few years we have turned into stock figures from a sitcom the ancient couple who spends way too much time carping about directions who rejoice at and later discuss hitting all the green lights on a certain stretch of road who talk ad nauseum about construction and potholes and which rest areas are the cleanest in other news the dance concert was fantastic and i came home on route 7 charlotte is a columnist for the times you can reach her at charlottelatvala gmail com
review and preview inflation accelerated at its fastest pace since 1982 in november the labor department said friday putting pressure on the economic recovery and raising the stakes for the federal reserve the consumer price index which measures the cost of a wide ranging basket of goods and services rose 0 8 for the month good for a 6 8 pace on a year over year basis and the fastest rate since june 1982 jeff cox inflation surged 6 8 in november to fastest rate since 1982 www cnbc com december 10 2021 last april economist thought inflation would be around 2 5 right now instead it s over 6 even by the forgiving standards of economic forecasting that s a miss of epic proportions meanwhile faster inflation could become self perpetuating through price and wage setting behavior then the solution to this unfamiliar inflation becomes painfully familiar higher interest rates and perhaps a recession greg ip a bout of inflation that defies old models the wall street journal december 9 2021 last week followed the powerful solar eclipse of december 4 and started with big bang how else would one expect the exaggerative nature of sagittarius to behave after several world indices suffered one of their steepest and in some cases like the u s a the steepest and most prolonged declines of the year with the low of december 3 most embarked upon very strong rallies last week for many like the djia the low of december 1 3 was the lowest price seen in 7 8 weeks but on monday december 6 it was up 646 followed by another 462 points the following day friday was up another 216 points it should be pointed out that the low of december 3 probably had more to do with transiting mars making a t square to the nyse mercury pluto square a combination that has a reliable correlation to sharp selloffs and lows in u s stock indices the sharp rally that followed was probably related to the solar eclipse in sagittarius that immediately followed the mars transit also noteworthy was the shanghai composite after making a low of 3526 the previous week on november 29 it soared to 3688 on december 9 getting very close to its multi year high of 3731 made on february 18 this is important because the first saturn uranus waning square passage took place on february 17 the third and final exact waning square of those two planets is approaching on december 24 and the sse appears poised to make another important high then what after the first high in february it dropped sharply to its first leg of a double bottom low of the year on march 9 after the second saturn uranus passage in june when the sse made its next primary cycle crest it dropped to the second leg of its yearly low on july 28 it has the markings of a pattern here in other markets silver had a nasty week falling to 21 81 on friday just three weeks earlier on mma s last 2 star critical reversal date it was up to 25 49 the good news is that gold did not follow the same plight as silver it held well above its low of the previous week at 1762 20 on december 2 short term geocosmics and longer term thoughts earlier this week the people s bank of china said it would ease banks reserve requirements effectively making more cash available for bank lending the move went against policy signals it had sent weeks earlier and came as central banks and other financial institutions came under scrutiny by beijing in its effort to curb capital forces in the economy lingling wei china s central bank feels reins tighten in shake up wall street journal december 9 2021 president biden ruled out the unilateral use of u s force if russia invades its neighbor ukraine a russian invasion of ukraine would be one of the most significant military actions in europe since the cold war s end posing a security challenge for the european union western european powers and nato catherine lucey ann m simmons biden rules out u s force if russia invades ukraine wall street journal december 9 2021 the two quotes above play right into the history of geocosmic signatures arising in the next few days first venus will turn retrograde on december 19 this is one of the strongest geocosmic correlations to primary cycles it is not 100 but it has a rate of frequency exceeding 70 which is very high it will also be in conjunction with pluto exact on december 11 and 25 both of these geocosmic signatures have themes correlating with policy changes by some or several of the world s central banks venus retrograde december 19 january 29 is particularly affiliated with changes and surprises in central bank announcements venus rules taurus the sign of money and currencies when any planet turns retrograde there is a tendency for the matters ruled by that planet to change suddenly and surprisingly venus especially is known in astrology as a planet of indecisiveness and as a ruler also of the sign of indecisiveness libra therefore a venus retrograde signifies a time when people often change their mind about something in a relationship or finances if the changes pertain to central bank policies they can roil financial markets especially the value of currencies treasuries and stock indices pluto rules scorpio the sign opposite taurus and also pertains to money and in particular debt matters when pluto is highlighted with venus currency prices are once again highlighted so too can be the price of sugar and soybeans not only can pluto pertain to debt but as an activity it can coincide with periods of intrusion or intervention forcing a change in market trends that are related to a change in policy thus the announcement that the people s bank of china has to walk back its previous policy signals at the behest of the chinese government is not surprising to those who understand this correlation but it may be surprising to those who don t it remains to be seen if other central banks in the world will announce sudden changes to their monetary policies in the coming weeks and what effect these announcements will have upon financial markets for instance the federal reserve has stated many times now that it intends to pull back from its quantitative easing programs of buying treasuries every month and that it will sooner than later begin raising rates do not be surprised if the fed changes that narrative in late december or early january when jupiter transits in a favorable trine aspect to the frb natal pluto and sextile its sun accommodative but soon afterwards don t be surprised if in fact they do decide to tighten perhaps even more quickly than originally thought with jupiter in pisces and venus retrograde conjunct pluto the fed may be giving some seriously mixed messages i am not so sure the market will appreciate this level of uncertainty and inconsistency and everyone knows that politicians in power aren t going to applaud a raise in rates our expectation is that venus retrograde will correlate with the culmination of primary cycles and commence a counter trend reversal of multiple weeks maybe even months the second quote regarding the military buildup of russian troops along the border of ukraine ties into the history of mars entering sagittarius and capricorn december 13 march 6 in a study i conducted several years ago on crude oil prices i noted that large price moves and frequent reversals occurred most often when mars was in sagittarius capricorn and gemini further research also revealed that these volatile fluctuations in crude oil prices coincided with an increase in military aggression especially in the middle east and especially involving israel it leads one to wonder if the russian build up on the border of ukraine will also coincide with a similar military advance of iran or some other middle eastern country that complicates or distracts from the concern of a threat to ukraine with saturn entering its final exact waning square to uranus on december 24 and with an orb of influence that lasts up to 10 months and with venus turning retrograde in conjunction with pluto there may be more than one crisis facing the world in the next 1 7 weeks and given that the venus pluto conjunction also conjoins the natal moon pluto conjunction in the u s founding chart july 2 1776 one has to be concerned about america s preparedness to handle multiple crises at once is america safe this is the subject of one of the chapters in the forecast 2022 book the ebook version was just released on thursday december 9 and the printed version will be sent out next week it is also worth noting that in 2022 mars will turn retrograde in gemini it enters gemini on august 20 turns retrograde at 25 gemini on october 29 2022 turns direct again at 8 gemini on january 12 2023 and finally departs gemini on march 25 2023 during the period it turns retrograde it will form a conjunction to the u s natal mars square neptune when it turns direct it will conjoin the u s natal uranus given that saturn will also come within one degree of orb to the waning square of uranus again in september october 2022 just before the u s midterm elections this escalation of military aggression may draw in the u s even against its will to be involved unilaterally or otherwise the question on the minds of many americans is now and will be for the next year i think will the u s commander in chief be up to the task of protecting americans and its allies better than he exhibited in august during the u s withdrawal of troops from afghanistan it is a relevant question to ask of astrologers given that the third and final exact saturn uranus waning square on december 24 will form a t square to president biden s natal mars the planet of aggression and or military leadership on a final related note i do not think that initiating a war on ukraine will be in russia s best interest long term every 36 years when saturn conjoins neptune russia seems to implode the last three times this cosmic event occurred were in 1989 collapse of communism 1953 death of stalin and 1917 bolshevik revolution and overthrow of the czar in this writer s opinion russia would be better off trying to execute a diplomatic resolution in the long run and avoid the possibility of another cyclical 36 year uprising overthrow or forced transformation of its current government within one year of the next saturn neptune conjunction that takes place on february 20 2026 in the meantime get ready for december 11 25 when three powerful geocosmic signatures unfold that could change current market trends and political banking policies it may be a holiday season but it could be a turbulent one the cosmic drama starts to unfold this week and should be apparent through january
morphosys presents latest data from the phase 2 manifest study evaluating the potential of pelabresib in the treatment of myelofibrosis data presented during poster and oral sessions at the 63 rd american society of hematology annual meeting and exposition latest results from the manifest trial underscore the rationale to further explore pelabresib in combination with ruxolitinib in manifest 2 a global phase 3 randomized double blind trial in treatment naïve patients with myelofibrosis planegg munich germany accesswire december 12 2021 morphosys ag fse mor nasdaq mor presented the latest data from the ongoing manifest study an open label phase 2 clinical trial of pelabresib an investigational bet inhibitor in patients with myelofibrosis a rare bone marrow cancer for which only limited treatment options are available these latest results which included more patients and longer term follow up than previously reported data suggest the potential of pelabresib in the treatment of myelofibrosis these findings were presented during poster and oral sessions at the 63rd american society of hematology annual meeting and exposition ash 2021 held december 11 14 2021 in atlanta georgia and virtually these data reconfirm previously published results and reinforce the role pelabresib may play if approved in overcoming some of the challenges we face in treating myelofibrosis said malte peters m d morphosys chief research and development officer we are further exploring the effectiveness and safety of pelabresib as a first line treatment for myelofibrosis in manifest 2 an ongoing phase 3 study the latest results reaffirm our confidence in the manifest 2 study and we look forward to sharing findings from this trial once they become available at ash 2021 the latest data evaluating pelabresib as a first line combination with ruxolitinib the current standard of care for patients with myelofibrosis who had not previously been treated with a jak inhibitor jak inhibitor naïve were presented as of september 10 2021 the data cut off a total of 84 jak inhibitor naïve patients have been enrolled and received the combination the data showed 68 percent n 57 of patients treated with the combination achieved a 35 percent reduction in spleen volume svr35 from baseline at week 24 and 60 percent n 47 maintained svr35 at week 48 most patients also saw their symptoms reduced with 56 percent n 46 achieving 50 percent reduction in total symptom score tss50 from baseline at week 24 at the time of the data cut off 53 patients 63 percent of the 84 patients were still on treatment no new safety signals were identified in the study the most common hematologic adverse events were thrombocytopenia 12 percent grade 3 4 and anemia 34 percent grade 3 4 non hematological events included dyspnea 5 percent grade 3 and respiratory tract infections 8 percent grade 3 4 additionally analyses from an exploratory endpoint presented at ash 2021 showed a reduction of megakaryocyte clustering in bone marrow and correlation with spleen volume reduction megakaryocytes are the cells in the bone marrow responsible for making platelets and the clustering of these cells are one of the signs of myelofibrosis the exploratory data which require further evaluation suggest the potential pelabresib may have in changing the course of myelofibrosis treatment if approved in my opinion a challenge in treating myelofibrosis is knowing that despite available treatment options the disease will ultimately progress in the majority of patients diagnosed said srdan verstovsek m d ph d professor of medicine and hematologist oncologist at the md anderson cancer center and a manifest investigator identifying new first line treatment options will improve physicians ability to better manage the disease from the time of diagnosis these latest data although early in the investigational process suggest that by combining pelabresib and ruxolitinib we may have the potential to enhance the current standard of care in the first line treatment of myelofibrosis additional data from arm 1 of the manifest study were also presented in an oral presentation at ash 2021 in arm 1 pelabresib is being evaluated as a monotherapy in patients with advanced myelofibrosis who are ineligible to receive intolerant of or refractory to jak inhibitors a population with very limited therapeutic options patients were divided into two cohorts transfusion dependent td and non transfusion dependent non td for the td cohort the primary endpoint was conversion to transfusion independence ti for 12 consecutive weeks in the non td cohort the primary endpoint was svr35 at week 24 at week 24 11 percent n 7 of patients reached svr35 in addition we observed 31 percent of patients had a spleen volume reduction of 25 percent or more n 20 at week 24 across all cohorts 28 percent n 18 of patients achieved tss50 no new safety signals were identified in the study the most common hematologic adverse events were thrombocytopenia 23 percent grade 3 4 and anemia 15 percent grade 3 non hematological events included diarrhea 6 percent grade 3 and respiratory tract infections 5 percent grade 3 about pelabresib pelabresib cpi 0610 is an investigational selective small molecule designed to promote anti tumor activity by inhibiting the function of bromodomain and extra

the congressional progressive caucus endorsed a bill by rep mark takano d california known as the 32 hour workweek act example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video columbus ohio some lawmakers in washington d c are pushing for the united states to adopt a four day workweek as the idea is gaining popularity around the world on tuesday the congressional progressive caucus endorsed a bill by rep mark takano d california known as the 32 hour workweek act that would create a 32 hour workweek with overtime paid after 32 hours of work after a nearly two year long pandemic that forced millions of people to explore remote work options it s safe to say that we can t and shouldn t simply go back to normal because normal wasn t working takano said in a statement people were spending more time at work less time with loved ones their health and well being was worsening and all the while their pay has remained stagnant this is a serious problem it s time for progress and i am confident that with the cpc behind this bill we can take meaningful steps forward and create positive lasting change in people s lives the bill would not eliminate longer workweeks but would require employers to pay time and a half for overtime at 32 hours according to cbs moneywatch the bill would leave out a number of workers who are currently excluded from legal protections such as gig workers who are legally considered independent contractors and salaried workers who are exempt from overtime the bill comes as a number of countries and companies have experimented with a shortened workweek this summer researchers in iceland found that a four day workweek without a pay cut improved workers wellbeing dramatically

new york times for much of this year joseph norwood s next breath was locked in a zero sum competition with people eager to upgrade their iphones norwood has sleep apnea meaning that he frequently stops breathing while sleeping a device known as a cpap or continuous positive airway pressure machine can pump air into his body through a face mask while he sleeps greatly reducing his risk of sudden death but such machines require computer chips a component that is in critically short supply amid the great supply chain disruption norwood waited more than six agonizing months before he received his device it felt like forever he said i haven t been working i haven t been doing much of anything around the world many of the largest industries are jockeying to secure scarce stocks of computer chips automakers have slashed production for a lack of chips threatening jobs from japan to germany to the united states apple has cut back on making ipads retailers have prepared for a holiday shopping season pockmarked by shortages of must have electronics the companies that make computer chips most of them clustered in asia have ramped up production while scrambling to fill orders from their largest customers that has made purchasing chips exceedingly difficult for smaller companies one of those niche buyers of chips is resmed the san diego based company that makes the cpap that norwood finally received last month medical devices are getting starved here the company s chief executive michael farrell said in an interview do we need one more cellphone one more electric car one more cloud connected refrigerator or do we need one more ventilator that gives the gift of breath to somebody resmed has struggled to buy enough chips farrell said constraining its ability to make a range of vital equipment from ventilators used by covid patients to breathing devices that sustain premature infants the company is producing less than 75 of what our customers need farrell said farrell has found himself in an uncustomary role beseeching his suppliers to allocate more of their goods to him so that his company can work through a growing backlog of orders this campaign has yet to yield more chips though it has provided poignant lessons about the priorities at work as the global economy strains to return to normal nearly two years into the pandemic i m fighting against very big name automotive companies and cellular communications companies and others who also want more supply farrell said we re such a small percentage of the total semiconductor chip output that we don t often get the attention medical device manufacturers have this year spent an estimated 6 4 billion on computer chips according to gartner a research firm the automotive industry has spent 49 billion makers of wireless communications gadgets like cellphones and tablets have purchased nearly 170 billion worth of chips more than 26 times as much as medical device manufacturers according to gartner the shortages are assailing every industry but much as airlines prioritize their most frequent flyers in the face of a flight canceling blizzard chipmakers are in many cases favoring their largest customers expert say everyone else is faced with the same struggle said willy c shih an international trade expert at harvard business school but it is true that if you are apple or someone who buys a lot you probably get more attention the shortages are in large part the result of botched efforts to anticipate the economic impact of the pandemic as covid 19 emerged from china in early 2020 it sowed fears of a global recession that would destroy demand for a vast range of products that prompted major buyers of chips especially automakers to slash their orders in response semiconductor plants reduced their production that proved a colossal mistake the pandemic shut down restaurants movie theaters and hotels while slashing demand for cars but lockdowns imposed to choke off the virus increased demand for an array of products that use chips like desktop monitors and printers for newly outfitted home offices by the time global industry figured out that demand for chips was surging it was too late adding chipmaking capacity requires as much as two years of lead time and billions of dollars in north america europe and elsewhere medical device manufacturers are governed by strict product safety standards that limit their flexibility in adapting to trouble once a company like resmed gains regulatory clearance to use a supplier it cannot simply seek out a new one that might have a ready stock of chips without first going through a time consuming approval process that meant that resmed had to figure out how to squeeze more chips out of its existing supply chain far from simple components computer chips come in enormous varieties each made with multiple parts that are typically made in multiple countries faced with the prospect of getting shut out farrell rooted through his supply chain identifying the suppliers of his suppliers in the hopes of persuading them to prioritize resmed s factories farrell soon realized that a primary reason that his chip supplier could not meet his demand was that five levels up the chain a taiwanese manufacturer of silicon wafers had exhausted its inventory because that plant could not deliver extra products the next link in the chain a company that combines wafers and circuitry could not produce more of its components that meant that another company that buys those components and packages them into clusters was unable to make more of them and that meant that resmed s supplier of circuit boards could not buy enough of those clusters leaving resmed s factories in singapore sydney and atlanta short of circuit boards farrell took it on himself to try to unstick his supply chain drawing on government contacts in australia where he was born and raised he set up a conversation with a board member of the wafer company in october during a getaway with his wife in british columbia to celebrate their anniversary farrell took time out for a zoom call the board member introduced farrell to another board member in london who then reached the company s head of sales in san francisco farrell connected the sales chief of the wafer company with resmed s president of operations in singapore resmed s orders amounted to barely 1 of the wafer company s output a mere fraction of 1 in additional wafers was enough to satisfy resmed s needs the wafer manufacturer initially agreed to the increase but then reversed that decision in fact they reduced our allocation farrell said all of this explained why norwood was stuck waiting for his cpap born in minnesota norwood 44 has spent his adult life seeking refuge from the bite of winter he lived in maui for seven years and then moved to san diego in the fall of 2019 working as a waiter at a waterfront hotel restaurant early last year he was watching a movie with a housemate when he suddenly passed out it was pretty scary norwood recalled i woke up and my housemate is tapping me on the shoulder i was disoriented a week later he blacked out again his concentration was weakening throughout the day short walks winded him he stopped working applying for disability payments early this year he spent a night in a sleep laboratory at the university of california san diego doctors observed that his breathing stopped 62 times per hour while his blood oxygen level decreased to alarming levels when the doctors administered a cpap norwood s breathing returned to normal they arranged for him to receive one at home he looked forward to resuming a normal life yet weeks later the device had yet to arrive when norwood called his insurance company to inquire it told him that he was on a waiting list with no clarity on how long he should expect to wait they said we have no idea no one is telling us anything norwood recalled on the web he learned about the shortage of computer chips he read a story about an airline pilot who had sleep apnea and was not flying because he had yet to receive his own cpap a massive recall of the devices by a big manufacturer further reduced supply i m just a waiter trying to bring people food and drinks and i can t get a cpap norwood said if the airplane pilot isn t getting his it might be a while before i get mine when he finally received the device in november it changed his outlook last night was the best sleep i have had in years he said the day after picking it up adding that he was hoping to return to work but the experience had left norwood shaken about the realities of who gets what in a time of bewildering shortages it s so unfortunate how money controls everything he said our priorities are really skewed
u s sen mark r warner d va and u s rep abigail spanberger d va 07 have introduced bipartisan legislation that would make it unlawful for a foreign national to contribute money to a state or local ballot initiative or ballot referendum the protecting ballot measures from foreign influence act would overturn a july decision from the federal election commission fec which gave a green light to foreign nationals seeking to finance campaign efforts related to ballot initiatives after ruling that a federal law banning foreign money in campaigns applies only to federal state and local candidate elections the protecting ballot measures from foreign influence act further safeguards our elections from foreign interference by making it illegal for foreign donors to contribute to any ballot initiative or referendum sen warner said there is no circumstance under which foreign entities should be able to sway the american democratic process and this legislation works to ensure that american elections should remain american elections local and state ballot initiatives here in the united states should be focused on the concerns of a community not the interests of a foreign individual company or nation rep spanberger said the current loophole that allows foreign entities to influence these initiatives should be closed immediately and i am proud to work with a bipartisan group of legislators in both the senate and the house to make that happen the protecting ballot measures from foreign influence act would reassert the american people s rightful control of their local ballot measures and i am proud to work with senator warner senator rubio and congressman banks on this critical effort foreign donors should not be able to influence america s democratic process sen marco rubio r fl said it is already illegal for foreign nationals to donate to political candidates parties and committees the protecting ballot measures from foreign influence act will extend that commonsense protection of our political process to ballot initiatives and other referendums we must do everything we can to protect the votes of american citizens as the top democrat on the senate intelligence committee sen warner co led the committee s bipartisan investigation into interference in the 2016 election eventually issuing a comprehensive five volume report that concluded the russian government engaged in an aggressive multi faceted effort to influence the outcome of the 2016 presidential election and that the willingness of top officials on the trump campaign to accept and even welcome russian assistance represented a grave counterintelligence threat to our nation sen warner also introduced the foreign influence reporting in elections fire act legislation that would require political campaigns to report attempts at foreign elections influence to the appropriate federal authorities at the fec and federal bureau of investigation a copy of the bill is available here

nicola mendelsohn s promotion to global advertising chief of facebook might have seemed a foregone conclusion after eight years of running emea but she still had to go through eight or nine rounds of interviews to land the job following a final round with chief operating officer sheryl sandberg mendelsohn was confirmed as head of the global business group in october at a critical moment frances haugen a whistleblower had just accused facebook of putting profit before safety while the parent company was preparing to rebrand as meta to reflect a broader focus that goes beyond social media and encompasses the metaverse of which more later manchester born mendelsohn who is moving from london to new york for her new role at meta starts with an inbox full of challenges although she insists to campaign that i absolutely do not recognise haugen s portrait of the company despite meta s reputational troubles the departure of several senior executives including mendelsohn s predecessor carolyn everson as well as what the company describes as headwinds from apple s curbs on data tracking and growing competition from rivals such as tiktok the business continues to grow revenues were up 46 in the first nine months of 2021 and are on course to hit 115 billion for the full year with more than 97 coming from advertising revenues have increased more than 50 fold from 2 billion in 2010 see graph twin priorities mendelsohn starts in the role with an insider s knowledge of how meta works she s done an outstanding job in emea mike cooper chief executive of omnicom media group in emea and asia pacific says the way she manages the facebook client council is quite masterful he adds referring to the panel of advertisers and agencies that she set up in the region in 2014 still everson has left big shoes to fill particularly in her native north america according to another industry chief who recalls how facebook s former advertising boss had major pull with us clients mendelsohn inherits a 4 200 strong team and oversees a good chunk but not all of meta s ad sales with responsibility for all advertisers and agencies that we touch but not the things that are automated she explains self serve ad products which are used by millions of small businesses around the world have grown in importance over time meta s top 100 advertisers generated less than 20 of revenue for the first time in 2019 and that is likely to have declined since then mendelsohn has two priorities supporting clients and agencies on their advertising plans and working with the industry on trust and safety making sure that our partners are aware of all the opportunities that meta has to offer is the straightforward part building trust is tougher although mendelsohn frames it as an issue that affects the wider ad industry agencies have always made sure they ve adapted they ve embraced technology they ve found ways to stay relevant a big focus is to make sure we continue the collaborative work we re doing with the industry on trust and safety she says citing the global alliance for responsible media garm an industry alliance as an example the timing of mendelsohn s arrival at facebook in 2013 was good zuckerberg had acquired instagram a year earlier for just 1bn just before facebook s stock market float and he won over investors by aggressively moving the business from desktop the shift to mobile was extraordinary mendelsohn says more recently the introduction of stories which snapchat pioneered has fuelled growth definitely mobile and technology and the cameras changed the way people want to reflect themselves want to express themselves that format now is just essential to people and to the way brands are communicating she adds instagram s video product reels widely regarded as a tiktok imitation has also become a primary driver of growth mendelsohn says we re seeing more and more mobile phone videos under 15 seconds and this is just going to grow i think reels will become as important as stories already is what s more two billion people now watch videos that we would class as long form which means they re eligible for in stream ads a lot of people 70 watch them through to completion she says revenue growth is proof that the ad products have been delivering asked why brands have kept spending with facebook one former executive at the social media giant who has now moved to a competitor says it s cheap and it works if there s a caveat it s that apple s allow apps to request to track changes pose a threat by reducing cross site tracking these changes threaten the system of measurable results that have helped small businesses spend on online ads with confidence enders analysis warns the metaverse more theory than reality for now zuckerberg has said his belief that the metaverse a phrase coined by science fiction writer neal stephenson in his 1992 novel snow crash will transform our lives prompted him to change the parent company s name from facebook to meta critics claimed the new name was an attempt by zuckerberg to shift attention from the under fire facebook brand but many industry watchers said the switch carried genuine significance enders described zuckerberg s 90 minute metaverse presentation in october as a once in a decade tech event akin to the environment altering keynotes of steve jobs at his peak at apple asked to give an elevator pitch for advertisers mendelsohn says it s probably a bit more than 30 seconds before offering a soundbite it s about making sure that advertisers are starting to see the ways in which we communicate that aren t just about looking at the screen but allowing consumers to be more involved in the screen meta acknowledges the metaverse is more theory than reality at this stage the creative shop within mendelsohn s team is planning a whole series of events and resources to help creatives learn how to design in the metaverse by using ar and 3d tools a world of new possibilities will open up as brands can put digital objects into the physical world and then allow people to interact with them she says citing how made com and charlotte tilbury are already doing this with furniture and make up trust and safety selling advertising is easy compared with the firefighting on trust and safety that mendelsohn and her bosses have had to do for more than three years first the cambridge analytica scandal broke in 2018 over the misuse of facebook data to influence elections this was followed by the outrage over the live streaming of a terror attack in christchurch new zealand in 2019 and then the stop hate for profit boycott by hundreds of advertisers in 2020 in response to abhorrent comments on social media in the wake of the killing of george floyd most recently haugen s testimony to the us congress and release of thousands of documents have raised questions about whether the company is willing to tackle problems about hate and misinformation on its platforms there is a sense that there are more questions than answers mark read wpp chief executive said at its q3 results the imperative is for facebook to demonstrate to our clients and to government that they can ensure that the platform is safe we make our money from advertising and advertisers are very clear that they don t want their ads next to harmful or angry content mendelsohn acknowledges clients concerns but uses emollient language i would describe it as having very thoughtful considered conversations with them convincing brands that meta is a safe place to advertise is an important part of her role making sure that people are aware of the progress and investments that we re making she says referring to the 40 000 people involved in content moderation and the company s 5bn spend on safety and security this year acknowledge the work we re doing they tell us that they have got confidence in the work we re doing and the fact that we re not satisfied with where we are we re going to continue to build on that i am proud of the work we ve done i know there s more that we need to do we re going to keep making progress but mendelsohn adds in a line often pushed by sir nick clegg vice president of global affairs i think there s an acknowledgement by the industry that we re better when we work together so that s why we support regulation to make sure that rules for the internet are updated and that s why i think things like the partnership with garm are so important driving the industry forward collaboration sounds persuasive but a good number of senior marketing executives don t see it quite that way facebook blunts criticism they say by inviting brands and agencies to join its client council and through its own membership of garm doesn t that make it harder for advertisers to criticise facebook or hold it to account because the company has forced its way into the room or kept itself in the room that doesn t elicit a direct answer from mendelsohn she says what s behind your question is do we want regulation the answer is we do we want to find the ways in which we can or as an industry i think it s much better as an industry come and say this is what the industry wants not just meta but all of the tech companies to adhere to a set of standards that we can align on she cites both industry wide and company specific examples of collaboration ranging from garm s brand suitability framework which grades the risk level of different types of content across platforms to facebook s own community standards report and topic exclusion controls for feed absolutely not putting profit before safety haugen s whistleblower testimony struck a chord in both the political and advertising worlds because it suggested that zuckerberg s company has systemic issues in her words that over and over again it chooses profits over safety does mendelsohn recognise that picture no i absolutely do not she insists our job is to make sure people feel good about the experiences that they have on we make our money from advertising and advertisers are very clear that they don t want their ads next to harmful or angry content and we don t want it on the platform either we have got very clear rules about what is allowed and what isn t i just don t agree with the characterisation of what said i don t recognise the company that she is talking about however some of the leaked documents that haugen has released paint an unflattering picture instagram made body image issues worse for one third of teen girls according to one piece of internal company research that came to light because of haugen according to the wall street journal which worked with the whistleblower that demonstrated facebook knows its platforms are flawed meta strongly denied that pointing out its research found instagram made girls feel better in 11 out of 12 areas and boys in 12 out of 12 mendelsohn maintains that some of the accusations about why we do research are unfair we do research because we care we want to learn about where there are issues so that we can adjust and then act accordingly and continue to make investments in a different way she says citing its oversight board of external experts our systems now are the most effective at reducing harmful content across the industry the company s ai and machine learning systems plus 40 000 moderators are removing billions of pieces of hateful content and fake accounts and catching the vast majority of that content before it even hits the platform facebook s latest community standards enforcement report showed it has been removing more and more hateful content and the volume that makes it onto the platform has dropped for the past four quarters we re now at a point on prevalence where for every 10 000 posts a person could potentially see three she says while she is not sure we will ever get it to zero the aim is to get that number as low as possible the assertion that meta s platforms are awash with hate isn t accurate she maintains living with cancer mendelsohn has taken on her new role and is working full on despite living with follicular lymphoma she had successful treatment to clear the rare blood cancer in 2018 but it still exists on a microscopic level and the outlook is uncertain it might be 10 or 15 years before it grows back to a point where it compromises me or it might not she has set up a follicular lymphoma foundation to investigate the disease but decided against giving up work or making other radical changes because i am really lucky to live the life that i live and i love my job born into a very tight knit jewish family with a strong sense of community and charity mendelsohn decided she wanted to get into the ad industry while doing her degree in english and theatre studies at leeds university she went to the library each week to read campaign and photocopy articles about the agencies she wanted to work at mendelsohn applied successfully to bartle bogle hegarty as a graduate trainee jobs followed at grey london and then independent shop karmarama where she was executive chairman before being head hunted by facebook i love agencies it s where i learnt my craft i learnt my skills she says mendelsohn s move to the media owner side coincided with a power shift from agencies to the platforms some big creative agencies have struggled to shift from making big brand tv work to producing the high volumes of short form content required in the social media age while media agencies risk being by passed by clients which can buy direct from the platforms however mendelsohn says she sees agencies adapting and embracing commerce creators and the metaverse going back to the mad men days agencies have always made sure they ve adapted they ve embraced technology they ve found ways to stay relevant it s probably the most exciting time to work in an agency she adds agencies act as critical friends and a great collective voice for advertisers and they help us to shape our products and services facebook will also make clear its private displeasure at some of that criticism according to agency executives who have been on the receiving end is facebook good for the world mendelsohn s role will mean a higher level of exposure at a time when scrutiny of facebook is relentless and likely to intensify but if zuckerberg s company can maintain revenue growth and keep rivals such as tiktok at bay investors may stay loyal however for many advertisers and political and civic leaders there is a bigger existential question is the existence of facebook good for the world the mere fact that this is asked by advertising insiders speaking privately and ethical brands such as patagonia and lush which won t advertise on the platform says a lot about the company s standing mendelsohn herself is in no doubt i absolutely believe that meta is good for the world i look to the 5bn that has been raised by people on facebook and instagram for charitable causes the 100 million people who use our blood donations the 160 million people that use safety check the fact that in the pandemic we were able to communicate with one another through the platform she says adding she also loves being able to see friends and family if mendelsohn ever tires of ad sales perhaps she could give clegg a run for his money as meta s top spin doctor this article first appeared on

dawson springs ky when the tornado sirens began rattling this town of 2 500 residents on friday night assistant police chief lance nosbusch locked himself in the concrete jail cell at the police station he figured that was all he needed to avoid feeling the tornado as it began plowing into the town at 10 37 p m but even in the cell nosbusch could feel the walls pulsing and vibrating as a monster tornado roared just north of the station destroying about 75 percent of the houses in one of western kentucky s most impoverished communities a place that takes pride in being the hometown of former governor steve beshear the father of gov andy beshear d nosbusch jumped into his police car after the tornado passed but he only made it a quarter mile before the debris filled streets became impassable advertisement then he opened the car door you could just hear people crying for help nosbusch said in an interview on sunday so we just started running through debris listening and we started carrying people down to the main highway to try to get them medical help but for nearly four hours dawson springs was largely on its own even as the cries for help continued the roads into dawson springs were so full of debris that the first ambulance from a neighboring community didn t get through until about 2 a m police chief mike opalek said by that time dawson springs police officers firefighters and residents had ferried about 100 people to a gymnasium where they tried to triage those who were suffering from broken bones bruises and deep gashes after being struck by flying debris some people were carried up to the school by front end loaders nosbusch said advertisement many people were saved friday night and saturday but dawson springs is now focused on who the town lost and how to dig out of the staggering piles of neighborhood rubble although national attention has focused on the devastation in mayfield about 70 miles west of dawson springs some residents here think the tornado was actually more powerful when it swept over them while survivors often say tornadoes sound like freight trains dawson springs residents said what they heard was more like a lawn mower gliding over tree stumps the wind chewed up brick houses and duplexes including much of the city s stock of subsidized apartments and caused some trailers and vehicles to tumble the length of a city block especially on the north side of town the destruction was so vast that some residents had trouble finding the spots where friends and relatives houses once stood by sunday afternoon 12 dawson springs residents were confirmed to have died in the storm according to coroner dennis mayfield but when a reporter asked mayfield if he expected the death toll to increase he responded oh god yes we did preliminary searches looking for the injured but now we ve got to go through the rubble nosbusch said there are still so many missing i fear there are still more for us to find when we bring in the heavy equipment advertisement as search teams with cadaver dogs worked in the rubble on sunday the grief and sadness was everywhere here as residents started considering the funerals ahead while also debating whether this community will ever be able to recover the median household income in dawson springs is just 25 000 annually nearly one third of the residents live in poverty double the statewide average according to the u s census bureau many people who lost their homes said they didn t have renters insurance tammy coble 55 spent sunday digging through the ruins of her father s service station coble s 86 year old father ernie aiken was killed by the tornado when it picked up the trailer he was in and tossed it across the street aiken s body was found a half block away next to his favorite bar at the american legion club advertisement you have a lot of elderly here and you have a lot of government housing and there is just not a lot of people with money here said coble these people don t have money to just go hire somebody to come do repairing to all of their homes they are going to have to wait for government or insurance companies and that is going to take a long time but coble and her sister in law lisa aiken said they remain optimistic that the town s connection to beshear will mean that dawson springs is not forgotten steve beshear who served as kentucky governor from 2007 to 2015 attended high school in dawson springs and his extended family has been involved in commerce here i m emotional after two days the current governor said at a sunday briefing his voice cracking dawson s a place where i d go and i d sit on my grandparents front porch beshear grew up spending christmas in the small western kentucky community and attended the annual barbecue festival his grandparents old house survived the tornado he said but the adjacent blocks are just gone just flattened advertisement you stand in the midst of this and everything you see everything right left forward backward is gone beshear said share this article share the family name is still associated with dawson springs main funeral home as well as a man made lake lake beshear a sign noting that steve beshear was born here is also affixed on a town gazebo as well as on highway signs i think with the governor s love for this town he will do his best to get the funding and other things we need said coble adding that she knew seven of the people among the dead so far it s going to take a lot to get people back up on their feet because they won t be able to do it out of their own pockets residents here do have some hope beyond action from the governor they note that some key pillars of the town the post office the municipal building the fire and police station and the school that serves prekindergarten through 12th grade escaped the tornado relatively unscathed and residents are relying on the generosity of neighbors amish families who live nearby cooked 1 000 meals for residents and first responders on sunday advertisement but the tornado gutted the town s health clinic and most of the city does not have running water cellphone service or electricity and all across dawson springs residents are focused on salvaging whatever they can because they are fearful that they won t be able to put their lives back together destiny cartledge 23 who is eight months pregnant moved into the clarksdale court apartments three months ago with daughters ages 1 and 3 a hostess at a restaurant where she earns 10 an hour cartledge paid 371 a month for her government subsidized three bedroom apartment when the sirens went off friday night cartledge initially ignored them but a minute or so before the tornado struck cartledge said her instincts told her to grab her 1 year old from the crib and crouch over her children in the hallway advertisement and then stuff started just falling all over me cartledge said with the roof and walls caved in cartledge found herself trapped at the back of her apartment in the dark although her children remained relatively calm cartledge started hearing the pleas of her neighbors children who were trapped in the rubble and crying out that they had broken bones all over the neighborhood you heard people screaming and babies crying and as a mother that is the most terrifying thing you can hear cartledge said so then i just started yelling i am pregnant i need help an off duty police officer and her uncle who lived nearby rescued the family cartledge suffered some cuts and bruises but her children were uninjured as she picked through her belongings on sunday cartledge was relieved to find some wrapped christmas presents one of which she allowed her 3 year old to open on the street advertisement we do live in low income housing and i was really depressed i lost my birth certificate my marriage license my driver s license and my car but i did find some diapers and christmas gifts cartledge said but there is no doubt about it people are going to need to help for now cartledge feels lucky that a town resort where she works at the restaurant has allowed her to sleep there this weekend and in this tightknit community cartledge knows that her relatives will be there for her at least helping when they can but cartledge s father jerry trover said his brother mother and three nieces also lost their homes in the tornado now trover must figure out how to help his family on his 14 an hour job at a sawmill i m just going to have to get work tomorrow and try to be there for each of you trover said apologizing to cartledge for not finding more of the christmas presents a few blocks away bryan williams is also wondering how he will move after he and several of his relatives lost their homes

everyone but you got to help yourself too

the country is being torn asunder by religious bigotry political belligerency journalistic aberration and judicial disarray the constant policy and institutional failures have eroded the state writ and distorted the institutional equation the situation is grave the state is under siege and faced with multiple perennial threats the collective will of its institutions is at stake hope for redemption is getting dimmer with the adoption of the objectives resolution as the preamble of every constitution and the existence of salient constitutional provisions regarding the status of the country as the islamic republic under a muslim head of the state and adoption of laws in conformity with the islamic injunctions and tenets the religious leaders should have concentrated on reforming and raising the society on islamic moral and social teachings for a bigger purpose instead of dividing it into intolerant and violent sectarian factions unfortunately they transformed their seminaries into commercial ventures and in the process became tools in the hands of some muslim states to advance their brand of islamic killing and maiming their brethren in faith with the failure of the state to provide education to the common people and reduce social and economic inequality the populace at the base of the societal pyramid proved an easy victim of the religious demagogues swelling the religious factions the financial profitability of the religious centres seminaries and shrines worked as an added incentive to widen and perpetuate the sectarian divide in the current political belligerency no consensus is expected from our myopic leaders on issues of national gravity this religiosity tolerated by every government has turned into a state within the state the state has no control over its domestic and foreign donations and the revenue from shrines and seminaries their mosques shrines centres seminaries are unregistered and unregulated a religious icon and owner of seminaries in karachi on his demise reportedly left a hefty bank balance of over rs 4billion every government and political party has tried to placate them notwithstanding their involvement in frequent violent demonstrations and humiliation and murder of high state officials and senior political activists would there ever be a government to muster the courage to lock horns with this mad bull one can only hope with fingers crossed the imposition of the second martial law by dictator zia ul haq changed the political culture and the institutional equations in the country general ayub khan s martial law remained in force for a few years with the promulgation of the 1962 constitution the soldiers were returned to barracks and his rule was given a civilian façade with basic democrats and elected national assembly he kept the military institutions away from the corrupt and polluted atmosphere of politics though he relished his undeserving title of field martial he ruled the country with all accouterments of a civilian leader general zia was a different breed of a soldier and went a whole hog committing all indiscretions to entrench the soldiers in state institutions and in the despicable act of eliminating old political stalwarts and cherry picking grooming and launching a new crop of political pygmies to control the political process this continued for whole eleven years under the umbrella of martial law changing the political landscape of the country this lot of politicians was least bothered by the political and democratic norms they were rather proud of and beholden to the military establishment for their political careers the overwhelming majority of a current lot of the ruling elite belongs to the zia stock they were sustained in power by the establishment for long years in the ensuing controlled political process they not only created their political constituencies in the client patron political system with the help of the powers that may be but started considering it their birthright to rule this country without any challenge they introduced into the political process all abusive tools and dirty tricks to humiliate and discredit their challengers whatever they did against their political opponents in the past has come back in a full circle to hound them their opponents took a leaf from their playbook to throw them out of the political arena now they are all out to put everything at stake fanning political belligerency crippling the legislation process spreading disinformation creating political uncertainty maligning the judiciary and military establishment by every possible trick including fake video and audio messages fabricated by a horde of social media activists disregarding the economic and foreign policy challenges we are faced with because of the fast changing global geopolitics and consequential strategic changes in the region in the current political belligerency no consensus is expected from our myopic leaders on issues of national gravity they are hell bent to take their pound of flesh from the breathless state a clear sign of a crumbling nation the print and electronic media are divided into political lines free from moral professional scruples they have long ago stopped separating the wheat from chaff looking for truth social media has eroded the distinguishing line between fact and fiction truth and falsehood the majority of the news disseminated by senior journalists through facebook youtube whats app or messenger is fake tainted and distorted to serve the purpose of a political group or dynasty for obvious considerations this free use of social media has confused and staggered our gullible people the excessive use of social media has steered the people into a hazy situation in which there is no credible leader in the country all ills in our political and judicial systems owe a great deal to the establishment nothing moves in the country without army and america our journalists are least bothered how all this is undermining the public trust in the state and its institutions the recent judicial decisions have attracted a spate of public criticism with the senior judges going public for having succumbed to external pressures in their landmark judgments or allowing convicts and under trial prisoners in serious corruption and money laundering cases to go abroad the judiciary has dealt a severe blow to its public standing as the fountain of justice the author was a member of the foreign service of pakistan and he has authored two books

racked up movies and tv shows like infinity stones in 2021 following the likes of wandavision the falcon and the winter soldier loki black widow and shang chi and the legend of the ten rings eternals proved itself to be one of marvel s most intriguing and divisive movies yet eternals follows a race of superpowered immortal beings who have secretly lived on earth for thousands of years here s what you need to know about the marvel movie including its comic origins cast and when you can watch it at home advertisement when can you watch eternals on disney in australia marvel movies have traditionally been theatre only experiences but we saw that change with the simultaneous streaming release of black widow shang chi changed things again with an exclusive cinema window but eventually made its way to streaming on disney day eternals is following shang chi s model with a theatrical release window of at least 45 days before its release on disney disney confirmed audiences would be able to stream marvel s eternals on disney from january 12 2022 if the film follows the same schedule as other disney releases we should be seeing it appear around 7 pm aedt the film will be available

scenes if you want to watch eternals and all the other marvel movies on disney you can get a subscription sorted here before you get watching here are some other things you should know about eternals celestials vs deviants vs eternals at the core of eternals are three races of alien god like beings they are of course at war with each other the celestials are like the prime creators they were responsible for creating our eternals characters they ve had a hand in major human evolutionary events and have also been known to use infinity stones every now and then the celestials spawned the eternals during a series of genetic experiments at the same time they also created the deviants a race of monstrous mutated beings the eternals have acted as guardians of humanity for centuries protecting them from their enemies the deviants they ve been hiding in secret helping us out from time to time but they never interfere this might explain why they didn t show up when thanos snapped away half of the population they were trying to protect in marvel s eternals however something significant happens bringing these super beings out of hiding what is marvel s eternals all about oscar winning director chloe zhao is behind the wheel for eternals and it s pretty different to anything we ve seen in the mcu before eternals covers multiple civilisations across multiple countries spanning multiple time periods so it has a lot of ground to cover and that s before you add in the absolutely stacked cast of characters but more on that later so do you need to see any other mcu movies prior to eternals not really chloe zhao has said if you know about the snap during avengers endgame that eradicated half the universe that s all the backstory you ll need going into eternals

san jose and san francisco and nanjing china dec 12 2021 prnewswire iaso biotherapeutics iaso bio a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering developing and manufacturing innovative medicines and innovent biologics inc innovent hkex 01801 a world class biopharmaceutical company that develops manufactures and commercializes high quality medicines for the treatment of cancer metabolic autoimmune and other major diseases today jointly announced the latest data from the phase 1 2 clinical study of a fully human b cell maturation antigen bcma chimeric antigen receptor car t cell therapy in an oral presentation at the 63rd american society of hematology ash annual meeting abstract 547 bcma car t therapy was co developed by the two companies iaso bio ct103a innovent ibi326 for the treatment of patients with relapsed refractory multiple myeloma rrmm presentation title a phase 1 2 study of a novel fully human b cell maturation antigen specific car t cells ct103a in patients with relapsed and or refractory multiple myeloma with professor chunrui li md phd from tongji hospital tongji medical college huazhong university of science technology hust in china as the oral presenter the updated data is based on a single arm open label multi center phase 1 2 study being conducted in china the study mainly enrolled patients with bcma positive rrmm who had an eastern cooperative oncology group ecog performance score of 0 1 and received 3 lines of prior therapy the study s primary endpoint is objective response rate orr with secondary endpoints including duration of response dor progression free survival pfs overall survival os safety tolerability pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics pk pd as the data cutoff date of oct 12 2021 this study included 79 subjects treated with the recommended phase ii dose rp2d of 1 0 106 car t cells kg 9 from the exploratory investigator initiated trial and 70 from the registrational study study results showed that ct103a has excellent safety and efficacy profiles as corroborated by long in vivo persistence indicating that ct103a has the potential to be a breakthrough therapy for patients with rrmm ct103a demonstrated a favorable and manageable safety profile among the 79 patients 75 94 9 experienced cytokine release syndrome crs the majority of them experienced 1 2 crs only 2 experienced grade 3 crs all occurred during the iit phase of the study while the 70 patients in the registrational study did not report any grade 3 or higher crs the median time to crs onset was 6 0 days after infusion and the median duration of crs was 5 0 days only 1 patient experienced grade 2 immune effector cell associated neurotoxicity syndrome icans manifested as transient decrease in consciousness and soon resolved without intervention all patients with crs or icans have resolved among which 20 and 34 7 were treated with tocilizumab and steroids respectively ct103a showed favorable and durable efficacy of the 79 patients the orr was 94 9 and the complete response stringent complete response cr scr rate was 58 2 with a trend suggesting a correlation between deeper responses and longer follow ups pfs at 6 9 and 12 months after infusion was 78 0 76 0 and 71 0 respectively ct103a also demonstrated favorable efficacy in 11 patients with emm achieving an orr of 100 and a cr scr rate of 72 7 in all 79 patients 93 7 achieved minimal residual disease mrd negativity with a sensitivity of 10 5 at least once after infusion ct103a also demonstrated favorable efficacy in patients who had received prior car t therapy among the 13 patients who previously received car t therapy the orr was 76 9 with 61 5 of those patients achieving very good partial response vgpr or deeper responses and 46 2 achieved cr scr ct103a demonstrated robust expansion and prolonged persistence the expansion of ct103a in peripheral blood reached the peak at a median of 12 days with a median c max of 92 000 copies ug dna ct103a was still detectable in 10 55 6 of the 18 patients who completed 12 month follow up after infusion the first enrolled patient still had detectable ct103a transgene 4 040 copies ug dna 34 months 1 030 days after infusion and remained in scr during this time soluble bcma in peripheral blood of patients rapidly declined after ct103a infusion and persistently remained below the detectable limit ct103a has low immunogenicity only 1 3 1 79 of patients were tested anti drug antibody ada positive within three months after ct103a infusion at a median follow up duration of seven months only 12 7 10 79 of patients tested ada positive while a high rate of relapse remains a major clinical challenge in rrmm bcma targeted car t has thus far showed great promise in its treatment ct103a is a fully human bcma specific car t therapy that can reduce relapse by bypassing potential anti car immunogenicity in the host this ct103a study demonstrated favorable efficacy safety pk pd and low immunogenicity signifying enormous therapeutic value for the treatment of rrmm as potentially a clinical breakthrough said the two principal investigators at the primary centers of the study prof lugui qiu md from the chinese academy of medical science hematology hospital and prof chunrui li md phd from tongji hospital tongji medical college huazhong university of science technology dr wen maxwell wang chief executive officer and chief medical officer of iaso bio said this is our second time reporting ct103a results during an oral session at ash meeting and this year s new data for safety and efficacy of ct103a is particularly exciting it includes some of the results from the registrational study at 11 sites which is worth emphasizing since it s globally the first registrational study that enrolled patients who had failed prior car t treatment for these patients who have no approved treatment options ct103a also demonstrated favorable and durable efficacy once again highlighting the enormous therapeutic potential of this innovative candidate at present we are also advancing the clinical development of ct103a for early line treatments combination therapies and autoimmune diseases while expanding the development program globally we ll submit the new drug application nda soon and look forward to launching this cell therapy to benefit even more patients in the future dr hui zhou senior vice president of innovent said multiple myeloma mm is a common hematology malignant disease with high incidence rate and relapse and refractory are inevitable after current treatments there s an urgent unmet need requesting a treatment with well tolerated and long persistence for patients we are glad the results from the phase i ii study of ct 103a innovent r d code ibi326 were announced in an oral presentation at this year s ash annual meeting these results looks very promising as they have demonstrated favorable and durable efficacy and manageable efficacy of ibi326 we will further accelerate this clinical development of ibi326 to bring forth a treatment option that will bring new hope to patients with mm about multiple myeloma mm multiple myeloma is a deadly blood cancer that often infiltrates the bone marrow causing anemia kidney failure immune problems and bone fractures for multiple myeloma patients common first line drug treatments include proteasome inhibitors immunomodulatory drugs and alkylating agents while treatment may result in remission most patients will inevitably enter the relapsed or refractory stage as there s currently no cure as a result there is a significant unmet need for patients with relapsed refractory multiple myeloma in the united states mm accounts for nearly 2 of all cancer cases and more than 2 of cancer related deaths according to frost sullivan the number of new mm cases in the united states rose from 30 300 in 2016 to 32 300 in 2020 and is expected to increase to 37 800 by 2025 the total number of patients diagnosed with mm in the united states increased from 132 200 in 2016 to 144 900 in 2020 and is expected to rise to 162 300 by 2025 the number of new mm cases in china rose from 18 900 in 2016 to 21 100 in 2020 and is expected to increase to 24 500 by 2025 the total number of patients diagnosed with mm in china increased from 69 800 in 2016 to 113 800 in 2020 and is expected to rise to 182 200 by 2025 about ct103a bcma car t ct103a is an innovative therapy co developed by iaso bio and innovent biologics previous studies indicate subjects with relapsed refractory multiple myeloma rrmm who received high dose bcma targeting car t cells may achieve better remission but have worse adverse events moreover once the disease progresses again the re infusion of car t cells will not be effective to solve this dilemma ct103a has been developed a lentiviral vector containing a car structure with a fully human scfv cd8a hinger and transmembrane 4 1bb co stimulatory and cd3ζ activation domains based on strict

bloomberg the european central bank s biggest decision this week is to decide if it can still call the current inflation spike transitory the answer will have a huge bearing on the euro area economy which is already dealing with resurgent coronavirus infections new restrictions and lockdowns and uncertainty about the omicron variant a wrong call would have grave consequences keeping monetary policy expansionary for too long could allow inflation to get out of control forcing more abrupt tightening later that chokes off growth but scrapping the term could signal a faster stimulus exit sparking a potential sell off in peripheral bonds along with tighter financial conditions that risk bruising the economy right now in its thursday decision the governing council will be able to lean on new forecasts through 2024 president christine lagarde is convinced that consumer price growth currently at a record 4 9 will eventually return below the ecb s 2 goal her deputy luis de guindos is concerned that inflation will not go down as quickly and as much as predicted and executive board member isabel schnabel is seeing upside risks federal reserve chair jerome powell has already dumped the transitory description and many others have disputed the term s validity the ecb may have reasons to keep it beyond fear that a change in tone could lead to a damaging market reaction such as labor market slack and relatively low underlying inflation here s a look at what s driving inflation in the 19 country region and how those factors will evolve supply chains global shortages of parts and raw materials are lasting longer than expected though businesses expect them to ease gradually through 2022 economists at jpmorgan chase co agree citing evidence such as declining shipping prices that show problems are abating across a broad range of indicators according to recent surveys fewer companies are battling with longer delivery times although the situation remains tense in the euro area and the u s the bank for international settlements has said that some price trends could even go into reverse when companies stop precautionary hoarding the pandemic remains a risk for example asian countries tend to have a low tolerance for higher infection rates meaning a fresh spike in cases could well lead to new production disruptions that would ripple through the global economy energy effects the commodity rally has been a key driver of inflation with energy responsible for more than half of the latest rate oil prices in europe are up 48 this year while the cost of natural gas increased five fold bank of america corp says prices have even further to go with average crude oil seen rising to 85 a barrel next year from 70 this year for natural gas the energy transition to net zero could mean prices stay high and volatile most energy price forecasts only go out about a year or two in advance clouding the picture for europe is a cocktail of global factors tension with russian president vladimir putin over ukraine oil stocks being released in the u s or colder weather that could impact prices wage growth europe s labor market is recovering and economists including anna titareva at ubs ag see wage growth returning to around 2 5 by the end of 2023 she and her colleagues estimate that each 1 increase boosts the core rate by some 0 3 percentage point in germany the minimum wage is set to rise by 25 a one time adjustment ubs argues could create broader pay pressures in the economy compensation in france will likely be held back by significant labor market slack as well competitiveness concerns wage growth in spain may settle around 2 next year and 3 in 2023 bloomberg economics says there s no evidence of overheating and while higher inflation and a tighter labor market could lead to annual pay growth of as much as 3 that s not of a scale that would concern the ecb according to philippe gudin of barclays consumer demand the inflation spike has been partly attributed to a shift in consumer spending from services closed for long periods during lockdowns to goods the demand overwhelmed factories that were grappling with restrictions of their own households still have hundreds of billions of euros in excess savings that could be splurged though an ecb analysis has concluded that there s limited likelihood of all that money quickly flowing back into the economy in addition resurgent infections and the inflation squeeze are denting the consumer mood statistical quirks the biggest relief for euro area inflation will come from germany when the impact of lower value added taxes in the second half of 2020 and a surge in carbon taxes fall out of the equation the bundesbank estimates that the former alone has boosted consumer prices in the country by more than 1 percentage point while berenberg predicts that the expiration of both effects could reduce euro area inflation by 0 4 percentage point in january yet changes to the basket of goods and services used to calculate inflation the previous year s spending patterns matter could delay a slowdown in prices in the second half according to bloomberg economist maeva cousin euro area inflation will reach a trough of around 1 5 next november said berenberg s holger schmieding thereafter an uptick in wage costs the costs of the green transition a restructuring of global supply chains and increased government interventions into the economy could underpin a slow but sustained uptrend in inflation for years to come read more ecb s stimulus exit path emerges with inflation at

rather than retreating to safe stocks as inflation hit its highest level in a decade and the omicron variant appeared in south africa investors piled into racy technology and electric vehicle stocks freetrade a stockbroker with 1 1 million customers said four of the 10 most popular buys last month were electric vehicle stocks they included two companies that had just debuted on stock exchanges rivian which has yet to report any sales and pod point a british charge point firm the rest of the most bought shares were technology stocks including microsoft and computer chip designer nvidia whose shares have risen by 142pc this year tesla was the most bought company dan lane of freetrade said customers had rejected cheap parts of the stock market such as so called value shares in the banking oil and mining sectors going against the broader trend of investors favouring parts of the stock market that are more sensitive to the economy this could be because they have become thick skinned and therefore worry less about virus news or because american technology share prices had previously dipped so they are less worried about how expensive shares are he said

found out that loyalty wasn t returned but she wouldn t trade the son she got from that relationship in the world kim is fifty years old she s white and she just started dating again but the person she s dating turned out to be usman usman was on the show once before he met another middle age white woman who was also an american and he married her things quickly fell apart in the relationship he was left in nigeria and that s why his relationship with kim is suspect kim is a sweetheart she s a good woman wanting to find love again and usman isn t it it highly suspicious that he answered her on social media she may have reached out because she heard his music and became a fan but usman doesn t go staring relationship with just any fan he desperately wants an american usman is a user and its unfortunate that he s now using poor kim up next was gino gino was an american who didn t really travel much because of the whole pandemic thing still raging and so his trip to panama was because of his girlfriend gino was a conservative creature of habit but he was taking a huge risk on his girlfriend it also wasn t the first time he s done this gino s ex wife is from brazil he brought her to the united states on a k1 visa and then they lost their spark they ended their marriage after seven years together the divorce was mutual and he doesn t have anything bad to say about his ex wife gino continued to be interested in foreign women he met jasmine on social media and the two hit it off right away gino hasn t been with anyone in a few years gino was happy to meet jasmine because she s a very sexual person he made sure to stock up on medication to help him in that department and he had already trial run the prescriptions but gino mentioned something to his family before he left he said that jasmine told him she wants kids and he wants kids too he was in fact hoping to knock her up on his trip to panama gino wants to rush into things and his family and friends are cautioning him to take it slow then there was alina alina is going to turkey to meet up with caleb and her family also thought she should take it slow she had rushed into things with a guy from south africa and she went all the way there only to find out he wasn t as interested in her as she was with him and so her family wanted her to things as slow as humanly possible its didn t even matter that its been thirteen years since they technically first started talking but at least alina doesn t have young kids and memphis does memphis has two young children one was thirteen years old and the other was six years old memphis is an american and she met hamza on an international dating website she tried the traditional one she didn t meet any matches and so she decided to go international memphis met him on the website they started dating from them and now she says he s the love of her life hamza is from tunisia he doesn t understand much english and she doesn t speak much arabic they use a translator app they also had never met in person but memphis was ready to file the k1 visa and she couldn t wait to marry him memphis was flying to tunisia to meet with her boyfriend for the first time memphis was holding off an engagement until then only she didn t want to take things slow and her friends were worried about her they asked her why the rush memphis said this was the best relationship she s ever had and that she has consistency with hamza that she doesn t have with anyone else he calls or messages her everyday memphis said american men give up after one month and that hamza wasn t like that he loves her she loves him she was ready to marry him and her friends were again trying to warn her not to rush into anything it was probably one of them that came up with the idea of a prenup memphis was still trying to placate her friends as poor kim was telling her mother how in love she was with usman usman was filming a music video in another country he asked kim to meet him there and she wants to go her mother wants her to hesitate she wasn t sure usman was the right guy and she wanted kim to be cautious but poor kim was already halfway in love and so she s going there s just no stopping her there is also no stopping gino gino got let off from his job because of the pandemic and luckily he has his savings to fall back on and he s usually good with him money but he s been sending money to jasmine he said she needs help right now only he didn t tell his family that the money he s been sending is for her hair to get done or her teeth to get fixed and so that was a massive red flag to his family his family mentioned a prenuptial agreement to protect him if nothing else its not like he and jasmine agree on everything she was a vegetarian he practically eats anything available there was over a decade of an age difference they were from different cultures they should take things slow no rushing into having kids or getting married gino is looking to fill a hole in his life and a wife might not be what he needs in the long run the end
joe margiotta 34 who runs the business with his three sisters under the guidance of father franco said the company has doubled the number of stores it has from five to 10 and spread into east lothian since he joined the business proper about five years ago the firm which employs 200 will stock more than 600 waitrose products under the partnership which mr margiotta set up himself with a phone call i was looking at partners that could be quite good for us and waitrose was basically number one on the list said mr margiotta their demographic fitted with us and so many of our customers shop with them as well and we thought it would be fantastic link up the call was followed by a couple of skype chats and waitrose representatives from london flew up to check out the margiotta offering they were happy with what they saw they thought it would be a good partnership for them so we just really took it from there probably the whole process from when i first contacted them to when we launched would have been about six months in total so it is quite a speedy turnaround from a company the size of waitrose waitrose ready meals free from and vegan ranges prepared fruit and vegetables meat snacks and store cupboard staples will all be available along with flowers and seasonal foods in a move mr margiotta says levels the field for the convenience store with the likes of tesco and sainsbury s it was then a case of marrying that with the existing proposition which includes offerings from artisan suppliers and renowned producers like crombie s butchers we love dealing with the local suppliers that is one of the main things we do and when we can collaborate with them we do he continued there are certain things that just have to be produced en masse and on scale and that is where waitrose helps a lot there are certain things that the mults multiples have access to that you just can t when you are small so kind of binding that offering that they have with the things that the independents and the small suppliers do well i think harmonising the both of them just creates a really good proposition for our customers they both have their place they are just very different places i would say within our shop read more family run convenience store and deli operator opens new shop the firm also runs its own catering business with from its kitchen in dundas street where it makes sandwiches pizzas and wraps to supply the whole company we re doing our own produce and hoping to do more of it as time goes on especially in the fresh and prepared side of things our customers absolutely love the fact that we deal with a local artisan baker a local artisan cheesemonger even the coffee we have an artisan producer and these are fantastic things as an independent we have always been struggling to compete with tesco and sainsbury s in certain areas where scale is rewarded so to have a partner at scale who can provide you with their stuff you have levelled the playing field at that point we have got plans to open new stores and i think with them on board there is even more ability to do that now it seems to dovetail well with the existing growth proposals waitrose is probably my biggest endeavour up until this point i was very keen to growth business i ve seen a lot of growth since i ve been involved but i m trying to push that expansion as much as possible we are moving from our current depot which is 10 000 square foot up to our new depot which is 35 000 sq ft so we are setting up the foundations for some good growth hopefully in the coming years mr margiotta added we are definitely on a growth trajectory year on year we are doing better which is great during coronavirus the catering business which supplies third parties including the universities but workers were able to transfer to the store the patriarch of the business at 73 is still closely involved my father started the company about 30 years ago although he had actually been in business prior to that when he had a baked potato shop and an ice cream van so business has been in the family for a long time it was pretty much my dad running the show solo starting with one shop myself and my sisters have really got involved over the last five to 10 years and more so as time has gone on so it is now got the stage where we are doing a lot he is still very actively involved looking up sales and discussing the new ventures but me and my sisters are taking some of that burden which is great for him and we enjoy it too q a what countries have you most enjoyed travelling to for business or leisure and why the time i spent in florida working for disney in my early 20s was the perfect blend of working and leisure i experienced life in a setting you just wouldn t find anywhere else it s surreal i made friends for life there and until the pandemic would still travel to visit them it s a time i ll never forget when you were a child what was your ideal job why did it appeal in my very early years i fancied myself as a postman pat but when i came to terms with the fact that the role had already been filled i turned my sights to business i watched my dad leave the house every day with his briefcase and i wanted to follow in his footsteps a businessman looked cool even if i was far too young to understand the extent of the hard work that his role entailed my mum tells a story about me as a child playing on the beach when i was around three years old i was building a sand castle with a moat as were many other kids on the beach the tide was out and it was some distance to travel to collect the water for the moats so i saw a business opportunity in charging the other children for my water 10p a bucket seemed like a good price for the convenience i could offer them my grandma recalled a similar story from when my dad was young featuring an impromptu sell off of her pots and pans what was your biggest break in business the most recent partnership with waitrose and the growth of our company in general has been a welcomed expansion a lot of hard work has gone in to it and it s fair to say it hasn t been without its challenges but great relationships have come from this too we couldn t ask for more from a business partner and we re looking forward to seeing how we grow together from here what was your worst moment in business the pandemic of course brought with it difficulties and challenges as most businesses experienced in the beginning it brought uncertainty but also new teachings margiotta provides an essential service to our communities and we have been doing so for over 30 years we had to adaptable as things developed and changed hour by hour day by day we had to be flexible and quick thinking in order to get through it and to get our customers through it this is when being a family owned and family run business has its perks as we were able to put our heads together and figure things out as and when the most recent of challenges arose who do you most admire and why my dad franco he came to scotland in 1957 from italy and started the business we know today he put every hour he had in to making margiotta and we have him to thank for how far we have come what book are you reading and what music are you listening to as a dyslexic books have never been a past time of mine i prefer to listen to podcasts and get my information from visual references i follow scishow and wendover productions on youtube lately my girlfriend and i have been watching brian cox s universe which is a phenomenal production we watched his previous show planets beforehand which i d also highly recommend

access to a wealth of collective knowledge based on these firms portfolio holdings as of september 30th in this article we will use that wealth of knowledge to determine whether or not seagate technology holdings plc nasdaq stx makes for a good investment right now is stx a good stock to buy seagate technology holdings plc nasdaq stx shareholders have witnessed a decrease in hedge fund sentiment recently seagate technology holdings plc nasdaq stx was in 27 hedge funds portfolios at the end of september the all time high for this statistic is 38 there were 31 hedge funds in our

on the stock designating 6 89 percent of its 13f equity portfolio to stx seeing as seagate technology holdings plc nasdaq stx has experienced falling interest from the smart money it s easy to see that there were a few money managers that slashed their positions entirely last quarter intriguingly dmitry balyasny s balyasny asset management cut the biggest investment of all the hedgies followed by insider monkey valued at about 422 6 million in stock phill gross and robert atchinson s fund adage capital management also dropped its stock about 9 3 million worth these moves are intriguing to

pakistan has proven to be unique she managed to escape the catastrophe and succeeded in orchestrating the economic recovery quicker and at a pace faster than others despite all odds a closer look however unveils some disturbing facts that bring into questions the sustainability and fairness of the recovery process currently it seems the coronavirus infection and morbidity are as common in the rich as they are in the poor unlike elsewhere the impact of quarantine restrictions imparted disproportionate hardships on the vulnerable sections the ruling pti team s revival plan however ignores most affected people and focuses narrowly on needs and aspirations of the elite of almost rs3 trillion worth of relief rs1 2tr monetary and rs1 8tr fiscal breaks barely 6 6 per cent or rs200 billion was spent in direct cash transfers to the poorest during the lockdown to shield them from hunger the rest 93 4pc is directed to support private businesses without tying concessions to job creation fairer pay scales and revenue generation it is a riddle as to what exactly saved pakistan from the fate that befell many others in the pandemic in most countries including the united states united kingdom germany india brazil and indonesia infections and deaths were more rampant in the vulnerable communities in pakistan it was not so the data is lacking but anecdotal evidence suggests more infections and deaths in the middle and upper classes in pakistan multiple studies show the pandemic related restrictions created greater hardships for daily wage and contractual labour a young economist barred by her employer from going public expressed reservations i don t see why the virus would spare the poor in pakistan we lack credible data when did we conduct mass testing to profile the social class of people who contracted the virus or died of it on second thoughts she said we know covid 19 is more lethal for old people maybe the poor in pakistan die early so their ratio is low in this segment and thus fewer deaths the covid 19 shock was not classist it impacted everyone the recovery is uneven it reflects the flawed framework and the elitist policies of the government in pakistan commented an economist multiple studies including the brochure of the key findings of the covid 19 impact circulated by the planning commission of pakistan suggest that the covid 19 induced restrictions imparted disproportionate hardships on daily wage earners and contractual labour with income and job losses indelibly tied to the lockdown asad umar federal minister for planning was approached as officers in key positions in his ministry told dawn that they have been explicitly asked not to share views and information with the media mr umar s response on the state of income disparity did not arrive till the filing of the report zafar ul hassan chief spokesperson for the ministry of planning responded thus inequality is a by product of economic development covid 19 has impacted livelihoods and economic activity rural areas non farm sector are impacted the most given the anecdotal evidence inequality seems to have increased which the government tried to compensate through broadening the coverage of the social sector the recovery phase recently started is likely to narrow the gap between the rich and the poor by creating opportunities in pro poor sectors the construction sector has traditionally worked as narrowing the inequality gap poverty and inequality are causes of concern the world over as the fallout of covid 19 however pakistan is likely to be less impacted he mentioned the soft loan plan designed to support the wage bill for companies that promised to retain employees during the lockdown and insisted on the noble intent of the government without citing evidence of the relief for common people in the bailout package to make the recovery inclusive a leading academic who declined to lend his name to the analysis done in haste to comment on the trend of income disparity over the past one year messaged if we analyse the income shock during the lockdown by asset quintiles five asset classes using pbs data it seems that the bottom three quintiles i e bottom lower middle and middle experienced a much larger shock and the post lockdown recovery has been least complete in these categories if these results hold up in a careful analysis it will suggest that inequality has increased one big reason for the harsher shock in the bottom three quintiles is the loss of jobs it was therefore important that any bailout to employers was explicitly tied to job protection earlier discussing the possibility of income disparity narrowing despite an increase in poverty during the pandemic he did not rule it out poverty and inequality may not move in the same direction in the current context because the poor weren t the only ones to experience the income shock the lower middle and middle classes experienced a large shock too but it is yet to be seen whether the recovery has been less robust in these classes than the poor that would shore up the upper end of the distribution but it doesn t help us figure out which other part of the distribution didn t get shored up dr shamshad akhtar former governor of the central bank and chairperson of karandaaz pakistan was reluctant to comment i don t have empirical evidence to base conclusions on but if people lost jobs at the lower end and the self employed lost income opportunities then the share of low income group must have gone down it s difficult to reverse the rising poverty of this nature with corporate business and retail bouncing back the higher income strata have benefited many analysts are arguing covid 19 has worsened inequality and added 100 to 150 million more to the ranks of the poor the government has expanded the ehsaas programme and is focused on growth revival but delays in real reforms can derail progress dr rashid amjad former vice chancellor of the pakistan institute of development economist said poverty increased significantly mainly in urban areas during the early few months of covid 19 as the lockdown was enforced resulting in rising open unemployment the new middle class was also badly affected in this period however the government by timely relaxing and then replacing the lockdown with targeted area shutdowns and backing it up with significant direct income support for the poorest through the ehsaas programme eased the situation though the overall income loss was felt by most of the population in urban areas i therefore do not agree with the large body of researchers and journalists who project a massive rise in poverty and that it will take years to bring it down to earlier levels inequality rose in all probability as some income groups maintained their incomes and a few made high profits including on the stock market mainly those who bought stocks during the crash in march april 2020 they included sellers of essential goods especially food grains textile exporters it companies cement and related construction material even if the increase in inequality is marginal it s overall rising trend in the last two decades needs the highest attention and action by the government collecting evaded taxes is turning out to be a slow process as is curbing corruption and money laundering raising duties and sales tax on luxury goods could help but not much enforcing an agricultural income tax and gst on services could be a step in the right direction published in dawn the business and finance weekly february 8th

by michelle toh cnn business sensetime is postponing its big stock market debut after once again getting caught up in tensions between the united states and china the chinese artificial intelligence startup announced monday that it would delay its initial public offering in hong kong where it had planned to raise up to 767 million it was set to start trading as soon as this week on friday the us treasury department placed the firm on a list of chinese military industrial complex companies in which us president joe biden has banned americans from investing the us treasury said that sensetime was sanctioned because of the role its technology plays in enabling human rights abuses against the uyghurs and other muslim minorities in xinjiang accusations that sensetime has strongly denied the company said in a stock exchange filing monday that it would postpone the listing to safeguard the interests of the potential investors of the company and allow them to consider the potential impact of the us move on any investments investors in hong kong who had already applied to take part in the ipo will receive refunds it added sensetime said that it still remains committed to completing the global offering and the listing soon it noted monday that it would release an updated prospectus for investors with a new expected timetable china s foreign ministry said the new us sanctions on sensetime were based on lies and disinformation we urge the us to immediately revoke its wrong decision and stop its words and deeds that interfere in china s internal affairs and undermine china s interests foreign ministry spokesperson wang wenbin told reporters if the us persists in acting arbitrarily china will definitely take strong measures to fight back another hit sensetime which was founded in 2014 in hong kong generates hundreds of millions of dollars a year in revenue by deploying technology for everything from smart city systems to driverless vehicles the company is no stranger to the international spotlight at one point even becoming the world s most valuable ai startup in 2018 it is also a member of china s national ai team which aids the country with its tech superpower ambitions but the firm is best known for its facial recognition software friday s announcement isn t the first time sensetime has run into trouble with washington in 2019 the company s beijing subsidiary was placed on a us entity list barring it from buying us products or importing american technology without a special license at that time the us government also cited concerns about the western chinese region of xinjiang and links that facial recognition software firms like sensetime had to the region while the use of such technology in policing and domestic security is widespread across china it is especially prevalent in xinjiang where up to 2 million people from uyghur and other ethnic muslim minorities have allegedly been put into internment camps according to the us state department beijing maintains that the camps are vocational training centers that help to deradicalize citizens but uyghur exiles have described the crackdown as cultural genocide with former detainees saying they were indoctrinated and abused in announcing the new restrictions on friday the us treasury department again invoked concerns about potential human rights abuses in the area the government said that sensetime s shenzhen subsidiary had developed facial recognition programs that can determine a target s ethnicity with a particular focus on identifying ethnic uyghurs sensetime pushed back against the allegations on saturday saying that we strongly oppose the designation and accusations that have been made in connection with it the accusations are unfounded and reflect a fundamental misunderstanding of our company it added we regret to have been caught in the middle of geopolitical disputes the firm also vowed to take appropriate action to protect the interests of our company and our stakeholders without elaborating further it declined to comment at the time when asked for details sensetime added in its weekend statement that it operated as a software company committed to promoting sustainable responsible and ethical use of ai which has complied with the applicable laws and regulations in the jurisdictions where we conduct business the company said it had formed an ai ethics council comprising both internal and external experts ensures that our business strictly adheres to recognized ethical principles and standards as of last week sensetime was planning to price shares between 3 85 and 3 99 hong kong dollars or roughly 50 cents apiece according to a stock exchange filing that would have put its valuation at approximately 17

menafn globenewswire nasdaq data continues to support the versatile potential of non gene edited shrna technology with updates from the cyad 02 and cyad 211 clinical programs management to host conference call today december 13th at 2 30 p m cet 8 30 a m est mont saint guibert belgium dec 13 2021 globe newswire celyad oncology sa euronext nasdaq cyad a clinical stage biotechnology company focused on the discovery and development of chimeric antigen receptor t cell car t therapies for cancer today announced that data from the phase 1 cycle 1 trial of cyad 02 for the treatment of relapsed or refractory r r acute myeloid leukemia aml and myelodysplastic syndromes mds and the phase 1 immunicy 1 trial of cyad 211 for the treatment of r r multiple myeloma were presented at the 63rd american society of hematology ash annual meeting and exposition the data support the potential and versatility of non gene edited short hairpin rna shrna technology for the development of next generation car t therapies our presentations at this year s ash conference continue to support the potential of our shrna technology platform to have an impact in the car t space without the potential risks recently associated with gene editing technologies said dr david gilham chief scientific officer of celyad oncology data from our cyad 02 program indicate that a single shrna can target two independent genes to optimize car t cell phenotype a utility that we believe is unique among currently available gene expression control technologies additionally the initial observations of cell engraftment lack of gvhd and initial signs of clinical activity in the early stages of our first in human allogeneic cyad 211 clinical study underpin the broad potential applicability of shrna as a platform technology as we continue to explore these individual product candidates and now focus upon evaluating clinical activity this clinical proof of principle gives us high confidence to develop further novel clinical candidates based upon our novel shrna platform filippo petti chief executive officer of celyad oncology added this is an exciting time for our company as we continue to validate the multifaceted approach of our shrna technology continued progress with the cyad 02 program demonstrates the power of shrna in an autologous setting and serves as a strong foundation for any potential partnership with the program we also have clear direction for our cyad 211 program where we plan to initiate enhanced lymphodepleting regimens to increase cell persistence to potentially maximize clinical benefit from the therapy as we continue to build on our solid foundation in the allogeneic car t space we remain committed to developing a new paradigm of therapy for these patients key highlights from the ash annual meeting cyad 02 and cycle 1 phase 1 trial update data from autologous nkg2d receptor car t candidate cyad 02 using shrna shows a single shrna can target two independent genes to enhance the phenotype of the car t cells a favorable tolerability profile for cyad 02 with a low rate of grade 3 cytokine release syndrome in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome r r aml mds the dual knockdown of genes mica micb with a single shrna has a positive contribution to the initial clinical activity of cyad 02 as compared to the first generation autologous nkg2d receptor car t cyad 01 two mds patients achieved a marrow complete response at dose level 3 of the eight patients with stable disease six had anti leukemic activity comparison of cellular kinetics for cyad 02 and cyad 01 trend towards increased engraftment and persistence of cyad 02 versus cyad 01 potentially associated with the knockdown of mica micb and reduced fratricide in vivo cyad 211 and immunicy 1 phase 1 trial update trial observations from allogeneic shrna based anti bcma car t candidate cyad 211 support the continued development of shrna based allogeneic car t therapies as a feasible approach to overcome potential drawbacks and risks associated with autologous and gene edited allogeneic car t therapies cyad 211 demonstrated a good tolerability profile and evidence of clinical activity in the dose escalation segment with three out of 12 total patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma r r mm evaluated for activity achieving partial response one in each dose level while eight patients had stable disease all patients had detectable cyad 211 cells in the peripheral blood preconditioning chemotherapy led to earlier than expected recovery of host lymphocytes limiting persistence of car t cells the next segment of the immunicy 1 trial will evaluate enhanced lymphodepleting regimens with the aim to improve persistence in addition the protocol also allows for cyad 211 redosing in certain patients enrollment in the cohorts evaluating enhanced lymphodepletion is ongoing additional data from the cyad 211 immunicy 1 trial are expected in mid 2022 conference call and webcast details celyad oncology will host a conference call to discuss the update from ash on monday december 13 2021 at

share facebook twitter linkedin pinterest by matt reese kim lemmon and kolt buchenroth it has certainly not been easy but roger and jan cox have quietly worked together over many years to build a successful sheep operation and a family legacy they are the 2021 charles boyles master shepherd award winners this award has been given since 1987 it is named after charles boyles who was the farm manager of the sheep and beef facilities at caldwell research station for many years this is the highest recognition the ohio sheep industry awards said roger high executive director of the ohio sheep improvement association and ohio sheep and wool program it is an honor to be able to recognize shepherds who are certainly deserving of this with a clear dedication to excellence the couple has been able to accomplish much on their morrow county crop and livestock operation they are successful because of their teamwork said dale davis a southdown breeder from morrow county i have known roger cox all my life he is a great friend he is a good husband father and grandfather back when they had the purebred hamps they were really successful they had farrow to finish hog unit he has done a great job with that and fed cattle and had a row crop farm the livestock always looked immaculate and the crops were always good roger and jan have done a great job together they got into the rotation of the grazing and i think that worked out really well they do their research and they are not afraid to try different things they also have a terrific breeding program i think they are role models in the county whether you have been involved for a long time or are just getting started you can go to roger and ask him questions and he ll be helpful and talk about feeding or grazing he will listen to anyone and give you good advice they have been mentors for beginning shepherds and have helped many families around the area roger has been working with sheep for many years photo provided by the cox family longtime friend and morrow county resident dale huvler agrees i ve known roger for a long time clear back to high school when i used to deliver feed out to their farm he was a tenant farmer and he kept 120 ewes plus all the time i started shearing at his place with two other gentlemen we d schedule it on saturdays so jan would be home to fix our lunch jan is a super cook huvler said you just need to see roger s place and you know what kind of farmer he is he takes great care of things he never leaves the farm very often but when he goes out to the fair or out in public he will talk to you and give you good advice he ll tell you the good and bad about everything whether it is life or sheep or whatever their plainview stock farm llc is just outside of mt gilead the farm has evolved significantly through the years according to roger cox my mother and dad bought me a registered hampshire ewe and a pair of twin lambs back in 1958 and we had hamps for a long time we showed them when i was younger as i got involved in farming we went from the registered sheep to more commercial sheep we have had those all of this time cox said in 05 we bought our first flock of katahdins and we still had our suffolk and dorset cross sheep we put the katahdins on trial a little bit to see if we liked them as time went by we really liked them roger and jan continue to manage the 100 ewe flock of katahdins through rotational grazing we like them and they are good for the land also it keeps organic matter up in the soils they have helped pay off land one reason katahdins are popular is there is a lot of rotational grazing going on and they are adapted to forages they are easy keepers they are prolific longevity is on their side we can get 7 to 9 lambings out of a ewe before we have to cull her out we don t have to shear they shed cox said they are hardy and we really like them if we decide to go more terminal we can bring in a terminal ram we just bought a pair of cheviot rams the old style cheviots that cross really good we have had them in the past but we haven t used them for a while the management has evolved to maximize productivity while minimizing inputs going into this next year we are going to have 112 ewes to lamb we lambed 120 last year our age is getting to be a factor now we used to run a couple of hundred ewes and it worked out really well it is getting more challenging each year one of the biggest changes is we used to lamb in january and february now i generally turn the rams in on my birthday which is nov 19 cox said we about always get lambs around april 13 they lamb outside and in the barn also usually that time of year works out pretty well we got away from the cold weather lambing it is just easier for us to manage later when the weather is better april lambing also works better with the grazing management that way we can stay in tune with the grass the ewes don t stay in the barn very long that time of year cox said we get a pretty good lambing percentage we try to get them all through the barn for processing where they get their shots and then we head for the grass usually once out on pasture for the year the sheep are rotated through 4 acre paddocks we try to keep them off 30 days if we can a lot of times that is not so easy if you get a dry spell or something you have to start moving pastures a little faster most of our pastures are alfalfa and orchardgrass we have other paddocks we pasture with oats and we make oats hay i really like that it doesn t cost too much i d like to get a paddock in cereal rye too we also graze the turnips with the purple tops in the fall cox said more people are going to rotational grazing and they are loading lambs right onto the trailer from pasture where they are finishing them we are producing lighter lambs maybe 20 or 30 years ago our lambs were going out of here weighing 130 to 145 pounds now the market has changed quite a bit you can still produce those kinds of lambs but with the pasture the smaller breeds and lighter lambs sell really well last year 91 of the lambs here went from pasture to the trailer and had enough finish to grade well the other 9 went on a little shelled corn and supplement to finish those off the market today is demanding smaller lambs more roaster type katahdins are naturally resistant to many parasites but this challenge is also managed with pasture rotation and selective manure application when we haul manure i like to plow it under i put it on about 8 acres or two paddocks it helps cut down the parasite problems he said i generally don t like turning sheep out onto pastures that have had manure hauled on them plainview stock farm also sells breeding stock it seems like there is quite a demand for ewe lambs and ram lambs right now the demand for maternal ewe lambs has been pretty good we feel like we can kind of fill that market too that is a value added product for us over and above what the market brings us we also do some terminal breeding of terminal rams for market lambs cox said the katahdin breed is pretty popular and in the last several years they have been selling locally and quite a few have gone out of state as well i try to cater to the younger breeder getting started we try to keep the prices in line that is my way of contributing to the sheep industry we have to have these young people coming in to keep it going the cox family has an incredible tradition of serving as master shepherds from one generation to the next it appears the tradition will continue in morrow county my family has raised sheep for my whole life my dad raised sheep our ancestors came from scotland and ireland and supposedly they had sheep my son and grandson have katahdins and they have some good sized flocks my daughter has a small flock of katahdins cox said i just want to thank god that we live in a country where we are so blessed like a lot of other people we started on the bottom rung we have been able to buy a couple of farms i appreciate this country so much because we had an opportunity to work hard manage well things can come together in america that is what i believe in

their screens on new year s eve to see if what was once dubbed the world s most important number slips quietly into the history books the london interbank offered rate or libor is finally being switched off ending its role pricing derivatives and loans ranging from mortgages and student loans to business funding and credit cards which totalled 265 trillion globally as of the start of 2021 the rate is being scrapped a decade after banks were caught trying to rig it in what will be the biggest shake up to markets since the introduction of the euro in 1999 its discontinuation on dec 31 for new business is being compared by bankers to y2k the computer coding that was forecast to sow chaos in it systems worldwide in the early hours of the new millennium on jan 1 2000 banks have spent around 10 billion preparing for libor s demise according to an estimate by consultancy oliver wyman y2k in the end saw few major incidents but regulators are taking no chances with libor with banks busy testing their systems i am going to be at my desk during the christmas and new year holidays and i know there will be other people who are there just in case edwin schooling latter director of markets at britain s financial conduct authority fca told reuters many derivatives markets based on libor have already moved to a new benchmark without major disruption watchdogs however have warned there may be glitches in some loan markets especially if the borrowers missed warnings of the switch and the impact of the change may not be felt fully until later in january if you have a contract that refers to one of those rates it s not going to be there when you go and look at the screen in january said schooling latter who oversees how libor is compiled from quotes submitted by banks from a market that has by now largely dried up libor began life in a corner of london s syndicated loan market in 1969 to help price an 80 million syndicated loan for the shah of iran its demise was prompted by regulators after banks from across the world were fined billions of dollars for attempting to manipulate the benchmark interest rate to make a profit it is being replaced by rates set by central banks including the u s federal reserve the bank of england and the european central bank the u s fed says its sofr rate for replacing libor is based on about 1 trillion in daily transactions making it far harder to rig the complexity of ending libor is similar to y2k said thomas wipf chair of the alternative reference rates committee arrc convened by the federal reserve to end the use of libor in the united states i think that the need for lots of pre planning and a lot of preparation are really consistent and we look forward to the fact that if we ve over prepared a little bit that would be a good thing said wipf who is also vice chairman of institutional securities at morgan stanley libor has 35 permutations across five currencies from the united states to europe and japan making its demise a huge global undertaking for regulators banks and companies since the fca fired the starting gun in 2017 twenty four of the 35 permutations disappear completely on dec 31 the rest continuing temporarily for outstanding contracts only not for new business customers who ignore letters from their bank asking to change the interest rate used for a loan could end up in a legal twilight zone if they don t reply getting enough holders of a bond to agree on switching to an alternative rate in time may also be difficult in some cases the really interesting part will be the month of january of 2022 watching what comes out of the london change said john oliver u s libor transition leader at consultants pwc it s not going to happen that first day but the first month s payments are going to be where things get very interesting oliver said about 80 of the 265 trillion of outstanding libor linked contracts at the start of 2021 were derivatives and swaps that pass through clearing houses the rest mainly in loans to companies mortgages and bonds next weekend london stock exchange group s clearing arm lch will convert 200 000 sterling libor swaps worth a notional 20 trillion to the bank of england s sonia rate this follows conversion of yen swiss franc and euro libor over the counter swaps derivatives directly negotiated between two parties worth about 6 trillion earlier this month there was no disruption to the over the counter swaps market with those conversions and all sterling swaps will reference sonia by dec 20 said susi de verdelon head of lch s swapclear worry over market disruption eased considerably after the fed said five dollar libor rates would continue for 18 months until june 2023 for existing but not new contracts the fca has also said six sterling and yen libor rates will continue in synthetic form sonia combined with a fixed spread for a year these two measures which help laggards catch up along with contracts baking in fallback alternative rates mean that few expect any widespread disruption though asia is behind europe and the united states in switching we have seen a lot more activity in the past two to three months companies are starting to get a lot more focused on it now said avinash thakur head of debt origination for asia pacific at barclays bank the western nations are the countries which have started off earlier in this process and asian companies don t feel it s as urgent an issue for them they are less worried about the issue thakur said dollar denominated libor accounts for half to two thirds of outstanding contracts the story is now already shifting to next year with the continued remediation of dollar libor contracts and the adoption of new contracts of alternative rates said mark cankett a partner at deloitte everybody in the market will want to avoid a cliff edge at the end of june 2023 banks are pushing hard for the u s congress to approve a bill that would automatically switch tough legacy contracts to an alternative rate and avoid legal limbo when dollar libor ends in june 2023 we re sort of coming into the home stretch we believe that the tools are available for market participants to get this transition done and we re hopeful that the legislative path in the u s will help solve the tough legacy wipf said others urged u s market participants not to wait until mid 2023 but to get a move on by learning from the more advanced switch in europe people should not solely rely on legislation come january 1 i think we re off to the races said tal reback responsible for libor transition at kkr credit and member of the fed s arrc

menafn asia times as is widely known in 1975 the united states abandoned the government of cambodian prime minister lon nol and the khmer rouge took power what is less known is that at the time then freshman senator joseph biden supported the evacuation of the americans from vietnam and cambodia on april 25 1975 the americans exited cambodia former prime minister sirik matak sisowath who refused to leave and was killed by the khmer rouge days later famously remarked i have only committed the mistake of believing in you while critics have said that now president biden s recent afghanistan policy was ad hoc and not well thought out it is much the same as what his approach to cambodia was in the 1970s the biden administration s recent sanctions on cambodia must be viewed in this historical context this action reflects biden s mindset it is based on misapplying the afghanistan paradigm to an incomparable situation exploited by stronger powers now an independent and democratic country cambodia was used as a pawn in cold war politics this includes america s secret bombings of suspected communist bases and supply lines in cambodia starting in 1969 the post world war ii cambodian government was first a french centric colony followed by a us centric period then a china centric period then a vietnam centric period and now arguably is reverting back to a china centric period it is like a ping pong ball none of this was or is inevitable and reflects a misunderstanding of cambodian politics a former french colony cambodia gained independence in 1953 under king norodom sihanouk in 1955 sihanouk abdicated the throne to his father and was the head of government for 15 years in the sihanouk era after world war ii the us provided economic support to cambodia from 1960 1970 norodom sihanouk was prime minister sihanouk long had ties to china the sihanouk and sisowath families are two of the eligible royal families in cambodia in may 1965 cambodia broke diplomatic relations with the us sihanouk wanted to be neutral during the vietnam war in 1970 the us supported the coup against sihanouk who fled to beijing and later supported the khmer rouge and the post coup khmer republic under lon nol the us made a loan of 278 million to the lon nol government an amount washington is now claiming has doubled to 500 million recently the biden administration demanded repayment of this loan from 1975 1979 the us condemned pol pot s democratic kampuchea regime in the cambodia vietnam war of 1979 vietnam ousted the khmer rouge from power and installed a new government of which hun sen was a part in 1985 hun sen became prime minister at only 33 he was the youngest prime minister in the world and now is the longest serving for 36 years prior to that at age 26 he had been the youngest foreign minister in the world in 1989 vietnam withdrew from cambodia in 1991 the warring factions in cambodia agreed to a ceasefire from 1992 1993 the country was under the united nations transitional authority in cambodia in my opinion untac was a successful transition to democracy and kept the peace in 1992 significantly the us ended an economic embargo of cambodia and in 1994 opened a diplomatic mission in phnom penh us alliance with hun sen makes sense since 1997 when a joint premiership with norodom ranariddh came to an end hun sen has been the sole prime minister of cambodia the reality is that hun sen is a perfect ally for the us his eldest son hun manet whom he recently endorsed as his successor is a graduate of the united states military academy at west point new york hun sen is part of an emerging democracy that is free market capitalist it is one of the 10 member states of the association of southeast asian nations asean which is historically

investment regime in asean while thailand has the most restrictive the us dollar is accepted in cambodia alongside the official currency the riel china and cambodia but then history brought us to november 12 2021 when the biden administration announced an arms embargo against cambodia because of allegations of growing chinese military influence and beijing s refurbishment of the ream naval base since the us is not an important arms supplier to cambodia it is a pointless policy that comes at the same time as america s boycott of china s olympics another paper tiger that reflects more weakness than strength hun sen s reaction to the embargo was to use the afghan analogy even before the embargo on september 12 hun sen said the situation in afghanistan evoked memories of when the khmer rouge took over phnom penh in 1975 cambodia could and should be a key ally of the us but first the us has to understand how hun sen views the world during the period of vietnamese control cambodia lost a lot of land area to vietnam such was the price of vietnam s occupation in the 1980s and also continuing into the 1990s china provides a counterbalance to vietnam s threat to and incursions on cambodian sovereignty and land area the us is not offering to protect cambodia from vietnam whereas china is so the us is not giving cambodia any choice this is different from thailand which has never faced aggression from china or vietnam because it is viewed as being under the security umbrella of the us in 2003 under then us president george w bush thailand was named a key non nato ally along with argentina australia bahrain egypt israel japan jordan kuwait morocco new zealand pakistan the philippines south korea and tunisia hun sen is the ideal leader to have constructive relations with china vietnam and the us the three countries that have influenced cambodia s postwar politics biden is still stuck in the afghanistan thinking that has roots in his leading role in america s evacuation of cambodia in 1975 in fact he owes a debt to cambodia biden needs to recognize that cambodia under hun sen will in 2022 hold the chairmanship of asean which is a political and economic competitor of china and is largely made up of democratic countries he is a masterly politician who seeks to be a key ally of the us a country that in 2006 opened a large new modern embassy compound next to wat phnom biden needs to build bridges with cambodia and spend time with hun sen hun sen is a self made man a poor soldier who rose to became prime minister he is a nationalist who biden needs to understand only wants to protect his country from numerous external threats there are valid reasons for what he is doing proudly independent the premise of the biden embargo that cambodia is under chinese military control is false cambodia is not a puppet state of china or any country the preamble to the cambodian constitution of 1993 revised in 2008 begins we the people of cambodia being the heirs of a great civilization a prosperous powerful large and glorious nation whose prestige radiated like a diamond article 1 states the kingdom of cambodia shall be an independent sovereign peaceful permanently neutral and non aligned country emphasis added anyone who knows hun sen knows that he is no one s puppet he is a nationalist who will make whatever alliances are necessary to protect cambodia s independence he knows that cambodia needs to have good relations with china vietnam and the united states note from the above history that in 1992 the united states first move was ending an embargo against cambodia imposing a new embargo on a friendly country now is a step backwards the us in fact is considered by cambodians to be a worthy model for their country and for hun sen s government instead of this stupid embargo based on the tempest in a teapot that is ream naval base biden should first write off the united states contentious 500 million debt and second name cambodia as a key non nato ally cambodia could then rest assured that like thailand which is under no threat it can count on us protection and not become another lon nol government or

photograph as a substitute for individuals and legal entities required to provide this information to reporting companies the proposed rule allows for individuals and legal entities to apply for and obtain a fincen identifier which can then be provided to the reporting company in lieu providing personal information who would be a beneficial owner consistent with the cta a beneficial owner would include any individual who meets at least one of two criteria an individual who directly or indirectly 1 exercises substantial control over the reporting company or 2 owns or controls at least 25 percent of the ownership interests in the reporting company beneficial owner the proposed rule clarifies the cta by proposing definitions of substantial control and ownership interests which are not defined in the cta substantial control the proposed rule sets forth three indicators of substantial control 1 service as a senior officer of the reporting company 2 authority to appoint or remove any senior officer or dominant majority of the board of directors or similar body of the reporting company and 3 direction determination or decision of or substantial influence over important matters affecting the reporting company the proposed rule includes a catch all control provision ny other form of substantial control over the reporting company which is meant to convey that substantial control can take forms other than the three specified indicators significantly this control prong under the proposed rule is broader than the control prong under the customer due diligence rule cdd rule that currently governs required disclosures new legal entity customers must make to their financial institutions under the cdd rule as a general matter new legal entity customers must identify only one individual who exercises a significant degree of control over the entity the proposed rule requires reporting companies to disclose to fincen all individuals with substantial control over the entity the proposed rule s divergence from the cdd rule on the control prong is likely to invite further public comment however fincen is unlikely to modify this aspect of the proposed rule in any material respect in a subsequent final rule fincen noted in the proposed rule release that it rejected adopting the cdd rule s control prong because the cta mandates that fincen rescind and revise portions of the cdd rule including the provision on beneficial owners also the failure to identify all individuals with substantial control of the reporting company would undermine the cta s purpose of preventing bad actors from hiding their assets in anonymous shell companies ownership interests the proposed rule provides that ownership interests include equity interests in the reporting company and other types of interests such as capital or profit interests including partnership interests or convertible instruments warrants or rights or other options or privileges to acquire equity capital or other interests in a reporting company as with the control prong fincen is contemplating a definition of ownership interests that is broader than the analogous provision in the cdd rule for example under the cdd rule assets held in a trust are deemed to be owned by their trustees under the proposed rule where ownership interests of a reporting company are held in a trust an individual would be deemed to have ownership interests if the individual is a trustee with authority to dispose of trust assets a beneficiary who is the sole permissible recipient of income and principal from the trust or has the right to demand a distribution of or withdraw substantially all of the assets of the trust or a grantor or settlor who has the right to revoke the trust or otherwise withdraw the assets of the trust fincen acknowledges the complexities concerning the attribution of ownership interests held in trust and is expressly inviting further comment on this topic exceptions to the definition of beneficial owner a beneficial owner would not include categories such as minors individuals acting as a nominee intermediary custodian or agent on behalf of another individual individuals with a future interest in a reporting company through inheritance and certain creditors of a reporting company when would reporting companies be required to report to fincen the proposed rule would not take effect until after fincen has considered public comments to the proposed rule and has issued its final regulation comments on the proposed rule will close on february 7 2022 once the final regulation is effective domestic reporting companies created before the effective date of the final regulation would have one year to file their initial boi report reporting companies created after the effective date would have 14 days after their formation to file the same deadlines would apply to existing and newly registered foreign reporting companies reporting companies would have 30 days to file updates to their previously filed reports and 14 days to correct inaccurate reports after they discover or should have discovered the reported information is inaccurate future proposed rules implementing the cta in addition to ushering in the proposed new boi reporting regime applicable to many domestic and foreign entities operating in the united states the cta will eventually impact how financial institutions comply with their bsa aml obligations for example the cta requires fincen to rescind and revise portions of the cdd rule within one year after the effective date of the boi reporting regulations proposed yesterday specifically the cta requires fincen to rescind 31 cfr 1010 230 b j which are the beneficial ownership collection requirements that financial institutions have spent years implementing and perfecting the purpose of the revisions will be to conform the cdd rule with the cta reduce unnecessary or duplicative burdens on financial institutions and their legal entity customers and in potentially welcome news to financial institutions account for financial institutions eventual access to the boi that will be reported to fincen which the cta authorizes in certain circumstances and with the customer s consent these cta provisions will not take effect until fincen implements corresponding rules which fincen has yet to propose financial institutions seeking advice on any comment to the proposed rule or seeking assistance with the ongoing bsa aml reform generally are encouraged to contact any of the authors of this advisory or their usual arnold porter contact the content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter specialist advice should be sought about your specific circumstances
china s sensetime postpones hong kong ipo after us blacklisting right groups say china has detained around one million uighurs and other muslims in re education camps in western xinjiang region hong kong chinese artificial intelligence start up sensetime said monday it was postponing a planned 767 million initial public offering in hong kong after it was blacklisted by the us over human rights concerns in xinjiang the us treasury announced the ban on friday saying sensetime s facial recognition programmes were designed in part to be used against uyghurs and other mostly muslim minorities in xinjiang where un experts and researchers estimate more than one million have been incarcerated in prison camps the blacklisting immediately cast a shadow over the company s upcoming ipo plans in hong kong which had been due to take place a week later and illustrated the risks investors face from competing sanctions rules as relations between the world s two biggest economies have soured on monday sensetime filed a statement with the hong kong stock exchange saying it would postpone its listing to safeguard the interests of the potential investors as they weigh the impact of being placed on the blacklist sensetime said it remains committed to listing in hong kong soon and would fully refund those who had already invested the us sanctions and blacklisting can prevent individuals from obtaining visas to the united states block assets under us jurisdiction and prevent the targets from doing business with us individuals or entities effectively locking them out of the us banking system a blacklisting would make it all but impossible for us investment banks usually involved in hong kong listings to get involved or for a us national to invest in the offering tech that spots ethnicity washington says sensetime is part of china s military industrial complex it had already placed the company on the us department of commerce s blacklist in 2019 because its technology had been used for mass surveillance in xinjiang it says sensetime has developed and deployed facial recognition software that can determine a person s ethnicity including whether someone looks uyghur sensetime strongly criticised the latest blacklisting saying in a statement over the weekend it was caught in the middle of geopolitical tension we strongly oppose the designation and accusations that have been made in connection with it the accusations are unfounded and reflect a fundamental misperception of our company the firm said the plight of the uyghurs has contributed to worsening diplomatic relations between western powers and beijing human rights groups and foreign governments have found evidence of what they say constitutes mass detentions forced labour political indoctrination torture and forced sterilisation washington has described it as genocide after initially denying the existence of the xinjiang camps china later defended them as vocational training centres aimed at reducing the appeal of islamic extremism beijing s use of technology to keep track of its citizens and the companies that pioneer such research have come under increased international scrutiny in recent years china maintains vast and sophisticated surveillance programmes both online and on the streets with artificial intelligence and facial recognition software playing key roles during the coronavirus pandemic sensetime s software was used to check commuter temperatures determine if they were wearing a facemask and could also identify people when their mouths were covered founded in 2014 by academic tang xiao ou at the chinese university of hong kong the company has gone on to become one of china s most valuable start ups in just a few years
now in its second year the publisher owned fraktura bookshop serves as a hub of literary events and trusted recommendations in zagreb by olivia snaije oliviasnaije serdarević sellers who are familiar with their product z agreb s fraktura publishing house is known for its high quality literature and beautifully designed books whether by local authors or authors in translation founded in 2002 by an editor and a journalist the couple seid and sibila serdarević fraktura won the bookseller international adult trade publisher award in the london book fair 2015 international excellence awards the following year in an interview with zrdavco basarić in wall street international magazine seid serdarević said he believed that in the future proper bookstores and book experts will again be important because bookstores will remain one of the rare places where you can talk with sellers who are familiar with their product the serdarevićs opened their own shop also called fraktura in july 2020 shortly after the end of the first covid 19 lockdown in croatia spread over 100 square meters 1 076 feet the shop has a ground level and a smaller gallery level where books on art and film studies are located along with graphic novels and works of croatian authors translated into english and german the shop s literature themed ceiling was painted by the artist tomislav buntak dean of the zagreb academy of arts the store s opening was the first major public cultural event in croatia following the lockdown serdarević tells publishing perspectives the store immediately began hosting book presentation events twice a week featuring titles not limited to those published by fraktura the majority of these events are streamed live professionally in three camera production the fraktura team had founded zagreb and split s festival of world literature festival svjetske književnosti in 2013 in 2020 some of the festival programming was held for the first time in the new store live events with international authors have included appearances by xavier cercas francesca melandri and etgar keret participating digitally from their respective cities at this year s festival a group of more than 50 guest writers included svetlana alexievich manual vilas and philippe claudel again some of the festival programming was held in the store for us seid serdarević says the opening of the bookshop is of great importance for two reasons one is to present quality books and not only ours books that are not usually discovered first in more commercial bookstores and secondly to have employees who read the books and can talk about them the bookshop then becomes a place where people can get information and trust their recommendations he says the public generally has a hard time getting information about books because major newspapers have let their critics go ten years ago most papers had weekly cultural supplements now only one croatian paper does people love to talk about books with our booksellers serdarević says we re even selling literary books better than some of the thrillers we publish smolčić the whole experience the fraktura bookshop staff comprises three booksellers and a manager helena smolčić who studied ex yu ex yugoslavia literature jewish studies and library science as well as running a student radio show about literature while she was at university of the more than 1 000 books in stock smolčić chose to organize fiction alphabetically and not by country as is often the case in bookstores there s a category for modern fiction from 2017 forward and a modern classics and classics section as in many other parts of europe books sold well in croatia during the pandemic smolčić says everyone says we don t read enough and people don t buy books she says but we ve only been open for a year now and i m happy because we can call ourselves a bookshop that comes with recommendations you get the whole experience we read a lot currently she says her personal favorites include colum mccann s apeirogon and a book in diary form about the year 2020 written by six ex yu authors luna bastašić luiza bouharaoua rumena bužarovska danilo lučić

menafn asia times as is widely known in 1975 the united states abandoned the government of cambodian prime minister lon nol and the khmer rouge took power what is less known is that at the time then freshman senator joseph biden supported the evacuation of the americans from vietnam and cambodia on april 25 1975 the americans exited cambodia former prime minister sirik matak sisowath who refused to leave and was killed by the khmer rouge days later famously remarked i have only committed the mistake of believing in you while critics have said that now president biden s recent afghanistan policy was ad hoc and not well thought out it is much the same as what his approach to cambodia was in the 1970s the biden administration s recent sanctions on cambodia must be viewed in this historical context this action reflects biden s mindset it is based on misapplying the afghanistan paradigm to an incomparable situation exploited by stronger powers now an independent and democratic country cambodia was used as a pawn in cold war politics this includes america s secret bombings of suspected communist bases and supply lines in cambodia starting in 1969 the post world war ii cambodian government was first a french centric colony followed by a us centric period then a china centric period then a vietnam centric period and now arguably is reverting back to a china centric period it is like a ping pong ball none of this was or is inevitable and reflects a misunderstanding of cambodian politics a former french colony cambodia gained independence in 1953 under king norodom sihanouk in 1955 sihanouk abdicated the throne to his father and was the head of government for 15 years in the sihanouk era after world war ii the us provided economic support to cambodia from 1960 1970 norodom sihanouk was prime minister sihanouk long had ties to china the sihanouk and sisowath families are two of the eligible royal families in cambodia in may 1965 cambodia broke diplomatic relations with the us sihanouk wanted to be neutral during the vietnam war in 1970 the us supported the coup against sihanouk who fled to beijing and later supported the khmer rouge and the post coup khmer republic under lon nol the us made a loan of 278 million to the lon nol government an amount washington is now claiming has doubled to 500 million recently the biden administration demanded repayment of this loan from 1975 1979 the us condemned pol pot s democratic kampuchea regime in the cambodia vietnam war of 1979 vietnam ousted the khmer rouge from power and installed a new government of which hun sen was a part in 1985 hun sen became prime minister at only 33 he was the youngest prime minister in the world and now is the longest serving for 36 years prior to that at age 26 he had been the youngest foreign minister in the world in 1989 vietnam withdrew from cambodia in 1991 the warring factions in cambodia agreed to a ceasefire from 1992 1993 the country was under the united nations transitional authority in cambodia in my opinion untac was a successful transition to democracy and kept the peace in 1992 significantly the us ended an economic embargo of cambodia and in 1994 opened a diplomatic mission in phnom penh us alliance with hun sen makes sense since 1997 when a joint premiership with norodom ranariddh came to an end hun sen has been the sole prime minister of cambodia the reality is that hun sen is a perfect ally for the us his eldest son hun manet whom he recently endorsed as his successor is a graduate of the united states military academy at west point new york hun sen is part of an emerging democracy that is free market capitalist it is one of the 10 member states of the association of southeast asian nations asean which is historically though less so recently pro western and a political bloc that china is not part of under hun sen cambodia established a stock market the world bank says cambodia has the most open foreign direct investment regime in asean while thailand has the most restrictive the us dollar is accepted in cambodia alongside the official currency the riel china and cambodia but then history brought us to november 12 2021 when the biden administration announced an arms embargo against cambodia because of allegations of growing chinese military influence and beijing s refurbishment of the ream naval base since the us is not an important arms supplier to cambodia it is a pointless policy that comes at the same time as america s boycott of china s olympics another paper tiger that reflects more weakness than strength hun sen s reaction to the embargo was to use the afghan analogy even before the embargo on september 12 hun sen said the situation in afghanistan evoked memories of when the khmer rouge took over phnom penh in 1975 cambodia could and should be a key ally of the us but first the us has to understand how hun sen views the world during the period of vietnamese control cambodia lost a lot of land area to vietnam such was the price of vietnam s occupation in the 1980s and also continuing into the 1990s china provides a counterbalance to vietnam s threat to and incursions on cambodian sovereignty and land area the us is not offering to protect cambodia from vietnam whereas china is so the us is not giving cambodia any choice this is different from thailand which has never faced aggression from china or vietnam because it is viewed as being under the security umbrella of the us in 2003 under then us president george w bush thailand was named a key non nato ally along with argentina australia bahrain egypt israel japan jordan kuwait morocco new zealand pakistan the philippines south korea and tunisia hun sen is the ideal leader to have constructive relations with china vietnam and the us the three countries that have influenced cambodia s postwar politics biden is still stuck in the afghanistan thinking that has roots in his leading role in america s evacuation of cambodia in 1975 in fact he owes a debt to cambodia biden needs to recognize that cambodia under hun sen will in 2022 hold the chairmanship of asean which is a political and economic competitor of china and is largely made up of democratic countries he is a masterly politician who seeks to be a key ally of the us a country that in 2006 opened a large new modern embassy compound next to wat phnom biden needs to build bridges with cambodia and spend time with hun sen hun sen is a self made man a poor soldier who rose to became prime minister he is a nationalist who biden needs to understand only wants to protect his country from numerous external threats there are valid reasons for what he is doing proudly independent the premise of the biden embargo that cambodia is under chinese military control is false cambodia is not a puppet state of china or any country the preamble to the cambodian constitution of 1993 revised in 2008 begins we the people of cambodia being the heirs of a great civilization a prosperous powerful large and glorious nation whose prestige radiated like a diamond article 1 states the kingdom of cambodia shall be an independent sovereign peaceful permanently neutral and non aligned country emphasis added anyone who knows hun sen knows that he is no one s puppet he is a nationalist who will make whatever alliances are necessary to protect cambodia s independence he knows that cambodia needs to have good relations with china vietnam and the united states note from the above history that in 1992 the united states first move was ending an embargo against cambodia imposing a new embargo on a friendly country now is a step backwards the us in fact is considered by cambodians to be a worthy model for their country and for hun sen s government instead of this stupid embargo based on the tempest in a teapot that is ream naval base biden should first write off the united states contentious 500 million debt and second name cambodia as a key non nato ally cambodia could then rest assured that like thailand which is under no threat it can count on us protection and not become another lon nol government or afghanistan which are the ghosts of biden s past

most of the dire forecasts of the effects of rising carbon emissions and global warming assume no significant human response rising sea levels will flood the coastal cities to which people have increasingly moved crops will wither due to too much summer heat perhaps the dinosaurs died out because they couldn t adapt to climate change but with ingenuity and substitutions humans can and will much of holland was under water until the dutch starting in the 15th century built dikes to hold back the north sea in the 20th century they constructed more dikes dams and causeways and pumped out the huge shallow bay the zuiderzee southern sea in dutch to use it for agriculture and housing renaming it ijsselmeer ijssel lake after the river that drains into it as the climate warms the global production of crops such as corn are being planted further north to take advantage of longer sunlight and less extreme weather levees flood walls and drainage systems now protect new orleans to the point that hurricane ida created much less damage than katrina in 2005 without offsetting measures projected increases in sea levels between now and 2100 would flood vast areas of the world s coastlines creating 55 trillion in total damage in 2005 dollars or 5 of global gross domestic product a study by the national academy of sciences projects but with higher dikes only 15 000 people would be flooded estimates bjorn lomborg president of the copenhagen consensus compared with 3 4 million in 2000 he also says that the total cost of the damage investments in new dikes and maintenance of existing dikes would fall six fold between now and 2100 to 0 008 of global gdp these measures would slash the number of people affected by flooding from 187 million to 15 000 lomborg estimates in contrast lowering global temperatures by 2 degrees celsius by the end of the century the standard goal would only cut the number of flood victims to 85 million a year in the long run human ingenuity always overcomes major economic problems i remember when serious economists believed that telecommunication development was limited by the finite supply of copper to make transmission wires then fiber optics were developed from silicone the second most relevant substance on the earth s surface next to oxygen computers were originally run by vacuum tubes that limited their size the odds of any one tube burning out were low but became substantial when thousands of them relied on each other so big computers would function for only a few minutes these limitations largely disappeared as more reliable semiconductors came into existence then there was the hubbert s peak forecast of crude oil production m king hubbert a geophysicist who joined shell oil in 1947 believed that oil field production followed a classic bell curve or normal distribution and that oil gets increasingly expensive to extract and is of lower quality after a field s production peaks based on his theory he predicted that production in the lower 48 us states would peak in the early 1970s so as demand for petroleum grew shortages and sky high prices might impede economic growth few believed him at the time of his predictions us oil output was expanding rapidly after world war ii and indeed american production not only supplied domestic needs but also much of the rest of the world through exports still his forecast proved accurate hubbert s followers subsequently extended his concepts globally and believed that worldwide production would top out in 2010 or in 2012 at the latest now however the issue is peak demand not peak supply hubbert s peak fans didn t expect natural gas liquefied natural gas the oil sands in canada heavy oil in venezuela and elsewhere oil shale coal hydroelectric power nuclear energy wind geothermic solar tidal ethanol and biomass energy fuel cells and so forth to substitute significantly for petroleum petroleum demand growth is slowing due to the ongoing shift from goods to services consumption conservation the substitution of natural gas for fossil fuels in electricity production and renewable energy to say nothing of longer term substitution of electric vehicles for gasoline and diesel engine powered autos and trucks the international energy agency expects oil demand to eventually fall in all three of its scenarios that range from the status quo to zero net carbon emissions by 2050 clean burning whale oil was the preferred fuel for lighting until the mid 1800s so much so that the famous whaling fleets in massachusetts were running out of whales in the nearby atlantic ocean that forced the ships to take long and hazardous voyages around the southern tip of south america to the pacific ocean there were fears that the world would exhaust the whale population and the lights would go out then in 1859 edwin drake a retired railroad man drilled the first successful oil well in titusville pennsylvania kerosene refined from crude oil rapidly became the standard fuel for lighting and the world s remaining whales were spared early in the industrial revolution many feared it couldn t continue charcoal was used to convert iron ore into steel and england was running out of the oak trees needed to make charcoal but an iron monger in shropshire discovered that coke a substitute for charcoal could be made from abundant coal and the industrial
