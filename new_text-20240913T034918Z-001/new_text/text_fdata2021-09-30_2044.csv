moved back home from a job in corporate strategy in toronto amid the pandemic many see new opportunities in this region as people get more comfortable living in isolated places and commuting to work

of gnp health wellness she aims to connect it to the wellness network and offer acupuncture yoga and a meeting place for teens and elders across the region the demographic problems are not going to be solved by having space for yoga she says but for those who need emotional and community support having the space helps people feel less isolated less alone when she was growing up residents gathered regularly at the local hall or in fish storage sheds on the community wharf but over time technology and a hollowing out of public spaces have eroded a sense of fraternity these little communities and the lifestyle here is dying out says ms pilgrim the relationship with the land the sense of community and working together people are becoming more independent and less community focused jeff webb a cultural historian at memorial university says there is a lot of nostalgia for rural newfoundland and its self reliant way of life but change is inevitable it s going to transform into something else that s not something i regret that is something that happens he says could become retirement communities some might rely heavily on tourism some might evolve into something else but it s going to change it s natural and inevitable ms lavers the bakery owner thinks the change must above all come from within her town isn t going to return to boom times but she believes rural newfoundland has a chance to grow if mindsets shift and small efforts like the gnp community place move forward already more locals have been congregating in her bakery after ms atkins her goddaughter began a pop up cafe once a week that offers espresso based drinks and chia pudding to survive in a rural region you really must have a community helping one another and volunteering she says and i think it will happen because at the end of the day as much as a lot of our people go away we never stay away with a good heart the plan is always to go back home

rural exodus newfoundland s quest to save its community collapse halfway up route 430 on the northern tip of newfoundland the tiny town of port au choix is postcard perfect caribou graze at sunset at the point riche lighthouse a pepper shaker like structure that has been guiding ships through the area since the late 1800s waves from the gulf of st lawrence gnaw incessantly at the craggy coastline whales frolic in the cobalt waters while seabirds flit in the salt winds overhead in the town itself barnacled shrimp boats bob in a protected harbor and brightly colored houses cling to barrens that have witnessed 6 000 years of human history it is a sonnet of rock and sea for the people who live here self reliance is a fact of life locals forage for berries and fish in the summer they hunt moose that s stored in freezers through the winter no one panics if the power goes out for days a not infrequent occurrence but that resourcefulness has been tested to the limits over the years ever since the canadian government banned cod fishing in 1992 the story of the province of newfoundland and labrador has been one of out migration decades of locals leaving their fishing communities for high paying jobs often to the tar sands of alberta here the population has seen a nearly 40 decline in three decades if once there were plenty of jobs and services to support a bustling workforce now residents accept hourslong drives for basic care and know that if a showerhead breaks they are on their own to fix it sara miller llana the christian science monitor people here are good at surviving they are not good at understanding how to thrive there has to be a cultural shift to make that happen rachel atkins who runs a pop up cafe in port au choix newfoundland people here are good at surviving they are not good at understanding how to thrive says rachel atkins who lives in port au choix there has to be a cultural shift to make that happen and that s why she has joined a group of residents building a regional collective for communities that will offer a range of services from massage and acupuncture to community kitchens and community radio it s an effort to draw in residents and keep others here and counter the narrative that these aging communities don t have the resilience to adapt it s a rebellion against the idea that a centuries old way of life is destined to disappear we need to stop this doom and gloom we hear about our communities dying says joanie cranston a local leader fostering rural resilience across what s called the great northern peninsula gnp of newfoundland that narrative gives everyone an excuse to not invest oh well it s dying they say why would you invest we can create strong hubs that can reach others and keep these communities strong the work the collective and other grassroots groups are doing across the gnp could hold lessons for regions around the world facing a hollowing out of populations and economies from small towns in the american midwest to rural parts of europe many places face demographic shifts that are making depopulation a pressing issue in the 21st century the question is whether the people of this isolated but beguilingly beautiful slice of canada have found some novel ways to combat the decline we re a canary in the coal mine when it comes to our rural areas says jamie ward manager of the regional analytics laboratory at the harris centre at memorial university of newfoundland in st john s rural areas everywhere are old and getting older and struggle with out migration but we re a little bit older we re a few years ahead so a lot of people are watching to see how this pans out here sara miller llana the christian science monitor cook s harbour once a busy fishing port on newfoundland s great northern peninsula now has only three children enrolled in the local school the mood across the province is what rob greenwood director of the harris centre describes as very conflicted given how the fortunes of the region have undulated over the years the province was growing during the heyday of cod fishing and after the moratorium led to a sudden exodus of workers newfoundland and labrador saw another economic turnaround with the offshore oil boom of the late 1990s and early 2000s then came the plunge in energy prices the province faced deep fiscal challenges exacerbated by mismanagement of a controversial mega hydroelectric project at muskrat falls in labrador still those in st john s the quaint provincial capital are now feeling the dynamism of a new tech boom dr greenwood says the mining sector is thriving too and most newfoundlanders appreciate the singular beauty of the land and the freedom inherent in the local lifestyle especially those who are retired and don t have to worry about earning a living and yet the province struggles to provide services to communities along its isolated coasts as the population ages and the number of people in the workforce who can support those on the public dole shrinks indeed according to federal statistics 30 of the province s residents will be over age 65 by 2043 the most of any canadian province at the same time newfoundland and labrador s fertility rate in 2019 was the lowest in the country within the province the gnp is suffering the greatest demographic challenges a 2016 study found it could lose 39 of its population by 2036 kathleen voege ap file st john s the capital of the province of newfoundland and labrador is known for its jellybean row houses it is one of the oldest english founded communities in north america this summer the provincial government unveiled a new 8 million canadian u s 6 3 million plan to attract 5 100 immigrants each year through 2026 to help increase the population our government has really put a push on because we need to see a huge influx of people from everywhere else come here says andrew parsons minister of industry energy and technology for newfoundland and labrador that s the only way we re going to be able to save our province that might work if you live in vibrant st john s with its colorful row houses pitched on rocky cliffs it easily draws newcomers especially since the pandemic from international students to remote professional workers take the case of kay naji she decided to uproot her life in brampton a densely populated city outside toronto to move to st john s with her two sisters after she lost her job as a flight attendant with air canada the three now own figs fromage which offers picnic charcuterie boxes aside from the wind she says she loves her new life in newfoundland i really feel a huge difference in the fact that there s a very big sense of community here especially with the business she says we have so many people that support us so much as a local business but newcomers don t tend to settle in the rural areas that need them the most the places where ways of life are built upon generations of a distinct kind of settlement sara miller llana the christian science monitor caribou graze near the coast of port au choix newfoundland the area was first settled by maritime archaic indians more than 6 000 years ago the remoteness of the towns in the province is partly a quirk of history in the 1600s as newfoundland was emerging as a prodigious fishing center the british monarchy banned women from venturing to this part of the new world it didn t want permanent settlements taking root that could compete with its own fishing industry it wanted to keep newfoundland a fishing colony so families hid in isolated enclaves in the bays the scattered settlements created a culture of self sufficiency and stoicism celebrated in song and oral history over the centuries as fishing techniques advanced the stocks of cod and other species eventually declined at the same time fertility rates dropped as education levels advanced these twin forces have beset the province ever since it first became an official part of canada in 1949 the first premier of newfoundland and labrador joey smallwood instituted a far reaching and controversial policy to try to deal with declining rural populations and modernize the province he relocated thousands of fishing families from remote communities to a handful of growth centers the idea was to establish a few thriving cities rather than have to service hundreds of fading outports as they were called this official resettlement policy which started in the 1950s saw 28 000 people moved from 307 communities by the time it ended in the mid 1970s according to the maritime history archive resettlement has been so emotive that one doesn t have to go far to find a novel or poem penned about it on the one evening this reporter could attend a production at the summer rising tide theater festival in the town of trinity the offering was a production of al pittman s west moon a haunting story of a community s relocation sara miller llana the christian science monitor cecil penney once worked on the barges that transported entire homes from his island community of tack s beach to arnold s cove under a controversial resettlement policy more than 50 years ago those passions remain raw to this day driving from the east to west coast of newfoundland one passes arnold s cove off the trans canada highway cecil penney was 16 years old when his community of tack s beach on an island in the middle of placentia bay was relocated across the water to this small town which to his eyes seemed like a megalopolis he worked his first job on the barges that transported entire houses including his family s in all more than 100 homes were transported to arnold s cove says edna penney a town councilor and historian who met her husband cecil after he relocated she recalls the population tripling while she was in elementary school from about 300 to 900 the town had to build new schools to accommodate the influx it s such a classic story of newfoundland resettlement that ms penney helped design a walking tour about the experience even though it s been more than 50 years since mr penney reluctantly left his quiet enclave the retired fisherman still tears up when he talks about tack s beach it s so peaceful he says there s no cars no nothing more home is up there it s just the way i feel resettlement is a term that politicians no longer dare utter but there remains an official community relocation policy under which residents in small towns that have become too expensive to service can vote to relocate with a government payout several communities have two years ago the town of little bay islands connected to the mainland via a 30 minute ferry ride made international news as residents left the enclave in notre dame bay off central newfoundland sara miller llana the christian science monitor route 430 known as the viking trail runs 250 miles along the coast of the great northern peninsula in newfoundland and many see hints of resettlement in an economic recovery report released this year called the the big reset to address the province s debt a paragraph in the executive summary underscores the enormity of the challenge facing the government running this sparsely populated province and maintaining its infrastructure is expensive an abundance of government run infrastructure is spread across significant geography including 259 schools over 180 health care sites 12 ferry routes 20 airstrips over 9 000 kilometres of highway 1 300 bridges 12 000 kilometres of forest access roads over 800 government buildings and structures and thousands of kilometres of electricity transmission and distribution lines all of this for a relatively small population of 522 000 people for yolande pottie sherman an associate professor in the department of geography at memorial university the report could lead to more cuts that make rural life untenable such as reducing ferry services the reality is if you do restructure ferry services that s a form of passive resettlement even if you re not saying this community should relocate says dr pottie sherman who co edited a collection of essays titled resettlement uprooting and rebuilding communities in newfoundland and labrador and beyond if you slowly remove services you undermine people s mobility justice rights their access to be able to get around and get places they re not formally resettlement policies but it s all connected the enduring resettlement talk is the inevitable outcome of demographic change consider for instance the view from jim larkin s house in a town called cook s harbour at the tip of the gnp the former fisherman turns in a circle pointing out all the empty dwellings around him nobody live in that one nobody live in that one nobody live in that one he says this used to be a real busy town after the moratorium everything went downhill now she s gone to the bottom sara miller llana the christian science monitor this used to be a real busy town after the moratorium everything went downhill now she s gone to the bottom jim larkin a former fisherman in cook s harbour newfoundland mr larkin s daughter moved away two years ago to st anthony because her son was the only teenager in the town and she wanted him to be around friends if relocation came up for a vote mr larkin says he wouldn t hesitate to move this community is pretty well finished carolyn lavers in port au choix understands that sentiment her son has left for a job as an electrician in alberta but she refuses to accept that leaving is the answer in the 1980s she was working as a hairdresser in toronto when she decided to set up a bakery as a side business to help her mother in port au choix within a few years they were baking bread for all the fishing fleets in town so she moved home to expand the business then the moratorium hit three years later oh lord have mercy it s like pluto and earth says ms lavers of the town before and after the suspension she still runs the bakery but it is now open only one day a week out of that slowdown though has come another epiphany a friend of ms lavers ms cranston the rural resilience leader asked if she could use the washing machine at ms lavers house where the bakery is located on a day when the business was closed ms cranston a physiotherapist regularly travels to see patients and wanted to use it to launder sheets this led to another idea why not open a place where all kinds of social services could be provided under one roof ms cranston had already started a similar center in norris point called the old cottage hospital it houses wellness services performance art space a public library community radio station a greenhouse and a hostel in a former rural hospital sara miller llana the christian science monitor rex boyd a former bush pilot from port au choix newfoundland built his own home and hunts moose like many residents for year round food it is now part of the great northern peninsula research collective an academic community partnership designed to foster development across the region the collective is trying to create community hubs in heritage spaces places that are historic anchors in towns says ms cranston in port au choix the group recently purchased an empty building facing the town s harbor that was once a teen hangout called the parlor they plan to turn it into the gnp community place which will offer massage physiotherapy and space for a community kitchen and events the center will be linked to one under development in st anthony which mr larkin and his neighbors in cook s harbour can access kelly vodden who supports projects in rural resilience at memorial university s grenfell campus says that fishing mostly shrimp and crab remains integral to the area but only employs a fraction of the people it once did unemployment in port au choix and the surrounding area stands at 38 many efforts are underway to boost long term sustainability such as fish cooperatives and community gardens fishing families have also pivoted to other jobs such as giving tours of viking settlements and icebergs and running whale watching trips adaptability has been key to the region s resilience the owners of the dark tickle co at the northern tip of the peninsula used to run a fishing supply shop after the moratorium and struggling to survive they noticed that tourists heading to the nearby viking settlement l anse aux meadows began asking about local wild berries such as partridge and bakeapple today the company sells wild berry teas vinegars and jams across the province i went from working on a fish wharf to working in a jam kitchen says kier knudsen who spent summers working at his grandfather s original store sara miller llana the christian science monitor i went from working on a fish wharf to working in a jam kitchen kier knudsen who lives on the northern tip of newfoundland on transitioning from the fishing industry to a tourist based business that sells jams and wild berry teas he was drawn back to newfoundland from a job in aerospace engineering in oregon because he missed the way of life ms atkins moved back home from a job in corporate strategy in toronto amid the pandemic many see new opportunities in this region as people get more comfortable living in isolated places and commuting to work by computer but before any towns can move forward they will first have to revive a spirit of community says renee pilgrim who moved back to the st anthony area from toronto last year too the founder of gnp health wellness she aims to connect it to the wellness network and offer acupuncture yoga and a meeting place for teens and elders across the region the demographic problems are not going to be solved by having space for yoga she says but for those who need emotional and community support having the space helps people feel less isolated less alone when she was growing up residents gathered regularly at the local hall or in fish storage sheds on the community wharf but over time technology and a hollowing out of public spaces have eroded a sense of fraternity these little communities and the lifestyle here is dying out says ms pilgrim the relationship with the land the sense of community and working together people are becoming more independent and less community focused jeff webb a cultural historian at memorial university says there is a lot of nostalgia for rural newfoundland and its self reliant way of life but change is inevitable it s going to transform into something else that s not something i regret that is something that happens he says could become retirement communities some might rely heavily on tourism some might evolve into something else but it s going to change it s natural and inevitable ms lavers the bakery owner thinks the change must above all come from within her town isn t going to return to boom times but she believes rural newfoundland has a chance to grow if mindsets shift and small efforts like the gnp community place move forward already more locals have been congregating in her bakery after ms atkins her goddaughter began a pop up cafe once a week that offers espresso based drinks and chia pudding to survive in a rural region you really must have a community helping one another and volunteering she says and i think it will happen because at the end of the day as much as a lot of our people go away we never stay away with a good heart the plan is always to go back home

mark pestronk q i am an independent contractor ic and my host agency is requiring that i set up my own corporation or limited liability company llc by year s end first what s the point of my doing so second which one should i set up a corporation or an llc third in what state should i set it up i keep reading about the advantages of setting up an llc in delaware nevada or wyoming although most of these articles and ads are written by lawyers who want business what is the real story a your host s requirement is a wise one for both the host and you for the host having you work through a corporation or llc makes it much less likely that a state taxing authority will reclassify your relationship as one of employer and employee such a reclassification would require the host to make withholding tax contributions and probably require the host to pay penalties for past noncompliance as an ic if you don t want to be deemed an employee of the host and i am sure you don t then it pays to become an employee of your own business in addition working through a corporation or llc protects your personal assets from liability for breach of contract and other misdeeds as for choosing between a corporation and an llc you should probably choose an llc for two reasons first there are few or no follow up formalities that you need to observe in order to operate your llc in compliance with the law whereas with a corporation you should be issuing stock doing annual meetings minutes as silly as they are if you are the sole owner and taking other steps depending on the law of the state in which you set up second with an llc you can choose to continue to be taxed as a proprietorship i e you can continue filing a schedule c as part of your personal federal tax return although such a filing makes the transition to the llc much easier for you i don t recommend it because schedule c filers are much more likely to get audited by the irs than llcs that get taxed as separate entities like corporations do an audit may mean that any travel expenses that you claimed will get disqualified specifically your odds of being audited as a schedule c filer are three times as high as they are if your company is taxed as a separate entity either an llc or a corporation these odds will change if the irs gets the additional funding that president biden wants but a schedule c filer will probably stay a bigger audit target an llc formed in delaware nevada or wyoming also must register as a foreign i e formed out of state llc in the state in which you are located this double filing requirement negates any benefits offered by these three states such as low filing fees low taxes and anonymity tax benefits won t extend to business income generated in your state anyway so unless your attorney advises you differently you should always establish the llc in your home state

article senate republicans voted unanimously on monday to block a bill that would suspend the debt ceiling until december 2022 with the deadline for funding the federal government just days away unless democrats find a way to address the debt limit the government will shut down and be unable to meet its financial obligations by oct 18 treasury secretary janet yellen wrote in a letter delivered to congress following the vote gop lawmakers led by senate minority leader mitch mcconnell wouldn t support the bill because they disapprove of the biden administration s economic agenda that would increase taxes on the wealthy and fund new spending on child care health care and infrastructure during the trump administration the debt limit was suspended three separate times according to treasury secretary janet yellen the most recent suspension was passed on a bipartisan basis in 2019 it expired in june 2021 the vast majority of the debt currently subject to the debt limit was accrued before president biden took office failure to raise debt ceiling may delay social security child tax credits if congress fails to address the debt limit and the government goes into default for the first time in history it would cause catastrophic damage to the country s credit rating yellen wrote in a recent op ed for the wall street journal this could send financial markets into a tailspin that may lead to an economic recession unless the issue is resolved failure to raise or suspend the debt ceiling could also lead to delays in social security and child tax credit checks this

rare disease has always been amicus therapeutics focus but in recent years the company adjusted how it aimed to treat such disorders a shift that followed a 100 million acquisition of a gene therapy startup amicus is now spinning out its gene therapy assets into a separate business that will be publicly traded following a merger with a blank check company sponsored post behavioral health interoperability and econsent meeting the demands of cms final rule compliance in a webinar on april 16 at 1pm et aneesh chopra will moderate a discussion with executives from docusign velatura and behavioral health providers on econsent health information exchange and compliance with the cms final rule on interoperability according to transaction terms announced wednesday amicus keeps its focus on its commercialized drug and therapeutic candidates in late stage development meanwhile new company caritas therapeutics steps out on its own as a gene therapy company with a pipeline of clinical and preclinical programs john crowley amicus ceo will leave his post at the philadelphia based biotech to lead caritas we see this transaction sharpening the strategic focus significantly strengthening the financial profile as well as enhancing the operational execution of both of these companies for the benefit of all of our stakeholders crowley said speaking on a conference call though amicus and caritas will be separate entities they will remain closely connected amicus will be the largest caritas shareholder owning about 36 of the company amicus will also have the right to share in the development and commercialization of two gene therapy programs that came from its collaboration with the university of pennsylvania caritas will start out well funded the merger with arya sciences acquisition corp iv a special purpose acquisition company spac will provide the new company with about 400 million in total financing throughout its nearly 20 year history amicus focus has been lysosomal storage disorders which are inherited metabolic diseases in which an enzyme deficiency leads to the toxic buildup of substances in the body amicus has commercialized one drug the fabry disease treatment galafold approved in 2018 the drug accounted for 260 8 million in sales last year a 43 increase over the prior year amicus hopes to add pompe disease drug candidate at gaa as another revenue generating product that therapy is currently under fda review with a regulatory decision expected in mid 2022 but amicus has never been profitable and the substantial financial investment required of gene therapy research was likely to keep the biotech from reaching profitability any time soon sponsored content a deep dive into specialty pharma a specialty drug is a class of prescription medications used to treat complex chronic or rare medical conditions although this classification was originally intended to define the treatment of rare also termed orphan diseases affecting fewer than 200 000 people in the us more recently specialty drugs have emerged as the cornerstone of treatment for chronic and complex diseases such as cancer autoimmune conditions diabetes hepatitis c and hiv aids crowley said the spinout of the gene therapies will put amicus on firm financial footing and a path to profitability in 2023 meanwhile the spac merger secures the financing needed to continue clinical development of the gene therapies crowley will be succeeded by bradley campbell currently amicus s president and chief operating officer speaking on a conference call campbell said amicus will be a late stage global development and commercialization company focused on fabry and pompe growth will come from commercializing galafold in new geographic markets and extending that drug s label the most advanced product candidates joining the caritas pipeline will be two clinical stage gene therapies for batten disease a rare inherited nervous system disorder

rural exodus newfoundland s quest to save its community collapse halfway up route 430 on the northern tip of newfoundland the tiny town of port au choix is postcard perfect caribou graze at sunset at the point riche lighthouse a pepper shaker like structure that has been guiding ships through the area since the late 1800s waves from the gulf of st lawrence gnaw incessantly at the craggy coastline whales frolic in the cobalt waters while seabirds flit in the salt winds overhead in the town itself barnacled shrimp boats bob in a protected harbor and brightly colored houses cling to barrens that have witnessed 6 000 years of human history it is a sonnet of rock and sea for the people who live here self reliance is a fact of life locals forage for berries and fish in the summer they hunt moose that s stored in freezers through the winter no one panics if the power goes out for days a not infrequent occurrence but that resourcefulness has been tested to the limits over the years ever since the canadian government banned cod fishing in 1992 the story of the province of newfoundland and labrador has been one of out migration decades of locals leaving their fishing communities for high paying jobs often to the tar sands of alberta here the population has seen a nearly 40 decline in three decades if once there were plenty of jobs and services to support a bustling workforce now residents accept hourslong drives for basic care and know that if a showerhead breaks they are on their own to fix it sara miller llana the christian science monitor people here are good at surviving they are not good at understanding how to thrive there has to be a cultural shift to make that happen rachel atkins who runs a pop up cafe in port au choix newfoundland people here are good at surviving they are not good at understanding how to thrive says rachel atkins who lives in port au choix there has to be a cultural shift to make that happen and that s why she has joined a group of residents building a regional collective for communities that will offer a range of services from massage and acupuncture to community kitchens and community radio it s an effort to draw in residents and keep others here and counter the narrative that these aging communities don t have the resilience to adapt it s a rebellion against the idea that a centuries old way of life is destined to disappear we need to stop this doom and gloom we hear about our communities dying says joanie cranston a local leader fostering rural resilience across what s called the great northern peninsula gnp of newfoundland that narrative gives everyone an excuse to not invest oh well it s dying they say why would you invest we can create strong hubs that can reach others and keep these communities strong the work the collective and other grassroots groups are doing across the gnp could hold lessons for regions around the world facing a hollowing out of populations and economies from small towns in the american midwest to rural parts of europe many places face demographic shifts that are making depopulation a pressing issue in the 21st century the question is whether the people of this isolated but beguilingly beautiful slice of canada have found some novel ways to combat the decline we re a canary in the coal mine when it comes to our rural areas says jamie ward manager of the regional analytics laboratory at the harris centre at memorial university of newfoundland in st john s rural areas everywhere are old and getting older and struggle with out migration but we re a little bit older we re a few years ahead so a lot of people are watching to see how this pans out here sara miller llana the christian science monitor cook s harbour once a busy fishing port on newfoundland s great northern peninsula now has only three children enrolled in the local school the mood across the province is what rob greenwood director of the harris centre describes as very conflicted given how the fortunes of the region have undulated over the years the province was growing during the heyday of cod fishing and after the moratorium led to a sudden exodus of workers newfoundland and labrador saw another economic turnaround with the offshore oil boom of the late 1990s and early 2000s then came the plunge in energy prices the province faced deep fiscal challenges exacerbated by mismanagement of a controversial mega hydroelectric project at muskrat falls in labrador still those in st john s the quaint provincial capital are now feeling the dynamism of a new tech boom dr greenwood says the mining sector is thriving too and most newfoundlanders appreciate the singular beauty of the land and the freedom inherent in the local lifestyle especially those who are retired and don t have to worry about earning a living and yet the province struggles to provide services to communities along its isolated coasts as the population ages and the number of people in the workforce who can support those on the public dole shrinks indeed according to federal statistics 30 of the province s residents will be over age 65 by 2043 the most of any canadian province at the same time newfoundland and labrador s fertility rate in 2019 was the lowest in the country within the province the gnp is suffering the greatest demographic challenges a 2016 study found it could lose 39 of its population by 2036 kathleen voege ap file st john s the capital of the province of newfoundland and labrador is known for its jellybean row houses it is one of the oldest english founded communities in north america this summer the provincial government unveiled a new 8 million canadian u s 6 3 million plan to attract 5 100 immigrants each year through 2026 to help increase the population our government has really put a push on because we need to see a huge influx of people from everywhere else come here says andrew parsons minister of industry energy and technology for newfoundland and labrador that s the only way we re going to be able to save our province that might work if you live in vibrant st john s with its colorful row houses pitched on rocky cliffs it easily draws newcomers especially since the pandemic from international students to remote professional workers take the case of kay naji she decided to uproot her life in brampton a densely populated city outside toronto to move to st john s with her two sisters after she lost her job as a flight attendant with air canada the three now own figs fromage which offers picnic charcuterie boxes aside from the wind she says she loves her new life in newfoundland i really feel a huge difference in the fact that there s a very big sense of community here especially with the business she says we have so many people that support us so much as a local business but newcomers don t tend to settle in the rural areas that need them the most the places where ways of life are built upon generations of a distinct kind of settlement sara miller llana the christian science monitor caribou graze near the coast of port au choix newfoundland the area was first settled by maritime archaic indians more than 6 000 years ago the remoteness of the towns in the province is partly a quirk of history in the 1600s as newfoundland was emerging as a prodigious fishing center the british monarchy banned women from venturing to this part of the new world it didn t want permanent settlements taking root that could compete with its own fishing industry it wanted to keep newfoundland a fishing colony so families hid in isolated enclaves in the bays the scattered settlements created a culture of self sufficiency and stoicism celebrated in song and oral history over the centuries as fishing techniques advanced the stocks of cod and other species eventually declined at the same time fertility rates dropped as education levels advanced these twin forces have beset the province ever since it first became an official part of canada in 1949 the first premier of newfoundland and labrador joey smallwood instituted a far reaching and controversial policy to try to deal with declining rural populations and modernize the province he relocated thousands of fishing families from remote communities to a handful of growth centers the idea was to establish a few thriving cities rather than have to service hundreds of fading outports as they were called this official resettlement policy which started in the 1950s saw 28 000 people moved from 307 communities by the time it ended in the mid 1970s according to the maritime history archive resettlement has been so emotive that one doesn t have to go far to find a novel or poem penned about it on the one evening this reporter could attend a production at the summer rising tide theater festival in the town of trinity the offering was a production of al pittman s west moon a haunting story of a community s relocation sara miller llana the christian science monitor cecil penney once worked on the barges that transported entire homes from his island community of tack s beach to arnold s cove under a controversial resettlement policy more than 50 years ago those passions remain raw to this day driving from the east to west coast of newfoundland one passes arnold s cove off the trans canada highway cecil penney was 16 years old when his community of tack s beach on an island in the middle of placentia bay was relocated across the water to this small town which to his eyes seemed like a megalopolis he worked his first job on the barges that transported entire houses including his family s in all more than 100 homes were transported to arnold s cove says edna penney a town councilor and historian who met her husband cecil after he relocated she recalls the population tripling while she was in elementary school from about 300 to 900 the town had to build new schools to accommodate the influx it s such a classic story of newfoundland resettlement that ms penney helped design a walking tour about the experience even though it s been more than 50 years since mr penney reluctantly left his quiet enclave the retired fisherman still tears up when he talks about tack s beach it s so peaceful he says there s no cars no nothing more home is up there it s just the way i feel resettlement is a term that politicians no longer dare utter but there remains an official community relocation policy under which residents in small towns that have become too expensive to service can vote to relocate with a government payout several communities have two years ago the town of little bay islands connected to the mainland via a 30 minute ferry ride made international news as residents left the enclave in notre dame bay off central newfoundland sara miller llana the christian science monitor route 430 known as the viking trail runs 250 miles along the coast of the great northern peninsula in newfoundland and many see hints of resettlement in an economic recovery report released this year called the the big reset to address the province s debt a paragraph in the executive summary underscores the enormity of the challenge facing the government running this sparsely populated province and maintaining its infrastructure is expensive an abundance of government run infrastructure is spread across significant geography including 259 schools over 180 health care sites 12 ferry routes 20 airstrips over 9 000 kilometres of highway 1 300 bridges 12 000 kilometres of forest access roads over 800 government buildings and structures and thousands of kilometres of electricity transmission and distribution lines all of this for a relatively small population of 522 000 people for yolande pottie sherman an associate professor in the department of geography at memorial university the report could lead to more cuts that make rural life untenable such as reducing ferry services the reality is if you do restructure ferry services that s a form of passive resettlement even if you re not saying this community should relocate says dr pottie sherman who co edited a collection of essays titled resettlement uprooting and rebuilding communities in newfoundland and labrador and beyond if you slowly remove services you undermine people s mobility justice rights their access to be able to get around and get places they re not formally resettlement policies but it s all connected the enduring resettlement talk is the inevitable outcome of demographic change consider for instance the view from jim larkin s house in a town called cook s harbour at the tip of the gnp the former fisherman turns in a circle pointing out all the empty dwellings around him nobody live in that one nobody live in that one nobody live in that one he says this used to be a real busy town after the moratorium everything went downhill now she s gone to the bottom sara miller llana the christian science monitor this used to be a real busy town after the moratorium everything went downhill now she s gone to the bottom jim larkin a former fisherman in cook s harbour newfoundland mr larkin s daughter moved away two years ago to st anthony because her son was the only teenager in the town and she wanted him to be around friends if relocation came up for a vote mr larkin says he wouldn t hesitate to move this community is pretty well finished carolyn lavers in port au choix understands that sentiment her son has left for a job as an electrician in alberta but she refuses to accept that leaving is the answer in the 1980s she was working as a hairdresser in toronto when she decided to set up a bakery as a side business to help her mother in port au choix within a few years they were baking bread for all the fishing fleets in town so she moved home to expand the business then the moratorium hit three years later oh lord have mercy it s like pluto and earth says ms lavers of the town before and after the suspension she still runs the bakery but it is now open only one day a week out of that slowdown though has come another epiphany a friend of ms lavers ms cranston the rural resilience leader asked if she could use the washing machine at ms lavers house where the bakery is located on a day when the business was closed ms cranston a physiotherapist regularly travels to see patients and wanted to use it to launder sheets this led to another idea why not open a place where all kinds of social services could be provided under one roof ms cranston had already started a similar center in norris point called the old cottage hospital it houses wellness services performance art space a public library community radio station a greenhouse and a hostel in a former rural hospital sara miller llana the christian science monitor rex boyd a former bush pilot from port au choix newfoundland built his own home and hunts moose like many residents for year round food it is now part of the great northern peninsula research collective an academic community partnership designed to foster development across the region the collective is trying to create community hubs in heritage spaces places that are historic anchors in towns says ms cranston in port au choix the group recently purchased an empty building facing the town s harbor that was once a teen hangout called the parlor they plan to turn it into the gnp community place which will offer massage physiotherapy and space for a community kitchen and events the center will be linked to one under development in st anthony which mr larkin and his neighbors in cook s harbour can access kelly vodden who supports projects in rural resilience at memorial university s grenfell campus says that fishing mostly shrimp and crab remains integral to the area but only employs a fraction of the people it once did unemployment in port au choix and the surrounding area stands at 38 many efforts are underway to boost long term sustainability such as fish cooperatives and community gardens fishing families have also pivoted to other jobs such as giving tours of viking settlements and icebergs and running whale watching trips adaptability has been key to the region s resilience the owners of the dark tickle co at the northern tip of the peninsula used to run a fishing supply shop after the moratorium and struggling to survive they noticed that tourists heading to the nearby viking settlement l anse aux meadows began asking about local wild berries such as partridge and bakeapple today the company sells wild berry teas vinegars and jams across the province i went from working on a fish wharf to working in a jam kitchen says kier knudsen who spent summers working at his grandfather s original store sara miller llana the christian science monitor i went from working on a fish wharf to working in a jam kitchen kier knudsen who lives on the northern tip of newfoundland on transitioning from the fishing industry to a tourist based business that sells jams and wild berry teas he was drawn back to newfoundland from a job in aerospace engineering in oregon because he missed the way of life ms atkins moved back home from a job in corporate strategy in toronto amid the pandemic many see new opportunities in this region as people get more comfortable living in isolated places and commuting to work by computer but before any towns can move forward they will first have to revive a spirit of community says renee pilgrim who moved back to the st anthony area from toronto last year too the founder of gnp health wellness she aims to connect it to the wellness network and offer acupuncture yoga and a meeting place for teens and elders across the region the demographic problems are not going to be solved by having space for yoga she says but for those who need emotional and community support having the space helps people feel less isolated less alone when she was growing up residents gathered regularly at the local hall or in fish storage sheds on the community wharf but over time technology and a hollowing out of public spaces have eroded a sense of fraternity these little communities and the lifestyle here is dying out says ms pilgrim the relationship with the land the sense of community and working together people are becoming more independent and less community focused jeff webb a cultural historian at memorial university says there is a lot of nostalgia for rural newfoundland and its self reliant way of life but change is inevitable it s going to transform into something else that s not something i regret that is something that happens he says could become retirement communities some might rely heavily on tourism some might evolve into something else but it s going to change it s natural and inevitable ms lavers the bakery owner thinks the change must above all come from within her town isn t going to return to boom times but she believes rural newfoundland has a chance to grow if mindsets shift and small efforts like the gnp community place move forward already more locals have been congregating in her bakery after ms atkins her goddaughter began a pop up cafe once a week that offers espresso based drinks and chia pudding to survive in a rural region you really must have a community helping one another and volunteering she says and i think it will happen because at the end of the day as much as a lot of our people go away we never stay away with a good heart the plan is always to go back home

the perfect storm is bearing down time the saying goes is nature s way of making sure that everything doesn t happen at once so now maybe we re at the event horizon where nature is suspended because everything seems to be happening at once the weeks ahead could determine whether we are a coherent society that can function on the basis of a firm consensual reality or just a collection of battling narratives designed to conceal anything that quacks like truth all veering toward failure this is a very nervous country and for a good reason the collective sense of reality has commenced a momentous shift the compass is spinning wildly things are shaking loose in the national brain pan the gaslight has lost its sheen and the once solid narrative is turning to vapor starting with the unspooling riddles of covid 19 the covid 19 engineered bioweapon is being used internationally to suppress formerly free citizens of formerly democratic republics it becomes more obvious each day that everything connected to this extravaganza is other than it appears to be the numbers don t add up starting with the fact that when you combine the official registered covid cases people with acquired natural immunity with the people who already had some kind of immunity from previous lifelong coronavirus encounters with the number of people vaccinated you have a population supposedly way beyond herd immunity who s getting sick now mostly people who are all vaxxed up a ticking time bomb contrary to the behavior and statements of public health officials and politicians the news is out that the spike proteins produced by the vax s mrna genetic reprogramming are toxic agents that create disorder in the major organs and blood vessels chiefly the vaccine is not a vaccine and it will probably end up killing more people than the covid 19 disease and its variants a lot of those deaths will be caused in the months ahead by damage to people s hearts and other organs from these spike proteins the reported official numbers are all lies of one kind or another issued by agencies primarily concerned not with public health but with covering asses at the highest level so do not trust them if you haven t had a vax shot better seriously consider steering clear of your government s desperate attempts to get the job done the news is also out despite strenuous suppression that early treatment of covid 19 with a kit of cheap drugs defeats the disease people must conclude that there is a malevolent purpose behind the suppression of early treatment they may also conclude that the vaxes are poison mandating the vaxes was an easily predicted tactical blunder did joe biden and company not realize that threatening the livelihoods of 100 million people might generate a whole lot of anger and resentment especially since those people have good reasons to believe the vax is harmful to them is fauci desperate or crazy last week an fda advisory panel ruled against distributing mrna booster shots among the general population over age 16 with exceptions for the vaguely defined high risk individuals over 65 in spite of that covid czar dr anthony fauci keeps pushing for boosters on sunday he told cnn s jake tapper we re waiting for data on natural immunity we know that if you have natural immunity and also get the shot immunity dramatically increases oh really even though it s known for sure i e established in science that natural immunity is way more potent comprehensive and permanent than anything the vaccine pretends to offer while it is becoming clear that the vaxes disable people s immune systems hence the impressive number of the vaxxed getting sick is dr fauci desperate or just plain crazy the question may be moot because it looks like he s out of running room on his whole crusade covid 19 vaxes authoritative nonsense and all the story has fallen apart it looks an awful lot like the government is trying to harm people healthwise while it destroys jobs and small business and ruins households financially and that counterstory is spreading faster now than covid 19 or maybe they re just idiots who knows it s fair to ask whether all that has destroyed the legitimacy of the people in charge but that is only one of several issues converging to detonate the people s faith in their own government bad news for biden biden had a bad week on the family grift front as the story broke first on politico and then elsewhere like a brushfire that the trove of incriminating memoranda on hunter biden s laptop was for real and that the concerted effort to hide all that muck from the voters during last year s election campaign was a completely dishonest operation add up all the memos and emails on hunter s hard drive and you have a pretty clear digital trail of a major racketeering operation that can no longer be denied so will merrick garland s doj keep ignoring it meanwhile the crisis on the u s mexican border has suddenly gotten so bad that even the mainstream media had to report on it the shantytown of haitians and other foreign nationals moiling under the freeway bridge at del rio texas grew by thousands each day to around 15 000 as of sunday joe biden owns the open border and everybody knows it and the actual citizens of the usa are getting alarmed and sore about it on sunday night the white house announced plans to fly at least 10 000 of the haitians to haiti despite the fact that most of them had been living in brazil chile and other nations before entering the usa haiti of course is the poorest country in the western hemisphere and only recently suffered a massive earthquake not to mention the assassination in july of its president does this airlift sound like a plan maybe check the no box on that u s citizens might have also registered that joe b unloaded 37 000 afghanis in five states since we bailed on that country aug 31 and plans to bring in almost 100 000 by the end of 2022 bbc all this at a time when millions of americans have lost their businesses and lost their jobs and are under threat of losing more jobs for not getting vaxxed wait there s more events are converging think this is enough to cause a national attitude adjustment china s financial system has tripped into a liquidity crisis with the insolvency of its colossal evergrande real estate ponzi coincidentally and on rather a separate track we have china s latest export to the advanced economies of the world the meltdown of its bond market as signified in the wreck of super gigantic real estate conglomerate evergrande behold the broken daisy chain of obligations stretching to the furthest reaches of global finance and the deleterious effect of that on capital markets everywhere to follow the central banks are pulling out the last stops now to prevent a general meltdown of hallucinated wealth around the world and you can probably measure the success of that last ditch effort in days as we enter the cursed month of october when skeletons dance on the graves of lost fortunes the stage managers behind joe biden look forward to that as they would to so many stakes driven through their degenerate hearts isn t this a great time for a global financial crisis maybe you re saying no not so much that d probably be a good call events are converging everything is happening at once narratives are in collapse governments may soon

ellijay ga whether its a time when you stock up and stay home or a time when you meet the coming crowds to tour the grounds two weekends in october undoubtedly change the face of gilmer county every year with the georgia apple festival except that wasn t true last year amid the pandemic the gilmer chamber has had to cancel several festivals and events over the last two years including the apple blossom festival taste of ellijay and the most popular event the georgia apple festival even as recent as spring of this year pressure from the outbreak has been felt as the chamber cancelled the 2021 apple blossom festival despite its popularity and efforts to hold the event in some form adhering to restrictions the georgia apple festival was cancelled in 2020 as the board of directors stated the difficult decision was made following the guidance of the local healthcare community after consultation with local officials and with extensive feedback from vendors volunteers and local citizens chamber president and ceo jennifer grimmer told fyn earlier this year that the chamber and those involved were working with former chamber president paige hutto on the major event as she continues along her first year with the chamber in a statement in february grimmer said i am happy to confirm that we are on track for the apple festival however rising covid numbers in positive cases over the summer months had some doubting whether the event could happen if it continued however recent weeks have seen the preparations spike and this week even saw the sign at the fairgrounds posted with the official details for the event additionally a theme has fallen on the festival this year is not just a return to the annual event but a golden year theme marks the return with the 50th georgia apple festival fyn s current understanding is that some details of the festival could be very different this year including more space among the vendors those vendors have been among main concerns of the chamber with cancellations as they have reached out for feedback and suggestions for future events and planning vendors that rely on festivals like this have been specifically hurt in the last two years as the apple festival is not the only cancellation they have suffered the chamber even noted last year that they were working with some to potentially rollover certain fees to this year in efforts to help and support the vendors that make up such a large part of the festival the event s return is right around the corner this year as it moves back into its usual dates on the second and third weekends of october as this friday is first of october that means the event starts next weekend the official dates are october 9 10 16 and 17 the festival begins at 9 a m every day and ends at 6 p m on saturdays and 5 p m on sundays with the return of the festival also comes the return of events all over gilmer county including apple arts on the downtown square and the apple festival parade as well as other supporting events like the 5k road race and the annual car show the apple festival parade will be held on october 8 this year at 6 p m however the chamber said it still needs more participants for the event the parade hosts the theme the golden year in honor of the 50th anniversary of the georgia apple festival and prizes will be awarded to the best most original participants according to the chamber the supporting events can all be found on the georgia apple festival website including the annual apple classic auto show on october 9 and the apple festival 5k road race at the ellijay elementary school on october 9 at 8 a m unfortunately the 2021 ellijay apple queen pageant will not rejoin the events this year additionally the gilmer chamber is still in need of volunteers to help with the operations and are asking people to contact them to volunteer
washington sept 29 reuters president joe biden s agenda was at risk of being derailed by divisions among his own democrats as moderates voiced anger on wednesday at the idea of delaying a 1 trillion infrastructure bill ahead of a critical vote to avert a government shutdown the white house said talks over twin bills that would revitalize the nation s roads and airports and fund social programs and climate change measures were at a precarious point as moderates and progressives disagreed over the scope of some 4 trillion in spending congress which democrats control by a razor thin margin is due to vote on a bipartisan resolution to fund federal operations through early december before funding expires at midnight on thursday the house of representatives is expected to vote on thursday on a 1 trillion infrastructure bill already passed by the senate although some party leaders warned that vote could be delayed again which would dismay moderates representative stephanie murphy a moderate democrat who backs the infrastructure bill warned against defeat or delay of the legislation advertisement if the vote were to fail tomorrow or be delayed there would be a significant breach of trust that would slow the momentum in moving forward in delivering the biden agenda she told reporters on wednesday with house progressives warning they will vote against the infrastructure bill until a deal is reached on the separate multitrillion dollar plan focused on social spending and climate the vote was not guaranteed the only way the vote happens thursday is if we have the votes to pass the bill representative dan kildee house democrats chief deputy whip told reporters white house huddle house speaker nancy pelosi and senate majority leader chuck schumer went to the white house on wednesday afternoon to meet biden a former senator himself who canceled a trip to chicago to lead negotiations with congress we re obviously at a precarious and important time white house press secretary jen psaki said on wednesday a white house staffer met at the capitol with moderate democratic senator kyrsten sinema who has expressed deep concern over the size of biden s plans and has the power to block them due to the democrats narrow control of the senate if the resolution to fund the government passes the senate the house could vote quickly to send the measure to biden to sign into law averting a partial government shutdown in the midst of a national health crisis biden s democrats campaigned on a platform of responsible government after republican donald trump s turbulent four years in office republican senator john cornyn expressed optimism on wednesday advertisement democrats don t want to shut down the government republicans don t want to shut down the government that will supply the result that we all expect which is to keep the lights on he told a news conference senate democrats have tried to pass legislation that both funds the government and heads off a potentially catastrophic federal government default by raising the nation s 28 4 trillion debt ceiling but they have been thwarted by republicans who want democrats to use a parliamentary maneuver to act alone on the debt limit issue the government will hit the ceiling around oct 18 an event that could cause a historic default with long lasting economic fallout and implications for financial markets schumer has demanded bipartisan cooperation on the issue arguing that it addresses debts racked up during both democratic and republican administrations the house passed a bill on wednesday suspending the limit through december 2022 by a mostly partisan vote it now goes to the senate where it is expected to be blocked by republicans again investment bank goldman sachs this month described the standoff as the riskiest debt limit deadline in a decade reconciliation several senior democrats have said the 3 5 trillion reconciliation bill so called because it is being drawn up under a budgetary procedure to avoid senate rules requiring 60 votes out of 100 members for passage will need to be scaled back to pass moderate democratic senator joe manchin said he believed it would take weeks to reach agreement advertisement i cannot and will not support trillions in spending or an all or nothing approach that ignores the brutal fiscal reality our nation faces he said in a lengthy statement late on wednesday afternoon there is a better way and i believe we can find it if we are willing to continue to negotiate in good faith he did not say however what he could support house democrats urged manchin and sinema to say publicly what they want they need to come up with their counteroffer and then we sit down and negotiate from there said representative pramila jayapal

article senate republicans voted unanimously on monday to block a bill that would suspend the debt ceiling until december 2022 with the deadline for funding the federal government just days away unless democrats find a way to address the debt limit the government will shut down and be unable to meet its financial obligations by oct 18 treasury secretary janet yellen wrote in a letter delivered to congress following the vote gop lawmakers led by senate minority leader mitch mcconnell wouldn t support the bill because they disapprove of the biden administration s economic agenda that would increase taxes on the wealthy and fund new spending on child care health care and infrastructure during the trump administration the debt limit was suspended three separate times according to treasury secretary janet yellen the most recent suspension was passed on a bipartisan basis in 2019 it expired in june 2021 the vast majority of the debt currently subject to the debt limit was accrued before president biden took office failure to raise debt ceiling may delay social security child tax credits if congress fails to address the debt limit and the government goes into default for the first time in history it would cause catastrophic damage to the country s credit rating yellen wrote in a recent op ed for the wall street journal this could send financial markets into a tailspin that may lead to an economic recession unless the issue is resolved failure to raise or suspend the debt ceiling could also lead to delays in social security and child tax credit checks this

advertisement from paints to plastics a chemical shortage ignites prices share copy link copy in an economy upended by the coronavirus shortages and price spikes have hit everything from lumber to computer chips not even toilet paper escaped now they re cutting into one of the humblest yet most vital links in the global manufacturing supply chain the plastic pellets that go into a vast universe of products ranging from cereal bags to medical devices automotive interiors to bicycle helmets like other manufacturers petrochemical companies have been shaken by the pandemic and by how consumers and businesses responded to it yet petrochemicals which are made from oil have also run into problems all their own one after another a freak winter freeze in texas a lightning strike in louisiana hurricanes along the gulf coast all have conspired to disrupt production and raise prices there isn t one thing wrong said jeremy pafford managing editor for the americas at independent commodity intelligence services icis which analyzes energy and chemical markets it s kind of whack a mole something goes wrong it gets sorted out then something else happens and it s been that way since the pandemic began the price of polyvinyl chloride or pvc used for pipes medical devices credit cards vinyl records and more has rocketed 70 the price of epoxy resins used for coatings adhesives and paints has soared 170 ethylene arguably the world s most important chemical used in everything from food packaging to antifreeze to polyester has surged 43 according to icis figures the root of the problem has become a familiar one in the 18 months since the pandemic ignited a brief but brutal recession as the economy sank into near paralysis petrochemical producers like manufacturers of all types slashed production so they were caught flat footed when the unexpected happened the economy swiftly bounced back and consumers flush with cash from government relief aid and stockpiles of savings resumed spending with astonishing speed and vigor suddenly companies were scrambling to acquire raw materials and parts to meet surging orders panic buying worsened the shortages as companies rushed to stock up while they could it s such a bizarre scenario said hassan ahmed a chemicals analyst with alembic global advisors a research firm inventories are lean and supply is low demand will exceed supply growth against the backdrop of tight supplies and surging demand came a series of events that struck pafford as murphy s law in action anything that could go wrong did in 2020 hurricanes laura and zeta pounded louisiana a hub of petrochemical production then in february a winter storm hit texas with its many oil refining and chemical manufacturing facilities millions of households and businesses including the chemical plants lost power and heat pipes froze more than 100 people died a july lightning strike temporarily shut down a plant in lake charles louisiana that makes polypropylene used in consumer packaging and auto manufacturing the industry was just beginning to recover when hurricane ida struck the gulf coast in august once again damaging refineries and chemical plants as if that weren t enough tropical storm nicholas caused flooding some of these downstream petrochemical plants in the gulf coast regions are still shut down from hurricane ida said bridgette budhlall a professor of plastics engineering at the university of massachusetts lowell anything related to base chemicals they ve had a hell of a year said tom derry ceo of the institute for supply management an association of purchasing managers it s been the hardest year for logistics and supply chain managers pafford said they always say the most stressful job in the world is being an air traffic controller at any airport i d venture to say that being a supply chain manager is that or worse this year ford motor co hampered by an industrywide shortage of computer chips is now running short of other parts too some of them based on petrochemicals i think we should expect as business leaders to continue to have supply chain challenges for the foreseeable future ceo jim farley said in an interview with the associated press the shortages are slowing production at two leading paint makers sherwin williams and ppg both have raised prices and downgraded their sales guidance saying the outlook for additional supply remains dim though sherwin williams reported strong second quarter profits it said that a lack of raw materials cut sales by 3 5 for the period ceo john morikis said sherwin williams raised prices in the americas by 7 in august and an additional 4 this month more increases are possible next year he said the chemical shortages combined with a near doubling of oil prices in the past year to 75 a barrel of u s benchmark crude mean higher prices for many goods the consumer is going to have to pay said bill selesky a chemicals analyst for argus research who suggested that many households armed with cash from government aid and built up savings will be willing to pay higher prices in the meantime the supply problem isn t getting any better a w s jenks son hardware store in washington d c is receiving only 20 to 30 of the paint it needs to meet customer demand without backordering in normal times that rate usually runs 90 says billy wommack the purchasing director nobody s happy about it wommack said there are a lot of i m sorrys out there the shortage is generally felt most by big contractors that need say the same colored paint for numerous apartment complexes and other major projects individual homeowners can typically be more flexible duval paint decorating with three stores in the jacksonville florida area is scrambling to fill orders especially for big contractors who need a lot of paint said john cornell a sales clerk who orders paint for the stores we re struggling cornell said sometimes you have to grab products and sit on them for weeks or months so that when the job starts we have it andrew moore a clerk at ricciardi brothers in philadelphia said the store has been running short of lower grade paints that large contractors use though here s ample supply of higher grades demand is so high that the store is having a record year with sales up 20 over last year prices are up as high as 15 for some brands moore said the problems in the petrochemical supply chain have been compounded by shortages of labor and shipping containers and by overwhelmed ports some asian ports have been shut down by covid 19 outbreaks in the united states ports like the one in long beach california are struggling with backlogs of ships waiting to be unloaded i think this is going to go on for a really long time because there are so many factors at play here said kaitlin wowak a management professor at the university of notre dame and it s across the board in so many products it s also forcing manufacturers to rethink some of their practices for decades companies moved production to china to capitalize on lower labor costs they also held down expenses by keeping inventories to a minimum using a just in time strategy they bought materials only as needed to fill orders but as the recession and recovery showed keeping inventories threadbare carries risk supply chains have changed forever said bindiya vakil ceo of the supply chain consultancy resilinc the old management philosophy she said was to get everything to the lowest possible price point what we are dealing with right now is a consequence of those decisions companies have lost hundreds of millions in some cases billions of dollars in profits because of that because their supply chains failed the petrochemical experience vakil said will teach companies to monitor the lowliest links in their supply chains it s always easier she said to track only the big ticket items engines say or electronics but simple plastics are vital too imagine trying to market breakfast cereal without a cheap plastic bag to hold corn flakes or wheat bran you can t just dump the cereal into the cardboard and ship it vakil says the plastic bag is just as critical an ingredient as the actual product and the cardboard and everything else but supply chain practitioners traditionally have not considered it to be just as critical and nowadays plastics are ubiquitous analysts expect the petrochemical crunch to last well into 2022 you really have to put covid truly in the rearview mirror for this logistics situation to normalize pafford said you can t simply just throw more ships and more containers on the water we ve got to get them loaded if ports are going to be shut down because of a covid lockdown good luck ___wiseman reported from washington

missing moon rock from apollo 17 mission back in louisiana original publication date september 29 2021 10 41 am baton rouge la ap louisiana has recovered a missing lunar rock gifted to the state to commemorate the last manned u s mission to the moon after it turned up in the hands of a man who recycles wooden plaques the rock from the 1972 apollo 17 landing was in the possession of the louisiana state museum on tuesday the advocate of baton rouge reported it was returned to the state late last year by a florida man who planned to use wood from the plaque that held it to repair a gun according to the newspaper but the recovery was not revealed until monday when a journalist and space historian robert pearlman reported it in the online publication collectspace the advocate said as you can appreciate i m just happy that it is here now museum interim director steven maklansky said the lunar fragment was one of hundreds presented to states territories and foreign nations in the early to mid 1970s by the administration of former president richard nixon they include samples taken by neil armstrong and the apollo 11 crew during the first moon landing in 1969 but many of them later went missing louisiana also had an apollo 11 rock that was thought to be missing but the advocate discovered it was in storage at the louisiana art and science museum how or when the apollo 17 rock went missing is not clear it is encased in an acrylic ball that is attached to a wooden plaque with a miniature replica of the state flag and inscriptions the florida man who discovered it told pearlman he likely bought the plaque at a garage sale at some point in the past 15 years he had been gathering old plaques to use the wood to refurbish the stocks on his guns and had recently discovered this one in his collection pearlman said the man did not want to be identified maklansky said the museum still plans to review its authenticity but officials haven t decided what steps they will take

listen to this article listen to this article in an economy upended by the coronavirus shortages and price spikes have hit everything from lumber to computer chips not even toilet paper escaped now they re cutting into one of the humblest yet most vital links in the global manufacturing supply chain the plastic pellets that go into a vast universe of products ranging from cereal bags to medical devices automotive interiors to bicycle helmets like other manufacturers petrochemical companies have been shaken by the pandemic and by how consumers and businesses responded to it yet petrochemicals which are made from oil have also run into problems all their own one after another a freak winter freeze in texas a lightning strike in louisiana hurricanes along the gulf coast all have conspired to disrupt production and raise prices there isn t one thing wrong said jeremy pafford managing editor for the americas at independent commodity intelligence services icis which analyzes energy and chemical markets it s kind of whack a mole something goes wrong it gets sorted out then something else happens and it s been that way since the pandemic began the price of polyvinyl chloride or pvc used for pipes medical devices credit cards vinyl records and more has rocketed 70 the price of epoxy resins used for coatings adhesives and paints has soared 170 ethylene arguably the world s most important chemical used in everything from food packaging to antifreeze to polyester has surged 43 according to icis figures the root of the problem has become a familiar one in the 18 months since the pandemic ignited a brief but brutal recession as the economy sank into near paralysis petrochemical producers like manufacturers of all types slashed production so they were caught flat footed when the unexpected happened the economy swiftly bounced back and consumers flush with cash from government relief aid and stockpiles of savings resumed spending with astonishing speed and vigor suddenly companies were scrambling to acquire raw materials and parts to meet surging orders panic buying worsened the shortages as companies rushed to stock up while they could it s such a bizarre scenario said hassan ahmed a chemicals analyst with alembic global advisors a research firm inventories are lean and supply is low demand will exceed supply growth against the backdrop of tight supplies and surging demand came a series of events that struck pafford as murphy s law in action anything that could go wrong did in 2020 hurricanes laura and zeta pounded louisiana a hub of petrochemical production then in february a winter storm hit texas with its many oil refining and chemical manufacturing facilities millions of households and businesses including the chemical plants lost power and heat pipes froze more than 100 people died a july lightning strike temporarily shut down a plant in lake charles louisiana that makes polypropylene used in consumer packaging and auto manufacturing the industry was just beginning to recover when hurricane ida struck the gulf coast in august once again damaging refineries and chemical plants as if that weren t enough tropical storm nicholas caused flooding some of these downstream petrochemical plants in the gulf coast regions are still shut down from hurricane ida said bridgette budhlall a professor of plastics engineering at the university of massachusetts lowell anything related to base chemicals they ve had a hell of a year said tom derry ceo of the institute for supply management an association of purchasing managers it s been the hardest year for logistics and supply chain managers pafford said they always say the most stressful job in the world is being an air traffic controller at any airport i d venture to say that being a supply chain manager is that or worse this year ford motor co hampered by an industry wide shortage of computer chips is now running short of other parts too some of them based on petrochemicals i think we should expect as business leaders to continue to have supply chain challenges for the foreseeable future ceo jim farley said in an interview with the associated press the shortages are slowing production at two leading paint makers sherwin williams and ppg both have raised prices and downgraded their sales guidance saying the outlook for additional supply remains dim though sherwin williams reported strong second quarter profits it said that a lack of raw materials cut sales by 3 5 for the period ceo john morikis said sherwin williams raised prices in the americas by 7 in august and an additional 4 this month more increases are possible next year he said the chemical shortages combined with a near doubling of oil prices in the past year to 75 a barrel of u s benchmark crude mean higher prices for many goods the consumer is going to have to pay said bill selesky a chemicals analyst for argus research who suggested that many households armed with cash from government aid and built up savings will be willing to pay higher prices in the meantime the supply problem isn t getting any better a w s jenks son hardware store in washington d c is receiving only 20 to 30 of the paint it needs to meet customer demand without backordering in normal times that rate usually runs 90 says billy wommack the purchasing director nobody s happy about it wommack said there are a lot of i m sorrys out there the shortage is generally felt most by big contractors that need say the same colored paint for numerous apartment complexes and other major projects individual homeowners can typically be more flexible duval paint decorating with three stores in the jacksonville florida area is scrambling to fill orders especially for big contractors who need a lot of paint said john cornell a sales clerk who orders paint for the stores we re struggling cornell said sometimes you have to grab products and sit on them for weeks or months so that when the job starts we have it andrew moore a clerk at ricciardi brothers in philadelphia said the store has been running short of lower grade paints that large contractors use though here s ample supply of higher grades demand is so high that the store is having a record year with sales up 20 over last year prices are up as high as 15 for some brands moore said the problems in the petrochemical supply chain have been compounded by shortages of labor and shipping containers and by overwhelmed ports some asian ports have been shut down by covid 19 outbreaks in the united states ports like the one in long beach california are struggling with backlogs of ships waiting to be unloaded i think this is going to go on for a really long time because there are so many factors at play here said kaitlin wowak a management professor at the university of notre dame and it s across the board in so many products it s also forcing manufacturers to rethink some of their practices for decades companies moved production to china to capitalize on lower labor costs they also held down expenses by keeping inventories to a minimum using a just in time strategy they bought materials only as needed to fill orders but as the recession and recovery showed keeping inventories threadbare carries risk supply chains have changed forever said bindiya vakil ceo of the supply chain consultancy resilinc the old management philosophy she said was to get everything to the lowest possible price point what we are dealing with right now is a consequence of those decisions companies have lost hundreds of millions in some cases billions of dollars in forgone profits because of that because their supply chains failed the petrochemical experience vakil said will teach companies to monitor the lowliest links in their supply chains it s always easier she said to track only the big ticket items engines say or electronics but simple plastics are vital too imagine trying to market breakfast cereal without a cheap plastic bag to hold corn flakes or wheat bran you can t just dump the cereal into the cardboard and ship it vakil says the plastic bag is just as critical an ingredient as the actual product and the cardboard and everything else but supply chain practitioners traditionally have not considered it to be just as critical and nowadays plastics are ubiquitous analysts expect the petrochemical crunch to last well into 2022 you really have to put covid truly in the rearview mirror for this logistics situation to normalize pafford said you can t simply just throw more ships and more containers on the water we ve got to get them loaded if ports are going to be shut down because of a covid lockdown good luck like this article gain access to all of our great content with a month to

principal investigator of the study tenured director of guangdong provincial people s hospital and honorary director of guangdong lung cancer institute stated kras is the most common ras protein subtype with a high mutation rate in non small cell lung cancer pancreatic cancer colorectal cancer and other cancer cells preclinical data showed that ibi351 is sufficiently differentiated from competitors already or about to enter the clinic and we look forward to positive results in the safety tolerability and efficacy data of ibi351 we will also continue to explore the application of precision therapy and potential combination therapy to benefit more cancer patients with kras g12c mutations dr hui zhou senior vice president of innovent stated kras g12c is one of the most commonly mutated oncogenes in human cancer and was well known as a non druggable target at present there are limited clinical treatments for this mutation and there is a great unmet clinical need we are pleased that the first patient has already received the first dose of ibi351 and this is an important milestone for the clinical development of ibi351 in china based on preclinical data we hope that

letters to the editor the health services district gives emergency services back to our community it s just the way we ve always done it how many times have you heard this phrase in your personal life or maybe at your job we ve all heard it while change is scary it s inevitable embracing change ensures forward mobility my name is nichole becker and i m running for the proposed health services district board i m a current resident of dinosaur and moved here after my husband accepted a marshall position with the town this is my community i have a long history with emergency services having spent time on patrol as an emt and a dispatch supervisor the proposed health services district would bring long awaited expeditious emergency care to a community that for 10 plus years was forgotten by the county seat currently our services are graciously provided by gold cross out of jensen in utah this is a 45 minute minimum response time for an ambulance service who are already beholden to their own community and over taxed we shouldn t be spreading the burden of supporting our citizens onto our neighboring state this is our responsibility by voting yes on 6a and 6b you are saying yes to an ambulance service run by a local board made up of members of the public who are passionate about their communities you are saying yes to training and paying community members to staff local ambulances allowing for quicker response times and monies returning to the communities dinosaur recently held a community meeting with the task force questions and concerns were brought forth and answers were given my opinion on the outcome of that meeting was that the citizens of dinosaur want access to local emergency medical services the reality is the hospital no longer has the funding available to maintain an ambulance service while other communities may think they are sitting pretty with their funding from the county every year i d ask you if this proposal doesn t go forward and you have to share that funding what then we have to find a better alternative one that works for the entire county not just the squeaky wheels this plan isn t perfect and this board will have their work cut out for them i m prepared to do that work and bring a voice to my community who has been quietly neglected for too long please vote yes on 6a and 6b with me on nov 2 nichole becker dinosaur a word from the yampa valley adventure center project leader we all know our community s near term challenge of losing approximately 1 000 primary energy jobs from the scheduled closing of coal power plants and mines in the yampa valley this would be like denver losing approximately 100 000 jobs i support efforts to help lead our community into a future of our own choosing a future of a strong and growing local economy full of life s opportunities and joys for our youth middle aged and senior citizens the editorial board s words and vision in recent editorials align with my wife s and my motivation for developing the yampa valley adventure center yvac and colorado great outdoors experience museum hall of fame cgoe as all of us do my wife kerry and i asked each other what can we do to help our community part of the conservation revolved around asking ourselves where we want to retire we want to retire to a community that has wonderful people that help look after one another a community that has a positive can do attitude a community that has the opportunity to have a strong growing and diversified economy a community with cultural educational and outdoor adventure opportunities for all segments of the population a community with great health care a community that has sidewalks and bike paths a community that has a clean environment a community with well kept homes with beautifully landscaped lawns a community with friendly locally owned businesses that take pride in their merchandising displays their store appearance and helping their friends and neighbors after we completed our list we concluded we have most of that here right now we love craig we have lived here for 33 years we love living here and want to continue at least another 33 years we concluded we could help enrich our community by fixing up a nearly vacant old mall that is in a state of disrepair create jobs create business opportunities and help diversify our economy my dear fellow craig and moffat county residents that is our motivation pure and simple i want to thank the community for the overwhelming appreciation and support we are getting from the vast majority of our community and also address the misinformed who propose no positive options or alternatives and who have posted negative comments on the craig press facebook page about the project the yvac and cgoe project is placing approximately 10 000 000 of tax increment financing dollars into the hands of the craig urban renewal authority cura for the public good of blight removal job creation business creation and local economic development and diversification stated another way without this project or any other developers offering alternate projects there are no tif dollars created or available to invest in our community the private placement bond we are seeking from the bond market that will secure the financing for a local bank loan is just that it is not a bond issued by cura all current leases are being honored in my entire life i have never told anybody to go pound sand i am a devout christian and member of the church of jesus christ of latter day saints and i would never defame the name of god my projects websites are and which list my cell number and my email for anyone who cares to contact me and have an honest conservation i am doing a public facebook broadcast this thursday sept 30 from 6 30 pm to 7 15 pm i ll be reviewing the concept and details involved in this project the link can be found on our yampa valley adventure center facebook page with respect frank moe

ways that we as humans build trust with one another the human brand relationship isn t any different brand awareness creates association when you ve had a paper cut i bet you ve put on a band aid when you had a pressing question i m sure you ve googled it when you needed to make a few copies i m guessing that you xeroxed them and when you ve packed for a nice picnic i m willing to bet you grabbed a coke to drink am i correct most likely but notice how some of the words above are capitalized these are brands not nouns or verbs speaking in brand less terms band aid should be referred to as a bandage google as a search engine and xerox as a copier but it s more fun to refer to the brand itself even if we aren t using their specific product that s what brand awareness does it associates actions and products with particular brands subconsciously encouraging us to replace common words with branded terms and before you know it simple paper cuts or picnics are doing the marketing for us brand awareness builds brand equity brand equity describes a brand s value which is determined by consumer experiences with and overall perception of the brand positive experiences and perception equal positive brand equity and the same goes for negative notions here are a few valuable things that come from positive brand equity higher prices due to higher perceived value a higher stock price the ability to expand business through product or service line extensions greater social impact due to brand name value how does a brand establish and increase brand equity by building brand awareness

about hobbies passions likes and dislikes and more i also pay attention to how they speak what they like to talk about and what stuff gets them excited these are the traits your brand should determine and promote about itself to leave an impact with your audience you ve got to define yourself as more than a company that sells stuff how else would you define yourself what words would you use if you had to introduce your brand to a new friend 2 socialize introvert or extrovert outgoing or quiet all humans benefit from social contact and spending time with one another it s how we stay connected learn new things and become known by others the same goes for your brand if you only attempt to connect with others when trying to make a sale or get support you won t be known as anything beyond a business with a singular intention and the same goes for a person to raise awareness of your brand you ve got to be social post on social media about things unrelated to your product or services interact with your audience by asking questions commenting on posts or retweeting or sharing content you like treat your social accounts as if you were a person trying to make friends not a business trying to make money research shows that over 50 of brand reputation comes from online sociability being social leads to greater awareness and simply being known 3 tell a narrative storytelling is an incredibly powerful marketing tactic whether you re marketing products or promoting your brand why because it gives something real for your audience to latch onto crafting a narrative around your brand humanizes it and gives it depth and weaving this said narrative into your marketing inherently markets your brand alongside your products or services what should your narrative be about anything as long as it s true it can be the narrative of your founder the tale of how your business had its first product idea or the little engine that could story of how your small business made it in this big world people like hearing stories about each other authenticity is impactful and it can lead to a big boost in brand awareness 4 make sharing easy whatever your industry product offering or marketing strategies make it easy for your audience to share your content this could be blog posts sponsored content videos social media posts or product pages it doesn t matter what it is as long as it s shareable word of mouth marketing is the most effective way to establish trust and familiarity among customers if someone sees that a friend or family member is recommending a product or service they ll take notice of that product and brand is this a brand worth exploring do they have other great products i can rely on what are their social accounts like and what do they talk about if you make it easy to post about your stuff consumers will raise brand awareness for you by simply clicking share brand awareness is about impact it s about interacting with your audience in ways that don t only ask for money participation or loyalty imagine if you met a new person who wanted to be your friend if they asked for any of the above you d probably laugh and walk away right not only is that a shallow approach to friendship but it also leaves no lasting impact on you the same goes for establishing and building brand awareness among your audience brand awareness strategy guest blog on other niche websites try co marketing advertise everywhere hire a face or create a mascot for the company choose an image or symbol that represents you create a short catchy slogan you already know how to start building your brand awareness from the ground up now it s time to put together a simple yet powerful brand awareness strategy that will keep the flywheel turning 1 guest blog on other niche websites guest blogging is one of the best ways to increase brand awareness with minimal effort you can take advantage of the traffic that s already arriving at another website to get more eyes on your brand while offering helpful and relevant content in other words you re not just pushing out your product on people who aren t ready to buy but rather writing in your brand voice and presenting yourself as human first company second another great alternative to guest blogging would be publishing sponsored content on niche websites we re committed to your privacy hubspot uses the information

time access now 2 try co marketing co marketing is an excellent way to build brand awareness not only because you d be taking advantage of another brand s audience but because it can highlight who you are and what you offer in the marketplace for instance if your company sells dog leashes and toys you could potentially partner with a dog walking app the campaign itself could appear in any number of ways you could create a shared offer download the app and get one free leash or host an instagram live together no matter what partnering up with another brand could help you double and even triple your reach 3 advertise everywhere i know i know advertising may not build brand awareness so much as it builds product awareness but still it s one of the best tools you can use to get people to find out about your brand in a low touch unobtrusive way consider grammarly it feels like just a few years ago no one knew about grammarly now it s one of those brands that you automatically think of when you consider online proofreading software that s because they ve launched robust social video and display advertising campaigns that appear nearly everywhere you might consider starting with online advertising which includes paid social media and ppc if you re interested in truly appearing everywhere and launching more sophisticated campaigns at a mass scale you can launch programmatic advertising campaigns 4 hire a face or create a mascot for the company this may not be doable for smaller companies but if you do have the budget consider hiring an actor or spokesperson to represent the company what do you first think of when you think of progressive flo who s even been termed progressive girl for her fun and friendly personality this allows you to not only humanize your brand as mentioned in the previous section but give a sense of the friendly and knowledgeable service customers can expect to receive you don t have to use a person either geico is a great example of this the moment you see that friendly lizard you know it s geico creating an animated mascot may be a cost efficient but equally effective way to give a face to your brand 5 choose an image or symbol that represents you nike is not even nike anymore it s a check mark the moment you see that check mark you know it s nike or how about mcdonald s yello m or apple s bitten apple i m not just talking about a logo either though it can certainly be part of your logo but work with your branding team or a freelance graphic designer to create a symbol that you ubiquitously use in your marketing advertising and organic campaigns you might also consider taking a note from apple mcdonald s and nike and incorporating the symbol into your product packaging and design 6 create a short catchy slogan extending the nike example you think of the brand immediately when you hear just do it creating a short motto or slogan is a cornerstone of a strong brand awareness strategy and is an easy and simple way to increase brand awareness it s definitely tough imagine condensing everything you re about in one short sentence it must explain how you re different what you offer and why customers should choose you consider hubspot s tagline helping millions grow better in four simple words you understand why our product should be your choice when considering marketing automation tools learn how to write an effective business slogan with this free guide how to increase brand awareness offer freemium create free content sponsor events give your brand a personality produce a podcast your brand awareness is now effectively off the ground and people talk about you without needing to see an ad what about expanding your established brand awareness and building on that strong foundation what can you do as a brand to campaign for awareness and constantly increase it here are a few campaign ideas to boost your brand awareness beyond your initial strategy 1 offer freemium freemium is a business model that offers a basic product or product line for free only charging for any products deemed premium or enterprise level it s a popular pricing strategy for software companies like hubspot and trello offering a freemium option allows customers to get a taste of your brand and product before making a purchase it s a try before you buy opportunity that can technically last forever as opposed to a free trial period that some companies choose it s common to offer a freemium option with the condition that the brand s watermark will be shown on any public facing parts of the product or service this makes freemium a win win situation the consumer gets the product for free and the brand gets free advertising when consumers use it typeform is another great example of this typeform offers a freemium option of its survey software but customers must include a thank you page that features the typeform logo and message image source depending on your type of business and product offer freemium may be the best way to raise awareness of your brand among your audience 2 create free content nowadays creating content is easier than ever which is a good thing because today s consumers turn to the internet for any and all questions concerns and diy projects content is a fun way to raise awareness of your brand because it s the easiest way to show personality and share opinions and positioning on issues two major components that personify and humanize your brand content doesn t have to be in written form either you can also create videos infographics podcasts which we ll cover below and more sure written content like blogs and downloadable guides are arguably the easiest but they re definitely not the only option content doesn t have to live on just your website either guest posting and sponsored content provide opportunities to get in front of new audiences and diversify the type of content you create if your brand isn t creating content you might be missing out on some major brand awareness opportunities content provides an amazing way to authentically connect with your audience while getting your brand name in front of people 3 sponsor events how many festivals concerts fairs and exhibitions have you attended these types of events are typically not possible without the help of brand sponsorships take a look at a t shirt koozie or string backpack you likely grabbed from the event see any brand names sponsoring events is a surefire way to get your brand in front of hundreds thousands or millions of people that likely fall into your target audience from banners to flyers to water bottles your brand name will be everywhere if you sponsor an event sponsoring an event also allows you to pin your brand name on an event that matches your personality interests and passions meaning consumers will then associate your brand with that event and its aesthetic and character it can also help your company build brand awareness among highly specialized and qualified audiences professionals don t attend events just for fun they attend to learn the latest developments in the industry it s more than just being a booth in a sea of booths by being a consistent event sponsor you ll cement yourself in attendees minds as a leader in the field the key is to be consistent in your sponsorship consider red bull red bull is an energy drink and without any brand awareness efforts we d simply consider it an energy drink but thankfully red bull took their marketing to the extreme literally by consistently sponsoring extreme sporting events like cliff diving and motocross they also sponsor athletes now we inherently associate red bull with daring and adventurous and believe that if we drink it we can be the same image source 4 give your brand a personality treating your brand as a person and defining your narrative are the first steps to giving your brand a personality the next step would be infusing this personality into your marketing efforts when you market your products and services with personality you can t help but boost your brand awareness because your brand will shine right through sure your consumers will take note of the pants or pasta you re marketing but they ll also experience your personality through your advertising this is a great strategy when mixing your traditional marketing campaigns with brand awareness campaigns they don t always have to be one in the same but they definitely can be consider old spice did you just picture the man on the horse i did their advertisements for their hygiene products are overflowing with personality and humor and they still mention their products throughout the advertisement not only makes an impact on its viewers but a mere mention of the old spice man also sends consumers back to youtube to watch the commercial and to the store to buy some deodorant the commercial below is old but still generates comments about the effectiveness of the campaign on youtube to this day 5 produce a podcast more than one third of americans 12 and older listen to podcasts regularly there s no doubt podcasts play an important role in our lives and marketing efforts podcasts used to be a complicated process only created by those with a studio and fancy microphone now it s easier than ever to create and release a podcast and doing so can do wonders for your brand awareness efforts why because podcasts like written or visual content provide a way to connect with your audience authentically instead of blatantly promoting your product or service which we ve agreed isn t the best way to go about boosting brand awareness podcasts give you the opportunity to educate inform entertain or advise your audience and build trust by doing so here are some examples of great podcasts produced by brands you know and love see how these brands have chosen podcast topics that relate to their 1 overall brand message and 2 products or services doing this helps them relate the podcast back to their brand and continue to raise awareness too building and growing brand awareness is a never ending process just as maintaining a friendship or relationship never really ends boosting your brand awareness through campaigns gives you a chance to dabble in marketing and advertising opportunities you d otherwise not invest in meaning new powerful ways to connect with your audience how to measure brand awareness brand awareness is measured using a combination of quantitative and qualitative metrics to see how well your marketing efforts are working over time how do you know if your brand awareness efforts are working how do you know if you need to change direction top the competition or fix a crisis just like any other marketing metric you measure it wait i thought you said brand awareness couldn t be measured aha you ve been listening i appreciate that you re right brand awareness can t be measured in the traditional sense but you can still review activities and metrics that ll help you gauge where your brand stands in terms of popularity and consumer awareness next we ll review few ways to gauge your brand awareness and learn where you can tweak your efforts 6 ways to measure brand awareness the methods for measuring brand awareness fall into two categories quantitative and qualitative quantitative methods use numerical data to determine growth while qualitative methods measure subjective value quantitative brand awareness measures these numbers can help you paint the overall picture of your brand awareness to measure quantitatively check out these metrics 1 direct traffic firstly direct traffic is the result of people intentionally typing in your url and visiting your website your direct traffic number will tell you how much your marketing is prompting people to visit your website this is an important metric as many consumers today discover brands through social media advertisements or by typing in keywords related to your brand or product when consumers go directly to your site it means they were aware of your brand beforehand 2 site traffic numbers this number just reflects overall site traffic which will tell you how much of the general internet population is checking out your content and spending time with your brand it won t quite tell you where people came from but that doesn t matter because they re aware of your brand enough to check it out 3 social engagement engagement can refer to followers likes retweets comments and more it s a reflection of how many people are aware of your brand and socialize with it as well as how impactful your content is for instance sites like sparktoro can give you a specific score for your twitter impact qualitative brand awareness measures this step is where your brand awareness score gets a little murky but these tactics can still help you gauge who and how many people are aware of your brand to measure qualitatively try 1 searching google and setting up google alerts doing this gets you up to speed with how your brand is being talked about online it will alert you to any news or mentions by third party press as your brand grows its internet real estate will expand beyond your website so keep an eye on that 2 social listening social listening is monitoring social media management tools for organic mentions and engagement who s tagging your brand mentioning it in comments or using your hashtag in their posts these tools can help you discover that and the more your audience is discussing your brand on social media the more they re aware of it 3 running brand awareness surveys this process involves getting direct feedback from your customers and audience and can be incredibly helpful with not only understanding who knows of your brand but also what they think of it you can release surveys through surveymonkey or typeform and share them on social media or directly with your customers this guide will help you create and promote them these quantitative and qualitative metrics will help you understand your brand awareness among your audience and the general public it ll never be a perfect number but keeping your pulse on this measure will help influence campaigns and stay connected to your audience regardless of how you gauge brand awareness for your company avoid these common mistakes when measuring brand awareness brand awareness examples not sure what a brand awareness campaign can look like let s take a look at some top examples hubfans is a brand awareness campaign that rewards avid and knowledgeable hubspot users for spreading their knowledge about the crm platform it s a brilliant campaign because awareness is built not by the hubspot brand but by hubspot customers that automatically makes the brand seem more approachable and human in the same way you can get your customers to advocate for you by rewarding them if they share knowledge about your product this will make it easier to build an army of brand evangelists who will effortlessly scale your brand awareness efforts image source we all know of companies that release new gadgets and features to keep their product lines up to date but none come to apple s level of fame and that s because apple hosts an entire event dedicated to announcing its new releases even though the updates to the actual products are minimal apple has hyped up the event to such a degree that you know automatically to watch for the brand s new developments that keeps the brand at the forefront of customers minds when they re considering a new tech gadget image source having an admirable mission at the core of your company is a great move for building brand awareness especially if you enable your customers to share resources that can help others that s what rare beauty did with its mental health 101 initiative it built a kit that people could share on their social media sites to build awareness about the importance of mental health by sharing the brand s kit users are also sharing the brand itself which is an excellent way to build brand awareness image source coca cola doesn t need more brand awareness and that s because it has built it so effectively over time that it has reached iconic status one such example is its share a coke campaign where you can find a coke bottle with your name in store or personalize one with a phrase this is a brilliant brand awareness move that capitalizes on customers love of personalization and with it coca cola ensures it remains an unshakable american classic this example shows how far personalization will get you in your brand awareness campaign so try to personalize whenever possible if your product isn t disposable consider giving customers the option to add their name image source if your product does something incredible such as staying put even under a stream of water consider filming one or more videos about it that s what beauty bakerie did with its now famous matte lip whip products i remember when my instagram feed used to be filled with videos of people putting matte lip whip swatches under water and washing them with soap it was so incredible that i couldn t help but look at the brand behold i was now aware of beauty bakerie and have been following them ever since show off something about your product that might just shock your audience into learning more about you it s guaranteed to work like it did for beauty bakerie track brand awareness like a pro brand awareness is a powerful albeit vague concept that can have a major impact on your marketing efforts consumer perception and revenue follow these techniques for establishing and building awareness for your brand and you ll find yourself with a loyal audience that recognizes your brand among competitors chooses your products time and time again and recommends their friends and family do the same editor s note this post was originally published in october

within the meaning of the 1995 private securities litigation reform act these statements are subject to risk and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from those suggested we issued our earnings release earlier this morning before the market opened please refer to it for more detail on those factors that could cause actual results to differ materially today s call is being recorded and a replay will be made available later on our worthingtonindustries com website at this point i will turn the call over to joe for a discussion of our financial results joseph b hayek vice president and chief financial officer thank you marcus and good afternoon everyone today we ll be sharing our results consistent with our new reporting segments for the first time we believe the new structure will provide greater insights into the underlying performance of our businesses we had a strong start to our fiscal year reporting earnings of 2 55 a share in q1 versus 11 22 in the prior year quarter excluding restructuring and one time items we generated a record 2 46 per share in earnings in q1 compared to 0 64 in the prior year quarter during the quarter we recognized a net after tax restructuring gain of 5 million or 0 09 a share primarily related to the sale of a shuttered facility owned by our wsp joint venture that compares to restructuring and impairment charges of 0 16 a share a year ago in addition the prior year results included a net benefit of 10 74 per share related to our investment in nikola corporation consolidated net sales in the quarter of 1 1 billion were up significantly compared to 703 million in q1 of last year the improvement was primarily due to higher steel prices combined with increased volumes across most of our segments gross profit for the quarter increased to 219 million from 113 million a year ago and our gross margin increased to 19 7 from 16 1 adjusted ebitda in q1 was a record 196 million up from 75 million in q1 of last year and our trailing 12 month adjusted ebitda is now 604 million in steel processing net sales of 823 million nearly doubled from 431 million in q1 of last year due to higher average selling prices and increased volumes total shipped tons were up 14 from last year s first quarter when demand was just beginning to recover from covid related shutdowns particularly at our automotive customers direct tons in q1 were 49 of mix which was consistent with the prior year quarter we continue to see solid demand across nearly all of our major end markets including automotive construction heavy truck and agriculture despite the solid demand and year over year growth automotive shipments could have been better if not for the continuing semiconductor related slowdowns everything we see suggest that while consumer and fleet demand for new cars remain strong chip shortages will persist for the next several quarters and our automotive demand will be subject to some uncertainty as a result the demand is clearly there it would likely just take some time for the semiconductor shortage to resolve itself our teams continue to do a terrific job navigating unprecedented market conditions while remaining laser focused on the needs of our customers in the current quarter steel generated adjusted ebit of 108 million and adjusted ebit margin of 13 compared to 14 million and 3 in q1 of last year the large year over year increase was primarily driven by increased demand higher spreads and arbitrage gains in the quarter we had pre tax inventory holding gains estimated to be 47 million or 0 68 per share compared to holding losses of 7 million or 0 09 a share in q1 of last year based on current steel prices we expect inventory holding gains again in q2 but we will also continue to see the impact of the widening scrap gap in consumer products net sales in q1 were 148 million up 10 6 from the prior year quarter legacy consumer products revenues were up slightly and the inclusion of sales from gti which was acquired in january drove the balance of the growth ebit for the consumer business was 21 million and ebit margin was 14 down from 24 million and 18 in the prior year quarter the decrease in ebit was due to higher labor and input costs our consumer business has some longer fixed price contracts with customers which can create a short term drag on margins when input rises when input prices rise as rapidly as they have these dynamics are typically short term and we do expect margins to improve moving forward building products generated net sales of 115 million in q1 which was up 30 from 88 million in the prior year quarter increase was due primarily to higher volumes as the prior year quarter was impacted by covid related disruptions building products ebit was 49 million and ebit margin was 42 up significantly from 23 4 million and 27 in q1 of last year we saw significant growth year over year in our wholly owned building products businesses but the majority of the upside was driven by strong results at wave and clarkdietrich that contributed 26 million and 17 million respectively in equity earnings wave and clarkdietrich both had better demand environments than in q1 of last year and all of our teams in building products are doing an excellent job managing dynamic supply chains and continuing to execute in challenging conditions in sustainable energy solutions net sales in q1 were 25 million down from 28 million in the prior year quarter largest end market for this business is transportation and the semiconductor chip shortage created a headwind for them with respect to demand in addition the economy in europe is recovering but very slowly the business reported a negative ebit of 3 million in the current period as volumes were too low to absorb fixed costs we remain very excited about this business and its prospects over the long term as its innovative products and solutions are poised to grow quickly serving hydrogen ecosystem and adjacent sustainable energies like compressed natural gas with respect to cash flows in our balance sheet operations used cash of 50 million in the quarter which was driven by 149 million increase in working capital primarily associated with higher steel prices along with annual accrued compensation being paid out during the quarter absent further increases in steel prices we would expect the significant working capital increases to subside in the next quarter or two during the quarter we received 20 million in dividends from our unconsolidated jvs received 27 million in proceeds from asset sales completed one acquisition for 105 million invested 24 million in capital projects paid 15 million in dividends and spent 61 million to repurchase 1 million shares of our common stock following the q1 purchases we have 8 3 million shares remaining under our share repurchase authorization looking at our balance sheet and our liquidity position funded debt at quarter end of 706 million was relatively flat sequentially and interest expense of 8 million was in line with the prior year quarter ended q1 with 399 million in cash and we continue to take a balanced approach to capital allocation focused on growth and on returning capital to shareholders earlier today the board declared a 0 28 per share dividend for the quarter which is payable in december 2021 at this point i will turn it over to andy andy rose president and chief executive officer thank you joe good afternoon everyone it s great to start fiscal 22 with another record performance however the operating environment remains quite challenging with the continued rise in steel prices supply chain issues in steel and other components and the continuing labor shortage our people continue to showcase their commitment by going the extra mile to ensure that we are working safe and doing their best to meet our customers needs demand levels are good across almost all of our end markets and backlogs remain at elevated levels we continue to raise prices in many of our product lines to offset rising input costs particularly steel higher working capital needs had a meaningful impact on free cash flow this quarter but this will reverse if steel prices begin to decline as we expect in coming quarters this is the first quarter reporting our three new operating segments consumer products building products and sustainable energy solutions hopefully you will find as we believe that each of these segments is an attractive business with unique advantages and compelling strategies to grow for years to come we will continue to leverage our transformation playbook new product development and innovation and m a to drive above market growth and higher returns on capital while our innovation and m a growth initiatives continue across the portfolio the m a environment is proving challenging with elevated purchase multiples and difficult earnings analysis due to the unpredictability of the covid environment to the extent we do find compelling targets our balance sheet remains strong with significant cash and borrowing capacity finally we just published our second corporate citizenship and sustainability report since our inception we have worked hard to be a good corporate citizen for all of our constituencies and in our communities as well as to minimize our environmental footprint while we are a relatively clean manufacturing operation overall in 2012 we started our successful greenstar initiative that aims to recognize our manufacturing facilities for environmental conservation and stewardship in fiscal 21 64 of our facilities achieved a four or five star performance rating we are working toward an even more robust approach to reducing our environmental footprint and expect to have more details in the future regarding our goals it is often difficult to follow a record year but we were off to a fast start and our teams remain focused on continuing to deliver for our customers and creating value for our shareholders thanks again to all of our employees for their hard work and dedication to operating safely and effectively we ll now take any questions questions and answers operator your first question comes from the line of martin englert with seaport research partners martin englert seaport research partners analyst hi good afternoon everyone andy rose president and chief executive officer good afternoon martin martin englert seaport research partners analyst i just want to come back and touch on inventory holding gains that were about 47 million within steel processing for the quarter could you discuss maybe the magnitude or some goalposts on what you might anticipate for the current quarter joseph b hayek vice president and chief financial officer sure it s joe martin we think that will be significant again but not as high as they were in q1 martin englert seaport research partners analyst okay and anything as far as the partial offsets from the scrap gap joseph b hayek vice president and chief financial officer yeah the scrap gap is historically run plus or minus 300 and it s four times that now or more and so significant we do everything we can to offset that in terms of trying to buy and sell in different buckets but we ll continue to see that it s we don t call it out but we know it s there martin englert seaport research partners analyst okay thanks for that and then just shifting and looking at the automotive supply chain can you provide a little more detail regarding what you are seeing there today in the current markets if that environment is improving or deteriorating and maybe more specifically what s your read on the downstream channel inventories there within autos do you get a sense that they are building inventories or do you think that they are still managing pretty tight turns andy rose president and chief executive officer i would say martin this is andy the supply chains are still pretty backed up it s hit or miss depending on the models that are being manufactured i m sure you re tracking it and we are doing our best to stay on top of it but it changes kind of daily depending on the facility that we re shipping to and who the customers are my sense we don t track sort of cars on lots if that s what you re asking but my sense in my little world of columbus ohio and other places is that inventories dealer inventories are still very very light there is way more demand than there are available cars and it s likely to be that way for the foreseeable future assuming the demand the end market demand stays the same joseph b hayek vice president and chief financial officer yeah and martin our automotive tons our direct tons into automotive were actually up 14 year over year including our twb joint venture which had a decrease there and the most impacted of our groups based on the platforms that they re on andy said it i don t think it s getting worse but it s not getting materially better yet either in terms of the supply chains generally martin englert seaport research partners analyst okay and how about you may not have a read here but more so the intermediate inventories the oems or the stampers do you get a sense of the cadence of steel that you re shipping is it matching what the production is out there or do you think that they are building that inventory before it gets produced into a vehicle whether it d be steel sitting there or stamped pieces and parts or partially produced vehicle joseph b hayek vice president and chief financial officer yeah we clearly don t have a global view there martin but i certainly don t think that there are warehouses point warehouses full of coils of steel at this point based on where things are martin englert seaport research partners analyst fair to say that it still seems like a lot of just in time inventory from a lot of folks in the supply chain joseph b hayek vice president and chief financial officer i mean that s traditionally how they ve been and again we don t think that there are mountains of coil somewhere that people don t know about martin englert seaport research partners analyst okay that s helpful i appreciate that if i could just one quick last one on the blanking facility acquired any goalposts as far as the volume contribution that we should expect there for steel processing joseph b hayek vice president and chief financial officer yeah that s part of shiloh obviously and that s one facility the other facilities went into the twb joint venture it s not going to be massive in that regard but we re really happy with it shiloh s assets were impacted during the quarter by the semiconductor shutdowns in a similar way that twb was but so far so good there and we re excited about what that does they were profitable pretty close to an adjusted plan assuming the semiconductor shortages so feel good about that one thus far martin englert seaport research partners analyst okay excellent nice job navigating the market there and congratulations on the results joseph b hayek vice president and chief financial officer thank you sir operator your next question comes from the line of phil gibbs with keybanc capital markets phil gibbs keybanc analyst hey thanks good afternoon hi guys andy rose president and chief executive officer hi phil joseph b hayek vice president and chief financial officer hi phil phil gibbs keybanc analyst so in terms of the scrap gap i know martin asked about it but can you help us in terms of just some level of magnitude in the first quarter or the way to think about it why in terms of it impacts you all i don t understand it i guess completely joseph b hayek vice president and chief financial officer sure won t be a perfect explanation but effectively we have scrap in the processing that we do ranging from 2 or 3 whether it s the beginning of a coil or the end of a coil up to upwards of 12 13 14 15 and our cold roll business where there just happens to be more and that s more of a stamping operation and so historically that scrap gap has averaged around 300 right there is delta between what we buy the steel for and what we can then ultimately sell the scrap for it s not a lot end up being roughly 8 of the total across the steel facilities and then as that scrap gap widens there are curves and charts you can plot on different services but we actually ultimately have an impact there and so we think it will be a greater impact on us in q2 than it was in q1 but nothing that is going to kind of by itself create giant issues for us i mean i think it could be based on the lag in steel prices it could be kind of order of magnitude bigger in q2 than it was in q1 but again we can try and offset that with some things that we can do on the hedging side or going into different buckets and so it s there and we pay attention to it we try and manage around it but it will create a headwind for us i can t really quantify it for you because it depends on a lot of things but that s directionally the way that it works phil gibbs keybanc analyst okay and then i saw you made an acquisition in the quarter can you kind of talk about what that may have contributed to the bottom line in the quarter and maybe strategic fit and then how it s how we should be thinking about it moving forward joseph b hayek vice president and chief financial officer i guess we re talking about the shiloh acquisition phil gibbs keybanc analyst yes yes joseph b hayek vice president and chief financial officer sure so fantastic laser welding and blanking operation fits very well with our twb business anything having to do with light weighting anything having to do with all those ongoing efforts within automotive really kind of blend themselves toward businesses like that that business that was did a nice reasonable slug of ebitda during the quarter it was impacted by the semi chip shortage because its customers are similar to twb s in that regard but really happy that it takes us even further in a direction around light weighting around hybrids around where the future that we see in automotive and so so far so good there and we it was accretive in the quarter we expect it to be accretive in the quarters to come phil gibbs keybanc analyst okay and then just on the non processed steel businesses i think you said in consumer products you saw a little bit of a pent relative to last year you expect margins to normalize but then you ve got some businesses in probably building products that benefited from the timing on the front end of getting pricing versus your raw materials so is there kind of a two quarter kind of a two quarter thought process prospectively where you ve got margins creeping back up in the consumer products and then you ve got margins probably normalizing at some point as the steel catches up to the selling price in the downstream businesses on the building product side joseph b hayek vice president and chief financial officer yeah i mean it s a tough question to just make a blanket statement on phil because each business is a little bit different and just as an example and for our joint ventures wave and clarkdietrich most of their business is spot oriented they have the ability to raise price when they need to as long as the market is receptive to that and it has been and then you contrast that with some of our consumer products businesses where we re selling to big box retailers and there is sort of brackets around when and how price increases are implemented and so there is a lag effect when that occurs and that s really what we re talking about where margins can be compressed on a short term basis but will ultimately catch up and that s usually a quarter maybe two of lag it s not a substantial delay but it does take some time phil gibbs keybanc analyst okay and then lastly and i ll jump off just remind us i guess of your liquidity position cash available credit that sort of thing and then if you re i know you re typically acquisitive what may be some things that you d be interested in in a general sense thanks so much joseph b hayek vice president and chief financial officer sure so ended the quarter with just under 400 million of cash 500 million on our revolver that is undrawn so feel pretty good about that we ve in the last three quarters phil just simple using simple working capital metrics just the inventories receivables and payables in the last three quarters we ve added 330 million to working capital so we feel like as steel prices moderate or in the eventuality that they decline some of that cash will come back to us as well really happy with our balanced approach to capital allocation so paying a dividend we bought back 1 million shares in q1 we re looking at m a opportunities we ve made three thus far in calendar 2021 and we continue to look for attractive targets that meet our cash return on investment thresholds and are good strategic fits or additions for us so we are going to continue to pursue all of those strategies simultaneously without overly stressing the balance sheet certainly phil gibbs keybanc analyst thank you joseph b hayek vice president and chief financial officer thank you operator your next question comes from the line of john tumazos with tumazos very independent research john tumazos john tumazos very independent research llc analyst thank you for the great results it s just incredible how much money you are making last week a wood company weyerhaeuser had an investor day and they predicted 25 five year growth in lumber with a slug of it coming from displacing steel in what they call tall buildings couple of days ago i was taking new jersey coastline and i saw a six story apartment building entirely wood framed up to the roof do you think that the high steel prices are hurting clarkdietrich badly i know the earnings were a record but there could be some substitution visible and are there other businesses where you see your customers looking for some substitution joseph b hayek vice president and chief financial officer yeah john we explore that on the surface anyway and i don t expect i mean look there is a lot of dislocation right now in terms of price volatility with wood and with steel as you well know and historically there has always been a little bit of substitution here or there but for the most part the markets are kind of pre established in terms of whether the buildings are built out of wood or out of steel now if steel were to stay at 2000 a ton and wood were to continue declining and the spread really increase maybe that would change but i don t at least our guys don t foresee kind of a systemic change going forward in that i don t know who was building the building on new jersey shore but i would encourage them to understand that hurricane codes are much more difficult for wood to meet with wood than they are with steel framing so there is a separate issue related to that but i understand the thought process i think a lot of it sort of depends on where this thing settles out price wise over the long run in a more normal environment john tumazos john tumazos very independent research llc analyst adding up the units of the three new segments to the old cylinder segment the units were about 3 million more in the volume category do you include wave or clarkdietrich units in construction can we compare those total units to the old cylinder total units joseph b hayek vice president and chief financial officer yes you can wave and clarkdietrich volumes are not in there you do have the acquisitions that took place specifically the ptec acquisition and then the gti acquisition the tools company that s going to be a large percentage of that increase john although volumes were up across the board in the legacy businesses as well with the exception of sustainable energy solutions which we talked about earlier john tumazos john tumazos very independent research llc analyst are the revenues of wave and clarkdietrich there or just the incomes joseph b hayek vice president and chief financial officer just the equity income in the reported numbers john tumazos john tumazos very independent research llc analyst in terms of the sustainable energy loss and a 600 000 loss in the other parts of the equity affiliates could you sort of explain that are there margin squeezes from inputs that could go away in a quarter or two or those are little details but every penny adds up joseph b hayek vice president and chief financial officer sure so specifically to sustainable energy solutions a year ago they lost 600 000 and so that business we expect over the course of time will be profitable and so some pretty specific things hitting them in this quarter seasonal slowdowns in our q1 just because it s europe and it s july and august and it s kind of the vacation slower season but on top of that the largest market being transportation automotive and the semiconductor shortage hitting a couple of its very large customers just some headwinds there but ultimately we think that resolves itself and that business will be profitable and ultimately has a lot of runway relative to the next several years in terms of hydrogen and the alternative fuels economies on the other line john those are really just some odds and ends nothing really dire i mean it s the legacy engineered cast business the pieces that are left so nothing that we would point to as being real material there john tumazos john tumazos very independent research llc analyst what are the sustainable energy solutions products in sort of simple way i m still learning the new segments joseph b hayek vice president and chief financial officer sure so i certainly invite you to bounce on to the website or one of the presentations but they make vessels that kind of house and make mobile if you will gases like hydrogen and cng and others through the ptec acquisition so it s a german company that we acquired in january they actually have a lot of the sensors and valves and accoutrements that enable transportation vehicles actually the cng or hydrogen systems that enable those vehicles to use fuel other than diesel so it s all around the transportation market using fuels other than traditional diesel fuels john tumazos john tumazos very independent research llc analyst thank you very much andy rose president and chief executive officer thank you john operator your next question comes from the line of martin englert with seaport research partners martin englert seaport research partners analyst hi thanks for taking my follow up i wanted to touch on the question about substitution between lumber and steel for like metal framing on construction can you speak to maybe some of the labor aspects to it because if i remember right i think maybe some of the metal framing in pursuing that path was a bit more labor intensive and offered some efficiency gains on that front and just thinking about that dynamic and kind of rising wages in the labor market as well joseph b hayek vice president and chief financial officer i am sorry martin are you saying metal framing is more labor efficient or less efficient martin englert seaport research partners analyst is more labor efficient joseph b hayek vice president and chief financial officer yeah martin englert seaport research partners analyst on the metal framing side versus the lumber is that a true statement joseph b hayek vice president and chief financial officer yeah i think that s true generally speaking there s other things you can do and construction companies do as well as they will pre fabricate some of that stuff which they also do in wood by the way but both wave and clarkdietrich with respect to the labor shortage are very focused on developing whether it s methods or products that require less labor easier to install less on site cutting trimming etc and they both have been quite effective at doing that in fact some of the acquisitions clarkdietrich made a few smaller acquisitions that are adding products and accessories that kind of accelerate that effort but the labor shortage is real everybody is facing it right now but the construction industry frankly has been facing it even longer than sort of the covid impact so i don t think that s going anywhere and the trends toward building efficiency are very important ones so we do think that s an important aspect of what they re trying to accomplish martin englert seaport research partners analyst okay thanks for the color there and one other kind of along the same lines if i remember from the past i think a lot of the substrate that s going into metal framing there for buildings a lot of that s purchased on the secondary market at a discount so while it would see the same inflation versus it would see inflation alongside the other flat rolled products but it s typically always kind of bought at a discount for a large portion of that is that right joseph b hayek vice president and chief financial officer i would tell you that historically meaning a number of years ago that used to be the case today they still do buy secondary but they buy their fair share of prime steel as well so it s not quite as prevalent as it used to be and one of the things that changed and we were instrumental in driving that was the code regulations and enforcement of those code regulations because while you can use secondary steel for some of those applications your the code requires that you don t for a number of others so it s still relevant but it s not like 80 of their steel is secondary steel if that makes sense martin englert seaport research partners analyst okay yeah no that s helpful to understand that shift and then are you sourcing typically the substrate for that solely from the north american market or have you been playing in the import market at all and taking advantage of the arbitrage joseph b hayek vice president and chief financial officer yeah both of those companies both of those joint ventures do import some of their steel and there s really two reasons one is price arbitrage but the other is having secondary and tertiary sources especially when you get into the really light gauge steel here in the us there just isn t a large supply of it and so from a strategic standpoint it makes sense to have some alternative sources but with some of the tariffs and other things the percentage of imported steel has declined but both of them still buy in those markets martin englert seaport research partners analyst did you ever have any appetite for other downstream fabrication i mean i understand it s part of jv now but thinking about other products that have done well in recent history with data center buildouts and warehouse and kind of the joist and decorating on that sort of thing joseph b hayek vice president and chief financial officer in terms of products or markets martin englert seaport research partners analyst yeah if there is anything you ever considered like participating more farther on the downstream andy rose president and chief executive officer well we certainly look at a number of downstream manufacturing operations many of them are metals based they don t have to be necessarily we have a pretty strict criteria that involves trying to raise our margins and our as joe said our cash return on investment so it just depends on how attractive the business is we ve been in around some of those in the past you may recall we had a cold formed steel building company where we actually built mid rise buildings for a while and it just wasn t a great market for us it didn t prove out the way we had hoped and so it wasn t a fit but we continue to look at things like that but i will tell you part of our focus is also around m a i think phil asked the question earlier what s attractive we are looking at a lot of different m a opportunities and part of the segmentation of the former pressure cylinders segment is to help us focus where we want to go there the consumer products business we feel like has a tremendous amount of opportunity to continue to leverage the brands in the markets that they re in and enhance our relationships with our customers the challenge right now is just a lot of those businesses are extremely expensive their earnings have exploded with covid so it just makes it a tough market to find a business and get it priced the way we would like to buy it so anyway it s an interesting market for sure i think we had a person on in the inside say somewhat of an m a frenzy going on out there right now and so we just have to be careful martin englert seaport research partners analyst is it a dynamic where people that are sellers are trying to get some more normalized cycle multiple or something work into that on the peak cash type earnings and you re not really having conversations where sellers are willing to base the sales multiple more on like a forward through cycle ebitda opportunity joseph b hayek vice president and chief financial officer yeah i mean everybody wants to pay off whatever the highest number or sell off whatever the highest number is right and i certainly would want to do that too if i were selling a business but what we re having a hard time doing is filtering how much of that is sustainable versus how much of that is because there was a temporary change in behavior over the last two or 2 5 years and we don t we it s hard enough to make money and build your capital base and we re trying to be conservative and make sure that we when we do spend dollars on m a that we feel confident that that ebitda is sustainable martin englert seaport research partners analyst no i think that s a good prudent approach so i m sure that your investor base appreciates that one last one here i m just curious on your thoughts on flat rolled steel prices and looking ahead over the next medium 5 10 years versus where hot rolled coil prices have been at through cycle do you think there is a structural change in the us north american and or global market where you have a different through cycle flat rolled steel price andy rose president and chief executive officer one of my favorite learnings i m not that old but i ve been through three sort of major business cycles in my career and when somebody says oh it s different this time that s usually when i get skeptical there are some fundamental changes going on in the steel market right now with the mills capacity has been taken out with some of the older legacy integrated mills and there is continued evolution into the mini mill market and expanded capacity there it s hard to say really i mean you also have the tariff impact that has sort of restricted imports into the us but i don t think fundamentally anything has changed with respect to the fact that there is there s too much capacity globally in steel production and so for us people sort of forget for worthington industries generally we want low stable steel prices and so we obviously make a lot of money when steel runs up and it s great and so we certainly enjoy it but at the end of the day for all of our businesses it s better to have those low stable steel prices we re at all time highs right now in this country and i don t know when it s going to go down but i would certainly be willing to predict that at some point probably in the not too distant future we re going to start to see some downward pressure joseph b hayek vice president and chief financial officer and martin the only thing i d add is we look at the forward curve right we re not steel price prognosticators but if you look at the forward curve and you look at how it evolved over the last year i think i saw in one of the sell side publications an estimate for 2023 year end hot rolled of over 900 a ton and that s the very first time that i ve ever seen something that s two years out that s that high and so again we think our teams are world class and we ll do better than most in any steel environment but there definitely has been a shift in how people spend their time and spend their money over the last couple of years andy rose president and chief executive officer it s hard for people to remember that not much more than a year ago steel was under 500 a ton for hot roll martin englert seaport research partners analyst yeah that s had quite a run so far look i think you are one of the biggest purchasers of flat rolled hot rolled coil in the u s north american market so i imagine you re not really having too much trouble getting into mill order books but maybe if you could just touch on the dynamic there and broadly the availability and like how lead times are looking andy rose president and chief executive officer yeah i mean it s still a challenging market to some degree on supply and most of the mills are pretty full and supply chains are obviously complicated right now for us we do have great relationships with our mill partners and the reason we have great relationships is we re a good customer we re a loyal customer but also sometimes the mills need help with filling up order books and other things and we try and work with them to be helpful when they need help as well so i think times like these when we do need to call on a partner for steel supply i think we have people that are willing to listen and that does help us out in the marketplace and enable us to service our customers but i think that s a that s a part of our philosophy and who we are as worthington we treat others the way we would like to be treated and i think that pays off in times like these martin englert seaport research partners analyst okay excellent appreciate all the color there so very helpful and again congratulations on the results andy rose president and chief executive officer thank you operator at this time there are no further questions i would like to turn the call back over to worthington industries for closing remarks andy rose president and

a full 97 of valley view hospital s 1 200 workers are now vaccinated for protection against covid 19 ahead of the thursday deadline imposed in late august hospital officials say but a group of about three dozen holdouts who expect to no longer be employed at the hospital today or in the case of local gynecologist dr cindy hall won t have privileges to use hospital facilities aren t going quietly several impacted employees and supporters plan to stage a rally for medical freedom of choice outside valley view at 11 a m friday morning a similar rally took place aug 30 protesters gather outside of valley view hospital on aug 30 2021 to rally against the mandate requiring workers in health care facilities be vaccinated chelsea self post independent hall who has her own private practice in glenwood springs but has an agreement with valley view to perform surgeries and other procedures there said this week that she and many direct hospital employees were denied their religious and or medical based requests for a vaccine exemption in her case hall said it was suggested by the hospital that she request an administrative leave so that her future ability to reinstate privileges or seek privileges elsewhere are not impacted she s busy going through that process and also is being tested for a possible medical exemption should she be allergic to any vaccine ingredients in the meantime she said her wings are clipped in her ability to serve her patients and has had to postpone several procedures that were scheduled well into the fall months moral objections i ve spent my career helping women get pregnant and successfully carry and deliver a healthy baby the vaccine is not something i can support because it s not in my belief system said hall who describes herself as a born again christian hall s opposition as well as others who ve sought religious exemptions is based on the use of decades old fetal cell lines from past abortions in the development of the covid 19 vaccine hall and others view it as a violation of their religious and personal freedom regarding this particular vaccine and aren t anti vaccine in general valley view declined to immediately answer several specific questions posed by the post independent including how many exemption requests were received granted or denied and its criteria in making those decisions ceo dr brian murphy did provide the following statement late tuesday currently 97 of our staff have chosen to receive the covid 19 vaccine and more are scheduled to receive the vaccine this week murphy said in an email valley view will continue to provide excellent care to our community at all of our facilities with no disruption in services valley view s mandate that all of its employees get vaccinated for covid 19 by sept 30 came at the same time the state of colorado required all health care workers who have direct contact with patients be vaccinated the state on friday did modify its directive saying that health care facilities that achieve 90 vaccination of their staff will not have to let unvaccinated workers go policies differ from hospital to hospital including valley view which mandates 100 compliance unless a worker exemption is granted some facilities are granting certain exemptions while others have been less inclined to do so in the interest of providing greater protection from disease spread within the hospital setting as a health care organization it is paramount that we do everything we can to provide high quality care to our patients in a safe environment murphy said at the time the policy was announced the covid 19 vaccines offer the most effective way to protect our patients and staff from the virus and variants taking a stand while hall said she can continue to practice through her own clinic more than 30 hospital workers who ve chosen not to get vaccinated and were denied exemptions will be out of a job come friday amanda betts works as an administrative assistant to the pharmacy and respiratory therapy directors she said she also sought a religious exemption on sept 1 and was denied two weeks later betts said she and others received a stock response unrelated to their specific reasoning for the request and only indicating that their decision to remain unvaccinated would present an undue burden to the hospital in ensuring they don t come in direct contact with staff and patients i even provided a letter from my church signed by our head minister betts said offering that she virtually attends the rez resurrection church based in loveland i just believe that my body is the temple of god and i don t want to put anything in it that could harm or kill me she said betts said she plans to join the rally on friday she too said she isn t anti vaccination in general but is among those who don t trust the quick rollout of the covid 19 vaccine and is leery of potential long term impacts she added that it s been a difficult few months with what she believes to be discrimination against the unvaccinated we ve all been compliant in wearing masks since it had been required doing health check ins every day and getting tested for covid 19 every week betts said we ve been keeping patients safe for a year and a half and now they re saying we can t continue to do it that way joshua peters works at valley view as a physician s assistant in orthopedics and put in for both a religious and medical exemption he said both were denied i have some personal medical issues going on that i thought was enough to warrant an exemption he said adding he even had a signed letter from his local primary care doctor recommending the exemption he said his personal religious beliefs also stand against taking the covid 19 vaccine there have been zero answers to our questions and no discussion about our concerns peters said there are hospitals all over that are allowing exemptions and figuring out a way to make it work what they re doing here is unethical and immoral worker shortage worries peters said he believes the burden on remaining staff brought by the loss of fellow workers against the backdrop of an ongoing labor shortage will be greater than accommodating unvaccinated employees tracy turner of carbondale who has worked at valley view s roaring fork family practice clinic and as a case manager on and off for five years agreed she said she was placed on administrative leave ahead of the deadline to become vaccinated after covering weekly shifts at the clinic and hospital since january she believes it was because she was pressing to get questions answered about the vaccine policy and exemption criteria turner said she was advised that if she got vaccinated she could return to work she is choosing not to and may seek another career hospitals seem willing to sacrifice the care that they give over this and that s the real burden the community is going to face turner said recently she said valley view employees were informed that they would be receiving a 500 bonus in november in thanks for their hard work during the pandemic turner said that was later clarified to say employees had to be vaccinated and still with the hospital by then to qualify it was like thanks for all your hard work this past year and there s more hard work ahead turner said then to say they are only rewarding people for vaccine

reuters divisions among congressional democrats threatened to derail president joe biden s agenda on wednesday as moderates voiced anger at the idea of delaying a 1 trillion infrastructure bill ahead of a critical vote to avert a government shutdown the white house said talks over twin bills revitalizing the nation s roads and airports as well as addressing social spending and climate change were at a precarious point as moderates and progressives disagreed over the scope of some 4 trillion in spending congress is due to vote on a bipartisan resolution to fund federal operations through early december before funding expires at midnight on thursday thursday is also the previously agreed and once delayed day that the house of representatives votes on a 1 trillion infrastructure bill already passed by the senate representative stephanie murphy a moderate house democrat who backs the infrastructure bill warned against a failure of the bill on thursday or a delay if the vote were to fail tomorrow or be delayed there would be a significant breach of trust that would slow the momentum in moving forward in delivering the biden agenda she told reporters on wednesday but with house progressives warning they will vote against the 1 trillion bill until a deal is reached on a sweeping multitrillion dollar plan to boost social spending and address climate change the vote was not guaranteed the only way the vote happens thursday is if we have the votes to pass the bill representative dan kildee house democrats chief deputy whip told reporters biden canceled a trip to chicago so he could lead negotiations with congress we re obviously at a precarious and important time white house press secretary jen psaki said on wednesday a white house staffer met at the capitol with moderate democratic senator kyrsten sinema who has expressed deep concern over the size of biden s plans and has the power to block them due to the democrats razor thin majority in the senate if this latest resolution to fund the government passes the senate the house could vote quickly to send the measure to biden to sign into law averting a partial government shutdown in the midst of a national health crisis biden s democrats who narrowly control both chambers of congress campaigned on a platform of responsible government after republican donald trump s turbulent four years in office republican senator john cornyn expressed optimism on wednesday democrats don t want to shut down the government republicans don t want to shut down the government that will supply the result that we all expect which is to keep the lights on he told a news conference senate democrats tried to both fund the government and head off a potentially catastrophic federal government default next month but were thwarted by republicans who twice blocked attempts to raise the nation s 28 4 trillion debt ceiling the government will hit the ceiling around oct 18 an event that could cause a historic default with long lasting economic fallout and implications for financial markets the house and senate may vote on a separate bill that temporarily lifts the debt limit but that too is the subject of a bitter partisan fight senate republicans refuse to vote for it telling democrats to act alone while senate democratic leader schumer has demanded bipartisan cooperation on a measure to address debts racked up during both democratic and republican administrations investment bank goldman sachs this month described the standoff as the riskiest debt limit deadline in a decade divisions biden also must negotiate a 3 5 trillion bill that aims to expand social programs and address climate change several senior democrats have said that the reconciliation bill so called because it is being drawn up under a budgetary procedure to avoid senate rules requiring 60 votes out of 100 members for passage will need to be scaled back to pass moderate democratic senator joe manchin said he believed it would take weeks to reach agreement on that plan the reconciliation bill is going to take a while it s not going to be a week or two or three weeks there s a lot manchin said with biden fully engaged with sinema and manchin other senate democrats avoided criticizing them but showed no sign of relenting on their own demands we re going to work very hard to ensure that we have a robust climate program that is in the reconciliation bill progressive senator ed markey told reporters we re not going to be satisfied unless we get it as i ve said many times no climate no deal reporting by david morgan steve holland richard cowan susan cornwell and alexandra alper writing by andy sullivan and sonya hepinstall editing by scott malone peter cooney jonathan oatis and cynthia osterman

their full time jobs have delved into freelancing since it offers more flexibility in terms of schedules and workload said joe wilson senior employment advisor at mintresume that s particularly valuable for parents without affordable child care or family leave options which has been a major hurdle employers face when it comes to filling in person positions according to a recent survey by upwork 20 of respondents are considering freelancing of those who are 73 said the ability to work remotely or flexibly is their top reason on a national scale that would represent 10 million americans

the federal government sells flood prone homes to often unsuspecting buyers npr finds enlarge this image toggle caption tayfun coskun anadolu agency via getty images tayfun coskun anadolu agency via getty images the first thing larry mccanney fell in love with was the tree in the front yard it cast shade on the porch of a house that if he were honest needed some work but mccanney is handy the price was right and the location was perfect just a couple of miles from his childhood home in burlington n j we just kind of wanted to get our family started and it was affordable for us mccanney says i m still paying college loans off 11 years later we wanted to ensure that we were purchasing a place that should i lose my job or if lost her job we wouldn t be out of a house in two months time there was one unexpected thing about the house the seller was listed as the secretary of housing and urban development the homes that the department of housing and urban development hud sells are foreclosures the previous owner was unable to pay their federally insured mortgage and the house was seized by a bank and turned over to hud only a small percentage of foreclosed homes in the united states end up being sold by hud but the numbers add up between 2017 and 2020 hud sold nearly 100 000 homes around the country like mccanney many buyers are first time homeowners excited to find a house they can afford there is a nationwide shortage of affordable homes especially for low income families providing safe affordable housing is hud s mission but an npr investigation finds that the homes hud sells are disproportionately located in flood prone places compared with zillow records of all homes sold in the united states the agency does not fully disclose the potential costs and dangers of living in harm s way and some of these transactions have happened as local governments are buying out properties in the same areas to mitigate flood risk npr analyzed tens of thousands of homes sold over a nearly four year period and found that while hud sells flood prone homes in almost every state a handful of states stand out as hot spots the findings include homes that were sold by hud between january 2017 and august 2020 are in federally designated flood zones at almost 75 times the rate of all homes sold nationwide in that period louisiana florida and new jersey stand out as hot spots more than one fifth of homes sold by hud in louisiana were in flood plains in florida it was about 12 of homes sold by hud and in new jersey 7 in comparison zillow s records show that 0 1 or less of all homes sold in these states are in flood zones in many cases buyers of hud homes get less information about flood risk and the cost of flood insurance than if they were to purchase the house from a private seller neighborhoods where hud sold homes have lower median household income on average than areas where hud did not sell homes loading interviews with people who bought homes from hud in multiple states make it clear that many buyers don t learn that their houses are in an official flood zone until after they ve made an offer or paid a nonrefundable deposit and even if a house doesn t flood immediately the cost of managing flood risk can be significant there is no federal regulation requiring hud to disclose flood risk to potential buyers most buyers find out their new house is prone to flooding when they are notified that they must purchase flood insurance which happens so late in the homebuying process that it is often too late for families to back out of the purchase that s what happened to mccanney that s the one disappointment in this area we re in a flood zone so we have to pay pretty expensive flood insurance he says i didn t really take that into account when we first bought it this summer a rainstorm flooded the park across the street and sent a foot of water into mccanney s basement after his sump pump broke mccanney says they re eventually hoping to move to a house that s not in a flood zone housing and climate experts say the pattern of hud home sales in flood plains raises questions about whether the agency fully appreciates the growing risks posed by climate change and it suggests the housing agency may be inadvertently exposing families to catastrophic inundation such as a foot or more of water in their home this is an incredible insight says laurie schoeman the resilience director for the national housing nonprofit enterprise community partners which manages affordable housing around the country it only bolsters the reality that a lot of homes that have provided shelter to low income households are in areas of greater risk these homes are in really vulnerable areas and it puts households at risk hud spokesperson michael burns says one reason that hud homes are disproportionately located in flood zones is that the agency does not choose the homes it sells and is likely to end up with homes that banks can t or won t sell because they are less marketable being located in a flood zone can make a home less marketable he says because buyers need flood insurance the agency is aware of climate driven flood risks to homes burns says millions of people in the united states live in areas prone to flooding a threat that is only growing as climate change worsens he wrote in a statement to npr ensuring that federal agencies including hud have the right tools and policies in place to increase resilience nationwide is a key priority of the biden harris administration for combating climate change and building strong equitable communities loading hud does not disclose flood risk in its home listings many buyers of hud homes don t learn that their houses are in an official flood zone until after they ve made an offer that is too late in the process for many families a property s flood risk needs to be disclosed early when potential buyers are still weighing their options and before they make a deposit as npr has reported hud could prominently display information on flood risk and the cost of flood insurance in its home listings the underlying information is already available from a sister agency the federal emergency management agency fema provides the vast majority of residential flood insurance and publishes official flood maps but unlike real estate sites such as realtor com and redfin the official hud home store website posts listings on the main page that buyers see without information about flood risk many hud homes are cross listed on multiple websites but hud specifically directs potential buyers to their website after this story was published and aired on morning edition hud spokesperson michael burns confirmed that the agency has access to certain fema generated flood insurance data and requires that the buyers of hud homes in flood zones obtain flood insurance in order to get a hud backed mortgage but burns said disclosing specific information about flood hazards would go beyond the agency s role as a mortgage insurer for the homes it sells schoeman says hud should work with real estate agents and local groups that often help market and sell hud homes to make sure that the risk of flooding is clear from the get go those groups could also help buyers understand how to mitigate flood risk for example by waterproofing a basement updating yard drainage or raising the home s foundation we need to let people know your dream house is wonderful and here are the steps you re going to need to take to protect it from flooding because you re in a flood zone says schoeman that s the conversation we need to have not here s your house and then you find out later after the first flood oh boy i m in a really bad situation enlarge this image toggle caption patrick t fallon afp via getty images patrick t fallon afp via getty images low income households have the most to lose npr s analysis finds that the households in neighborhoods where hud has sold homes are poorer on average than those in areas where hud has not sold homes long term costs of flood damage can do tremendous harm to families especially those who put their life savings into a home and live paycheck to paycheck low income households are more likely to face health problems displacement and bankruptcy after a major flood in the long term flooding can wipe out a family s generational wealth by driving down home values or destroying homes altogether that worries some experts who say hud appears to be inadvertently concentrating marginalized people in risky areas and setting families up for big financial losses down the road global warming is driving more frequent and severe flooding in much of the united states floods that used to occur once in a lifetime are now happening every few years in some places npr visited multiple neighborhoods in the tampa bay region along florida s gulf coast where hud sold more than 100 homes between 2017 and 2020 in several of those neighborhoods in coastal pinellas and pasco counties streets routinely flood even on sunny days due to sea level rise the threat of inundation as well as the allure of affordable homes located in flood plains is particularly clear in places that have suffered catastrophic flooding in recent years like the area around baton rouge la loading jonathan stewman bought his house in denham springs la in the spring of 2019 homeownership was a lifelong dream and he was excited to move in with his wife and two toddlers they painted the porch and put in some new front steps now they like to ride four wheelers in the big backyard and he s building the kids a swing set stewman grew up in an apartment in nearby baton rouge and always dreamed of having his own place a family and a yard for the kids i never knew what it was like to stay in a house so when i moved here it felt like home immediately stewman says stewman works overnight shifts at a local refinery he says they purchased the house for just 110 000 he wouldn t have been able to afford anything more stewman purchased his home just three years after a massive climate driven rainstorm dumped more than 20 inches of rain over the area in less than 24 hours stewman and his wife were told by their real estate agent that their house took in about 2 feet of water that day but the benefits of the house seemed to outweigh the risks i got a good deal on it he says enlarge this image toggle caption brendan smialowski afp via getty images brendan smialowski afp via getty images still he wants to be prepared for future floods stewman is saving money to raise the home at least another foot off the ground i have a family here and i just want to make sure it is safe and secure at all times he says hud should proactively help families like the stewmans protect themselves and their homes says robert bullard a professor at texas southern university and a longtime environmental justice researcher for one thing it s a stated priority of the current administration on his first day in office president biden promised to address climate change in an equitable way this summer the white house directed all federal agencies to examine whether their climate related programs adequately serve marginalized communities including poor people and people of color hud has to step up no doubt about it that equity lens needs to be applied to all of hud s policies says bullard who is a member of the white house environmental justice advisory council that s not rocket science but it means cooperating with other agencies for example hud could work more closely with fema which produces flood maps provides flood insurance and allocates money for climate related mitigation projects such as raising houses burns the agency spokesperson suggests that infrastructure spending proposed by the biden administration would make housing more resilient for millions of families and ensure communities are better prepared for future disasters hud initially did not respond to specific questions about how it might work more closely with fema to reduce flood risk or how its home sales in flood zones might impact low income buyers after this story was published burns wrote in an email to npr locking low income homebuyers out of a great number of affordable homeownership opportunities because the homes are located in communities within flood zones not only runs contrary to the administration s objectives of achieving greater equity in homeownership but prohibiting sales based on income would be comparable to sanctioning a resurgence of redlining in response to the story burns also wrote hud is engaging with fema and other federal partners to look at policies operations and actions that would make the nation s housing stock more resilient to climate change state and local governments criticize hud some local officials say hud needs to do a better job working with state and local agencies too especially in places where homes have flooded repeatedly in many such communities local officials are trying to move people out of harm s way by purchasing homes and knocking them down demand for home buyouts has steadily increased in recent years and the federal government helps pay for them through multiple programs including one administered by hud officials in louisiana have embraced home buyouts as a solution in the flood prone state hundreds of homes are being purchased through state programs and demolished to create catchment areas in growing flood plains pat forbes is the director of the louisiana office of community development which oversees buyouts and administers federal disaster relief money through hud s community development block grant program that program pays to elevate and flood proof homes and to move people to higher ground that s incongruous with a lot of other directives coming from hud where we are not allowed to put folks in harm s way forbes says for example after a 2016 storm flooded over 50 000 homes in and around baton rouge the state offered buyouts fema sent more than a thousand letters to residents telling them that they needed to elevate their homes or move the areas targeted for buyouts included the town where stewman lives npr s investigation found that hud sold at least 19 homes in that town between 2017 and 2020 enlarge this image toggle caption ryan kellman npr ryan kellman npr in florida federal data obtained by npr and member station wlrn show that four homes sold by hud in miami dade county are listed as severe repetitive loss properties by fema such properties have been flooded and rebuilt multiple times at taxpayer expense all together the properties incurred nearly 500 000 in flood insurance payouts between 1999 and 2015 flagging them as severe repetitive loss properties is intended to reduce the cost to the federal government of repetitive rebuilding and to protect residents and prevent them from living in high risk areas by prioritizing the houses for elevation or buyouts in response to this story hud spokesperson michael burns told npr that the agency cannot comment on the specific properties in miami dade county but that hud has an obligation to sell properties in its inventory so that the properties do not become the source of neighborhood blight and depress property values in neighborhoods and local officials in other states echo the concerns raised by forbes in louisiana the government of roanoke va has spent years trying to move families out of repeatedly flooded homes along a creek only to have hud step in and sell one of the houses to a new owner after it fell into foreclosure a similar dynamic has played out in burlington county n j where larry mccanney bought his home the county is extremely prone to flooding and buyouts are an important part of the local government s strategy for preventing repeat flood damage some of the funds for buyouts have come from fema and hud more evidence of how parts of the federal government are sometimes in conflict on climate change npr s analysis shows that hud sold more than 30 flood prone properties in the county between 2017 and 2020 including a house in a creek side neighborhood where the county has actively tried to purchase repeatedly flooded homes mary pat robbie has directed the county s resource conservation department for 20 years and was unaware of the hud sales she says it s frustrating that hud never reached out to the county if it had perhaps the county could have stepped in to prevent a flood prone home from changing hands you re really preventing that buyer of the house from dealing with the agony of having their property destroyed she says robbie has worked directly with many homeowners who survived floods in the county and she says people often don t understand how upsetting it is i ve dealt with a lot of homeowners she says they lost so much of sentimental value that they re never going to get back after this story was published hud spokesperson michael burns responded that the agency was not aware of concerns about coordination with local and state governments and that hud welcome additional feedback directly from local officials on this issue methodology through a freedom of information act request npr obtained records of real estate owned reo single family properties that hud sold from january 2017 to august 2020 npr cross referenced the records with fema s flood maps to identify homes in special flood hazard areas and also cross

in an economy upended by the coronavirus shortages and price spikes have hit everything from lumber to computer chips not even toilet paper escaped now they re cutting into one of the humblest yet most vital links in the global manufacturing supply chain the plastic pellets that go into a vast universe of products ranging from cereal bags to medical devices automotive interiors to bicycle helmets like other manufacturers petrochemical companies have been shaken by the pandemic and by how consumers and businesses responded to it yet petrochemicals which are made from oil have also run into problems all their own one after another a freak winter freeze in texas a lightning strike in louisiana hurricanes along the gulf coast all have conspired to disrupt production and raise prices there isn t one thing wrong said jeremy pafford managing editor for the americas at independent commodity intelligence services icis which analyzes energy and chemical markets it s kind of whack a mole something goes wrong it gets sorted out then something else happens and it s been that way since the pandemic began the price of polyvinyl chloride or pvc used for pipes medical devices credit cards vinyl records and more has rocketed 70 percent the price of epoxy resins used for coatings adhesives and paints has soared 170 percent ethylene arguably the world s most important chemical used in everything from food packaging to antifreeze to polyester has surged 43 percent according to icis figures advertisement the root of the problem has become a familiar one in the 18 months since the pandemic ignited a brief but brutal recession as the economy sank into near paralysis petrochemical producers like manufacturers of all types slashed production so they were caught flat footed when the unexpected happened the economy swiftly bounced back and consumers flush with cash from government relief aid and stockpiles of savings resumed spending with astonishing speed and vigor suddenly companies were scrambling to acquire raw materials and parts to meet surging orders panic buying worsened the shortages as companies rushed to stock up while they could it s such a bizarre scenario said hassan ahmed a chemicals analyst with alembic global advisors a research firm inventories are lean and supply is low demand will exceed supply growth against the backdrop of tight supplies and surging demand came a series of events that struck pafford as murphy s law in action anything that could go wrong did in 2020 hurricanes laura and zeta pounded louisiana a hub of petrochemical production then in february a winter storm hit texas with its many oil refining and chemical manufacturing facilities millions of households and businesses including the chemical plants lost power and heat pipes froze more than 100 people died a july lightning strike temporarily shut down a plant in lake charles louisiana that makes polypropylene used in consumer packaging and auto manufacturing advertisement the industry was just beginning to recover when hurricane ida struck the gulf coast in august once again damaging refineries and chemical plants as if that weren t enough tropical storm nicholas caused flooding some of these downstream petrochemical plants in the gulf coast regions are still shut down from hurricane ida said bridgette budhlall a professor of plastics engineering at the university of massachusetts lowell anything related to base chemicals they ve had a hell of a year said tom derry ceo of the institute for supply management an association of purchasing managers it s been the hardest year for logistics and supply chain managers pafford said they always say the most stressful job in the world is being an air traffic controller at any airport i d venture to say that being a supply chain manager is that or worse this year ford motor co hampered by an industrywide shortage of computer chips is now running short of other parts too some of them based on petrochemicals i think we should expect as business leaders to continue to have supply chain challenges for the foreseeable future ceo jim farley said in an interview with the associated press advertisement the shortages are slowing production at two leading paint makers sherwin williams and ppg both have raised prices and downgraded their sales guidance saying the outlook for additional supply remains dim though sherwin williams reported strong second quarter profits it said that a lack of raw materials cut sales by 3 5 percent for the period ceo john morikis said sherwin williams raised prices in the americas by 7 percent in august and an additional 4 percent this month more increases are possible next year he said the chemical shortages combined with a near doubling of oil prices in the past year to 75 a barrel of u s benchmark crude mean higher prices for many goods the consumer is going to have to pay said bill selesky a chemicals analyst for argus research who suggested that many households armed with cash from government aid and built up savings will be willing to pay higher prices in the meantime the supply problem isn t getting any better a w s jenks son hardware store in washington d c is receiving only 20 percent to 30 percent of the paint it needs to meet customer demand without backordering in normal times that rate usually runs 90 percent says billy wommack the purchasing director nobody s happy about it wommack said there are a lot of i m sorrys out there advertisement the shortage is generally felt most by big contractors that need say the same colored paint for numerous apartment complexes and other major projects individual homeowners can typically be more flexible duval paint decorating with three stores in the jacksonville florida area is scrambling to fill orders especially for big contractors who need a lot of paint said john cornell a sales clerk who orders paint for the stores we re struggling cornell said sometimes you have to grab products and sit on them for weeks or months so that when the job starts we have it andrew moore a clerk at ricciardi brothers in philadelphia said the store has been running short of lower grade paints that large contractors use though here s ample supply of higher grades demand is so high that the store is having a record year with sales up 20 percent over last year prices are up as high as 15 percent for some brands moore said the problems in the petrochemical supply chain have been compounded by shortages of labor and shipping containers and by overwhelmed ports some asian ports have been shut down by covid 19 outbreaks in the united states ports like the one in long beach california are struggling with backlogs of ships waiting to be unloaded i think this is going to go on for a really long time because there are so many factors at play here said kaitlin wowak a management professor at the university of notre dame and it s across the board in so many products advertisement it s also forcing manufacturers to rethink some of their practices for decades companies moved production to china to capitalize on lower labor costs they also held down expenses by keeping inventories to a minimum using a just in time strategy they bought materials only as needed to fill orders but as the recession and recovery showed keeping inventories threadbare carries risk supply chains have changed forever said bindiya vakil ceo of the supply chain consultancy resilinc the old management philosophy she said was to get everything to the lowest possible price point what we are dealing with right now is a consequence of those decisions companies have lost hundreds of millions in some cases billions of dollars in forgone profits because of that because their supply chains failed the petrochemical experience vakil said will teach companies to monitor the lowliest links in their supply chains it s always easier she said to track only the big ticket items engines say or electronics but simple plastics are vital too imagine trying to market breakfast cereal without a cheap plastic bag to hold corn flakes or wheat bran you can t just dump the cereal into the cardboard and ship it vakil says the plastic bag is just as critical an ingredient as the actual product and the cardboard and everything else but supply chain practitioners traditionally have not considered it to be just as critical and nowadays plastics are ubiquitous analysts expect the petrochemical crunch to last well into 2022 you really have to put covid truly in the rearview mirror for this logistics situation to normalize pafford said you can t simply just throw more ships and more containers on the water we ve got to get them loaded if ports are going to be shut down because of a covid lockdown good luck send questions comments to the editors previous next
one of my favorite analogies about friendship is of course related to the stock market in the wisdom of finance hbs professor mihir desai recommends a friendship philosophy of diversification based on beta the degree to which the returns of an investment in this case the support from your friends are correlated with the market your own success high beta relationships your linkedin network professional acquaintances and even boothies you will meet only in passing are likely to show up when you do well and disappear when things go poorly suggests desai in contrast low beta or even negative beta relationships your family members close friends from undergrad and the boothies you really bond with during these two years are more valuable when you stumble the hardest these people are there for you the most and when you fly too high they manage to pull you back down to earth intelligently diversifying between high beta and low beta relationships will be one of the most important challenges of our lives and the best portfolio has a healthy mix of each a large number of high beta relationships is a necessity in our knowledge economy where weak ties allow us to access new networks of fulfilling careers and other opportunities that we d never know about otherwise that s what they mean when they tell you business school is about the network but if you invest solely in high beta relationships you ll have no insurance when things go poorly you don t get the job offer you expected you have a medical emergency or you need advice on a challenging personal or career dilemma you need to prepare for these situations by investing deeply in a few close friends low beta relationships who care about investing in you regardless of your success it can be hard to determine where to spend your relationship building time when you re bombarded with e mails slack messages and whatsapp groups promising dozens of opportunities each day to meet other boothies and learn something new classes trips clubs parties internships and volunteer opportunities all compete for your time the sheer abundance of options can invoke a fear of commitment known commonly as the fear of missing out which makes it harder for us to be totally present in the situation we are in for many students desai argues a focus on the creation and preservation of choices can ironically lead to an inability to make choices this is true for business school social events but also for more consequential decisions in your career and romantic life when we don t make active decisions in these areas because we are worried about limiting our future options desai argues the world makes decisions for us and we find ourselves caught in currents without any ability to navigate them in essence indecision is actually a decision and a pretty bad one a question i m frequently asked is how i can do business school as a dad my wife and i have an 18 month old with another on the way i m certainly an outlier out of 1 200 boothies there are only 43 people on the parents of little ones slack channel and some of those are partners the obligations of being a dad and husband undoubtedly limit my choices while in business school i don t usually stay out late because i have to wake up with my son at 7am and traveling to europe or colombia for a few weeks just isn t an option anymore at this stage in my life and yet because my time and choices are more limited than most i do find it easier to commit to things without fear of what i could be missing in a way a restricted set of choices can help me avoid choice overload i can t be as spontaneous with my social events so i plan more 1 1 coffee chats or small dinners ahead of time to sustain close relationships with boothies from different backgrounds interests and career goals partly because of the covid uncertainty last year any opportunity to meet a larger group of boothies still feels like a special occasion one of my most rewarding business school experiences was leading a random walk to tennessee last month with 20 mostly international first year students seeing this diverse group from india japan belarus israel brazil argentina and everywhere in between come together as close friends was absolutely thrilling and i learned more about how the rest of the world sees america from that trip than i could have read in a dozen books my advice to all first year students you will have so many opportunities to build high beta relationships while at booth and you should definitely take some of them especially during these first few weeks it s good to meet people across booth and learn about their experiences and passions and some of the closest friends i ve made here began as those chance meetings at large events but when you look at your calendar each week don t be afraid to commit more one on one time to developing a few close boothie friendships they are critical in those times of stress that will undoubtedly come over the next two years sooner than you think you ll need to decide which clubs to lead or whether to be a lead facil or which internship offer to take and your close friends can best help you discern what you re really motivated about vs what is merely social pressure finally remember to actively take time each week to sustain your pre booth relationships with family and close friends they are the most valuable low negative beta relationships at this time in your life because they will help you break out of the booth bubble and remind you that there is more to life than your career throughout it all remember that being a good friend isn t just about finding people to support you actively seek out ways to be generous and kind to your friends who need your support too daniel huizinga is a full time second year student at booth and plans to continue working in consulting after graduation in his free time daniel also loves helping his classmates make smarter decisions about their personal finances you can find him on linkedin here

in an economy upended by the coronavirus shortages and price spikes have hit everything from lumber to computer chips not even toilet paper escaped now they re cutting into one of the humblest yet most vital links in the global manufacturing supply chain the plastic pellets that go into a vast universe of products ranging from cereal bags to medical devices automotive interiors to bicycle helmets like other manufacturers petrochemical companies have been shaken by the pandemic and by how consumers and businesses responded to it yet petrochemicals which are made from oil have also run into problems all their own one after another a freak winter freeze in texas a lightning strike in louisiana hurricanes along the gulf coast all have conspired to disrupt production and raise prices there isn t one thing wrong said jeremy pafford managing editor for the americas at independent commodity intelligence services icis which analyzes energy and chemical markets it s kind of whack a mole something goes wrong it gets sorted out then something else happens and it s been that way since the pandemic began the price of polyvinyl chloride or pvc used for pipes medical devices credit cards vinyl records and more has rocketed 70 percent the price of epoxy resins used for coatings adhesives and paints has soared 170 percent ethylene arguably the world s most important chemical used in everything from food packaging to antifreeze to polyester has surged 43 percent according to icis figures advertisement the root of the problem has become a familiar one in the 18 months since the pandemic ignited a brief but brutal recession as the economy sank into near paralysis petrochemical producers like manufacturers of all types slashed production so they were caught flat footed when the unexpected happened the economy swiftly bounced back and consumers flush with cash from government relief aid and stockpiles of savings resumed spending with astonishing speed and vigor suddenly companies were scrambling to acquire raw materials and parts to meet surging orders panic buying worsened the shortages as companies rushed to stock up while they could it s such a bizarre scenario said hassan ahmed a chemicals analyst with alembic global advisors a research firm inventories are lean and supply is low demand will exceed supply growth against the backdrop of tight supplies and surging demand came a series of events that struck pafford as murphy s law in action anything that could go wrong did in 2020 hurricanes laura and zeta pounded louisiana a hub of petrochemical production then in february a winter storm hit texas with its many oil refining and chemical manufacturing facilities millions of households and businesses including the chemical plants lost power and heat pipes froze more than 100 people died a july lightning strike temporarily shut down a plant in lake charles louisiana that makes polypropylene used in consumer packaging and auto manufacturing advertisement the industry was just beginning to recover when hurricane ida struck the gulf coast in august once again damaging refineries and chemical plants as if that weren t enough tropical storm nicholas caused flooding some of these downstream petrochemical plants in the gulf coast regions are still shut down from hurricane ida said bridgette budhlall a professor of plastics engineering at the university of massachusetts lowell anything related to base chemicals they ve had a hell of a year said tom derry ceo of the institute for supply management an association of purchasing managers it s been the hardest year for logistics and supply chain managers pafford said they always say the most stressful job in the world is being an air traffic controller at any airport i d venture to say that being a supply chain manager is that or worse this year ford motor co hampered by an industrywide shortage of computer chips is now running short of other parts too some of them based on petrochemicals i think we should expect as business leaders to continue to have supply chain challenges for the foreseeable future ceo jim farley said in an interview with the associated press advertisement the shortages are slowing production at two leading paint makers sherwin williams and ppg both have raised prices and downgraded their sales guidance saying the outlook for additional supply remains dim though sherwin williams reported strong second quarter profits it said that a lack of raw materials cut sales by 3 5 percent for the period ceo john morikis said sherwin williams raised prices in the americas by 7 percent in august and an additional 4 percent this month more increases are possible next year he said the chemical shortages combined with a near doubling of oil prices in the past year to 75 a barrel of u s benchmark crude mean higher prices for many goods the consumer is going to have to pay said bill selesky a chemicals analyst for argus research who suggested that many households armed with cash from government aid and built up savings will be willing to pay higher prices in the meantime the supply problem isn t getting any better a w s jenks son hardware store in washington d c is receiving only 20 percent to 30 percent of the paint it needs to meet customer demand without backordering in normal times that rate usually runs 90 percent says billy wommack the purchasing director nobody s happy about it wommack said there are a lot of i m sorrys out there advertisement the shortage is generally felt most by big contractors that need say the same colored paint for numerous apartment complexes and other major projects individual homeowners can typically be more flexible duval paint decorating with three stores in the jacksonville florida area is scrambling to fill orders especially for big contractors who need a lot of paint said john cornell a sales clerk who orders paint for the stores we re struggling cornell said sometimes you have to grab products and sit on them for weeks or months so that when the job starts we have it andrew moore a clerk at ricciardi brothers in philadelphia said the store has been running short of lower grade paints that large contractors use though here s ample supply of higher grades demand is so high that the store is having a record year with sales up 20 percent over last year prices are up as high as 15 percent for some brands moore said the problems in the petrochemical supply chain have been compounded by shortages of labor and shipping containers and by overwhelmed ports some asian ports have been shut down by covid 19 outbreaks in the united states ports like the one in long beach california are struggling with backlogs of ships waiting to be unloaded i think this is going to go on for a really long time because there are so many factors at play here said kaitlin wowak a management professor at the university of notre dame and it s across the board in so many products advertisement it s also forcing manufacturers to rethink some of their practices for decades companies moved production to china to capitalize on lower labor costs they also held down expenses by keeping inventories to a minimum using a just in time strategy they bought materials only as needed to fill orders but as the recession and recovery showed keeping inventories threadbare carries risk supply chains have changed forever said bindiya vakil ceo of the supply chain consultancy resilinc the old management philosophy she said was to get everything to the lowest possible price point what we are dealing with right now is a consequence of those decisions companies have lost hundreds of millions in some cases billions of dollars in forgone profits because of that because their supply chains failed the petrochemical experience vakil said will teach companies to monitor the lowliest links in their supply chains it s always easier she said to track only the big ticket items engines say or electronics but simple plastics are vital too imagine trying to market breakfast cereal without a cheap plastic bag to hold corn flakes or wheat bran you can t just dump the cereal into the cardboard and ship it vakil says the plastic bag is just as critical an ingredient as the actual product and the cardboard and everything else but supply chain practitioners traditionally have not considered it to be just as critical and nowadays plastics are ubiquitous analysts expect the petrochemical crunch to last well into 2022 you really have to put covid truly in the rearview mirror for this logistics situation to normalize pafford said you can t simply just throw more ships and more containers on the water we ve got to get them loaded if ports are going to be shut down because of a covid lockdown good luck send questions comments to the editors previous next
democrats want wealthy households to pay more taxes to help fund their effort to expand the social safety net and one proposal in congress calls for lowering the threshold for the estate tax to 5 million that prompted cnbc s greg iacurci to take a look at how many americans currently pay the estate tax and the answer is very few according to irs data reviewed by iacurci just 0 2 of u s adults who died between 2011 to 2016 paid the estate tax that s well below the historical norm of 1 to 2 the falling rate is due in large part to the increase in the threshold for the estate tax twenty years ago the threshold was 1 million rising to 3 5 million in 2009 and then to 5 million in 2010 in 2017 republicans more than doubled the threshold to the current levels of 11 7 million for single people and 23 4 million for couples above those levels of wealth the estate tax of 40 applies in raw numbers just 2 570 returns owed estate tax in 2019 iacurci reports the money owed was substantial though totaling 13 2 billion according to the joint committee on taxation the democratic plan to lower the estate tax threshold to 5 million won t significantly increase the percentage of people who owe the tax bumping the share up to 0 3 or 0 4 but it will raise a lot of money bringing in about 52 billion over the next five years mind the grat a new report from propublica highlights a method some ultrawealthy households use to avoid paying estate taxes altogether the estate tax can be easily avoided by exploiting a loophole unwittingly created by congress three decades ago propublica s researchers write by using special trusts a rarefied group of americans has taken advantage of this loophole reducing government revenues and fueling inequality the special trusts are called grantor retained annuity trusts or grats and they ve been used by more than half of the country s 100 wealthiest individuals propublica reports here s how they work a typical grat entails putting assets like stocks in a trust that ultimately benefits a person s heirs the trust pays back an amount equal to what the trust s creator put in plus a modest amount of interest but any gains on the investments above that amount flow to the heirs free of gift or estate taxes the grat structure has helped the likes of michael bloomberg oprah winfrey and charles koch ensure that their families and in some cases friends receive millions from their estates tax free i don t blame the taxpayers who are doing it daniel hemel a professor at the university of chicago law school told propublica congress has virtually invited them to do it i blame congress for creating the monster and then failing to stop the monster once it became clear how much of the tax base the grat monster would eat up like what you re reading sign up for our free newsletter

old joke on stock trading floors that if the media rang you for comment on why the market went down today you d wave them off with more sellers than buyers or vice versa yesterday the asx saw a staunch battle between the two the futures said down 82 points but the asx200 opened down 100 in the first twenty minutes before attempting a bounce that failed and by midday we were down 130 when the buyers again had a go we got all the way back to down 65 by 3pm in came the late sellers and we were down 100 again at the close but for a bounce on market on close orders an unconvincing rebound on wall street overnight has our futures up 23 points this morning but it s the last day of the quarter so anything could happen selling was relatively uniform among sectors yesterday apart from small gains for defensives consumer staples 0 1 and utilities 0 2 property missed out 1 1 but was fighting a big day of ex divs a small bounce in the gold price had the punters running back in with the top four index winners on the day all gold miners gold was down again overnight this didn t prevent the ongoing rout in the materials sector 1 0 and an overdue dip in oil prices had energy down 1 8 after a surging few days technology was down 2 4 as one might expect on the nasdaq fall overnight and square fell 5 but it s hard to tell whether the banks were always going to fall 1 1 or whether apra had anything to do with it apra announced it will consider possible macro prudential policy responses to address the medium term risk created as a result of surging home loan sizes data released show 22 of new loans in the june quarter had a debt to income ratio of 6x which the regulator deems risky that s up from 16 one year ago didn t we have that royal thingy a while back truth is economists have been tipping apra tightening towards year end for months now and surging house prices have not changed that tune healthcare was hammered again yesterday 1 9 to mark a very weak run in spite of an increasingly supportive aussie dollar which is now below us72c the space clearly had become overcrowded we ll be happy to wave september goodbye after today but then we hit october as yesterday s action suggests investors are jumpy and at odds so we may need some positive news to stave off the jitters similar theme wall street saw a similar buyers versus sellers battle last night the major indices attempted a rally from the open but it didn t last when the s p500 held its ground at tuesday night s closing price the buyers had another go and were looking good up to 3pm before most of that gain was given back the debt ceiling issue is looming larger every day and a government shutdown is not without precedent the last being in 2011 after obama lost control of congress in the mid terms it didn t last long cutting off pay to public servants on the basis of partisan stubbornness does not make for elevated voter support my guess would be the republicans push it as far as they can to make a point then withdraw and claim victory the us lost its aaa rating last time and hasn t got it back since wall street is up about a million percent in the interim inflation is of course the big topic of conversation and tonight sees the release of the fed s preferred measure being the personal consumption expenditure pce index it s an august number so a little old now and also leaves out specific price drivers otherwise captured in the cpi such as rents even the cpi doesn t paint the full picture of household spending requirements and given the core measure of both excludes fuel costs it s almost misleading either way economists are more anxious about the september cpi numbers in a couple of weeks time there is also lingering nervousness about the chinese property market the last we know is that evergrande will probably be restructured rather than bankrupted and yesterday the property developer sold its stake in a regional chinese bank to help fund interest payments as the pboc injected yet more liquidity into the market evergrande rallied 10 in hong kong it is notable that despite last night s ups and downs on wall street at no point did the s p500 either exceed

august profit reporting season that saw earnings grow by a stunning 26 5 per cent the mining and the banking sectors led by comyn s cba and henry s bhp also showered investors with 40 billion in dividends sending the asx to fresh all time highs that s not to say there haven t been missteps from corporate australia in the past year the battle over whether profitable asx recipients of jobkeeper should be forced to pay back the wage subsidy is long and bruising and at times threatens to overshadow the sense that the pandemic helped the business sector rediscover its purpose in employment more broadly business has also struggled to adjust to the changes in investor and community expectations that have kept up their pace even through the crisis there was no greater example of this than the scandal that engulfed rio tinto following its decision to blow up a sacred aboriginal site at juukan gorge in western australia in may 2020 rio s initial internal investigation which exonerated senior management including former chief executive js jacques sparked a furious response from investors led by the australian council of superannuation investors which represents the nation s biggest industry super funds acsi chief executive louise davidson who joins the corporate power list for the first time in 2021 eventually claimed a string of rio scalps including jacques and chairman simon thompson the rio scandal was an example of the rising power of investors particularly australia s super giants in corporate life but it was the fallout from another scandal that underlined the huge challenge facing boards and management teams in navigating the shifting sands of corporate responsibility in june a report was handed down following an independent review ordered by banducci into how woolworths first made and then reversed a decision to build a dan murphy s store in darwin after an outcry from indigenous groups the review panel chaired by veteran lawyer danny gilbert underscored a brave new world in which a company is effectively answerable to everybody in the past power was distributed through a top down approach the report says today power is distributed through a flatter network effect those who wield power may reside anywhere in the network this has had a direct impact on decision making encouraging a bottom up two way flow of engagement in this much more collaborative environment leaders become the powerbrokers rather than governing bodies in a hierarchy it s a contentious but fascinating idea which suggests modern captains of industry must be able to slide between wielding power and ceding it between leading and following that s no easy task at the best of times but it may prove particularly challenging as australia embarks on a post covid 19 recovery likely to be bumpy and uneven advertisement left to right matt comyn andrew forrest rob scott mike henry brad banducci dominic lorrimer alina gozin a philip gostelow wolter peeters 1 matt comyn the commonwealth bank chief executive is arguably the leading member of team australia from the business community and as sydney and melbourne were dunked by the pandemic s delta wave in june comyn stepped up again promising a fresh round of support for affected borrowers and cajoling staff customers and the wider community to get vaccinated more broadly comyn has turned cba s leadership in the australian banking industry into something that looks close to dominance building market share in mortgages aggressively stepping up business lending and trying to turn cba s banking app into a digital ecosystem across shopping utilities and financial services 2 andrew forrest not content with having built fortescue metals group into one of the world s top iron ore miners forrest has turned activist betting billions on a shift to a cleaner and greener world much of this centres on forrest s plan to turn fortescue into a green energy company including making so called green steel by harnessing hydrogen power but forrest s private companies have also launched aggressive takeover bids for a tasmanian salmon farm and a canadian nickel explorer both with an explicit environmental social and governance agenda a master of grabbing media attention australia s second richest person is never afraid to add a little theatre to his efforts even if it means clashing with those who doubt his claim that australia can become a green superpower 3 rob scott while wesfarmers home town of perth has become increasingly isolated from the rest of the country over the past 18 months chief executive scott has been a vocal advocate of the nation s need to find ways to live with covid 19 advertisement with an employee base of 113 941 and business that spans the giant bunnings kmart target and officeworks chains scott has watched the ebbs and flows of business and consumer confidence closely frequently warning of the economic and social costs of lockdowns as sydney locked down in june scott successfully argued to keep many stores open until rising cases saw restrictions tightened with wesfarmers share price and profitability near record levels scott has also made some canny corporate moves including giving approval to the mount holland lithium project 4 mike henry after a quiet start to his reign at the top of australia s biggest miner henry unleashed a series of moves in august that will change bhp forever it s ending its listing on london s ftse the merger of its petroleum business with woodside signals a further move away from fossil fuels while the approval of the us5 7 billion 7 74 billion jansen potash project in canada has led the group into an entirely new sector where rival rio tinto has been in turmoil following the destruction of juukan gorge in may 2020 bhp has largely kept its nose clean showing leadership on emissions reduction diversity and vaccination 5 brad banducci few corporate leaders have been on the front line of the pandemic like the woolworths boss who for 18 months has been forced to balance the responsibility of keeping the country fed with the need to keep his 115 000 staff safe banducci has used the power that his giant store network gives him to reassure panicked shoppers chastise mask refusers and lead the retail sector s vaccination campaign outside this banducci made an important contribution to corporate governance standards when he turned the spotlight on the process that led woolworths to first approve and then abandon a bottle shop development in darwin after failing to properly consult local indigenous groups advertisement left to right shemara wikramanayake paul perrault louise davidson amanda lacaze anthony eisen nick molnar louie douvis tony stewart wayne taylor louise kennerley eamon gallagher 6 shemara wikramanayake while wikramanayake works hard to avoid the limelight the macquarie group s global reach and bulging balance sheet give its chief executive a unique type of power at home and abroad macquarie s push into renewable energy and infrastructure is nothing new but as the urgency of the global energy transition has increased the millionaire factory s role in these sectors has become more prominent in one of her rare public appearances at last year s chief executive women annual dinner wikramanayake spoke candidly about the importance of diversity revealing her husband is a stay at home dad and mental health 7 paul perreault the csl boss has not been able to visit australia in the past 18 months but his influence on australian society has probably never been greater csl s deal to produce the astrazeneca vaccine at its melbourne production facility was central to the federal government s vaccine rollout until growing concerns about blood clots in some recipients led to a barrage of confusing and often contradictory advice about the vaccine s suitability perreault has been a voice of reason in the controversy declaring it a personal mission to see every australian vaccinated the 140 billion biotech giant remains in the frame to produce an mrna vaccine in australia in the future 8 louise davidson as australia s superannuation giants grow so too does their power to influence the way business is done in this country advertisement there was no greater example of this than at rio tinto when the company s decision to blow up an aboriginal sacred site in may 2020 led to widespread community condemnation but it was the australian council of superannuation investors led by chief executive davidson that demanded real accountability at rio when an internal report into the disaster cleared individual executives of blame acsi led an investor outcry that would ultimately see chief executive js jacques and chairman simon thompson depart acsi was similarly vocal during amp s harassment scandal 9 amanda lacaze as the chief executive of rare earths miner lynas lacaze is used to being something of an outlier lynas is the only major producer of light rare earths outside of china but she s also perhaps the only australian ceo who managed to influence us government policy last year lacaze s plan to build a heavy rare earths separation plant in texas attracted opposition from a group of republican lawmakers worried about the fact that parts of lynas supply chain are in australia and malaysia but lacaze managed to convince the department of defence to hold firm in its support for the project with the pentagon signing off on a funding deal for the plant in july last year 10 anthony eisen nick molnar square inc s 39 billion acquisition of australia s buy

the state of florida is officially raising the age restriction on all smoking and vaping products from 18 years and older to 21 years and older this change becomes effective on friday october 1 in may gov ron desantis signed sb 1080 which raises the legal age for purchasing nicotine and tobacco products to 21 this new change aligns florida s legal age for purchasing these products with the age set by federal law in 2019 now that it is time for the change to go into effect many consumers who are not yet 21 years old are voicing their disapproval of the new age restriction i feel like raising the age to 21 is really a disgrace because we waited so many years to be able to buy tobacco products just to get turned back around said kenyelle porter a tallahassee resident now i m 20 and i suddenly can t buy tobacco products so it s very unfair and i think it s a rising problem this change will not only impact the consumers of these products but also the distributors of tobacco and nicotine products according to the summary of the bill on the florida senate website it requires age verification before the sale of tobacco or nicotine products to persons who appear to be under 30 years of age local smoke shops in tallahassee have been notifying their customers ages 18 to 20 of the change and are preparing for the change in business i would just suggest that everyone underage stock up said a cashier at a smoke shop on ocala rd who preferred to remain anonymous i know our regular customers pretty well and some of the younger people already plan to stock up however consumers have already been planning ways to get around the new restriction chelsea arnett 31 and a tallahassee resident has been asked by younger individuals if she would mind being sent in the store to get tobacco products for them i ve been asked multiple times but that is illegal and i have too much to lose said arnett of course arnett is not the only individual over 21 who people could ask for this type of favor multiple individuals who would rather not be named have said that they would go to the smoke shop for a younger friend this type of behavior may allow consumers to continue their normal habits and allow distributors to not take such a hit in sales it is risky however because those caught can be punished by law

1 5 2 5 3 5 4 5 5 5 in an economy upended by the coronavirus shortages and price spikes have hit everything from lumber to computer chips not even toilet paper escaped now they re cutting into one of the humblest yet most vital links in the global manufacturing supply chain the plastic pellets that go into a vast universe of products ranging from cereal bags to medical devices automotive interiors to bicycle helmets like other manufacturers petrochemical companies have been shaken by the pandemic and by how consumers and businesses responded to it yet petrochemicals which are made from oil have also run into problems all their own one after another a freak winter freeze in texas a lightning strike in louisiana hurricanes along the gulf coast all have conspired to disrupt production and raise prices there isn t one thing wrong said jeremy pafford managing editor for the americas at independent commodity intelligence services icis which analyzes energy and chemical markets it s kind of whack a mole something goes wrong it gets sorted out then something else happens and it s been that way since the pandemic began the price of polyvinyl chloride or pvc used for pipes medical devices credit cards vinyl records and more has rocketed 70 the price of epoxy resins used for coatings adhesives and paints has soared 170 ethylene arguably the world s most important chemical used in everything from food packaging to antifreeze to polyester has surged 43 according to icis figures the root of the problem has become a familiar one in the 18 months since the pandemic ignited a brief but brutal recession as the economy sank into near paralysis petrochemical producers like manufacturers of all types slashed production so they were caught flat footed when the unexpected happened the economy swiftly bounced back and consumers flush with cash from government relief aid and stockpiles of savings resumed spending with astonishing speed and vigor suddenly companies were scrambling to acquire raw materials and parts to meet surging orders panic buying worsened the shortages as companies rushed to stock up while they could it s such a bizarre scenario said hassan ahmed a chemicals analyst with alembic global advisors a research firm inventories are lean and supply is low demand will exceed supply growth against the backdrop of tight supplies and surging demand came a series of events that struck pafford as murphy s law in action anything that could go wrong did in 2020 hurricanes laura and zeta pounded louisiana a hub of petrochemical production then in february a winter storm hit texas with its many oil refining and chemical manufacturing facilities millions of households and businesses including the chemical plants lost power and heat pipes froze more than 100 people died a july lightning strike temporarily shut down a plant in lake charles louisiana that makes polypropylene used in consumer packaging and auto manufacturing the industry was just beginning to recover when hurricane ida struck the gulf coast in august once again damaging refineries and chemical plants as if that weren t enough tropical storm nicholas caused flooding some of these downstream petrochemical plants in the gulf coast regions are still shut down from hurricane ida said bridgette budhlall a professor of plastics engineering at the university of massachusetts lowell anything related to base chemicals they ve had a hell of a year said tom derry ceo of the institute for supply management an association of purchasing managers it s been the hardest year for logistics and supply chain managers pafford said they always say the most stressful job in the world is being an air traffic controller at any airport i d venture to say that being a supply chain manager is that or worse this year ford motor co hampered by an industrywide shortage of computer chips is now running short of other parts too some of them based on petrochemicals i think we should expect as business leaders to continue to have supply chain challenges for the foreseeable future ceo jim farley said in an interview with the associated press the shortages are slowing production at two leading paint makers sherwin williams and ppg both have raised prices and downgraded their sales guidance saying the outlook for additional supply remains dim though sherwin williams reported strong second quarter profits it said that a lack of raw materials cut sales by 3 5 for the period ceo john morikis said sherwin williams raised prices in the americas by 7 in august and an additional 4 this month more increases are possible next year he said the chemical shortages combined with a near doubling of oil prices in the past year to 75 a barrel of u s benchmark crude mean higher prices for many goods the consumer is going to have to pay said bill selesky a chemicals analyst for argus research who suggested that many households armed with cash from government aid and built up savings will be willing to pay higher prices in the meantime the supply problem isn t getting any better a w s jenks son hardware store in washington d c is receiving only 20 to 30 of the paint it needs to meet customer demand without backordering in normal times that rate usually runs 90 says billy wommack the purchasing director nobody s happy about it wommack said there are a lot of i m sorrys out there the shortage is generally felt most by big contractors that need say the same colored paint for numerous apartment complexes and other major projects individual homeowners can typically be more flexible duval paint decorating with three stores in the jacksonville florida area is scrambling to fill orders especially for big contractors who need a lot of paint said john cornell a sales clerk who orders paint for the stores we re struggling cornell said sometimes you have to grab products and sit on them for weeks or months so that when the job starts we have it andrew moore a clerk at ricciardi brothers in philadelphia said the store has been running short of lower grade paints that large contractors use though here s ample supply of higher grades demand is so high that the store is having a record year with sales up 20 over last year prices are up as high as 15 for some brands moore said the problems in the petrochemical supply chain have been compounded by shortages of labor and shipping containers and by overwhelmed ports some asian ports have been shut down by covid 19 outbreaks in the united states ports like the one in long beach california are struggling with backlogs of ships waiting to be unloaded i think this is going to go on for a really long time because there are so many factors at play here said kaitlin wowak a management professor at the university of notre dame and it s across the board in so many products it s also forcing manufacturers to rethink some of their practices for decades companies moved production to china to capitalize on lower labor costs they also held down expenses by keeping inventories to a minimum using a just in time strategy they bought materials only as needed to fill orders but as the recession and recovery showed keeping inventories threadbare carries risk supply chains have changed forever said bindiya vakil ceo of the supply chain consultancy resilinc the old management philosophy she said was to get everything to the lowest possible price point what we are dealing with right now is a consequence of those decisions companies have lost hundreds of millions in some cases billions of dollars in forgone profits because of that because their supply chains failed the petrochemical experience vakil said will teach companies to monitor the lowliest links in their supply chains it s always easier she said to track only the big ticket items engines say or electronics but simple plastics are vital too imagine trying to market breakfast cereal without a cheap plastic bag to hold corn flakes or wheat bran you can t just dump the cereal into the cardboard and ship it vakil says the plastic bag is just as critical an ingredient as the actual product and the cardboard and everything else but supply chain practitioners traditionally have not considered it to be just as critical and nowadays plastics are ubiquitous analysts expect the petrochemical crunch to last well into 2022
