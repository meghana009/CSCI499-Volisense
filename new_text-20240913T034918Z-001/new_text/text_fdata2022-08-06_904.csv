this is an edition of the atlantic daily a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day helps you discover new ideas and recommends the best in culture sign up for it here senator kyrsten sinema of arizona said that she ll sign on to the democrats climate bill after advocating for a few adjustments that she apparently didn t care to explain to anyone but first here are three new stories from the atlantic enigma wrapped in a loophole democrats were relieved last week when senator joe manchin and senate majority leader chuck schumer announced that they had reached a deal on sweeping climate legislation but that relief lasted only about a minute because pretty soon there was a holdup sinema wasn t so sure about the bill reports told us that it had something to do with getting rid of the carried interest loophole which allows hedge fund managers and others to pay a lower tax rate on certain portions of their income but the arizona senator didn t explain why she might not like that provision in the legislation sinema has apparently never uttered the phrase carried interest in a public legislative session the new york times reported yesterday after more negotiating the democrats reached a deal they stripped out that tax provision and one dealing with accelerated depreciation which will benefit manufacturers then they added both a 1 percent tax on stock buybacks and a few billion dollars in drought funding for the southwest sinema said that she was satisfied which means the democrats were too but we re all still confused the democrats new legislation might actually be more effective than the original in terms of reducing the deficit and sinema could make the case for that she could tell americans that this was what she was going for all along she could talk about wanting to get more dollars for drought relief but she won t talk with reporters and she didn t say anything like that in her vague statement last night the senator s silence has left commentators to fill in the blanks about her motives sinema wielded her extreme political power to demand a tax break for rich wall street bros ezra levin from the progressive group indivisible tweeted last night every day kyrsten sinema gets up and asks herself a simple but important question how can i help venture capitalists and wealthy private equity managers pay lower tax rates than everyone else matt fuller from the daily beast posted even the conservative pundit hugh hewitt who is no fan of the bill seemed mystified sinema has long cultivated a strange air of mystery refusing to explain herself to the press or even to her own voters she s been a leading obstacle in basically every element of her party s agenda she opposed a minimum wage hike in the covid 19 relief bill without really explaining why and she never laid out her qualms with build back better legislation even after a constituent confronted her in a bathroom she doesn t seem reachable one prominent arizona democratic activist who campaigned for sinema told me this spring i don t understand two other sinema voters both political independents told me in january that they didn t necessarily mind their senator s opposition to build back better they just wish they understood it all of this confusion has prompted dozens of articles asking things like what is kyrsten sinema s deal and what does kyrsten sinema really want reporters have called the senator s views shrouded and enigmatic pointing out that even her style keeps us guessing but these are all euphemisms for describing someone who seems to take pride in her lack of transparency she doesn t just reject interview requests from national reporters and the sunday talk show circuit she barely does interviews at all even in her own state despite the fact that she is a government employee paid with public tax dollars in her limited public statements of substance sinema has articulated that she wants to keep arizona friendly to businesses when she gave a floor speech defending her support for keeping the filibuster she was thoughtful and open though many in her party were outraged by her stance but we don t know much else about what sinema stands for she seems to view her base as arizona moderates and independents a broad middle section of voters who don t have strong political views and aren t demanding much in the way of political change but sinema has veered further to the right during her senate career than seems politically expedient given that arizona has elected two democratic senators and a democratic president maybe sinema wants to be known for being unknown an inscrutable leader whose only observable passion seems to be running triathlons maybe that s the vibe above the fray indifferent immune she s going for the problem though is that polls show that sinema is very unpopular with arizona democrats republicans actually view her much more positively and if she runs again in 2024 republicans aren t going to be the ones voting for her in a primary the issue with being an enigma is that eventually people will form their own interpretations of your motives accurate or not being a cipher means allowing people to see exactly what they want this can work for some politicians but it is not working for kyrsten sinema related additional reporting and editing russell berman today s news top

trial suffering and resurrection begun in 1634 and performed roughly every 10 years the play is produced by the inhabitants of this bavarian village located in the foothills of the alps maybe it was the scene where jesus holds a torah scroll aloft and leads the congregation in the sh ma yisrael the jewish declaration of faith in a single god or perhaps it was the last supper where jesus and his

economic woes send oil prices towards a 10 weekly loss despite market tightness by ship bunker news team but bill smead still defends the commodity as a good investment file image pixabay punishing that s one adjective pundits used to describe oil s performance this week as the commodity headed for a sizable weekly loss of 10 percent amid increased evidence that a worsening global economy is causing demand destruction for the day two key commodities settled slightly higher brent closed 0 85 percent higher at 94 92 per barrel while west texas intermediate settled 0 53 percent higher at 89 01 per barrel recession worries reached a fever pitch when the bank of england raised interest rates by the most since 1995 and warned of a drawn out downturn after this caused tina teng analyst at cmc markets to remark that if commodities are not pricing in an imminent economic recession they might be preparing for a stagflation era when the unemployment rate starts picking up and inflation stays high everyone is taking the threat of recession far more seriously craig erlam senior market analyst oanda craig erlam senior market analyst at oanda added clearly everyone is taking the threat of recession far more seriously as we re still seeing a very tight market and producers with no capacity to change that the ongoing irony of course is that the global supply market remains tighter than ever and is expected to intensify even further towards the end of the year when on december 5 the european union sanctions banning seaborne imports of russia crude and oil products are set to take effect indeed other news on friday gives the impression that the oil market now exists in two parallel worlds one that is influenced by demand concerns and the other in which a tight market is sparking vigorous competition the latter was evident when bloomberg on friday noted that saudi arabia s decision earlier in the week to price some of its oil at lower than expected levels is setting the stage for keen competition in asia among producers vying to supply the region the news agency went on to point out that asian refiners have started to snap up light sweet crude from the u s for november delivery the wti midland grade was shown at a premium of around 8 a barrel over benchmark dubai prices to north asian buyers this week down from 15 to 16 a month ago meanwhile as it became evident that oil was heading towards another substantial weekly loss on friday bill smead chief investment officer at smead capital management insisted that oil stocks are still a great buy because energy prices are likely to stay high or even increase further he said you have this huge move you go from 20 a barrel to 120 and then you pull back and now people are going oh yeah that s all over that s going to cure the inflation right there however he added that the u s will have to replace 180 million barrels of strategic reserves that were recently drawn down plus china s economy will likely come roaring back after its covid inspired lockdowns are lifted in presumably the near future both of which will presumably boost prices yet again

cancer related deaths worldwide and in the us 3 4 more than two million patients with breast cancer were diagnosed in 2020 resulting in nearly 685 000 deaths globally 3 in the us more than 290 000 patients are expected to be diagnosed in 2022 resulting in more than 43 000 deaths 5 her2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor growth promoting protein expressed on the surface of many types of tumors including breast gastric lung and colorectal cancers and is one of many biomarkers expressed in breast cancer tumors 6 her2 expression is currently determined by an immunohistochemistry ihc test which estimates the amount of her2 protein on a cancer cell and or an in situ hybridization ish test which counts the copies of the her2 gene in cancer cells 6 7 her2 tests provide ihc and ish scores across the full her2 spectrum and are routinely used to determine appropriate treatment options for patients with metastatic breast cancer her2 positive cancers are currently defined as her2 expression measured as ihc 3 or ihc 2 ish and her2 negative cancers are defined as her2 expression measured as ihc 0 ihc 1 or ihc 2 ish 6 however approximately half of all breast cancers are her2 low defined as an her2 score of ihc 1 or ihc 2 ish 8 10 her2 low occurs in both hr positive and hr negative disease 11 previously patients with hr positive metastatic breast cancer and her2 low disease had limited

what you should know the index of healthcare life science equities tracked by stout was down 16 8 in q2 2022 which was in line with the s p 500 decline of 16 4 healthcare life science m a activity plummeted to 338 deals in q2 2022 versus 535 in q2 2021 and a record 565 deals in q4 2021 the report reveals credit markets likely to tighten but a healthy level of m a is expected to continue in the growing and defensive healthcare sector key trends and market summary for more than 30 years stout has exclusively focused on serving the unique m a transaction advisory needs of middle market clients it is a trusted advisor to leading organizations due to its deep industry knowledge senior level attention process expertise and relentless focus on delivering unparalleled results the key trends highlighted in the quarterly update q2 2022 report from stout are as follows 1 health service equities and big pharma healthcare service equities underperformed the s p 500 but the outperformance of the big pharma and biotech sub sectors allowed healthcare overall to keep pace with the market hospital stocks dropped 32 6 in the second quarter and were the worst performing sub sector tracked by stout in the quarter rising costs for nurses and hospital staff along with growing labor shortages have resulted in several of the largest hospital companies such as hca healthcare lowering earnings estimates which drove prices downward across the sub sector in q2 2022 to combat labor shortages hospitals have been frequently contracting out for traveling nursing staff or dealing with organized building staff which ultimately raises their cost of labor 2 the physician practice management sub sector stout has not observed the same labor cost issues impacting the physician practice management ppm sub sector as these companies typically avoid turning to contract labor and some ppm companies have already been paying at higher rates supply costs are often less significant in the cost structure of ppm companies and campaigns run by large drug companies in an effort to increase market share for pharmaceuticals coming off patent expiration may generate additional opportunities for ppm companies to achieve higher margins on j code drug billing 3 cms proposed changes to the physician fee schedule 2023 on july 7 2022 the cms announced that it is soliciting public comment on proposed policy changes for medicare payments under the physician fee schedule pfs effective on or after january 1 2023 physician payments are based on multiplying relative value units rvus that are assigned to each type of service by a conversion factor rvus are applied to each service for work medical practice expenses and malpractice expenses the proposed changes would reduce the conversion factor by 4 4 from 34 61 in cy 2022 to 33 08 in cy 2023 4 behavioural health and telemedicine the behavioural health subsector was down 18 4 in q2 2022 with only acadia healthcare posting a gain in share price policymakers are recognizing the need for payers to increase coverage and reimbursement for integrated behavioral health services which entails primary care and behavioral health collaboration to achieve better clinical and cost outcomes along with a healthier workforce access to telemedicine in behavioral health is also expected to increase over time but there are prevailing questions that continue to be discussed as to whether opioids can be prescribed in telemedicine consultations versus in person visits once the public health emergency passes 5 health it equities healthcare information technology equities were down 21 2 in the quarter telemedicine leader teladoc tumbled 54 in the quarter as the pandemic continues to subside and patients are no longer sheltering in place electing instead to partake in in person visits telemedicine is also experiencing a higher level of competition and growing costs of advertising 6 predictions regarding home care and medicaid outlook as a general observation stout thinks that many states will increase reimbursement rates and funding for medicaid recipients who have often had difficulty accessing quality home care due to providers declining to participate in government funded programs in california medicaid has become an attractive and lucrative business for providers who know how to effectively operate in the segment stout anticipates that payers will increasingly refer patients into the lower cost home setting earlier in the continuum of care and we are actively working on mandates within the home healthcare supply and medical equipment distribution subsectors where the market is also expanding and moving toward capitation from traditional fee for service models 7 medical devices and life sciences the defensive pharmaceutical equities outperformed the market during q2 2022 medical device equities were down 18 5 in the quarter while the molecular diagnostics clinical labs tools subsector declined 15 7 driven down by weaker performance among high multiple names such as illumina m a market key takeaways m a transaction volume across the healthcare life science industry plummeted in q2 2022 to 338 deals announced and or closed a decline of 37 from 535 transactions in q2 2021 and a record 565 transactions in q4 2021 the weak first half of 2022 was to be expected given the bolus of transactions that were consummated at the end 2021 but the second quarter dip was far greater than anticipated the volume of new deals announced during q2 2022 also dropped to 74 transactions versus 87 transactions a year ago which is its lowest level since q1 2018 this likely suggests that 2h 2022 will not rebound much and we also anticipate that lenders will become more discerning and conservative in the second half given recession fears and recent interest rate increases stout is seeing high quality mandates in its own healthcare pipeline private equity groups and strategic still maintain large cash reserves and lenders will probably show debt underwriting preference for recession resistant sectors likely healthcare life sciences in the near term so we think m a activity healthcare will remain healthy overall the number of transactions closed in the quarter dropped 41 to 264 overall transaction value of deals announced and or closed in q2 2022 was 26 billion versus 31 billion in q2 2021 and 65 billion in q4 2021 the larger transactions in the quarter were once again transactions occurring in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology subsectors pharmaceutical and biotechnology transactions accounted for five of the ten largest transactions in the quarter however companies in these subsectors are more likely to be publicly traded than companies in other subsectors and are therefore more likely to disclose transaction value

hopes of tackling inflation and bringing down deficits washington not as robust as the proposal president joe biden once envisioned to rebuild america s public infrastructure and family support systems the democrats compromise of health care climate change and deficit reduction strategies is still a substantial undertaking the estimated 740 billion package passed sunday by the senate and heading to the house is full of party priorities those include capping prescription drug costs at 2 000 out of pocket for seniors helping americans pay for private health insurance and what democrats are calling the most substantial investment in history to fight climate change some 375 billion over the decade almost half the money raised 300 billion will go toward paying down federal deficits it s all paid for largely with new corporate taxes including a 15 minimum tax on big corporations to ensure they don t skip out on paying any taxes at all as well as projected federal savings from lower medicare drug costs how does the inflation reduction act reduce inflation called the inflation reduction act of 2022 it s not at all clear the 755 page bill will substantially ease inflationary pressures though millions of americans are expected to see some relief in health care and other costs when will the house vote on the inflation reduction act votes fell strictly along party lines in the 50 50 senate with all democrats in favor all republicans opposed and vice president kamala harris providing a tie breaking vote for 51 50 passage the house is expected to vote by friday a look at

budget rules and republicans stripped it from the final bill help pay for health insurance the bill would extend the subsidies provided during the covid 19 pandemic to help some americans who buy health insurance on their own under earlier pandemic relief the extra help was set to expire this year but the bill would allow the assistance to keep going for three more years lowering insurance premiums for people who are purchasing their own health care policies single biggest investment in climate change in u s history the bill would invest nearly 375 billion over the decade in climate change fighting strategies including investments in renewable energy production and tax rebates for consumers to buy new or used electric vehicles it s broken down to include 60 billion for a clean energy manufacturing tax credit and 30 billion for a production tax credit for wind and solar seen as ways to boost and support the industries that can help curb the country s dependence on fossil

cut greenhouse gas emissions 40 by 2030 and would represent the single biggest climate investment in u s history by far how to pay for all of this the biggest revenue raiser in the bill is a new 15 minimum tax on corporations that earn more than 1 billion in annual profits it s a way to clamp down on some 200 u s companies that avoid paying the standard 21 corporate tax rate including some that end up paying no taxes at all the new corporate minimum tax would kick in after the 2022 tax year and raise more than 258 billion over the decade the revenue would have been higher but sinema insisted on one change to the 15 corporate minimum allowing a depreciation deduction used by manufacturing industries that shaves about 55 billion off the total revenue what s changed in recent days to win

rate the left has for years sought to boost the carried interest tax rate hiked to 37 in the original bill more in line with upper income earners sinema wouldn t allow it keeping the tax break for the

american bloodstock industry and last year was appointed the vice president of sales at keeneland he would have returned home in any event for ceremonial and networking duties but has even greater impetus as one of the six declared runners persian force was bred by his family lacy s father tom and brother barry produced the mehmas colt from their ballyheashill stud in county offaly the second foal out of the unraced lope de vega mare vida amorosa was bought by tally ho stud for 75 000 92 026 as a foal from the goffs november foal sale and pinhooked onwards for 225 000 262 878 to peter and ross doyle at the orby there was an immediate return from persian force as he appeared in the brocklesby stakes at doncaster streaking almost five lengths clear second for richard hannon and amo racing to bradsell in the coventry stakes g2 at royal ascot he will take that rival on again fresh from a smooth victory in the close brothers july stakes g2 at newmarket photo edward whitaker racing post persian force powers away from the field to land the july stakes at newmarket having a connection with a runner in a group 1 is always exciting but having this double tiered connection is especially exciting this year said lacy i m very privileged to be able to do this and excited for my brother and father to be cheering on a horse that has been very progressive this year my father is 86 and this is brilliant for him richard hannon has been very excited about the horse s prospects from a very early stage and this time last year when i came home i actually saw persian force at tally ho when he was being prepped for the yearling sales the moment is quite a notable one for the whole family as lacy explained our first connection came when we won the keeneland phoenix sprint stakes back in 1988 he said it was a fillies sprint back then but my father trained a filly called ingabelle who was the granddam of chriselliam who won the 2013 breeders cup juvenile fillies turf g1t for co owner willie carson i think that was keeneland s first or second year to do that back at the old phoenix park it s been a long relationship and the european market is extremely important to keeneland so sponsorship is a way of giving back shannon arvin keeneland president and ceo was at ascot for the race we sponsored recently she had an excellent time and we re going to be entertaining a large group of people there so it s all interconnecting for me certainly being a head of sales is a huge privilege and now to have a connection in a much different way with a 2 year old that s running in a group 1 that we have bred and has a great chance in it is very exciting lacy was planning to fit in another brief visit to tally ho to have a look at the next yearling from vida amorosa an inns of court colt who was bought by the o callaghan family at 80 000 90 939 and is also penciled in for the orby her first foal persian force s full brother gubbass won last year s weatherbys super sprint for the hannon stable and finished third in the unibet richmond stakes g2 since my father retired from training he s been focusing on breeding with a small number of mares with my brother he said it s always tough to breed a high class horse on any level but it s certainly exciting with a young mare like this with two foals and two black type tally ho have been supportive from the get go they bought gubbass and then because they felt good about what happened there they came back and were adamant they wanted to buy her third foal and he s seemingly a very nice colt as well my family have also been supportive of the tally ho stallions over the years and they ve bought our foals we re friends but it s been a good business and personal relationship for many years as soon as duties at the curragh are over lacy must return to kentucky as there are only a few weeks before the first lot goes under the hammer at the 2022 keeneland september yearling sale the first of a frantic spell of auctions we ve been working on the september sale from honestly february or march with planning inspections once the entry process is done then placement book creation he says now we re really in the operational aspect of it for the next few weeks making sure everything is tied down without travel restrictions it s more or less business as usual last year it was very complicated for international travelers and it made it very frustrating we ve had very positive feedback from a lot of international buyers who want to come both for september and the november breeding stock sale and we re very much in the planning stages for that as well gathering up all the final entries that s held immediately after the breeders cup also at keeneland so it s a very busy year for us we projected we ll have approximately 11 000 horses rotate through the grounds over about two and a half months between september october and november the logistics are pretty incredible but we ve got an amazing team time certainly flies so thankfully this was a nice little opportunity to get home for a long weekend and catch up with everybody here
the present lineup of american motorcycle maker harley davidson includes many incredible two wheeled machines the fat bob is one of them described by the u s bike maker as a street eater built with muscular style and performance the bike is not necessarily a go to platform for customizers yet when one does slip through the cracks the result is usually quite spectacular enter the performer a fat bob based conversion handled by the guys over at switzerland based bundnerbike it s an older project of theirs but one that departs the usual way of customizing fat bobs to such an extent that it would probably forever be worth a mention like all harley bikes and all other bikes in general the fat bob comes when in stock form with curved lines not this one though as the custom in house made fuel tank and the extreme conversion at the rear place some very well crafted straight lines that make this conversion rather unique propper on carbon fiber wheels and an ohlins suspension system and fork conversion the fat bob also got some engine tweaks that increased its power to nearly 132 hp and 197 nm of torque the engine breathes through a very custom and very visible exhaust system while stopping power is ensured by means of brembo hardware all while the rider is seated on a perfectly straight saddle that to these eyes looks rather uncomfortable but to bundnerbike it represents the perfect way to ensure the optimal racing position aided in this mission by the position and shape of the footrests nicknamed the performer the bike has a sticker that reads chf 85 000 which is almost 90 000 in american money we are unable to tell if this exact one is still up for grabs but the shop can easily replicate it if you ve got the desire and money

today the us met this fact the economy is not in a recession two months of negative gdp growth does not make a recession and as the new york times admitted joe biden was right about the economy which in july added 528 000 jobs numbers like that are usually placed in the boom rather than recession category and we should expect this economy to continue booming well past the midterms why because the us has actually been adding an average of 400 000 jobs over the past three months also wages enjoyed a considerable bump also unemployment is at its lowest level in 50 years also gas prices are still falling all of this adds up to an economy that will not be there for the gop which put all of its midterm eggs in the inflation and recession basket how did the gop and political mainstream not seen this coming i did i knew that negative gdp growth was a fuzzy indicator particularly in a novel situation the post lockdown world i also knew that a recession that does not follow a market crash or a catastrophic war tends to be mild or of little importance think of the 60s i also knew that job and wage growth made stagflation high unemployment combined with inflation impossible i also knew that one should only worry about a crash and consequent recession if wall street claims a market boom is going to last forever when you hear that run for the hills and so we are looking at a week that will remove certainty from the midterms on tuesday kansas made it clear that the supreme court s destruction of roe v wade is deeply unpopular with american voters today s jobs report means abortion rights will not be effectively drowned out by an economic downturn if the gop does not reclaim the house in 2022 people will only have to look back to the first week of august to see why and it gets worse trump sent a bunch of election deniers into important races nothing will sound more irrelevant to suburban and independent voters than all of this fanatical stop the steal talk particularly after another round of the jan 6 committee hearings but one must be impressed with how loud the recession drum was banged it wasn t just fox news it was on every major network including cnn it was all of the major papers every day two months in a row gop recession talking points on all sides louder and louder until it crashed today if i am not for myself who will be for me so this newsletter which generated more hate mail than i ve seen since the iraq war is looking pretty good this morning paul krugman paulkrugman august 5 2022 but the right will win at the end of the day why because it has locked the democrats in an economic structure determined by two questionable factors interest rates and full employment what this means is that the democrats have to over perform in conditions determined by the business class by the gop by the rich if the dems fuck up even a little they are still in hot soup for example if today s job report was a solid 250 000 jobs wall street s estimate then the recession talk would have exploded into a storm that raged until november it took a blockbuster report to silence the gop as for interest rates the feds will likely raise them to cool inflation which will rise they argue because so many americans have jobs rate hikes will only make life harder for workers and better for lenders their impact on inflation is dubious because the driving force behind high gas prices is greed rather than scarcity or war or what have you while you were feeling pain at the pump shell exxon and chevron raked in 46 billion in profits over the last three months and said they would spend up to 47 billion on stock buybacks after spending 18 8 billion so far this year yes it s time for a windfall profits tax bernie sanders sensanders july 29 2022 democratically speaking what s needed here is not higher interest rates but an income policy that redistributes the exceptional profits gained from inflated prices in a given sector of the economy this thinking which makes sense in a capitalist context is offered by the post keynesians pdf as for a future recession i would pay more attention to mainstream democrats obsession with reducing deficits taking money out of an economy does nothing positive for the working classes the lower the deficits the greater chance of a crash because job creation is driven by business investments this is the structure of american capitalism this is a point made by the adherents of modern monetary theory but was first expressed by post keynesians associated with and inspired by hyman minsky a recession can also be caused by biden doing too well because economic stability as minsky famously pointed out is inherently destabilizing this is one of the many paradoxes of a capitalist economy that only become visible when macro results are linked with micro actors orthodox economists don t do this they stick with the behavior of individuals with the assumption they are rational and have access to all market information marxists have contradictions an unfortunate consequence of hegel s influence i m a marxist until we reach talk about contradictions which are contaminated by a teleology that defined 19th century german idealism post keynesian paradoxes don t have any metaphysical baggage as such they better explain the worldly processes of capitalism but at the end of the day marxism is the higher economic reasoning because it recognizes that we need to go beyond capitalism a system that s not resolved by the improved distribution of wealth as moishe postone a heterodox marxist explained again and again until his death in 2017 capitalism is not about wealth but value culturally constructed value and as marx pointed out in the first volume of capital value is social cultural not material mainstream democrats are nowhere near this kind of thinking it s an alien planet to them their world is entirely shaped by the right and their news channels and websites i will end with another paradox which has to do with wealth rather than value the left from mainstream democrats down to social democrats are better at capitalism
4 09pm nasdaq composite salvages positive week despite friday losses the dow closed friday up 75 points 0 2 at 32 802 while the nasdaq composite dipped 63 points 0 5 to 12 658 and the s p 500 ticked 7 points lower 0 2 to 4 145 the benchmarks all ended higher on the week though despite the nasdaq composite and s p ending the day in negative territory the week ended with a volatile day of trading in response to the july jobs report the us added 528 000 jobs last month well ahead of a dow jones estimate of 258 000 the unemployment rate dropped to 3 5 compared to a 3 6 estimate meanwhile wage growth increased 0 5 from june and came in 5 2 higher than a year ago that could mean more rate increases from the federal reserve according to art hogan chief market strategist at b riley financial anybody that jumped on the fed is going to pivot next year and start cutting rates is going to have to get off at the next station because that s not in the cards hogan said according to cnbc it is clearly a situation where the economy is not screeching or heading into a recession here and now 12 05pm us stocks struggle while labor market is on fire all three major us indices were in the red at midday as the american economy added more than 500 000 jobs in july causing investors to fear the us federal reserve s next move in september on inflation rates the dow jones industrial average was down 0 5 at 32 577 points the s p 500 was down by 0 8 at 4 117 and the nasdaq composite was down by 1 3 at 12 559 the us economy is still firing on all cylinders if today s jobs report is anything to go by pointing the way to more rate increases this year according to chris beauchamp chief market analyst at online trading platform ig beauchamp noted that equities wobbled in the wake of today s us jobs report but have managed to stabilise during the course of the afternoon suggesting that this bear market bounce is not doomed yet the solid jobs number falling unemployment rate and rising wage figures show that the us economy unlike many others continues to strengthen even as the fed ratchets up its tightening programme thus it appears that the fed can push on yet further putting another 75 bps rise in play for september this has put new fight into the dollar but equities have seen the positive side too shrugging off losses on hopes that the us consumer can remain resilient too beauchamp said at midday the major movers included software production company atlassian nasdaq team up 13 as their 4q earnings beat estimates plus constellation energy was up 8 5 on strong 2q results also at

deflates recession fears us stocks plummeted into the red at the open on friday after jobs data for the month of july showed the american labor market remains red hot despite inflationary pressures and talk of layoffs just after the open the dow jones industrial average had dipped 210 points or 0 6 at 32 510 points the s p 500 was down 40 points or 0 9 at 4 113 points and the nasdaq composite was down 172 points or 1 3 at 12 548 points kingswood holdings limited lse kwg investment strategist rupert thompson said today s employment numbers made it all the more unlikely that the us had entered a recession as consecutive falls in gdp seen in both the first and second quarters would normally suggest the data can only encourage the fed to continue tightening policy at a rapid pace particularly as wages posted another strong gain in july and there is minimal sign yet of any easing in underlying inflation pressures thompson said in terms of major movers virgin galactic holdings

down to 3 5 or 5 7 million people whereas analysts had expected this measure to remain steady at 3 6 job growth was widespread led by gains in leisure and hospitality professional and business services and health care the us bureau of labor statistics said both total nonfarm employment and the unemployment rate have returned to their february 2020 pre pandemic levels shortly after the release of the data futures for the three major us indexes had turned red with the dow jones industrial average down 0 4 the s p 500 down 0 7 and the nasdaq composite down 0 9 6 30am jobs jobs jobs us

expected to see 250k jobs added which coincidentally was the forecast for june which was beaten quite comfortably said michael hewson chief market analyst at cmc markets uk it will still be the lowest number this year however the strength of the labor market may well be starting to increase in the level of importance when it comes to how aggressive the fed is likely to be when it comes to tackling inflation he added if the labor market shows signs of weakening the us federal reserve may well be dissuaded from continuing on its aggressive path of interest rate increases while the rate setters primary concerns are about reining in inflation they are also hoping that their actions do not plunge the country into a prolonged period of weak growth a weak jobs number could temper the fed s hawkishness but it would have to be a shockingly low number or even negative said hewson additionally he noted weekly jobless claims have been rising steadily for three months and are back above 250 000 the rise in jobless claims appears to be the first sign the us labor market is showing signs of weakness even if this isn t being reflected in the actual numbers added hewson he also noted that

the 740 billion package is made up of health care climate change and deficit reduction strategies in hopes of tackling inflation and bringing down deficits example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video washington not as robust as the proposal president joe biden once envisioned to rebuild america s public infrastructure and family support systems the democrats compromise of health care climate change and deficit reduction strategies is still a substantial undertaking the estimated 740 billion package passed sunday by the senate and heading to the house is full of party priorities those include capping prescription drug costs at 2 000 out of pocket for seniors helping americans pay for private health insurance and what democrats are calling the most substantial investment in history to fight climate change some 375 billion over the decade almost half the money raised 300 billion will go toward paying down federal deficits it s all paid for largely with new corporate taxes including a 15 minimum tax on big corporations to ensure they don t skip out on paying any taxes at all as well as projected federal savings from lower medicare drug costs how does the inflation reduction act reduce inflation called the inflation reduction act of 2022 it s not at all clear the 755 page bill will substantially ease inflationary pressures though millions of americans are expected to see some relief in health care and other costs when will the house vote on the inflation reduction act votes fell strictly along party lines in the 50 50 senate with all democrats in favor all republicans opposed and vice president kamala harris providing a tie breaking vote for 51 50 passage the house is expected to vote by friday a look at what s in and out of the final package lower prescription drug costs launching a long sought goal the bill would allow the medicare program to negotiate prescription drug prices with pharmaceutical companies saving the federal government some 288 billion over the 10 year budget window those new revenues would be put back into lower costs for seniors on medications including a 2 000 out of pocket cap for older adults buying prescriptions from pharmacies the money would also be used to provide free vaccinations for seniors who now are among the few not guaranteed free access according to a summary document seniors would also have insulin prices capped at 35 a dose a provision to extend that price cap on insulin to americans with private health insurances was out of line with senate budget rules and republicans stripped it from the final bill help pay for health insurance the bill would extend the subsidies provided during the covid 19 pandemic to help some americans who buy health insurance on their own under earlier pandemic relief the extra help was set to expire this year but the bill would allow the assistance to keep going for three more years lowering insurance premiums for people who are purchasing their own health care policies single biggest investment in climate change in u s history the bill would invest nearly 375 billion over the decade in climate change fighting strategies including investments in renewable energy production and tax rebates for consumers to buy new or used electric vehicles it s broken down to include 60 billion for a clean energy manufacturing tax credit and 30 billion for a production tax credit for wind and solar seen as ways to boost and support the industries that can help curb the country s dependence on fossil fuels the bill also gives tax credits for nuclear power and carbon capture technology that oil companies such as exxon mobil have invested millions of dollars to advance the bill would impose a new fee on excess methane emissions from oil and gas drilling while giving fossil fuel companies access to more leases on federal lands and waters a late addition pushed by sen kyrsten sinema d ariz and other democrats in arizona nevada and colorado would designate 4 billion to combat a mega drought in the west including conservation efforts in the colorado river basin which nearly 40 million americans rely on for drinking water for consumers there are tax breaks as incentives to go green one is a 10 year consumer tax credit for renewable energy investments in wind and solar there are tax breaks for buying electric vehicles including a 4 000 tax credit for purchase of used electric vehicles and 7 500 for new ones in all democrats believe the strategy could put the country on a path to cut greenhouse gas emissions 40 by 2030 and would represent the single biggest climate investment in u s history by far how to pay for all of this the biggest revenue raiser in the bill is a new 15 minimum tax on corporations that earn more than 1 billion in annual profits it s a way to clamp down on some 200 u s companies that avoid paying the standard 21 corporate tax rate including some that end up paying no taxes at all the new corporate minimum tax would kick in after the 2022 tax year and raise more than 258 billion over the decade the revenue would have been higher but sinema insisted on one change to the 15 corporate minimum allowing a depreciation deduction used by manufacturing industries that shaves about 55 billion off the total revenue what s changed in recent days to win over sinema democrats dropped plans to close a tax loophole long enjoyed by wealthier americans so called carried interest which under current law taxes wealthy hedge fund managers and others at a 20 rate the left has for years sought to boost the carried interest tax rate hiked to 37 in the original bill more in line with upper income earners sinema wouldn t allow it keeping the tax break for the wealthy deprives the party of 14 billion in revenue they were counting on to help pay for the package in its place democrats with sinema s nod will impose a 1 excise tax on stock buybacks raising some 74 billion over the decade money is also raised by boosting the irs to go after tax cheats the bill proposes an 80 billion investment in taxpayer services enforcement and modernization which is projected to raise 203 billion in new revenue a net gain of 124 billion over the decade the bill sticks with biden s original pledge not to raise taxes on families or businesses making less than 400 000 a year the lower drug prices for seniors are paid for with savings from medicare s negotiations with the drug companies extra money to pay down deficits with some 740 billion in new revenue and around 433 billion in new investments the bill promises to put the difference toward deficit reduction federal deficits spiked during the covid 19 pandemic when federal spending soared and tax revenues fell as the nation s economy churned through shutdowns closed offices and other massive changes the nation has seen deficits rise and fall in recent years but overall federal budgeting is on an unsustainable path according to the congressional budget office which put out a new report this week on long term projections what s left behind this latest package emerged suddenly at the end of july after 18 months of start stop negotiations leaves behind many of biden s more ambitious goals senate majority leader chuck schumer d n y struck a deal with sen joe manchin to revive biden s package slimming it down to bring the west virginia democrat back to the negotiating table next they drew sinema the remaining party holdout with additional changes the package remains robust by typical standards but nowhere near the sweeping build back better program biden once envisioned while congress did pass a 1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill for highways broadband and other investments that biden signed into law last year the president s and the party s other key priorities have slipped away among them is a continuation of a 300 monthly child tax credit that was sending

posted friday august 5 2022 5 32 pm by jeff chudzinski north country this week canton st lawrence county legislators have signed off on approval for an 80 million bond for st lawrence university that will come at no expense to the county or industrial development agency the passing of the resolution which is a technical formality to allow st lawrence to secure a municipal bond means the ida will now have to finalize the process before the bonds are sold on the open market as described by patrick kelly director of the ida morgan stanley will facilitate the sale of the bonds on wall street with private equity firms purchasing the bonds and essentially lending the money to the university funds from the bonds will be used to primarily complete necessary repairs and upgrades to many historical buildings on campus including academic buildings dormitories and various other infrastructure around campus the remaining portion of the bond roughly 36 million will be used to refinance an existing bond to a much lower interest rate officials say the restructuring and refinancing of the bond will place the university in a much more advantageous and fiscally sound position to spend or bond in the future officials say legislator harry smithers spoke in support of the resolution citing st lawrence s commitment to and investment in the north country we can t override their non profit status and i don t begrudge them that he said to emphasize our role in this we re just kind of an avenue to authorize the tax exempt role that is going to be in play so it doesn t cost st lawrence county we re not putting any money into this just to be sure the public knows we are not giving them finances he continued legislator jim reagen also spoke to the potential job creation that will come from the projects on campus who is going to get those contracts it s going to be local pavers local roofing companies it s going to be local contractors movers all kinds of folks who are looking for employment and this will help st lawrence university compete for students he said reagen continued on saying it has become increasingly more difficult to fill campuses and the global competition for students has only intensified we are helping a future employer that offers a great deal to our quality of life to compete in global market for students to bring students and families faculty and staff to st lawrence county he said reagen also commented on the tax exempt status of the local universities mentioning the new york power authority and ogdensburg psychiatric center have long enjoyed tax exemptions that helped maintain hundreds of jobs in the north country not all legislators agreed with backing the bonds however as legislator larry denesha voted against the resolution for philosophical differences not to diminish any of the contributions st lawrence makes as to the higher education they provide however this is another example i know there is no cost to st lawrence county they are a 501 c 3 and as such not subject to property taxes and if all 501 c 3 around the county hospitals churches schools if you add it up you probably have less than 50 of the people paying 100 of the taxes he said st lawrence university like all north country schools is a registered 501 c 3 organization and has held that status since 1933 legislator kevin acres also highlighted the economic impact the university has on the local economy saying the 270 million annually contributed to the economy from just that little campus was nearly double the 139 million local dairy farms add to the economy acres went on further saying it was prudent for the legislature to approve the bonds to better position st lawrence financially for the future

the 740 billion package is made up of health care climate change and deficit reduction strategies in hopes of tackling inflation and bringing down deficits example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video washington not as robust as the proposal president joe biden once envisioned to rebuild america s public infrastructure and family support systems the democrats compromise of health care climate change and deficit reduction strategies is still a substantial undertaking the estimated 740 billion package passed sunday by the senate and heading to the house is full of party priorities those include capping prescription drug costs at 2 000 out of pocket for seniors helping americans pay for private health insurance and what democrats are calling the most substantial investment in history to fight climate change some 375 billion over the decade almost half the money raised 300 billion will go toward paying down federal deficits it s all paid for largely with new corporate taxes including a 15 minimum tax on big corporations to ensure they don t skip out on paying any taxes at all as well as projected federal savings from lower medicare drug costs how does the inflation reduction act reduce inflation called the inflation reduction act of 2022 it s not at all clear the 755 page bill will substantially ease inflationary pressures though millions of americans are expected to see some relief in health care and other costs when will the house vote on the inflation reduction act votes fell strictly along party lines in the 50 50 senate with all democrats in favor all republicans opposed and vice president kamala harris providing a tie breaking vote for 51 50 passage the house is expected to vote by friday a look at what s in and out of the final package lower prescription drug costs launching a long sought goal the bill would allow the medicare program to negotiate prescription drug prices with pharmaceutical companies saving the federal government some 288 billion over the 10 year budget window those new revenues would be put back into lower costs for seniors on medications including a 2 000 out of pocket cap for older adults buying prescriptions from pharmacies the money would also be used to provide free vaccinations for seniors who now are among the few not guaranteed free access according to a summary document seniors would also have insulin prices capped at 35 a dose a provision to extend that price cap on insulin to americans with private health insurances was out of line with senate budget rules and republicans stripped it from the final bill help pay for health insurance the bill would extend the subsidies provided during the covid 19 pandemic to help some americans who buy health insurance on their own under earlier pandemic relief the extra help was set to expire this year but the bill would allow the assistance to keep going for three more years lowering insurance premiums for people who are purchasing their own health care policies single biggest investment in climate change in u s history the bill would invest nearly 375 billion over the decade in climate change fighting strategies including investments in renewable energy production and tax rebates for consumers to buy new or used electric vehicles it s broken down to include 60 billion for a clean energy manufacturing tax credit and 30 billion for a production tax credit for wind and solar seen as ways to boost and support the industries that can help curb the country s dependence on fossil fuels the bill also gives tax credits for nuclear power and carbon capture technology that oil companies such as exxon mobil have invested millions of dollars to advance the bill would impose a new fee on excess methane emissions from oil and gas drilling while giving fossil fuel companies access to more leases on federal lands and waters a late addition pushed by sen kyrsten sinema d ariz and other democrats in arizona nevada and colorado would designate 4 billion to combat a mega drought in the west including conservation efforts in the colorado river basin which nearly 40 million americans rely on for drinking water for consumers there are tax breaks as incentives to go green one is a 10 year consumer tax credit for renewable energy investments in wind and solar there are tax breaks for buying electric vehicles including a 4 000 tax credit for purchase of used electric vehicles and 7 500 for new ones in all democrats believe the strategy could put the country on a path to cut greenhouse gas emissions 40 by 2030 and would represent the single biggest climate investment in u s history by far how to pay for all of this the biggest revenue raiser in the bill is a new 15 minimum tax on corporations that earn more than 1 billion in annual profits it s a way to clamp down on some 200 u s companies that avoid paying the standard 21 corporate tax rate including some that end up paying no taxes at all the new corporate minimum tax would kick in after the 2022 tax year and raise more than 258 billion over the decade the revenue would have been higher but sinema insisted on one change to the 15 corporate minimum allowing a depreciation deduction used by manufacturing industries that shaves about 55 billion off the total revenue what s changed in recent days to win over sinema democrats dropped plans to close a tax loophole long enjoyed by wealthier americans so called carried interest which under current law taxes wealthy hedge fund managers and others at a 20 rate the left has for years sought to boost the carried interest tax rate hiked to 37 in the original bill more in line with upper income earners sinema wouldn t allow it keeping the tax break for the wealthy deprives the party of 14 billion in revenue they were counting on to help pay for the package in its place democrats with sinema s nod will impose a 1 excise tax on stock buybacks raising some 74 billion over the decade money is also raised by boosting the irs to go after tax cheats the bill proposes an 80 billion investment in taxpayer services enforcement and modernization which is projected to raise 203 billion in new revenue a net gain of 124 billion over the decade the bill sticks with biden s original pledge not to raise taxes on families or businesses making less than 400 000 a year the lower drug prices for seniors are paid for with savings from medicare s negotiations with the drug companies extra money to pay down deficits with some 740 billion in new revenue and around 433 billion in new investments the bill promises to put the difference toward deficit reduction federal deficits spiked during the covid 19 pandemic when federal spending soared and tax revenues fell as the nation s economy churned through shutdowns closed offices and other massive changes the nation has seen deficits rise and fall in recent years but overall federal budgeting is on an unsustainable path according to the congressional budget office which put out a new report this week on long term projections what s left behind this latest package emerged suddenly at the end of july after 18 months of start stop negotiations leaves behind many of biden s more ambitious goals senate majority leader chuck schumer d n y struck a deal with sen joe manchin to revive biden s package slimming it down to bring the west virginia democrat back to the negotiating table next they drew sinema the remaining party holdout with additional changes the package remains robust by typical standards but nowhere near the sweeping build back better program biden once envisioned while congress did pass a 1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill for highways broadband and other investments that biden signed into law last year the president s and the party s other key priorities have slipped away among them is a continuation of a 300 monthly child tax credit that was sending money directly to families during the pandemic and is believed to have widely reduced child poverty also gone for now are plans for free pre kindergarten and community college as well as the nation s first paid family leave program that would have provided up to 4 000 a month for births deaths and other pivotal needs ___

sens elizabeth warren d mass and alex padilla d calif recently asked the department of transportation to fine airlines for delays and cancellations and prevent airline consolidation the widespread delays and cancellations are indeed annoying but the senators demands won t help any more than congress last airline blunder did remember the last airline bailouts during the pandemic politicians were fooled into handing out billions so that among other things airlines could keep their workers and be travel ready when more passengers started flying again airlines got the money passengers eventually returned and somehow the airlines still weren t staffed and prepared the bailouts didn t cause the mess we are in but they didn t prevent it recall just how much the airlines received throughout the pandemic the 10 major passenger airlines pocketed direct payments of more than 54 billion in rounds of 25 billion 15 billion and 14 billion plus another 25 billion in subsidized loans from the treasury department and a suspension of the 7 5 excise tax on domestic air travel also receiving handouts were airports and airport contractors in exchange the airlines were required to use the funds for payroll they couldn t furlough workers for a time or reduce pay or benefits nor could airlines buy back shares of their stock or pay shareholder dividends they also had to limit executive compensation finally they would eventually have to repay a small fraction of the money the first bailout 25 billion in 2020 s cares act did manage to prevent airlines from furloughing everyone and shutting down it required airlines to continue flying to all destinations while reduced frequencies were permitted about 90 000 people per day down from 2 million managed to travel by air during the pandemic s height was this outcome worth billions no airlines had just enjoyed 10 solid years of remarkable profits they were not at risk of disappearing and owning lots of valuable assets had tremendous access to capital markets for needed liquidity even in the worst case scenario airlines could go through the bankruptcy process continue to fly safely while doing so and emerge healthier either way the airlines pleas for handouts were idiotic there was contrary to their insistence no systemic risk associated with closing or going bankrupt if the first bailout was unjustified the second and third bailouts were total wastes they were at least 10 times larger than what was needed to cover the payroll of those workers at risk of being furloughed and so most of the money was used to pay workers whose jobs were never at risk shareholders pocketed the difference and the airlines then furloughed loads of workers anyway also while airlines continued to pay pilots pilot training wasn t kept up to date thus preventing some from returning to the skies when passenger demand returned uncle sam s unwarranted generosity with other people s money and its implicit message weren t lost on airline bosses delta ceo ed bastian for instance told investors during a speech that it was worth investing in airlines since even in the worst crisis imaginable we ve proven ourselves we ve proven the value of what we bring to society we ve proven that governments will be there for us if ever needed again hopefully never again while warren pushed for some corporate accountability and padilla joined the senate late in the bailout process the senators were ultimately willing participants in the scam they also supported legislation that sent individuals checks regardless of need thus creating large disincentives to return to work this likely contributed to the airlines labor shortages now these politicos are outraged and want to fine airlines for delays and prevent them from merging a move often required to survive warren and padilla s demands will hurt passengers rather than help them instead the senators should pledge never to bail out airlines again that might not prevent airlines from coming out of an emergency without cancellations and flight delays but at least taxpayers won t in the process be fleeced also knowing they will have to fly solo next time airlines shareholders may do a better job of planning for emergencies while they re all at it they could work together to lift the requirement that u s commercial pilots have 1 500 flight hours before being hired european pilots who are just as safe as american pilots don t face such a strict requirement also helpful would be raising pilots retirement age higher than 65 more airline workers and more flights not bailouts and restrictions on mergers is the better policy veronique de rugy is a senior research fellow at the mercatus center at george mason university a columnist for reason magazine and the washington examiner and blogs about economics for national review click here to contact her and follow her on twitter veroderugy click here to read previous columns the opinions expressed are her own related stories

washington ap u s employers added an astonishing 528 000 jobs last month despite flashing warning signs of an economic downturn easing fears of a recession and handing president joe biden some good news heading into the midterm elections unemployment dropped another notch from 3 6 to 3 5 matching the more than 50 year low reached just before the pandemic took hold the economy has now recovered all 22 million jobs lost in march and april 2020 when covid 19 slammed the u s the red hot numbers reported friday by the labor department are certain to intensify the debate over whether the u s is in a recession recession what recession wrote brian coulton chief economist at fitch ratings the u s economy is creating new jobs at an annual rate of 6 million that s three times faster than what we normally see historically in a good year economists had expected only 250 000 new jobs last month in a drop off from june s revised 398 000 instead july proved to be the best month since february the strong figures are welcome news for the biden administration and the democrats at a time when many voters are worried about the economy inflation is raging at its highest level in more than 40 years and the economy has contracted for two quarters in a row which is the common but informal definition of a recession and does not take into account a host of other factors economists consider such as the job picture at the white house biden credited the job growth to his policies even as he acknowledged the pain being inflicted by inflation he emphasized the addition of 642 000 manufacturing jobs on his watch instead of workers begging employers for work we re seeing employers have to compete for american workers the president said biden has boosted job growth through his 1 9 trillion coronavirus relief package and 1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure law last year republican lawmakers and some leading economists however say the administration s spending has contributed to high inflation the president has received some other encouraging economic news in recent weeks as gasoline prices have steadily fallen after averaging slightly more than 5 a gallon in june on wall street stocks closed mostly lower friday the good news about job creation was mostly offset by worries that the federal reserve will have to keep aggressively raising interest rates to cool the economy and tamp down inflation the strength of the labor market in the face of rate tightening from the fed already this year clearly shows that the fed has more work to do said charlie ripley senior investment strategist at allianz investment management overall today s report should put the notion of a near term recession on the back burner for now the labor department also reported that hourly earnings posted a healthy 0 5 gain last month and are up 5 2 over the past year but that is not enough to keep up with inflation and many americans are having to scrimp to pay for groceries gasoline even school supplies job growth was especially strong last month in the health care industry and at hotels and restaurants the number of americans saying they had jobs rose by 179 000 while the number saying they were unemployed fell by 242 000 but 61 000 americans dropped out of the labor force in july trimming the share of those working or looking for work to 62 1 from 62 2 in june new yorker karen smalls 46 started looking for work three weeks ago as a member of the support staff for social workers i didn t realize how good the job market is right now she said after finishing her fifth interview this week you look at the news and see all these bad reports but the job market is amazing right now a single mother she is weighing several offers looking for one that is close to home and pays enough to let her take care of her two children two years ago the pandemic brought economic life to a near standstill as companies shut down and millions of people stayed home or were thrown out of work the u s plunged into a deep two month recession but massive government aid and the fed s decision to slash interest rates and pour money into financial markets fueled a surprisingly quick recovery caught off guard by the strength of the rebound factories shops ports and freight yards were overwhelmed with orders and scrambled to bring back the workers they furloughed when covid 19 hit the result has been shortages of employees and supplies delayed shipments and high inflation in june consumer prices were up 9 1 from a year earlier the biggest increase since 1981 the fed has raised its benchmark short term interest rate four times this year in a bid to tame inflation with more increases ahead labor secretary marty walsh conceded that businesses and consumers are worried about inflation but added companies are still growing and they re looking for employees and that s a good sign in a report filled with mostly good news the labor department did note that 3 9 million people were working part time for economic reasons in july up by 303 000 from june department economists said that reflected an increase in the number of people whose hours were cut because of slack business some employers are also reporting signs of slack in the job market aaron sanandres ceo and co founder untuckit an online clothing company with nearly 90 stores noticed that in the past few weeks that it has been a bit easier filling jobs at the corporate headquarters in new york and part time roles at the stores we have had a plethora of candidates sanandres said he also said the labor market has been loosening up for engineers probably as a result of some layoffs at technology companies simona mocuta chief economist at state street global advisors was among those stunned by the strong hiring numbers when other indicators show an economy losing momentum mocuta said it is possible that hiring rose so sharply last month because job candidates seeing signs of an impending slowdown are now more willing to accept jobs they would have balked at earlier in the year conditions may now be shifting in employers favor she said whatever the reason for it the employment data released friday shows an astonishingly strong and resilient job market underestimate the u s labor market at your own peril said nick bunker head of economic research at the indeed hiring lab yes output growth might be slowing and the economic outlook has some clouds on the horizon but employers are still champing at the bit to hire more workers that demand may fade but it s still red hot right now ____ josh boak

article not as robust as the 4 trillion proposal president joe biden once envisioned to rebuild america s public infrastructure and family support systems the democrats compromise of health care climate change and deficit reduction strategies is still a substantial undertaking and on track for senate passage sunday the estimated 740 billion package is full of party priorities including capping prescription drug costs at 2 000 out of pocket for seniors helping americans pay for private health insurance and what democrats are calling the most substantial investment in history to fight climate change almost half the money 300 billion will go toward paying down federal deficits it s all paid for largely with new corporate taxes including a 15 minimum tax on big corporations to ensure they don t skip out on paying any taxes at all called the inflation reduction act of 2022 it s not at all clear the 755 page bill will substantially ease inflationary pressures though millions of americans are expected to see some relief in health care and other costs votes are expected to fall along party lines with all senate democrats in favor and all republicans opposed once the bill clears the senate the house is expected to vote next week here s a look at what s in and out of the final package lower prescription drug costs launching a long sought goal the bill would allow the medicare program to negotiate prescription drug prices with pharmaceutical companies saving the federal government some 288 billion over the 10 year budget window those new revenues would be put back into lower costs for seniors on medications including a 2 000 out of pocket cap for older adults buying prescriptions from pharmacies related mark cuban backed online pharmacy promises to slash prescription drug prices the money would also be used to provide free vaccinations for seniors who now are among the few not guaranteed free access according to a summary document seniors would also have insulin prices capped at 35 a dose though a provision to extend that price cap on insulin to americans with private health insurances was out of line with senate budget rules and republicans stripped it from the final bill help pay for health insurance the bill would extend the subsidies provided during the covid 19 pandemic to help some americans who buy health insurance on their own under earlier pandemic relief the extra help was set to expire this year but the bill would allow the assistance to keep going for three more years lowering insurance premiums for people who are purchasing their own health care policies single biggest investment in climate change in u s history the bill would invest nearly 374 billion over the decade in climate change fighting strategies including investments in renewable energy production and tax rebates for consumers to buy new or used electric vehicles it s broken down to include 60 billion for a clean energy manufacturing tax credit and 30 billion for a production tax credit for wind and solar seen as ways to boost and support the industries that can help curb the country s dependence on fossil fuels the bill also gives tax credits for nuclear power and carbon capture technology that oil companies such as exxon mobil have invested millions of dollars to advance the bill would impose a new fee on excess methane emissions from oil and gas drilling while giving fossil fuel companies access to more leases on federal lands and waters a late addition pushed by sen kyrsten sinema and other democrats in arizona nevada and colorado would designate 4 billion to combat a mega drought in the west including conservation efforts in the colorado river basin which nearly 40 million american rely on for drinking water for consumers there are tax breaks as incentives to go green one is a 10 year consumer tax credit for renewable energy investments in wind and solar there are tax breaks for buying electric vehicles including a 4 000 tax credit for purchase of used electric vehicles and 7 500 for new ones in all democrats believe the strategy could put the country on a path to cut greenhouse gas emissions 40 by 2030 and would represent the single biggest climate investment in u s history by far related these electric vehicles are cheaper to own than gas ones now how to pay for all of this the biggest revenue raiser in the bill is a new 15 minimum tax on corporations that earn more than 1 billion in annual profits it s a way to clamp down on some 200 u s companies that avoid paying the standard 21 corporate tax rate including some that end up paying no taxes at all the new corporate minimum tax would kick in after the 2022 tax year and raise some 258 billion over the decade the revenue would have been 313 billion but sinema insisted on one change to the 15 corporate minimum allowing a depreciation deduction used by manufacturing industries that shaves about 55 billion off the total revenue to win over sinema democrats dropped plans to close a tax loophole long enjoyed by wealthier americans the so called carried interest which under current law taxes wealthy hedge fund managers and others at a 20 rate the left has for years sought to boost the carried interest tax rate hiked to 37 in the original bill more in line with upper income earners sinema wouldn t allow it keeping the tax break for the wealthy deprives the party of 14 billion in revenue they were counting on to help pay for the package in its place democrats with sinema s nod will impose a 1 excise tax on stock buybacks raising some 74 billion over the decade money is also raised by boosting the irs to go after tax cheats the bill proposes an 80 billion investment in taxpayer services enforcement and modernization which is projected to raise 203 billion in new revenue a net gain of 124 billion over the decade the bill sticks with biden s original pledge not to raise taxes on families or businesses making less than 400 000 a year the lower drug prices for seniors are paid for with savings from medicare s negotiations with the drug companies extra money to pay down deficits with some 740 billion in new revenue and around 433 billion in new investments the bill promises to put the difference toward deficit reduction federal deficits spiked during the covid 19 pandemic when federal spending soared and tax revenues fell as the nation s economy churned through shutdowns closed offices and other massive changes the nation has seen deficits rise and fall in recent years but overall federal budgeting is on an unsustainable path according to the congressional budget office which put out a new report this week on long term projections what s left behind this latest package emerged suddenly at the end of july after 18 months of start stop negotiations leaves behind many of biden s more ambitious goals senate majority leader chuck schumer d n y struck a deal with sen joe manchin to revive biden s package slimming it down to bring the west virginia democrat back to the negotiating table next they drew sinema the remaining party holdout with additional changes the package remains robust by typical standards but nowhere near the sweeping build back better program biden once envisioned while congress did pass a 1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill for highways broadband and other investments that biden signed into law last year the president s and the party s other key priorities have slipped away previous what s in the infrastructure bill biden s signature measure explained among them is a continuation of a 300 monthly child tax credit that was sending money directly to families during the pandemic and is believed to have widely reduced child poverty

and economists last night accused the bank of england governor andrew bailey of talking down britain s prospects the beleaguered banker is facing a backlash over his handling of the economy mr bailey was accused of adding to a sense of panic with doom laden forecasts that britain will endure 15 months of recession and that inflation will pass 13 per cent critics said he was being too downbeat at a time when the nation needs reassurance and called for more optimism it came after tory leadership contender liz truss insisted that a recession was not inevitable if the government helped the economy grow by cutting taxes there has been increasing criticism that the bank has been asleep at the wheel and was too slow to increase interest rates to tame soaring inflation business leaders and economists last night accused the bank of england governor andrew bailey of talking down britain s prospects the beleaguered banker is facing a backlash over his handling of the economy mr bailey was yesterday forced to insist he will not quit early despite the mounting backlash at his position on thursday he and his colleagues on the bank s monetary policy committee mpc predicted inflation would hit 13 3 per cent in october and britain would tumble into a recession lasting five quarters as they raised interest rates to 1 75 per cent they also forecast household income taking into account the rise in the cost of living will fall by the largest amount since records began in the 1960s both this year and next former tory leader sir iain duncan smith said andrew bailey is in damage limitation mode the bank have got this past year badly wrong and they don t want to own up to it mr bailey was yesterday forced to insist he will not quit early despite the mounting backlash at his position on thursday he and his colleagues on the bank s monetary policy committee mpc predicted inflation would hit 13 3 per cent in october and britain would tumble into a recession lasting five quarters as they raised interest rates to 1 75 per cent stock image house prices start to dip house prices fell in july for the first time in more than a year figures from the uk s largest lender revealed the average cost of a home dropped by 0 1 per cent to 293 221 the first monthly decline since june 2021 experts warn it is a sign the red hot housing market is set to cool as the impact of the cost of living crisis and higher interest rates puts pressure on buyers the dip last month caused the average annual house price growth to slip to 11 8 per cent halifax said of all the regions wales came out on top with prices rising 14 7 per cent to 222 639 the south west saw the biggest rise in england a typical property cost 310 846 up 14 3 per cent russell galley from halifax said looking ahead house prices are likely to come under more pressure as the headwinds of rising interest rates and increased living costs take a firmer hold advertisement there s no reason why we have to head into a recession we don t have to go along with this ridiculous miserable orthodoxy liz is right we can cut taxes to boost growth he added andrew bailey is not just talking the economy down he is taking it down the british people get this idea that a recession is inevitable nothing is inevitable douglas mcwilliams deputy chairman of the centre for economics and business research think tank also criticised mr bailey for talking down britain s prospects the forecast looks worse than most others and if anything has added to a sense of panic he said the bank s gloomy predictions intensified the row between miss truss and her leadership rival rishi sunak over how to respond to the bleak economic outlook mr sunak says the foreign secretary s plan to cut taxes will fuel inflation meanwhile tens of millions of people have resorted to self imposed rationing of hot water light food and other essentials such as clothes according to the office for national statistics gerard lyons economic adviser to wealth manager netwealth and adviser to boris johnson during his time as london mayor also said mr bailey was very downbeat when delivering the doom laden news on thursday he compared mr bailey s sombre delivery with that of his peers at the us federal reserve when they forecast a recession in america last month mr lyons said the fed were essentially delivering the same message but they were far more reassuring there was a bit more optimism which bailey just didn t have advertisement tony danker head of the confederation of british industry said i hope that the bank of england are overly pessimistic about the length and depth of any recession

example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video the 740 billion package is made up of health care climate change and deficit reduction strategies in hopes of tackling inflation and bringing down deficits washington not as robust as the proposal president joe biden once envisioned to rebuild america s public infrastructure and family support systems the democrats compromise of health care climate change and deficit reduction strategies is still a substantial undertaking the estimated 740 billion package passed sunday by the senate and heading to the house is full of party priorities those include capping prescription drug costs at 2 000 out of pocket for seniors helping americans pay for private health insurance and what democrats are calling the most substantial investment in history to fight climate change some 375 billion over the decade almost half the money raised 300 billion will go toward paying down federal deficits it s all paid for largely with new corporate taxes including a 15 minimum tax on big corporations to ensure they don t skip out on paying any taxes at all as well as projected federal savings from lower medicare drug costs how does the inflation reduction act reduce inflation called the inflation reduction act of 2022 it s not at all clear the 755 page bill will substantially ease inflationary pressures though millions of americans are expected to see some relief in health care and other costs when will the house vote on the inflation reduction act votes fell strictly along party lines in the 50 50 senate with all democrats in favor all republicans opposed and vice president kamala harris providing a tie breaking vote for 51 50 passage the house is expected to vote by friday a look at what s in and out of the final package lower prescription drug costs launching a long sought goal the bill would allow the medicare program to negotiate prescription drug prices with pharmaceutical companies saving the federal government some 288 billion over the 10 year budget window those new revenues would be put back into lower costs for seniors on medications including a 2 000 out of pocket cap for older adults buying prescriptions from pharmacies the money would also be used to provide free vaccinations for seniors who now are among the few not guaranteed free access according to a summary document seniors would also have insulin prices capped at 35 a dose a provision to extend that price cap on insulin to americans with private health insurances was out of line with senate budget rules and republicans stripped it from the final bill help pay for health insurance the bill would extend the subsidies provided during the covid 19 pandemic to help some americans who buy health insurance on their own under earlier pandemic relief the extra help was set to expire this year but the bill would allow the assistance to keep going for three more years lowering insurance premiums for people who are purchasing their own health care policies single biggest investment in climate change in u s history the bill would invest nearly 375 billion over the decade in climate change fighting strategies including investments in renewable energy production and tax rebates for consumers to buy new or used electric vehicles it s broken down to include 60 billion for a clean energy manufacturing tax credit and 30 billion for a production tax credit for wind and solar seen as ways to boost and support the industries that can help curb the country s dependence on fossil fuels the bill also gives tax credits for nuclear power and carbon capture technology that oil companies such as exxon mobil have invested millions of dollars to advance the bill would impose a new fee on excess methane emissions from oil and gas drilling while giving fossil fuel companies access to more leases on federal lands and waters a late addition pushed by sen kyrsten sinema d ariz and other democrats in arizona nevada and colorado would designate 4 billion to combat a mega drought in the west including conservation efforts in the colorado river basin which nearly 40 million americans rely on for drinking water for consumers there are tax breaks as incentives to go green one is a 10 year consumer tax credit for renewable energy investments in wind and solar there are tax breaks for buying electric vehicles including a 4 000 tax credit for purchase of used electric vehicles and 7 500 for new ones in all democrats believe the strategy could put the country on a path to cut greenhouse gas emissions 40 by 2030 and would represent the single biggest climate investment in u s history by far how to pay for all of this the biggest revenue raiser in the bill is a new 15 minimum tax on corporations that earn more than 1 billion in annual profits it s a way to clamp down on some 200 u s companies that avoid paying the standard 21 corporate tax rate including some that end up paying no taxes at all the new corporate minimum tax would kick in after the 2022 tax year and raise more than 258 billion over the decade the revenue would have been higher but sinema insisted on one change to the 15 corporate minimum allowing a depreciation deduction used by manufacturing industries that shaves about 55 billion off the total revenue what s changed in recent days to win over sinema democrats dropped plans to close a tax loophole long enjoyed by wealthier americans so called carried interest which under current law taxes wealthy hedge fund managers and others at a 20 rate the left has for years sought to boost the carried interest tax rate hiked to 37 in the original bill more in line with upper income earners sinema wouldn t allow it keeping the tax break for the wealthy deprives the party of 14 billion in revenue they were counting on to help pay for the package in its place democrats with sinema s nod will impose a 1 excise tax on stock buybacks raising some 74 billion over the decade money is also raised by boosting the irs to go after tax cheats the bill proposes an 80 billion investment in taxpayer services enforcement and modernization which is projected to raise 203 billion in new revenue a net gain of 124 billion over the decade the bill sticks with biden s original pledge not to raise taxes on families or businesses making less than 400 000 a year the lower drug prices for seniors are paid for with savings from medicare s negotiations with the drug companies extra money to pay down deficits with some 740 billion in new revenue and around 433 billion in new investments the bill promises to put the difference toward deficit reduction federal deficits spiked during the covid 19 pandemic when federal spending soared and tax revenues fell as the nation s economy churned through shutdowns closed offices and other massive changes the nation has seen deficits rise and fall in recent years but overall federal budgeting is on an unsustainable path according to the congressional budget office which put out a new report this week on long term projections what s left behind this latest package emerged suddenly at the end of july after 18 months of start stop negotiations leaves behind many of biden s more ambitious goals senate majority leader chuck schumer d n y struck a deal with sen joe manchin to revive biden s package slimming it down to bring the west virginia democrat back to the negotiating table next they drew sinema the remaining party holdout with additional changes the package remains robust by typical standards but nowhere near the sweeping build back better program biden once envisioned while congress did pass a 1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill for highways broadband and other investments that biden signed into law last year the president s and the party s other key priorities have slipped away among them is a continuation of a 300 monthly child tax credit that was sending money directly to families during the pandemic and is believed to have widely reduced child poverty also gone for now are plans for free pre kindergarten and community college as well as the nation s first paid family leave program that would have provided up to 4 000 a month for births deaths and other pivotal needs ___
the good news on the jobs market helped to limit losses for the dow jones industrial average whose stocks tend to move more with expectations for the overall economy associated press stock indexes closed mostly lower friday after a roller coaster day following a blockbuster report on the u s jobs market that offered both good and bad news for wall street the benchmark standard poor s 500 ended just 0 2 lower after recovering from an early slide as investors reacted to the report which showed that u s employers unexpectedly added hundreds of thousands more jobs than forecast last month the data suggest the economy may not be in a recession as feared but the numbers also undercut investors speculation that a slowing economy may mean a peak for inflation soon that means the federal reserve may not let up on its aggressive rate hikes to combat inflation as early as hoped and much of wall street still revolves around expectations for rates it s a reminder for investors on how uncertain fed policy is going forward and the strong jobs market data shows just how far the fed has to go said charlie ripley senior investment strategist at allianz investment management stocks of technology and other high growth companies once again took the brunt of the selling amid the rising rate worries the tech heavy nasdaq composite index cut its early losses and closed down 63 03 points or 0 5 at 12 657 55 the good news on the jobs market helped to limit losses for the dow jones industrial average whose stocks tend to move more with expectations for the overall economy it added 76 65 points or 0 2 to close at 32 803 47 the s p 500 slipped 6 75 points to 4 145 19 both the s p 500 and nasdaq posted a gain for the week beyond the nation s strong hiring wage growth for workers also unexpectedly accelerated last month that s helpful for households trying to keep up with the fastest price gains in 40 years but it also raises worries on wall street that inflation will become more embedded in the economy higher wages can cause companies to raise prices for their own products to sustain profits which can lead to something economists call a wage price spiral to be sure some market watchers also pointed to numbers within friday s employment report suggesting the jobs market may not be as strong as the overall numbers imply the number of people with multiple jobs rose by more than half a million for example said brian jacobsen senior investment strategist at allspring global investments that was mostly from people who already have a full time job and then the second job is part time he said maybe this is more superficially impressive than substantively impressive wall street s clearest moves came from the bond market where treasury yields shot higher immediately after the release of the jobs data the two year treasury yield which tends to track expectations for fed action jumped to 3 23 from 3 05 late thursday the 10 year yield which influences rates on mortgages rose to 2 84 from 2 69 wall street is coming off the best month for stocks since late 2020 a rally driven mostly by what had been falling yields across the bond market the hope on wall street had been that the economy was slowing enough to get the fed to ease up on its rate hikes higher mortgage rates had cut into the housing industry in particular after the fed raised its short term rates four times this year the last two increases were triple the usual size bringing the total increases in the fed s benchmark overnight rate to 2 25 percentage points today s print coming in much stronger than anticipated complicates the job of the federal reserve rick rieder blackrock s chief investment officer of global fixed income said in a statement he said the assumption now becomes the fed raising short term rates by another 0 75 of a percentage point next month unless next week s highly anticipated report on inflation shows some dramatic weakness which seems highly unlikely at this point traders scrambled to place bets for bigger rate increases coming out of the fed s next meeting they have flipped their expectations from a day earlier and now largely expect a 0 75 point increase instead of half a point such increases hurt investment prices in the near term and they raise the risk of recession further down the line because they slow the economy by design such expectations also mean the two year treasury yield remains above the 10 year yield that s unusual and some investors see it as a sign of a recession hitting the economy within the next year or two on friday warner bros discovery fell 16 5 for the biggest loss in the s p 500 after reporting weaker results for the latest quarter than analysts expected monster beverage lost 5 2 after it reported

the back story behind reality star and ousted elite world group ceo julia haart s losing court battle with estranged husband silvio scaglia has been revealed in a 52 page opinion by a judge from delaware s chancery court the decision written by vice chancellor morgan t zurn and filed aug 4 exposes scaglia s efforts to maintain control of elite world group despite his public proclamations that he and haart were equal partners but the judgement concludes that neither party had unclean hands more from wwd advertisement advertisement haart the former creative director of la perla was fired from her position as ceo of elite last february amid the couple s deteriorating relationship hours after she was ousted she filed for divorce from her italian business mogul husband and in a separate manhattan supreme court sued scaglia characterizing him as a liar and a fraud who owes her millions from her share of elite parent freedom holding inc according to court documents according to the chancery court motion freedom began reporting in financial statements that scaglia and haart owned freedom equally in reality and apparently unbeknownst to haart scaglia maintained one share more of freedom stock than his wife a razor thin margin of control that was apparently unbeknownst to haart at the time as zurn wrote despite the appearance of an equal partnership the evidence reveals that haart never owned an equal stake of freedom s preferred stock but according to court filings haart first became aware that her husband was deceiving her back in 2020 that s when freedom entered into a negotiation with gabelli group capital partners over a possible spac transaction for elite at the time haart was ceo of elite but scaglia excluded her from the negotiations with gabelli advertisement advertisement during these negotiations haart learned for the first time that freedom preferred shares existed and that scaglia owned all of them writes zurn haart testified she was devastated to learn that scaglia had misled and lied to and that he could make decisions for the business including selling it to gabelli without her having been caught in this deceit scaglia showed contrition by appearing to transfer to haart 50 percent of freedom holdings zurn writes the record contains a june 12 stock power purporting to transfer from scaglia to haart 61 832 of freedom s 123 665 preferred shares the stock power the stock power was drafted by scaglia s corporate accountant jeffrey fineman of accounting firm ddk company fienman is named in haart s lawsuit advertisement advertisement but as zurn writes the stock power by its own terms does not transfer half of scaglia s 123 665 preferred shares rather it transfers one half share less than half or 49 9995957 of those preferred shares assuming the stock power was effective scaglia continued to hold the bare majority 50 0004043 of freedom s preferred shares both scaglia and feinman testified this structure was intentional christopher milito haart s attorney said in a statement to wwd the court s decision is a tour de force examination of the many years of scaglia s statements and documents confirming to ms haart and to the world at large that she was a full fifty percent owner ms haart disagrees with the ultimate decision and will appeal it but in the event it stands it will be the final piece of evidence proving scaglia s fraud against his wife fraud for which ms haart is already seeking redress in new york state supreme court marty singer who is not involved in the case but is representing haart in other matters concerning scaglia weighed in as well court papers filed further confirm the falsity of mr scaglia s statements about ms hart s ownership of freedom lanny davis a publicist for mr scaglia stated in a headline in a march 9 2022 press release the numbers don t lie mr scaglia owns more than 99 of the voting stock ms haart owns less than 01 that s a fact documents don t lie either mr davis statement is belied by the judge s statement in the ruling acknowledging the existence of a document signed by mr scalia confirming his agreement to transfer 49 9995957 of the preferred or voting shares to ms haart but there s more according to the filing haart was aware that scaglia had maintained a one share advantage by early 2021 by may 2021 scaglia was in contact with investment bank jeffries group about a potential spac or ipo at the time zurn writes scaglia was also hopeful that an upcoming netflix series focusing on haart would bring value to ewg and accelerate a potential deal advertisement advertisement and while she discovered the stock discrepancy after the fact she was aware of it when she filed her lawsuit zurn also highlights haart s efforts to pressure fineman whom zurn characterizes as an on call personal assistant to scaglia and haart to parrot that she owned half of freedom haart continued leaning on feinman after this litigation began adds zurn when feinman complained about unpaid bills haart owed haart responded you want to get paid plz help me help you i cannot pay you without the truth first coming out and being acknowledged as a 50 owner which you know better than anyone that i am in the end the court rejected haart s claims that the judgement in scaglia s favor should be overturned because of scaglia s documented duplicity zurn writes in a final if syntactically challenged conclusion the exercise of looking at the litigants hands reveals dirt on haart s peter a bicks a partner at orrick herrington sutcliffe and lead counsel for scaglia added we are pleased that the judge after seeing mr scaglia testify live found him credible and that in sharp contrast ms haart was determined to have dirt on her hands because she fabricated the

speaker of the us house of representatives nancy pelosi recently made a provocative visit to china s taiwan region in disregard of china s strong opposition and serious representations the visit is a serious violation of the one china principle and the provisions of the three china us joint communiquã s it has a severe impact on the political foundation of china us relations seriously infringes on china s sovereignty and territorial integrity and gravely undermines peace and stability across the taiwan strait by visiting taiwan pelosi has made six mistakes reneging on past commitments trampling the rule of law undermining peace meddling in china s internal affairs political manipulation and abusing power for selfish purposes the visit is bound to face the judgement and punishment of history reneging on past commitments the visit is a gross violation of the us commitments in the three china us joint communiquã s in 1972 the us made a clear commitment in the shanghai communiquã that the united states acknowledges that all chinese on either side of the taiwan strait maintain there is but one china and that taiwan is a part of china the united states government does not challenge that position in 1979 the us clearly pledged in the sino us joint communiquã on the establishment of diplomatic relations that the united states of america recognizes the government of the people s republic of china as the sole legal government of china within this context the people of the united states will maintain cultural commercial and other unofficial relations with the people of taiwan in 1982 the us clearly promised in the joint communiquã of the people s republic of china and the united states of america that the united states of america recognized the government of the people s republic of china as the sole legal government of china and it acknowledged the chinese position that there is but one china and taiwan is part of china and that the united states government reiterates that it has no intention of infringing on chinese sovereignty and territorial integrity or interfering in china s internal affairs or pursuing a policy of two chinas or one china one taiwan the three joint communiquã s constitute the political foundation of china us relations in recent years the us with its double dealing has kept fudging and hollowing out the one china principle and challenging china s red line with salami tactics the us congress keeps making toxic rhetoric on taiwan and proposed and adopted many negative bills regarding taiwan these have seriously undermined the political foundation of china us relations since the biden administration took office rather than undo the serious mistakes of the previous administration it has gone further in ganging up with us allies to play the taiwan card spreading the idea that the status of taiwan is undetermined and attempting to make the taiwan question an international issue thus sending a very wrong signal to taiwan independence separatist forces there can be only one foreign policy of the us as a country the house of representatives of the us congress as part of the us government is obliged to strictly follow the one china policy of the us government and not engage in any official interactions with china s taiwan region pelosi is the third highest ranking political figure in the us and second in line following the vice president to succeed the president her visit to taiwan in whatever form and under whatever pretext carries high political sensitivity and marks a major political provocation upgrading the official interactions between the us and taiwan and a breach of the political commitment of the us trampling the rule of law pelosi s visit to taiwan is a serious violation of the one china principle this principle is the prevailing consensus of the international community and a widely accepted basic norm in international relations in october 1971 the 26th session of the united nations general assembly adopted resolution 2758 which decided to restore all its rights to the people s republic of china and to recognize the representatives of its government as the only legitimate representatives of china to the united nations and to expel forthwith the representatives of chiang kai shek from the place which they unlawfully occupy at the united nations and in all the organizations related to it this resolution has not only solved once and for all in political legal and procedural terms the issue of representation of the whole of china including taiwan in the united nations but also made it clear that there is but one seat of china in the united nations not two and that there has never been an issue of two chinas or one china one taiwan the one china principle has been an integral part of the post wwii international order to date 181 countries around the world have established diplomatic relations with the people s republic of china on the basis of the one china principle pelosi argues that the visit does not contradict the long standing us policy guided by the taiwan relations act of 1979 the china us joint communiquã s and the six assurances citing that as the excuse for the visit to taiwan as a matter of fact both the so called taiwan relations act and the six assurances to taiwan are unilaterally concocted by some forces in the us this is in nature putting us domestic laws above international law and international obligations and ignoring and infringing on international law and norms of international relations undermining peace the root cause to the current tensions across the taiwan strait is that the taiwan authorities have kept seeking us support for their independence agenda while some in the us intend to use taiwan to contain china pelosi s visit to taiwan is the latest example of the us conniving at and supporting taiwan independence separatist forces it gravely undermines peace across the taiwan strait and regional stability the us should and must bear all responsibilities for that over the past few days many countries have issued official statements condemning pelosi s visit to taiwan which leads to escalation of situation in the taiwan strait and constitutes a deliberate political and military provocation as well as a malicious act that undermines peace and security in the region they have expressed firm support for china to take all necessary measures in defence of its sovereignty security and development interests pelosi s provocative visit to taiwan is also opposed and criticized by many sensible people in the us many publicly stated that pelosi s grandstanding visit was extremely dangerous and irresponsible a poll conducted inside the taiwan island shows that nearly two thirds of the respondents believe this visit has undermined peace and stability across the taiwan strait the one china principle is the anchor for peace and stability across the taiwan strait history and practice have proven time and again that when the one china principle is fully endorsed and earnestly observed the taiwan strait would remain calm and tranquil and the two sides across the taiwan strait would enjoy peace and development but when the one china principle is willfully challenged or even sabotaged there would be dark clouds or even fierce storms in the taiwan strait the position of the chinese government and people on the taiwan question has been consistent it is the firm commitment of the more than 1 4 billion chinese people to resolutely safeguard state sovereignty and territorial integrity whoever acts against the overwhelming historical trend of peace and development will become a huge disgrace in history meddling in china s internal affairs while visiting taiwan pelosi exploited various occasions to make outrageous slanders against china on issues including democracy human rights hong kong tibet xinjiang and religion which reflected her long standing anti china position over the years pelosi has been using the anti china card and china hate for political gains and grossly interfered in china s internal affairs in 1991 pelosi disturbed public order by grandstanding in the name of supporting so called democracy during her visit to china in 2008 she went out of her way to stir up trouble on tibet and urged president george w bush to boycott the beijing summer olympics in 2019 she met in d c with anti china destabilizing forces from hong kong and described the violent demonstrations in hong kong as a beautiful sight to behold in 2019 she met with rebiya kadeer a principal figure of xinjiang independence separatists in 2021 she played the same old trick by advocating a us diplomatic boycott of the beijing winter olympics on the taiwan question pelosi s influence is surely behind all the so called taiwan friendly bills passed by the us congress in recent years pelosi has turned a blind eye to the myriad domestic challenges in the united states and shown little interest in the welfare of the american people instead she is obsessed with repeating what have been repeatedly proven to be lies of the century this fully reveals how far she is prepared to go only to pursue her anti china agenda she may well choose to make a show in whatever form but what she does will end up in vain if anything it will only go down in history as additional evidence of the us s gross interference in other countries internal affairs political manipulation pelosi claimed that today the world faces a choice between democracy and autocracy and that our congressional delegation s visit to taiwan honors america s unwavering commitment to supporting taiwan s vibrant democracy yet in reality what pelosi has done is by no means for the sake of defending democracy but to infringe on china s sovereignty undermine china s stability and hold back china s development in the name of democracy it is political manipulation out and out democracy is a common value of humanity it is an entitlement of people in all countries not a prerogative of only a handful of countries whether a country is democratic or not can only be left to its own people to decide it should not be subjected to the finger pointing of some people from outside pelosi and some other american politicians styling themselves as champions of freedom democracy and human rights have defined other countries as a democracy or otherwise simply based on their own liking and spun the democracy versus autocracy narrative in the international community their behavior is in essence an anachronism of the cold war mentality and zero sum mindset it features the use of ideology and values as a tool to create confrontational blocs and advance a geopolitical agenda for the purpose of protecting the vested institutional power of the us and other western countries and defending western centrism and white supremacy centering on anglo saxon culture over the years the us has used democracy as a label a political tool and a weapon to advance democratic transformation and orchestrate color revolution causing disastrous consequences since 2001 the wars and military operations that the us waged under the pretext of democracy in afghanistan iraq libya and syria have claimed tens of thousands of lives and left millions injured and tens of millions displaced what pelosi is doing now is no different it is just another example of the us s despicable pursuit of hegemony under the guise of democracy which will be strongly condemned and opposed by the international community abusing power for selfish purposes as pointed out by american media with the upcoming us midterm elections and a declining democratic party pelosi seeks to win political points by playing the taiwan card and leave behind so called political legacy but pelosi s achievements in taiwan are largely personal symbolic and short term the regional security tensions thus caused as well as other serious consequences are to bring long term impacts and inflict profound damage on china us relations us congresswoman marjorie taylor greene censured pelosi on twitter pointing out that pelosi s going to taiwan putting so much under risk is only for her husband paul pelosi to profit from his recent investment in the chip industry americans have had enough with a woman obsessed with her own power she s held for decades while our entire country crumbles greene s words do not come from nowhere recently pelosi and her husband have had repeated scandals and come under severe skepticism multiple pieces of media coverage in the us have revealed that paul pelosi having become a prominent figure in the us stock market in recent years is always able to make the right investment decision just ahead of the government s policy roll out in 2020 the couple s investment return was as high as 56 percent compared to the legendary warren buffett s 26 percent during the same period as a result the pelosi family s net worth is now over us 100 million before she went to taiwan when asked at a press conference has your husband ever made a stock purchase or sale based on information he received from you pelosi was quick to deny and rushed to leave pelosi s reckless taiwan drama is another debacle of us politics diplomacy and credibility it is doomed to be despised by the world and swept into the dustbin of history

not finalised until september the following year partly as a result of this 2 of renewable fuel so far supplied this year is not yet verified each provisional report typically has a higher proportion of renewable fuel which has been verified and the final report describes all verified renewable fuel supplied in the year background information sources of data in this report data on volumes of fuel renewable transport fuel certificates rtfcs issues redemptions surrenders transfers and carbon and sustainability c s are held by the renewable transport fuel obligation rtfo administrator on the rtfo operating system ros fuel volume data is submitted on a monthly basis by fuel suppliers to the rtfo administrator and validated against hmrc duty payment data c s data is only reported once rtfcs have been issued there will therefore be a difference between the volume of renewable fuel supplied and the number of rtfcs issued or c s data available the final report for an obligation period will show the final position further details further information on the data can be found in the notes and definitions related information previously published reports can be found on the dft website the publication timetable can be found at annex b renewable fuel mix reporting the data reported by fuel suppliers under the rtfo is in line with mass balance rules a mass balance system requires suppliers throughout the supply chain to account for their product on a units in units out basis but does not require physical separation of certified feedstock or fuel from uncertified material it ensures that for every unit of sustainable renewable fuel sold the corresponding amount of sustainable feedstock has been produced this can mean the actual feedstock mix might differ from that reported nonetheless the feedstocks and renewable fuels reported in this document represent those that are incentivised and rewarded under the rtfo strengths and weaknesses of the data c s data is verified by independent verifiers and checked against the rtfo guidance by the administrator the administrator validates volume data submitted by fuel suppliers against that held by the hmrc regarding

example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video the 740 billion package is made up of health care climate change and deficit reduction strategies in hopes of tackling inflation and bringing down deficits washington not as robust as the proposal president joe biden once envisioned to rebuild america s public infrastructure and family support systems the democrats compromise of health care climate change and deficit reduction strategies is still a substantial undertaking the estimated 740 billion package passed sunday by the senate and heading to the house is full of party priorities those include capping prescription drug costs at 2 000 out of pocket for seniors helping americans pay for private health insurance and what democrats are calling the most substantial investment in history to fight climate change some 375 billion over the decade almost half the money raised 300 billion will go toward paying down federal deficits it s all paid for largely with new corporate taxes including a 15 minimum tax on big corporations to ensure they don t skip out on paying any taxes at all as well as projected federal savings from lower medicare drug costs how does the inflation reduction act reduce inflation called the inflation reduction act of 2022 it s not at all clear the 755 page bill will substantially ease inflationary pressures though millions of americans are expected to see some relief in health care and other costs when will the house vote on the inflation reduction act votes fell strictly along party lines in the 50 50 senate with all democrats in favor all republicans opposed and vice president kamala harris providing a tie breaking vote for 51 50 passage the house is expected to vote by friday a look at what s in and out of the final package lower prescription drug costs launching a long sought goal the bill would allow the medicare program to negotiate prescription drug prices with pharmaceutical companies saving the federal government some 288 billion over the 10 year budget window those new revenues would be put back into lower costs for seniors on medications including a 2 000 out of pocket cap for older adults buying prescriptions from pharmacies the money would also be used to provide free vaccinations for seniors who now are among the few not guaranteed free access according to a summary document seniors would also have insulin prices capped at 35 a dose a provision to extend that price cap on insulin to americans with private health insurances was out of line with senate budget rules and republicans stripped it from the final bill help pay for health insurance the bill would extend the subsidies provided during the covid 19 pandemic to help some americans who buy health insurance on their own under earlier pandemic relief the extra help was set to expire this year but the bill would allow the assistance to keep going for three more years lowering insurance premiums for people who are purchasing their own health care policies single biggest investment in climate change in u s history the bill would invest nearly 375 billion over the decade in climate change fighting strategies including investments in renewable energy production and tax rebates for consumers to buy new or used electric vehicles it s broken down to include 60 billion for a clean energy manufacturing tax credit and 30 billion for a production tax credit for wind and solar seen as ways to boost and support the industries that can help curb the country s dependence on fossil fuels the bill also gives tax credits for nuclear power and carbon capture technology that oil companies such as exxon mobil have invested millions of dollars to advance the bill would impose a new fee on excess methane emissions from oil and gas drilling while giving fossil fuel companies access to more leases on federal lands and waters a late addition pushed by sen kyrsten sinema d ariz and other democrats in arizona nevada and colorado would designate 4 billion to combat a mega drought in the west including conservation efforts in the colorado river basin which nearly 40 million americans rely on for drinking water for consumers there are tax breaks as incentives to go green one is a 10 year consumer tax credit for renewable energy investments in wind and solar there are tax breaks for buying electric vehicles including a 4 000 tax credit for purchase of used electric vehicles and 7 500 for new ones in all democrats believe the strategy could put the country on a path to cut greenhouse gas emissions 40 by 2030 and would represent the single biggest climate investment in u s history by far how to pay for all of this the biggest revenue raiser in the bill is a new 15 minimum tax on corporations that earn more than 1 billion in annual profits it s a way to clamp down on some 200 u s companies that avoid paying the standard 21 corporate tax rate including some that end up paying no taxes at all the new corporate minimum tax would kick in after the 2022 tax year and raise more than 258 billion over the decade the revenue would have been higher but sinema insisted on one change to the 15 corporate minimum allowing a depreciation deduction used by manufacturing industries that shaves about 55 billion off the total revenue what s changed in recent days to win

escrypto the global crypto payment service has been getting licenses to operate in 3 continents and will launch later this year with the innovative capabilities afforded by the escrypto platform financial regulators have approved its use in a comprehensive list of territories including the us canada eu israel and many more locations the successful licensing of escrypto on such a broad scale represents a huge step forward not just for the miami based company but for crypto payment services in general with escrypto bringing secure easy to use escrow services to the crypto space decentralized finance has taken another significant step toward the mainstream escrow in the crypto landscape while cryptocurrencies may offer any number of advantages to users increased security privacy and transparency to name but a few they also come with a distinct drawback cryptocurrency transactions can t be reversed in the event that buyer is unhappy with a product or service that have paid for there is no method by which buyer can demand his money back once have paid for something with crypto even if have paid the wrong person by mistake that crypto is gone in order to get money returned buyer is entirely reliant upon the good nature of the individual or business have paid to give a refund and if they aren t prepared to offer one options are severely limited this characteristic is unfortunately inherent to blockchain systems with there being no central governing body that customers can approach to make a complaint if there has been any mistake or failure in a transaction to resolve this escrypto is bringing the reliability and security of traditional escrow methodology to the crypto landscape the escrypto solution in traditional escrow a third party with no vested interests or connections to the transaction parties is brought in to act as an arbiter and maintain control of any payments made only when all parties involved are satisfied that the transaction can be completed are the payment funds released to the seller when it comes to crypto transactions the most effective way to provide escrow security is to use a multi signature escrow wallet also known as a multisig although the function of a multisig wallet is the same as a traditional escrow service the manner in which it performs this task differs in a profound way when using a multisig no funds are held by a third party instead the multisig serves as an agreement that the funds will not be transferred until any two of the three parties involved buyer the seller and the escrow provider have signed off that the transaction has gone ahead satisfactorily assuming that buyer is satisfied with the product or service purchased both buyer and the seller use your own personal crypto keys to authorize the transaction with the two of three authorization condition now fulfilled the payment held in the multisig wallet is released to the seller the human element as effective as blockchain escrow may be there are still reasons why transaction parties need to be careful in the event that there are issues or complications with a transaction the escrow provider will serve as the adjudicator and third vote to decide the veracity of the transaction with the manner in which these disputes are resolved varying widely depending on the escrow service provider chosen it s vital that crypto transaction partners engage a reputable and licensed escrow provider in this respect blockchain escrows are no different from traditional ones as automated and safe as the transaction process may be an escrow provider s reputation still matters it s here where escrypto makes a profound difference employing extensive user verification systems such as kyc kyb and aml escrypto ensures that all transactions are fully vetted and compliant further to this the platform utilizes institutional grade vaults that require both a public and a private key to access as well as leveraging mpc wallet technology with mpc technology allowing individuals to evaluate transaction data without having to reveal their data to anyone else escrypto offers escrow payments solutions that are built around unparalleled security and reliability crypto payments at your fingertips more than just security however escrypto aims to make blockchain escrow as intuitive and user friendly as possible one of the other unfortunate characteristics of blockchain technology is that it tends to confuse people remarkably easily especially newcomers to the field while nodes and permissioned ledgers may well be standard terminology in financial markets they aren t necessarily the most inviting phrases to the wider public to address this issue and widen the mass appeal of blockchain technology in general escrypto has created an entire platform of crypto payment services that require absolutely no technical knowledge to use by employing innovative software and smart contracts escrypto has effectively removed any complications from the process allowing people to engage in crypto payments with the same ease and confidence they experience when using traditional centralized payment platforms from art and real estate to payments for services or just absolutely everything escrypto has been specifically designed to make blockchain finance not just safe but simple for everyone to find out more about escrypto its capabilities and how the platform is set to revolutionize crypto payments in the future please visit the escrypto team at media contact company name globet

the most substantial investment in history to fight climate change some 375 billion over the decade almost half the money raised 300 billion will go toward paying down federal deficits it s all paid for largely with new corporate taxes including a 15 minimum tax on big corporations to ensure they don t skip out on paying any taxes at all as well as projected federal savings from lower medicare drug costs how does the inflation reduction act reduce inflation called the inflation reduction act of 2022 it s not at all clear the 755 page bill will substantially ease inflationary pressures though millions of americans are expected to see some relief in health care and other costs when will the house vote on the inflation reduction act votes fell strictly along party lines in the 50 50 senate with all democrats in favor all republicans opposed and vice president kamala harris providing a tie breaking vote for 51 50 passage the house is expected to vote by friday a look at what s in and out of the final package lower prescription drug costs launching a long sought goal the bill would allow the medicare program to negotiate prescription drug prices with pharmaceutical companies saving the federal government some 288 billion over the 10 year budget window those new revenues would be put back into lower costs for seniors on medications including a 2 000 out of pocket cap for older adults buying prescriptions from pharmacies the money would also be used to provide free vaccinations for seniors who now are among the few not guaranteed free access according to a summary document seniors would also have insulin prices capped at 35 a dose a provision to extend that price cap on insulin to americans with private health insurances was out of line with senate budget rules and republicans stripped it from the final bill help pay for health insurance the bill would extend the subsidies provided during the covid 19 pandemic to help some americans who buy health insurance on their own under earlier pandemic relief the extra help was set to expire this year but the bill would allow the assistance to keep going for three more years lowering insurance premiums for people who are purchasing their own health care policies single biggest investment in climate change in u s history the bill would invest nearly 375 billion over the decade in climate change fighting strategies including investments in renewable energy production and tax rebates for consumers to buy new or used electric vehicles it s broken down to include 60 billion for a clean energy manufacturing tax credit and 30 billion for a production tax credit for wind and solar seen as ways to boost and support the industries that can help curb the country s dependence on fossil fuels the bill also gives tax credits for nuclear power and carbon capture technology that oil companies such as exxon mobil have invested millions of dollars to advance the bill would impose a new fee on excess methane emissions from oil and gas drilling while giving fossil fuel companies access to more leases on federal lands and waters a late addition pushed by sen kyrsten sinema d ariz and other democrats in arizona nevada and colorado would designate 4 billion to combat a mega drought in the west including conservation efforts in the colorado river basin which nearly 40 million americans rely on for drinking water for consumers there are tax breaks as incentives to go green one is a 10 year consumer tax credit for renewable energy investments in wind and solar there are tax breaks for buying electric vehicles including a 4 000 tax credit for purchase of used electric vehicles and 7 500 for new ones in all democrats believe the strategy could put the country on a path to cut greenhouse gas emissions 40 by 2030 and would represent the single biggest climate investment in u s history by far how to pay for all of this the biggest revenue raiser in the bill is a new 15 minimum tax on corporations that earn more than 1 billion in annual profits it s a way to clamp down on some 200 u s companies that avoid paying the standard 21 corporate tax rate including some that end up paying no taxes at all the new corporate minimum tax would kick in after the 2022 tax year and raise more than 258 billion over the decade the revenue would have been higher but sinema insisted on one change to the 15 corporate minimum allowing a depreciation deduction used by manufacturing industries that shaves about 55 billion off the total revenue what s changed in recent days to win over sinema democrats dropped plans to close a tax loophole long enjoyed by wealthier americans so called carried interest which under current law taxes wealthy hedge fund managers and others at a 20 rate the left has for years sought to boost the carried interest tax rate hiked to 37 in the original bill more in line with upper income earners sinema wouldn t allow it keeping the tax break for the wealthy deprives the party of 14 billion in revenue they were counting on to help pay for the package in its place democrats with sinema s nod will impose a 1 excise tax on stock buybacks raising some 74 billion over the decade money is also raised by boosting the irs to go after tax cheats the bill proposes an 80 billion investment in taxpayer services enforcement and modernization which is projected to raise 203 billion in new revenue a net gain of 124 billion over the decade the bill sticks with biden s original pledge not to raise taxes on families or businesses making less than 400 000 a year the lower drug prices for seniors are paid for with savings from medicare s negotiations with the drug companies extra money to pay down deficits with some 740 billion in new revenue and

a taiwan resident displays a placard reading oppose pelosi visit to avoid war between two shores as us house speaker nancy pelosi arrived in new taipei city on aug 3 2022 beijing speaker of the us house of representatives nancy pelosi recently made a provocative visit to china s taiwan region in disregard of china s strong opposition and serious representations the visit is a serious violation of the one china principle and the provisions of the three china us joint communiqués it has a severe impact on the political foundation of china us relations seriously infringes on china s sovereignty and territorial integrity and gravely undermines peace and stability across the taiwan strait by visiting taiwan pelosi has made six mistakes reneging on past commitments trampling the rule of law undermining peace meddling in china s internal affairs political manipulation and abusing power for selfish purposes the visit is bound to face the judgement and punishment of history reneging on past commitments the visit is a gross violation of the us commitments in the three china us joint communiqués in 1972 the us made a clear commitment in the shanghai communiqué that the united states acknowledges that all chinese on either side of the taiwan strait maintain there is but one china and that taiwan is a part of china the united states government does not challenge that position in 1979 the us clearly pledged in the sino us joint communiqué on the establishment of diplomatic relations that the united states of america recognizes the government of the people s republic of china as the sole legal government of china within this context the people of the united states will maintain cultural commercial and other unofficial relations with the people of taiwan in 1982 the us clearly promised in the joint communiqué of the people s republic of china and the united states of america that the united states of america recognized the government of the people s republic of china as the sole legal government of china and it acknowledged the chinese position that there is but one china and taiwan is part of china and that the united states government reiterates that it has no intention of infringing on chinese sovereignty and territorial integrity or interfering in china s internal affairs or pursuing a policy of two chinas or one china one taiwan the three joint communiqués constitute the political foundation of china us relations in recent years the us with its double dealing has kept fudging and hollowing out the one china principle and challenging china s red line with salami tactics the us congress keeps making toxic rhetoric on taiwan and proposed and adopted many negative bills regarding taiwan these have seriously undermined the political foundation of china us relations since the biden administration took office rather than undo the serious mistakes of the previous administration it has gone further in ganging up with us allies to play the taiwan card spreading the idea that the status of taiwan is undetermined and attempting to make the taiwan question an international issue thus sending a very wrong signal to taiwan independence separatist forces there can be only one foreign policy of the us as a country the house of representatives of the us congress as part of the us government is obliged to strictly follow the one china policy of the us government and not engage in any official interactions with china s taiwan region pelosi is the third highest ranking political figure in the us and second in line following the vice president to succeed the president her visit to taiwan in whatever form and under whatever pretext carries high political sensitivity and marks a major political provocation upgrading the official interactions between the us and taiwan and a breach of the political commitment of the us trampling the rule of law pelosi s visit to taiwan is a serious violation of the one china principle this principle is the prevailing consensus of the international community and a widely accepted basic norm in international relations in october 1971 the 26th session of the united nations general assembly adopted resolution 2758 which decided to restore all its rights to the people s republic of china and to recognize the representatives of its government as the only legitimate representatives of china to the united nations and to expel forthwith the representatives of chiang kai shek from the place which they unlawfully occupy at the united nations and in all the organizations related to it this resolution has not only solved once and for all in political legal and procedural terms the issue of representation of the whole of china including taiwan in the united nations but also made it clear that there is but one seat of china in the united nations not two and that there has never been an issue of two chinas or one china one taiwan the one china principle has been an integral part of the post wwii international order to date 181 countries around the world have established diplomatic relations with the people s republic of china on the basis of the one china principle pelosi argues that the visit does not contradict the long standing us policy guided by the taiwan relations act of 1979 the china us joint communiqués and the six assurances citing that as the excuse for the visit to taiwan as a matter of fact both the so called taiwan relations act and the six assurances to taiwan are unilaterally concocted by some forces in the us this is in nature putting us domestic laws above international law and international obligations and ignoring and infringing on international law and norms of international relations undermining peace the root cause to the current tensions across the taiwan strait is that the taiwan authorities have kept seeking us support for their independence agenda while some in the us intend to use taiwan to contain china pelosi s visit to taiwan is the latest example of the us conniving at and supporting taiwan independence separatist forces it gravely undermines peace across the taiwan strait and regional stability the us should and must bear all responsibilities for that over the past few days many countries have issued official statements condemning pelosi s visit to taiwan which leads to escalation of situation in the taiwan strait and constitutes a deliberate political and military provocation as well as a malicious act that undermines peace and security in the region they have expressed firm support for china to take all necessary measures in defence of its sovereignty security and development interests pelosi s provocative visit to taiwan is also opposed and criticized by many sensible people in the us many publicly stated that pelosi s grandstanding visit was extremely dangerous and irresponsible a poll conducted inside the taiwan island shows that nearly two thirds of the respondents believe this visit has undermined peace and stability across the taiwan strait the one china principle is the anchor for peace and stability across the taiwan strait history and practice have proven time and again that when the one china principle is fully endorsed and earnestly observed the taiwan strait would remain calm and tranquil and the two sides across the taiwan strait would enjoy peace and development but when the one china principle is willfully challenged or even sabotaged there would be dark clouds or even fierce storms in the taiwan strait the position of the chinese government and people on the taiwan question has been consistent it is the firm commitment of the more than 1 4 billion chinese people to resolutely safeguard state sovereignty and territorial integrity whoever acts against the overwhelming historical trend of peace and development will become a huge disgrace in history meddling in china s internal affairs while visiting taiwan pelosi exploited various occasions to make outrageous slanders against china on issues including democracy human rights hong kong tibet xinjiang and religion which reflected her long standing anti china position over the years pelosi has been using the anti china card and china hate for political gains and grossly interfered in china s internal affairs in 1991 pelosi disturbed public order by grandstanding in the name of supporting so called democracy during her visit to china in 2008 she went out of her way to stir up trouble on tibet and urged president george w bush to boycott the beijing summer olympics in 2019 she met in d c with anti china destabilizing forces from hong kong and described the violent demonstrations in hong kong as a beautiful sight to behold in 2019 she met with rebiya kadeer a principal figure of xinjiang independence separatists in 2021 she played the same old trick by advocating a us diplomatic boycott of the beijing winter olympics on the taiwan question pelosi s influence is surely behind all the so called taiwan friendly bills passed by the us congress in recent years pelosi has turned a blind eye to the myriad domestic challenges in the united states and shown little interest in the welfare of the american people instead she is obsessed with repeating what have been repeatedly proven to be lies of the century this fully reveals how far she is prepared to go only to pursue her anti china agenda she may well choose to make a show in whatever form but what she does will end up in vain if anything it will only go down in history as additional evidence of the us s gross interference in other countries internal affairs political manipulation pelosi claimed that today the world faces a choice between democracy and autocracy and that our congressional delegation s visit to taiwan honors america s unwavering commitment to supporting taiwan s vibrant democracy yet in reality what pelosi has done is by no means for the sake of defending democracy but to infringe on china s sovereignty undermine china s stability and hold back china s development in the name of democracy it is political manipulation out and out democracy is a common value of humanity it is an entitlement of people in all countries not a prerogative of only a handful of countries whether a country is democratic or not can only be left to its own people to decide it should not be subjected to the finger pointing of some people from outside pelosi and some other american politicians styling themselves as champions of freedom democracy and human rights have defined other countries as a democracy or otherwise simply based on their own liking and spun the democracy versus autocracy narrative in the international community their behavior is in essence an anachronism of the cold war mentality and zero sum mindset it features the use of ideology and values as a tool to create confrontational blocs and advance a geopolitical agenda for the purpose of protecting the vested institutional power of the us and other western countries and defending western centrism and white supremacy centering on anglo saxon culture over the years the us has used democracy as a label a political tool and a weapon to advance democratic transformation and orchestrate color revolution causing disastrous consequences since 2001 the wars and military operations that the us waged under the pretext of democracy in afghanistan iraq libya and syria have claimed tens of thousands of lives and left millions injured and tens of millions displaced what pelosi is doing now is no different it is just another example of the us s despicable pursuit of hegemony under the guise of democracy which will be strongly condemned and opposed by the international community abusing power for selfish purposes as pointed out by american media with the upcoming us midterm elections and a declining democratic party pelosi seeks to win political points by playing the taiwan card and leave behind so called political legacy but pelosi s achievements in taiwan are largely personal symbolic and short term the regional security tensions thus caused as well as other serious consequences are to bring long term impacts and inflict profound damage on china us relations us congresswoman marjorie taylor greene censured pelosi on twitter pointing out that pelosi s going to taiwan putting so much under risk is only for her husband paul pelosi to profit from his recent investment in the chip industry americans have had enough with a woman obsessed with her own power she s held for decades while our entire country crumbles greene s words do not come from nowhere recently pelosi and her husband have had repeated scandals and come under severe skepticism multiple pieces of media coverage in the us have revealed that paul pelosi having become a prominent figure in the us stock market in recent years is always able to make the right investment decision just ahead of the government s policy roll out in 2020 the couple s investment return was as high as 56 percent compared to the legendary warren buffett s 26 percent during the same period as a result the pelosi family s net worth is now over us 100 million before she went to taiwan when asked at a press conference has your husband ever made a stock purchase or sale based on information he received from you pelosi was quick to deny and rushed to leave pelosi s reckless taiwan drama is another debacle of us politics diplomacy and credibility it is doomed to be despised by the world and swept into the dustbin of history

standing us policy guided by the taiwan relations act of 1979 the china us joint communiquã s and the six assurances citing that as the excuse for the visit to taiwan as a matter of fact both the so called taiwan relations act and the six assurances to taiwan are unilaterally concocted by some forces in the us this is in nature putting us domestic laws above international law and international obligations and ignoring and infringing on international law and norms of international relations undermining peace the root cause to the current tensions across the taiwan strait is that the taiwan authorities have kept seeking us support for their independence agenda while some in the us intend to use taiwan to contain china pelosi s visit to taiwan is the latest example of the us conniving at and supporting taiwan independence separatist forces it gravely undermines peace across the taiwan strait and regional stability the us should and must bear all responsibilities for that over the past few days many countries have issued official statements condemning pelosi s visit to taiwan which leads to escalation of situation in the taiwan strait and constitutes a deliberate political and military provocation as well as a malicious act that undermines peace and security in the region they have expressed firm support for china to take all necessary measures in defence of its sovereignty security and development interests pelosi s provocative visit to taiwan is also opposed and criticized by many sensible people in the us many publicly stated that pelosi s grandstanding visit was extremely dangerous and irresponsible a poll conducted inside the taiwan island shows that nearly two thirds of the respondents believe this visit has undermined peace and stability across the taiwan strait the one china principle is the anchor for peace and stability across the taiwan strait history and practice have proven time and again that when the one china principle is fully endorsed and earnestly observed the taiwan strait would remain calm and tranquil and the two sides across the taiwan strait would enjoy peace and development but when the one china principle is willfully challenged or even sabotaged there would be dark clouds or even fierce storms in the taiwan strait the position of the chinese government and people on the taiwan question has been consistent it is the firm commitment of the more than 1 4 billion chinese people to resolutely safeguard state sovereignty and territorial integrity whoever acts against the overwhelming historical trend of peace and development will become a huge disgrace in history meddling in china s internal affairs while visiting taiwan pelosi exploited various occasions to make outrageous slanders against china on issues including democracy human rights hong kong tibet xinjiang and religion which reflected her long standing anti china position over the years pelosi has been using the anti china card and china hate for political gains and grossly interfered in china s internal affairs in 1991 pelosi disturbed public order by grandstanding in the name of supporting so called democracy during her visit to china in 2008 she went out of her way to stir up trouble on tibet and urged president george w bush to boycott the beijing summer olympics in 2019 she met in d c with anti china destabilizing forces from hong kong and described the violent demonstrations in hong kong as a beautiful sight to behold in 2019 she met with rebiya kadeer a principal figure of xinjiang independence separatists in 2021 she played the same old trick by advocating a us diplomatic boycott of the beijing winter olympics on the taiwan question pelosi s influence is surely behind all the so called taiwan friendly bills passed by the us congress in recent years pelosi has turned a blind eye to the myriad domestic challenges in the united states and shown little interest in the welfare of the american people instead she is obsessed with repeating what have been repeatedly proven to be lies of the century this fully reveals how far she is prepared to go only to pursue her anti china agenda she may well choose to make a show in whatever form but what she does will end up in vain if anything it will only go down in history as additional evidence of the us s gross interference in other countries internal affairs political manipulation pelosi claimed that today the world faces a choice between democracy and autocracy and that our congressional delegation s visit to taiwan honors america s unwavering commitment to supporting taiwan s vibrant democracy yet in reality what pelosi has done is by no means for the sake of defending democracy but to infringe on china s sovereignty undermine china s stability and hold back china s development in the name of democracy it is political manipulation out and out democracy is a common value of humanity it is an entitlement of people in all countries not a prerogative of only a handful of countries whether a country is democratic or not can only be left to its own people to decide it should not be subjected to the finger pointing of some people from outside pelosi and some other american politicians styling themselves as champions of freedom democracy and human rights have defined other countries as a democracy or otherwise simply based on their own liking and spun the democracy versus autocracy narrative in the international community their behavior is in essence an anachronism of the cold war mentality and zero sum mindset it features the use of ideology and values as a tool to create confrontational blocs and advance a geopolitical agenda for the purpose of protecting the vested institutional power of the us and other western countries and defending western centrism and white supremacy centering on anglo saxon culture over the years the us has used democracy as a label a political tool and a weapon to advance democratic transformation and orchestrate color revolution causing disastrous consequences since 2001 the wars and military operations that the us waged under the pretext of democracy in afghanistan iraq libya and syria have claimed tens of thousands of lives and left millions injured and tens of millions displaced what pelosi is doing now is no different it is just another example of the us s despicable pursuit of hegemony under the guise of democracy which will be strongly condemned and opposed by the international community abusing power for selfish purposes as pointed out by american media with the upcoming us midterm elections and a declining democratic party pelosi seeks to win political points by playing the taiwan card and leave behind so called political legacy but pelosi s achievements in taiwan are largely personal symbolic and short term the regional security tensions thus caused as well as other serious consequences are to bring long term impacts and inflict profound damage on china us relations us congresswoman marjorie taylor greene censured pelosi on twitter pointing out that pelosi s going to taiwan putting so much under risk is only for her husband paul pelosi to profit from his recent investment in the chip industry americans have had enough with a woman obsessed with her own power she s held for decades while our entire country crumbles greene s words do not come from nowhere recently pelosi and her husband have had repeated scandals and come under severe skepticism multiple pieces of media coverage in the us have revealed that paul pelosi having become a prominent figure in the us stock market in recent years is always able to make the right investment decision just ahead of the government s policy roll out in 2020 the couple s investment return was as high as 56 percent compared to the legendary warren buffett s 26 percent during the same period as a result the pelosi family s net worth is now over us 100 million before she went to taiwan when asked at a press conference has your husband ever made a stock purchase or sale based on information he received from you pelosi was quick to deny and rushed to leave pelosi s reckless taiwan drama is another

hopes of tackling inflation and bringing down deficits washington not as robust as the proposal president joe biden once envisioned to rebuild america s public infrastructure and family support systems the democrats compromise of health care climate change and deficit reduction strategies is still a substantial undertaking the estimated 740 billion package passed sunday by the senate and heading to the house is full of party priorities those include capping prescription drug costs at 2 000 out of pocket for seniors helping americans pay for private health insurance and what democrats are calling the most substantial investment in history to fight climate change some 375 billion over the decade almost half the money raised 300 billion will go toward paying down federal deficits it s all paid for largely with new corporate taxes including a 15 minimum tax on big corporations to ensure they don t skip out on paying any taxes at all as well as projected federal savings from lower medicare drug costs how does the inflation reduction act reduce inflation called the inflation reduction act of 2022 it s not at all clear the 755 page bill will substantially ease inflationary pressures though millions of americans are expected to see some relief in health care and other costs when will the house vote on the inflation reduction act votes fell strictly along party lines in the 50 50 senate with all democrats in favor all republicans opposed and vice president kamala harris providing a tie breaking vote for 51 50 passage the house is expected to vote by friday a look at what s in and out of the final package lower prescription drug costs launching a long sought goal the bill would allow the medicare program to negotiate prescription drug prices with pharmaceutical companies saving the federal government some 288 billion over the 10 year budget window those new revenues would be put back into lower costs for seniors on medications including a 2 000 out of pocket cap for older adults buying prescriptions from pharmacies the money would also be used to provide free vaccinations for seniors who now are among the few not guaranteed free access according to a summary document seniors would also have insulin prices capped at 35 a dose a provision to extend that price cap on insulin to americans with private health insurances was out of line with senate budget rules and republicans stripped it from the final bill help pay for health insurance the bill would extend the subsidies provided during the covid 19 pandemic to help some americans who buy health insurance on their own under earlier pandemic relief the extra help was set to expire this year but the bill would allow the assistance to keep going for three more years lowering insurance premiums for people who are purchasing their own health care policies single biggest investment in climate change in u s history the bill would invest nearly 375 billion over the decade in climate change fighting strategies including investments in renewable energy production and tax rebates for consumers to buy new or used electric vehicles it s broken down to include 60 billion for a clean energy manufacturing tax credit and 30 billion for a production tax credit for wind and solar seen as ways to boost and support the industries that can help curb the country s dependence on fossil fuels the bill also gives tax credits for nuclear power and carbon capture technology that oil companies such as exxon mobil have invested millions of dollars to advance the bill would impose a new fee on excess methane emissions from oil and gas drilling while giving fossil fuel companies access to more leases on federal lands and waters a late addition pushed by sen kyrsten sinema d ariz and other democrats in arizona nevada and colorado would designate 4 billion to combat a mega drought in the west including conservation efforts in the colorado river basin which nearly 40 million americans rely on for drinking water for consumers there are tax breaks as incentives to go green one is a 10 year consumer tax credit for renewable energy investments in wind and solar there are tax breaks for buying electric vehicles including a 4 000 tax credit for purchase of used electric vehicles and 7 500 for new ones in all democrats believe the strategy could put the country on a path to cut greenhouse gas emissions 40 by 2030 and would represent the single biggest climate investment in u s history by far how to pay for all of this the biggest revenue raiser in the bill is a new 15 minimum tax on corporations that earn more than 1 billion in annual profits it s a way to clamp down on some 200 u s companies that avoid paying the standard 21 corporate tax rate including some that end up paying no taxes at all the new corporate minimum tax would kick in after the 2022 tax year and raise more than 258 billion over the decade the revenue would have been higher but sinema insisted on one change to the 15 corporate minimum allowing a depreciation deduction used by manufacturing industries that shaves about 55 billion off the total revenue what s changed in recent days to win over sinema democrats dropped plans to close a tax loophole long enjoyed by wealthier americans so called carried interest which under current law taxes wealthy hedge fund managers and others at a 20 rate the left has for years sought to boost the carried interest tax rate hiked to 37 in the original bill more in line with upper income earners sinema wouldn t allow it keeping the tax break for the wealthy deprives the party of 14 billion in revenue they were counting on to help pay for the package in its place democrats with sinema s nod will impose a 1 excise tax on stock buybacks raising some 74 billion over the decade money is also raised by boosting the irs to go after tax cheats the bill proposes an 80 billion investment in taxpayer services enforcement and modernization which is projected to raise 203 billion in new revenue a net gain of 124 billion over the decade the bill sticks with biden s original pledge not to raise taxes on families or businesses making less than 400 000 a year the lower drug prices for seniors are paid for with savings from medicare s negotiations with the drug companies extra money to pay down deficits with some 740 billion in new revenue and around 433 billion in new investments the bill promises to put the difference toward deficit reduction federal deficits spiked during the covid 19 pandemic when federal spending soared and tax revenues fell as the nation s economy churned through shutdowns closed offices and other massive changes the nation has seen deficits rise and fall in recent years but overall federal budgeting is on an unsustainable path according to the congressional budget office which put out a new report this week on long term projections what s left behind this latest package emerged suddenly at the end of july after 18 months of start stop negotiations leaves behind many of biden s more ambitious goals senate majority leader chuck schumer d n y struck a deal with sen joe manchin to revive biden s package slimming it down to bring the west virginia democrat back to the negotiating table next they drew sinema the remaining party holdout with additional changes the package remains robust by typical standards but nowhere near the sweeping build back better program biden once envisioned while congress did pass a 1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill for highways broadband and other investments that biden signed into law last year the president s and the party s other key priorities have slipped away among them is a continuation of a 300 monthly child tax credit that was sending money directly to families during the pandemic and is believed to have widely reduced child poverty also gone for now are plans for free pre kindergarten and community college as well as the nation s first paid family leave program that would have provided up to 4 000 a month for births deaths and other pivotal needs ___
a taiwan resident displays a placard reading oppose pelosi visit to avoid war between two shores as us house speaker nancy pelosi arrived in new taipei city on aug 3 2022 beijing speaker of the us house of representatives nancy pelosi recently made a provocative visit to china s taiwan region in disregard of china s strong opposition and serious representations the visit is a serious violation of the one china principle and the provisions of the three china us joint communiqués it has a severe impact on the political foundation of china us relations seriously infringes on china s sovereignty and territorial integrity and gravely undermines peace and stability across the taiwan strait by visiting taiwan pelosi has made six mistakes reneging on past commitments trampling the rule of law undermining peace meddling in china s internal affairs political manipulation and abusing power for selfish purposes the visit is bound to face the judgement and punishment of history reneging on past commitments the visit is a gross violation of the us commitments in the three china us joint communiqués in 1972 the us made a clear commitment in the shanghai communiqué that the united states acknowledges that all chinese on either side of the taiwan strait maintain there is but one china and that taiwan is a part of china the united states government does not challenge that position in 1979 the us clearly pledged in the sino us joint communiqué on the establishment of diplomatic relations that the united states of america recognizes the government of the people s republic of china as the sole legal government of china within this context the people of the united states will maintain cultural commercial and other unofficial relations with the people of taiwan in 1982 the us clearly promised in the joint communiqué of the people s republic of china and the united states of america that the united states of america recognized the government of the people s republic of china as the sole legal government of china and it acknowledged the chinese position that there is but one china and taiwan is part of china and that the united states government reiterates that it has no intention of infringing on chinese sovereignty and territorial integrity or interfering in china s internal affairs or pursuing a policy of two chinas or one china one taiwan the three joint communiqués constitute the political foundation of china us relations in recent years the us with its double dealing has kept fudging and hollowing out the one china principle and challenging china s red line with salami tactics the us congress keeps making toxic rhetoric on taiwan and proposed and adopted many negative bills regarding taiwan these have seriously undermined the political foundation of china us relations since the biden administration took office rather than undo the serious mistakes of the previous administration it has gone further in ganging up with us allies to play the taiwan card spreading the idea that the status of taiwan is undetermined and attempting to make the taiwan question an international issue thus sending a very wrong signal to taiwan independence separatist forces there can be only one foreign policy of the us as a country the house of representatives of the us congress as part of the us government is obliged to strictly follow the one china policy of the us government and not engage in any official interactions with china s taiwan region pelosi is the third highest ranking political figure in the us and second in line following the vice president to succeed the president her visit to taiwan in whatever form and under whatever pretext carries high political sensitivity and marks a major political provocation upgrading the official interactions between the us and taiwan and a breach of the political commitment of the us trampling the rule of law pelosi s visit to taiwan is a serious violation of the one china principle this principle is the prevailing consensus of the international community and a widely accepted basic norm in international relations in october 1971 the 26th session of the united nations general assembly adopted resolution 2758 which decided to restore all its rights to the people s republic of china and to recognize the representatives of its government as the only legitimate representatives of china to the united nations and to expel forthwith the representatives of chiang kai shek from the place which they unlawfully occupy at the united nations and in all the organizations related to it this resolution has not only solved once and for all in political legal and procedural terms the issue of representation of the whole of china including taiwan in the united nations but also made it clear that there is but one seat of china in the united nations not two and that there has never been an issue of two chinas or one china one taiwan the one china principle has been an integral part of the post wwii international order to date 181 countries around the world have established diplomatic relations with the people s republic of china on the basis

report warns worldâ s developing countries of â trap of international financial capitalâ 18 08 august 05 2022 by zhang jinruo people s daily beijing peopleâ s daily â on august 3 2022 the launch event for the report titled â the trap of financial capital the impact of international bonds on the debt sustainability of developing countries â co organized by tsinghua universityâ s department of international relations and the china forum under the center for international security and strategy was held in beijing the report takes stock of the lessons learned from the issuance of eurobonds by developing countries and calls on the international community to work together to avoid any further expansion of sovereign bond defaults by taking timely precautions and fostering an international financial system that accounts for the characteristics of emerging markets the report points out that developing countries have been facing rising debt pressures since 2020â which presents a significant threat to the ongoing global economic recovery according to the report the surge in bond issuances and bond crises in african countries stems from international financial capital s provision of loose and convenient measures towards developing countries during periods of economic downturn which has in turn encouraged these countries to issue eurobonds so that the international financial capital â mainly well known investment institutions in europe and the united states â can reap high yields from the rapid growth of emerging markets however as developing countries have vulnerable economic structures and lack financial risk management experience they have faced difficulties dealing with the superimposed impacts of multiple adverse factors engendered by the global economic downturn many countries have been forced to issue new bonds with higher interest rates in order to repay old debt forming a vicious circle in the medium and long term the impact of international bonds on sovereign debt has been widely neglected by western media and research institutions the report warns through a systematic analysis of the negative implications of eurobonds the report finds that certain market behaviors based on developed countriesâ financial systems just do not work for small inexperienced developing economies the bond issuance and liquidity rules formulated by financial institutions in developed countries tend to give priority to the interests of financial institutions and the needs of the developed country markets they fail to fully account for the characteristics of developing countries such as single revenue sources strong cyclicality weak risk management and the need for infrastructure construction over the long term the issuance of eurobonds a procyclical commercial behavior has meanwhile exacerbated the economic fluctuations of developing countries for emerging economies the sudden reduction in public expenditure caused by the peaking of debt repayments and the consequent difficulties in refinancing might bring an abrupt end to their economic restructuring efforts that have taken place over the past decade or more it will take a long time for them to recover to their pre crisis levels after the liquidity crisis comes to an end such a huge impact arising from cyclical repayments has already caused several developing countries to fall into a vicious cycle of unsustainable economic growth in their most recent period of historical development tang xiaoyang the reportâ s lead author and a professor in the department of international relations at tsinghua university presented the report at the event he pointed out that since africa faces over 100 billion worth of bonds that are set to mature between 2023 and 2025 a debt and liquidity crisis is looming over the continent which therefore calls on developing countries to better manage the relationship between the market and demand photo shows tang xiaoyang the

the democrats compromise of health care climate change and deficit reduction strategies is still a substantial undertaking the estimated 740 billion package passed sunday by the senate and heading to the house is full of party priorities those include capping prescription drug costs at 2 000 out of pocket for seniors helping americans pay for private health insurance and what democrats are calling the most substantial investment in history to fight climate change some 375 billion over the decade almost half the money raised 300 billion will go toward paying down federal deficits it s all paid for largely with new corporate taxes including a 15 minimum tax on big corporations to ensure they don t skip out on paying any taxes at all as well as projected federal savings from lower medicare drug costs how does the inflation reduction act reduce inflation called the inflation reduction act of 2022 it s not at all clear the 755 page bill will substantially ease inflationary pressures though millions of americans are expected to see some relief in health care and other costs when will the house vote on the inflation reduction act votes fell strictly along party lines in the 50 50 senate with all democrats in favor all republicans opposed and vice president kamala harris providing a tie breaking vote for 51 50 passage the house is expected to vote by friday a look at what s in and out of the final package lower prescription drug costs launching a long sought goal the bill would allow the medicare program to negotiate prescription drug prices with pharmaceutical companies

document seniors would also have insulin prices capped at 35 a dose a provision to extend that price cap on insulin to americans with private health insurances was out of line with senate budget rules and republicans stripped it from the final bill help pay for health insurance the bill would extend the subsidies provided during the covid 19 pandemic to help some americans who buy health insurance on their own under earlier pandemic relief the extra help was set to expire this year but the bill would allow the assistance to keep going for three more years lowering insurance premiums for people who are purchasing their own health care policies single biggest investment in climate change in u s history the bill would invest nearly 375 billion over the decade in climate change fighting

drew angerer getty images washington with the senate democrats last remaining holdout arizona sen kyrsten sinema tentatively signing onto a 739 billion modified reconciliation deal her party leaders are looking forward to a first procedural vote on their historic tax climate and drug pricing bill as early as saturday the senate is expected to eventually pass the inflation reduction act of 2022 through using a fast track budget process known as reconciliation as early as this weekend if all democrats stick together they ll be able to clear the hefty legislative package by their razor thin majority and avoid a republican threat of a filibuster in a surprise move in late july west virginia sen joe manchin announced he had brokered a deal on a revised version of a democrat only spending bill with majority leader chuck schumer after it seemed the door was closed on negotiations after reviewing the legislation sinema on thursday evening offered her essential but still conditional support for the bill her support was conditioned upon democrats stripping from the bill a tax break favoring wealthy hedge fund managers called the carried interest loophole while adding instead a new excise tax on stock buybacks the current proposed text aims to increase job creation raise taxes on large corporations and the mega wealthy allows the government to negotiate prices of prescription drugs to lower costs expands the affordable care act health care program and invests in addressing climate change with measure such as extending tax credits for clean energy initiatives together the climate and aca provisions would cost the government roughly 433 billion and democrats plan to put at least 300 billion of that toward deficit reduction the tax provisions prescription drug pricing reform and increased irs tax enforcement would raise the estimated revenue the bill would produce to 739 billion republicans have bashed the proposal saying that any tax increases or spending package while the nation is falling into an economic recession is irresponsible this is not about inflation reduction this is all about democrats spending on things they want to spend money on i m not going to support it i don t think any republicans are going to support it why is that well it s another taxing and spending bill said sen mitt romney of utah in response to the bill tax analysts argue that the legislation would help american families who make less than 400 000 democrats say it would reduce inflation at least in part by lowering the deficit a key priority for manchin the bill would reduce federal budget deficits by 102 billion over 10 years according to the nonpartisan congressional budget office the legislation would either reduce or have no effect on the taxes due or paid by any family with income less than 400 000 and is fully consistent with the president s pledge in fact the clean energy tax credits and the expanded premium tax credit will cut taxes for millions of americans treasury secretary janet yellen wrote in a letter to congressional leadership sinema said she is still waiting to see the results of a scrub by the senate s non partisan rule keeper before signing off but if schumer can keep his caucus together and pass this bill it will be a big win for democratic leaders ahead of a hotly contested upcoming midterm cycle we have agreed to remove the carried interest tax provision protect advanced manufacturing and boost our clean energy economy in the senate s budget reconciliation legislation the arizona senator said in a statement subject to the parliamentarian s review i ll move forward details of the reconciliation bill were highlighted further thursday as lawmakers continued to comb through the 700 plus pages of legislation ahead of this weekend s votes once the senate votes to begin debate on the bill lawmakers will have the opportunity to offer an unlimited number of amendments a cumbersome and time consuming process here s what s in the bill from the democrats top line priorities the economy the environment and health care economy the new proposal will invest 300 billion in deficit reduction backers say by making the biggest corporations and ultra wealthy pay their fair share and by providing funds to enhance irs tax enforcement but some of democrats most ambitious efforts to tax the ultra wealthy were sidelined by sinema s insistence that so called carried interest tax breaks for wealthy hedge fund managers and private equity executives be retained the original bill aimed to close this carried interest loophole by extending the holding period and therefore forcing investors to hold onto assets for longer a move wall street has adamantly fought sinema sought changes to the inflation reduction act specifically for the removal of the carried interest loophole provision sen sinema said she would not vote for the bill not even move to proceed unless we took it out so we had no choice schumer said during a press conference on friday in her statement thursday evening sinema left the door open to future discussions on modifying the carried interest tax following this effort i look forward to working with senator warner to enact carried interest tax reforms protecting investments in america s economy and encouraging continued growth while closing the most egregious loopholes that some abuse to avoid paying taxes she said in a statement thursday night changes to secure sinema s backing also included the lessening of a proposed 15 corporate minimum tax by preserving the ability of manufacturers to quickly deduct capital purchases proposed changes to depreciation policies had some republicans concerned that the ira would disproportionately hit manufactures we remain skeptical and will be reviewing the revised legislation carefully national association of manufacturers president and ceo jay timmons said in a statement we cannot afford to undermine manufacturing competitiveness the proposed corporate minimum tax still apply only to large corporations but while democrats took a loss in revenue to meet sinema s demands they made up for it with the addition of a provision aimed at investors a new 1 excise tax on stock buybacks that would make companies pay on the amount of stock that they repurchase schumer has said that this excise tax would ensure that the package still reduces the federal deficit by as much as 300 billion the same amount democrats aimed for in the original deal and a key priority for manchin we re adding in an excise tax on stock buy backs that will bring in 74 billion schumer said chuck marr the vice president of federal tax policy at the center on budget and policy priorities in a twitter thread called the tax an excellent policy designed to correct tax policy inefficiency and raises 125 billion over ten years climate most of the 369 billion the inflation reduction act would spend on climate would go to renewable energy tax credits that would prop up clean energy technology such as carbon capture hydrogen renewables and energy storage the climate provisions would also provide consumer tax credits for home energy efficiency improvements and for the purchase of clean vehicles backers say the package would cut about 40 of the country s carbon emissions by 2030 the bill includes a methane emissions reduction program an array of reforms that would have a dramatic impact on both the onshore and offshore federal oil and gas royalty rates and undo a 10 year moratorium on offshore wind leasing established by former president donald trump among other provisions democrats are also excited about the bill s hefty funding initiative 60 billion overall for environmental justice projects sinema sought a 5 billion boost to the bill s spending on drought resiliency funding in addition to the 575 million already written in the bill that would go to the bureau of reclamation for drought response and preparedness and 13 million for drought relief for tribes on friday sinema s arizona colleague mark kelly announced a deal to include 4 billion in resources to combat draught in the western u s in the bill health care prescription drug prices aside from climate spending the reconciliation bill also would allocate 64 billion to extend expiring affordable care act subsidies by three years through 2025 it also aims to chip away at a long held democratic goal of lowering prescription drug prices for seniors by allowing medicare to negotiate drug prices directly the new negotiation policy will ensure that patients with medicare get the best deal possible on high priced drugs and pay cost sharing for those drugs based on the medicare negotiated price according to the bill s summary the bill would also cap out of pocket costs at 2 000 for those who use medicare drug plans with the option to break that amount into affordable monthly payments currently no cap exists it would also impose penalties on drug companies if they increase their prices faster than inflation which would incentivize them to keep prices down and expand premium and co pay assistance on prescription drugs for low income individuals while we re not there yet we re on the cusp of passing the most important step we can pass to take help congress to help us lower inflation the inflation reduction act biden said in

on july 27 2022 delaware gov john carney signed into law amendments to the delaware statutory trust act dsta these amendments include the addition of new subchapter iii control beneficial interest acquisitions control share statute which is reproduced as appendix a to this mailing the control share statute applies to all registered closed end funds and business development companies bdcs that are organized as delaware statutory trusts and have a class of equity securities listed on a national securities exchange 1 the control share statute contains provisions comparable to existing control share statutes in other states although it also contains a number of enhanced protections for registered closed end funds and bdcs 2 generally control share statutes provide a company with the right to prevent or restrict certain changes in corporate control by limiting voting rights of a person that acquires directly or indirectly the ownership of or the power to direct the vote of control shares as defined in the specific state control share statute control shares are shares of stock that are equal to or exceed specified percentages of the company s total voting power under existing control share statutes holders of control shares typically cannot vote their control shares unless the company s stockholders vote to approve their voting rights or the acquisition is approved in advance by the company s board 3 the control share statute differs in some respects from existing state control share statutes by virtue of being tailored to the unique regulatory and corporate governance considerations applicable to registered closed end funds and bdcs under the investment company act of 1940 1940 act and restores delaware to a state of parity with maryland as a jurisdiction for organizing registered closed end funds and bdcs the following sections describe the principal features of the control share statute which remain unchanged in all material respects from the legislation originally proposed in the delaware general assembly on may 5 2022 and described in our june 7 2022 client alert delaware proposes protections for closed end fund investors following this description of the control share statute we offer some observations on the implications of this new law under the 1940 act and for boards of trustees application of the control share statute many closed end investment companies registered or regulated under the 1940 act covered funds are organized as delaware statutory trusts and are subject to the dsta the control share statute automatically applies to all covered funds without any action required on the part of the covered fund or its board of trustees to opt in to its provisions 4 the control share statute follows the general structure of other state control share statutes it defines control beneficial interests which we refer to as control shares by reference to a series of voting power thresholds and provides that a holder of control shares acquired in a control share acquisition5 has no voting rights under the dsta or the governing instrument of the covered fund with respect to the control shares acquired in the control share acquisition except to the extent approved by the beneficial owners of the covered fund by the affirmative vote of two thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter excluding all interested shares 6 this vote cannot be modified by the covered fund s board of trustees or governing documents and generally must occur at a special meeting requested by the acquiring person pursuant to the procedures contained in new section 3885 of the dsta however consistent with the general approach of the dsta to give maximum effect to the principle of freedom of contract 7 the control share statute also permits a covered fund s board of trustees through a provision in the covered fund s governing instrument or by board action alone to eliminate the application of the control share statute to the acquisition of control shares in the covered fund specifically generally or generally by types as to specifically identified or unidentified existing or future beneficial owners or their affiliates or associates or as to any series or classes of beneficial interests 8 the control share statute does not provide that a covered fund can generally opt out of the application of the control share statute to the covered fund rather specific acquisitions or classes of acquisitions may be exempted by the board of trustees either in advance or retroactively but other aspects of the control share statute which are described herein would continue to apply the result is that several different outcomes may occur in the event of a control share acquisition that does not fall into a preexisting exemption in the covered fund s governing documents or adopted by the board of trustees or contained in the control share statute the board could i exempt the acquisition though the board is under no obligation to do so 9 ii take no action and wait for a request from the acquiring person to convene a special meeting of shareholders or iii determine to call a special meeting of shareholders on its own accord 10 the control share statute provides for a series of voting power thresholds above which shares are considered control shares whether one of these thresholds of voting power is met is determined by aggregating the holdings of the acquiring person as well as those of his her or its associates 11 these thresholds are 10 or more but less than 15 of all voting power 15 or more but less than 20 of all voting power 20 or more but less than 25 of all voting power 25 or more but less than 30 of all voting power 30 or more but less than a majority of all voting power or a majority or more of all voting power voting power under the control share statute is the power whether such power is direct or indirect or through any contract arrangement understanding relationship or otherwise to directly or indirectly exercise or direct the exercise of the voting power of beneficial interests of a covered fund in the election of trustees either generally or with respect to any subset series or class of trustees including any trustees elected solely by a particular series or class of beneficial interests the control share statute is forward looking only and any control shares acquired before august 1 2022 the effective date of the control share statute are not subject to the control share statute 12 under the control share statute once a threshold is reached an acquirer has no voting rights with respect to shares in excess of that threshold i e the control shares until approved by a vote of beneficial owners or otherwise exempted by the board of trustees as described above an acquirer must repeat that process at each threshold level for example upon a control share acquisition resulting in ownership of 12 of all voting power the acquirer would only be able to exercise 9 99 of the covered fund s voting power until the full 12 voting power is approved assuming that approval was given and the acquirer then executed a control share acquisition resulting in ownership of 17 of all voting power the acquirer would only be able to exercise 14 99 of the covered fund s voting power until the full 17 voting power is approved in a merger or consolidation the acquisition of shares will not constitute a control share acquisition if the covered fund is the surviving or resulting party in the merger or consolidation however any shares issued to a holder of control shares in the target party will be considered a control share acquisition and remain control shares of the surviving party assuming that company is a delaware statutory trust 13 the control share statute requires shareholders to disclose to the covered fund any control share acquisition within 10 days of such acquisition and also permits a covered fund to require a shareholder or an associate of such person to disclose the number of shares owned or with respect to which such person or an associate thereof can directly or indirectly exercise voting power 14 further the control share statute requires a shareholder or an associate of such person to provide to a covered fund within 10 days of receiving a request therefor from the covered fund any information that the trustees reasonably believe is necessary or desirable to determine whether a control share acquisition has occurred 15 under the control share statute a member of a national securities exchange such as a broker dealer shall not be deemed to be a beneficial owner of shares held directly or indirectly by it on behalf of another person solely because such member is the record holder of such securities and pursuant to the rules of such exchange may direct the vote of such shares without instruction on other than contested matters or matters that may affect substantially the rights or privileges of the holders of the shares to be voted but is otherwise precluded by the rules of such exchange from voting without instructions 16 benefits for covered funds the control share statute contains several provisions designed to complement the unique regulatory and corporate governance considerations applicable to covered funds under the 1940 act and to provide benefits relative to the maryland control share acquisition act mcsaa 17 that can apply to registered closed end funds and bdcs organized as maryland corporations many covered funds issue preferred shares that under the 1940 act entitle holders to vote as a separate class to elect two trustees preferred trustees 18 the definition of control shares also applies to preferred shares and the control share thresholds apply to preferred shares as a separate class for example a preferred shareholder acquiring 12 of the preferred share voting power would be treated as having made a control share acquisition and would have 9 99 voting power with respect to class voting for the preferred trustees but would not be treated as having made a control share acquisition with respect to voting for other trustees where the common and preferred shares vote together as one class assuming that 12 preferred share position when combined with any common share position does not result in overall voting power above one of the thresholds described above when the preferred and common shareholders are combined as one class this provision recognizes the unique corporate governance dynamics applicable to many covered funds acknowledges how those dynamics impact corporate control and provides clarity on how to apply the control share statute in this unique context additionally the voting power thresholds for control shares are more tailored to the ranges of voting power that can result in undue influence over a covered fund the mcsaa contains thresholds at i 1 10 or more but less than 1 3 of all voting power ii 1 3 or more but less than a majority of all voting power and iii a majority or more of all voting power 19 in light of the generally low overall shareholder participation in covered funds shareholder meetings and the result that a relatively small amount of voting power can influence the outcome of a matter put to a vote by covered funds the increased stratification of voting power ranges in the control share statute could provide greater protection to investors in covered funds for example the difference between an acquiring person owning 11 and 21 of a covered fund s voting power may make a significant difference in the outcome of a vote under the control share statute noninterested shareholders can evaluate the intentions and plans of an acquiring person at the 10 15 and 20 levels whereas under the mcsaa an approval at the 11 level would remain sufficient until the acquiring person acquired more than 33 33 of the voting power the definition of associate in the control share statute encompasses a wide range of parties related to an acquiring person including any investment fund or other collective investment vehicle that shares an investment adviser with the acquiring person this is important because the 1940 act does not otherwise prohibit affiliated private funds with the same investment adviser from acting in concert to acquire a large position in a closed end fund and then exerting undue influence on the acquired closed end fund 20 registered closed end funds and bdcs pursue a stated investment strategy for the long term benefit of investors the control share statute contains provisions that prevent acquiring persons from disrupting and distracting covered funds in the execution of these long term strategies the board of trustees is also entitled to include a vote on the issue of such voting rights at the covered fund s annual meeting rather than call a special meeting if a control share buyer s request is received within 120 days of the anniversary date of the covered fund s proxy statement for the prior year s annual meeting 21 additionally control shares are not considered outstanding for shareholder quorum purposes until voting rights for such control shares are approved by noninterested shareholders 22 the application of the control share statute is unambiguous it automatically applies to all covered funds without any action on the part of a covered fund or its board of trustees as discussed previously the mcsaa applies to a registered closed end fund only if the fund s board of directors affirmatively opts in to the coverage of the mcsaa as described above the control share statute gives the board of trustees tools to monitor concentrated ownership that may constitute a control share acquisition and imposes duties on shareholders to cooperate with reasonable requests from covered funds in this regard 23 overall the unique benefits that the control share statute provides are designed to complement the unique regulatory and corporate governance considerations applicable to covered funds under the 1940 act and to provide enhanced protection relative to comparable provisions in the mcsaa 1940 act matters the 2020 sec staff control share statement stated that the staff would not recommend enforcement action against a covered fund under section 18 i of the 1940 act for opting in to and triggering a control share statute if the decision to do so by the board of the fund was taken with reasonable care on a basis consistent with other applicable duties and laws and the duty to the fund and its shareholders generally section 18 i provides except as otherwise required by law every share of stock shall be a voting stock and have equal voting rights with every other outstanding voting stock the staff reminded market participants that any action taken by a covered fund s board including regarding control share statutes should be examined in light of i the board s fiduciary duties ii applicable federal and state law and iii the particular facts and circumstances surrounding the board s action 24 the u s district court for the southern district of new york recently ruled that a closed end fund organized as a massachusetts business trust that had adopted bylaw provisions that established a control share mechanism similar to the control share statute in maryland corporate law violated section 18 i of the 1940 act 25 the closed end fund at issue in this case has appealed the district court s decision to the u s court of appeals for the second circuit the final outcome of this litigation and the final position of certain federal courts on closed end funds use of control share provisions is therefore yet to be determined this ruling however did not address the application of the 1940 act to a fund organized in a state with a control share statute and organized as a type of legal entity to which the control share statute automatically applies 26 the control share statute provides an express statutory scheme for control share acquisitions under delaware law applicable to covered funds organized as delaware statutory trusts the control share statute is automatically applicable to all covered funds without any action on the part of the covered fund s board of trustees and covered funds cannot generally opt out of the control share statute the control share statute applies to holders of shares and not to shares themselves and therefore is designed to not implicate section 18 i of the 1940 act 27 in addition the control share statute facially falls within section 18 i s unless otherwise required by law provision the automatic application of the control share statute to covered funds together with the inability of covered funds to generally opt out of the control share statute also directly answers the staff s principal rationale for not applying the unless otherwise required by law exception in its analysis of the mcsaa in the now withdrawn boulder letter 28 the control share statute represents an important step forward in the application of control share statutes to registered closed end funds and bdcs and is the most thoughtful state legislation to date addressing the unique 1940 act considerations applicable to registered closed end funds and business development companies in the control share context additional matters for consideration the control share statute will require boards of trustees to consider how the statute interacts with different scenarios that covered funds will or may face of key importance will be determinations regarding whether how and when to exempt control share acquisitions from the control share statute without a shareholder vote the possibility of such exemptions is likely to arise in a variety of scenarios including those involving preferred share holdings fund of funds arrangements entered into pursuant to rule 12d1 4 under the 1940 act and insider purchases regarding insider purchase decisions boards will need to balance multiple factors including an insider s holdings as of the effective date of the control share statute i e as of august 1 2022 relative to any other large or concentrated positions in the fund as of that date the potential strengthening of the foregoing section 18 i analysis through a policy of not granting discretionary exemptions for control share acquisitions and any particular facts and circumstances bearing on a board s duty to act in the best interests of the covered fund and its shareholders other issues are likely to arise in the event an acquiring shareholder requests a special meeting to have noninterested shareholders approve voting rights for control shares in particular how proxy voting advisory firms will analyze such a proposal or how they may recommend that shareholders vote on that proposal is not clear also unclear is whether proxy voting advisory firms would penalize trustees with unfavorable recommendations in trustee elections if the trustees have not granted discretionary exemptions with respect to control share acquisitions boards of trustees of covered funds and sponsors should carefully review their particular facts and circumstances and the provisions of the control share statute and consider the impacts of the control share statute and whether these impacts warrant any present action _______________ 1 the control share statute does not apply to unlisted registered closed end funds and business development companies and they cannot opt in to the control share statute 2 approximately half of u s states have adopted control share statutes however among the jurisdictional and organizational forms most commonly used by registered closed end funds and bdcs until now

example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video the 740 billion package is made up of health care climate change and deficit reduction strategies in hopes of tackling inflation and bringing down deficits washington not as robust as the proposal president joe biden once envisioned to rebuild america s public infrastructure and family support systems the democrats compromise of health care climate change and deficit reduction strategies is still a substantial undertaking the estimated 740 billion package passed sunday by the senate and heading to the house is full of party priorities those include capping prescription drug costs at 2 000 out of pocket for seniors helping americans pay for private health insurance and what democrats are calling the most substantial investment in history to fight climate change some 375 billion over the decade almost half the money raised 300 billion will go toward paying down federal deficits it s all paid for largely with new corporate taxes including a 15 minimum tax on big corporations to ensure they don t skip out on paying any taxes at all as well as projected federal savings from lower medicare drug costs how does the inflation reduction act reduce inflation called the inflation reduction act of 2022 it s not at all clear the 755 page bill will substantially ease inflationary pressures though millions of americans are expected to see some relief in health care and other costs when will the house vote on the inflation reduction act votes fell strictly along party lines in the 50 50 senate with all democrats in favor all republicans opposed and vice president kamala harris providing a tie breaking vote for 51 50 passage the house is expected to vote by friday a look at what s in and out of the final package lower prescription drug costs launching a long sought goal the bill would allow the medicare program to negotiate prescription drug prices with pharmaceutical companies saving the federal government some 288 billion over the 10 year budget window those new revenues would be put back into lower costs for seniors on medications including a 2 000 out of pocket cap for older adults buying prescriptions from pharmacies the money would also be used to provide free vaccinations for seniors who now are among the few not guaranteed free access according to a summary document seniors would also have insulin prices capped at 35 a dose a provision to extend that price cap on insulin to americans with private health insurances was out of line with senate budget rules and republicans stripped it from the final bill help pay for health insurance the bill would extend the subsidies provided during the covid 19 pandemic to help some americans who buy health insurance on their own under earlier pandemic relief the extra help was set to expire this year but the bill would allow the assistance to keep going for three more years lowering insurance premiums for people who are purchasing their own health care policies single biggest investment in climate change in u s history the bill would invest nearly 375 billion over the decade in climate change fighting strategies including investments in renewable energy production and tax rebates for consumers to buy new or used electric vehicles it s broken down to include 60 billion for a clean energy manufacturing tax credit and 30 billion for a production tax credit for wind and solar seen as ways to boost and support the industries that can help curb the country s dependence on fossil fuels the bill also gives tax credits for nuclear power and carbon capture technology that oil companies such as exxon mobil have invested millions of dollars to advance the bill would impose a new fee on excess methane emissions from oil and gas drilling while giving fossil fuel companies access to more leases on federal lands and waters a late addition pushed by sen kyrsten sinema d ariz and other democrats in arizona nevada and colorado would designate 4 billion to combat a mega drought in the west including conservation efforts in the colorado river basin which nearly 40 million americans rely on for drinking water for consumers there are tax breaks as incentives to go green one is a 10 year consumer tax credit for renewable energy investments in wind and solar there are tax breaks for buying electric vehicles including a 4 000 tax credit for purchase of used electric vehicles and 7 500 for new ones in all democrats believe the strategy could put the country on a path to cut greenhouse gas emissions 40 by 2030 and would represent the single biggest climate investment in u s history by far how to pay for all of this the biggest revenue raiser in the bill is a new 15 minimum tax on corporations that earn more than 1 billion in annual profits it s a way to clamp down on some 200 u s companies that avoid paying the standard 21 corporate tax rate including some that end up paying no taxes at all the new corporate minimum tax would kick in after the 2022 tax year and raise more than 258 billion over the decade the revenue would have been higher but sinema insisted on one change to the 15 corporate minimum allowing a depreciation deduction used by manufacturing industries that shaves about 55 billion off the total revenue what s changed in recent days to win over sinema democrats dropped plans to close a tax loophole long enjoyed by wealthier americans so called carried interest which under current law taxes wealthy hedge fund managers and others at a 20 rate the left has for years sought to boost the carried interest tax rate hiked to 37 in the original bill more in line with upper income earners sinema wouldn t allow it keeping the tax break for the wealthy deprives the party of 14 billion in revenue they were counting on to help pay for the package in its place democrats with sinema s nod will impose a 1 excise tax on stock buybacks raising some 74 billion over the decade money is also raised by boosting the irs to go after tax cheats the bill proposes an 80 billion investment in taxpayer services enforcement and modernization which is projected to raise 203 billion in new revenue a net gain of 124 billion over the decade the bill sticks with biden s original pledge not to raise taxes on families or businesses making less than 400 000 a year the lower drug prices for seniors are paid for with savings from medicare s negotiations with the drug companies extra money to pay down deficits with some 740 billion in new revenue and around 433 billion in new investments the bill promises to put the difference toward deficit reduction federal deficits spiked during the covid 19 pandemic when federal spending soared and tax revenues fell as the nation s economy churned through shutdowns closed offices and other massive changes the nation has seen deficits rise and fall in recent years but overall federal budgeting is on an unsustainable path according to the congressional budget office which put out a new report this week on long term projections what s left behind this latest package emerged suddenly at the end of july after 18 months of start stop negotiations leaves behind many of biden s more ambitious goals senate majority leader chuck schumer d n y struck a deal with sen joe manchin to revive biden s package slimming it down to bring the west virginia democrat back to the negotiating table next they drew sinema the remaining party holdout with additional changes the package remains robust by typical standards but nowhere near the sweeping build back better program biden once envisioned while congress did pass a 1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill for highways broadband and other investments that biden signed into law last year the president s and the party s other key priorities have slipped away among them is a continuation of a 300 monthly child tax credit that was sending money directly to families during the pandemic and is believed to have widely reduced child poverty also gone for now are plans for free pre kindergarten and community college as well as the nation s

heading to the house is full of party priorities those include capping prescription drug costs at 2 000 out of pocket for seniors helping americans pay for private health insurance and what democrats are calling the most substantial investment in history to fight climate change some 375 billion over the decade almost half the money raised 300 billion will go toward paying down federal deficits it s all paid for largely with new corporate taxes including a 15 minimum tax on big corporations to ensure they don t skip out on paying any taxes at all as well as projected federal savings from lower medicare drug costs how does the inflation reduction act reduce inflation called the inflation reduction act of 2022 it s not at all clear the 755 page bill will substantially ease inflationary pressures though millions of americans are expected to see some relief in health care and other costs when will the house vote on the inflation reduction act votes fell strictly along party lines in the 50 50 senate with all democrats in favor all republicans opposed and vice president kamala harris providing a tie breaking vote for 51 50 passage the house is expected to vote by friday a look at

cap for older adults buying prescriptions from pharmacies the money would also be used to provide free vaccinations for seniors who now are among the few not guaranteed free access according to a summary document seniors would also have insulin prices capped at 35 a dose a provision to extend that price cap on insulin to americans with private health insurances was out of line with senate budget rules and republicans stripped it from the final bill help pay for health insurance the bill would extend the subsidies provided during the covid 19 pandemic to help some americans who buy health insurance on their own under earlier pandemic relief the extra help was set to expire this year but the bill would allow the assistance to keep going for three more years lowering insurance premiums for people who are purchasing their own health care policies single biggest investment in climate change in u s history the bill would invest nearly 375 billion over the decade in climate change fighting strategies including investments in renewable energy production and tax rebates for consumers to buy new or used electric vehicles it s broken down to include 60 billion for a clean energy manufacturing tax credit and 30 billion for a production tax credit for wind and solar seen as ways to boost and support the industries that can help curb the country s dependence on fossil fuels the bill also gives tax credits for nuclear power and carbon capture technology that oil companies such as exxon mobil have invested millions of dollars to advance the bill would impose a new fee on excess methane emissions from oil and gas drilling while giving fossil fuel companies access to more leases on federal lands and waters a late addition pushed by sen kyrsten sinema d ariz and other democrats in arizona nevada and colorado would designate 4 billion to combat a mega drought in the west including conservation efforts in the colorado river basin which nearly 40 million americans rely on for drinking water for consumers there are tax breaks as incentives to go green one is a 10 year consumer tax credit for renewable energy investments in wind and solar there are tax breaks for buying electric vehicles including a 4 000 tax credit for purchase of used electric vehicles and 7 500 for new ones in all democrats believe the strategy could put the country on a path to cut greenhouse gas emissions 40 by 2030 and would represent the single biggest climate investment in u s history by far how to pay for all of this the biggest revenue raiser in the bill is a new 15 minimum tax on corporations that earn more than 1 billion in annual profits it s a way to clamp down on some 200 u s companies that avoid paying the standard 21 corporate tax rate including some that end up paying no taxes at all the new corporate minimum tax would kick in after the 2022 tax year and raise more than 258 billion over the decade the revenue would have been higher but sinema insisted on one change to the 15 corporate minimum allowing a depreciation deduction used by manufacturing industries that shaves about 55 billion off the total revenue what s changed in recent days to win over sinema democrats dropped plans to close a tax loophole long enjoyed by wealthier americans so called carried interest which under current law taxes wealthy hedge fund managers and others at a 20 rate the left has for years sought to boost the carried interest tax rate hiked to 37 in the original bill more in line with upper income earners sinema wouldn t allow it keeping the tax break for the wealthy deprives the party of 14 billion in revenue they were counting on to help pay for the package in its place democrats with sinema s nod will impose a 1 excise tax on stock buybacks raising some 74 billion over the decade money is also raised by boosting the irs to go after tax cheats the bill proposes an 80 billion investment in taxpayer services enforcement and modernization which is projected to raise 203 billion in new revenue a net gain of 124 billion over the decade the bill sticks with biden s original pledge not to raise taxes on families or businesses making less than 400 000 a year the lower drug prices for seniors are paid for with savings from medicare s negotiations with the drug companies extra money to pay down deficits with some 740 billion in new revenue and around 433 billion in new investments the bill promises to put the difference toward deficit reduction federal deficits spiked during the covid 19 pandemic when federal spending soared and tax revenues fell as the nation s economy churned through shutdowns closed offices and other massive changes the nation has seen deficits rise and fall in recent years but overall federal budgeting is on an unsustainable path according to the congressional budget office which put out a new report this week on long term projections what s left behind this latest package emerged suddenly at the end of july after 18 months of start stop negotiations leaves behind many of biden s more ambitious goals senate majority leader chuck schumer d n y struck a deal with sen joe manchin to revive biden s package slimming it down to bring the west virginia democrat back to the negotiating table next they drew sinema the remaining party holdout with additional changes the package remains robust by typical standards but nowhere near the sweeping build back better program biden once envisioned while congress did pass a 1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill for highways broadband and other investments that biden signed into law last year the president s and the party s other key priorities have slipped away among them is a continuation of a 300 monthly child tax credit that was sending money directly to families during the pandemic and is believed to have widely reduced child poverty also gone for now are plans for free pre kindergarten and community college as well as the nation s first paid family leave program that would have provided up to 4 000 a month for births deaths and other pivotal needs ___

investments that biden signed into law last year the president s and the party s other key priorities have slipped away among them is a continuation of a 300 monthly child tax credit that was sending money directly to families during the pandemic and is believed to have widely reduced child poverty also gone for now are plans for free pre kindergarten and community college as well as the nation s first paid family leave program that would have provided up to 4 000 a month for births deaths and other pivotal needs ___
查看中文 key points and practical advice in february 2022 the u s department of justice doj announced that the china initiative launched in november 2018 to counter perceived threats to u s national security from china was not the right approach 1 nonetheless the biden administration continues to pursue china related enforcement actions including with respect to alleged trade secret theft as well as alleged sanctions and export controls violations nonetheless the biden administration continues to pursue china related enforcement actions including with respect to alleged trade secret theft as well as alleged sanctions and export controls violations facing investigation obstacles including several chinese blocking statutes the u s securities and exchange commission sec may change its enforcement strategy in china related matters by pursuing charges that do not require it to establish fraud and or by relying more on evidence it is able to collect from sources outside of china meanwhile the sec has listed more than 150 issuers that do not comply with the holding foreign companies accountable act hfcaa and has strengthened disclosure requirements for china based variable interest entity vie structures recent people s republic of china prc blocking statutes and laws on cyber and data security and privacy have made cross border enforcement more challenging given the current state of u s china relations and a number of complicated new laws in both countries companies should establish transparent and credible internal compliance processes to help ensure that they meet u s and chinese legal requirements for example when making strategic decisions companies should be proactive in assessing legal and compliance risks and potential conflicts under both u s and chinese regulatory regimes instead of reacting to issues when they arise to avoid being caught between conflicting regulatory regimes companies may consider urging u s and chinese regulators to talk among themselves rather than serving as a go between credibility and process matter for example if prc blocking statutes inhibit the sec s ability to conduct its own investigations it may seek to rely more heavily on reviews done by the company s internal audit team or outside counsel and other sources of information companies should implement and maintain internal processes that the sec can trust both the u s and chinese authorities recently have taken significant actions relating to cross border enforcement involving china on the u s side the doj continues to investigate and prosecute alleged trade secret theft as well as alleged sanctions and export controls violations while the sec has focused on issues related to the hfcaa and vie structures on the chinese side the prc government has passed various blocking statutes and data privacy laws that have made u s cross border enforcement efforts more challenging companies that do business in both countries thus need a plan to navigate between these sometimes conflicting regulatory regimes recent doj enforcement trends regarding china doj s shift away from the china initiative in november 2018 the doj launched the china initiative an effort to identify and investigate economic espionage and trade secret theft intended to benefit the chinese state under the initiative s umbrella federal prosecutors also brought a number of cases charging academics and researchers with fraud and false statements to federal agencies for allegedly misrepresenting their ties to the chinese government in february 2022 matthew g olsen the assistant attorney general aag in charge of the doj s national security division nsd acknowledged that to many the china initiative fueled a narrative of intolerance and bias suggesting that the justice department treats people from china or of chinese descent differently 2 at the same time mr olsen asserted that the chinese government continued to pose a national security threat to u s interests he announced that going forward the justice department would apply the broader strategy for countering nation state threats to potential threats from countries such as china russia iran and north korea during a july 28 2022 hearing before the u s house committee on the judiciary mr olsen reiterated the department s commitment to the strategy for countering nation state threats noting that the nsd is particularly focused on cyber enabled attacks and other nation state attacks and that the nsd is most concerned of china and russia and also iran and north korea 3 while some interpreted mr olsen s february 2022 speech as a repudiation of the china initiative the shift away from the china initiative does not mean that the biden administration is relaxing its enforcement of perceived threats from china the doj has continued to pursue many cases originally brought under the china initiative including those involving alleged fraud and false statements that said future enforcement will likely prioritize alleged trade secret theft and export controls violations over alleged grant fraud and false statements other enforcement and regulatory authorities also will use all available tools and existing mechanisms such as committee on foreign investment in the united states cfius reviews will not be affected companies and individuals operating in china would be well advised to stay vigilant and ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations prc talent programs the doj also has been active in bringing criminal charges against individuals who allegedly lie about receiving money from the prc or about their affiliations with the prc many of those cases involve defendants participation in prc talent recruitment programs like the thousand talents program which is not itself illegal however the doj scrutinizes these programs closely because it views them as a way to recruit individuals with access to u s government funded research for the prc s benefit companies may face reputational risks and may find themselves having to incur substantial legal expenses in defending themselves against investigations if they are seen by the u s authorities as facilitating employee cooperation in prc talent programs perceived to threaten u s national security interests if companies lie about or omit information on this participation they may face potential legal liability including criminal liability companies should always comply with u s laws and regulations maintain accurate books and records and ensure that any responses to u s government inquiries are truthful and complete at the same time companies also may be well advised to inform their employees of their right to seek counsel or remain silent when questioned under certain circumstances such as at border crossings and to decline to give consent for searches of their persons or possessions in addition companies should assess what data they should store in the united states as opposed to in the prc and vice versa and be careful about data transfers between the two jurisdictions that may raise issues under prc data and cybersecurity laws and the u s clarifying lawful overseas use of data act cloud act companies should also be mindful of the protections offered by attorney client privilege to the extent that they are seeking advice from u s counsel sanctions and export controls sanctions and export controls are top priorities for doj enforcement on june 16 2022 deputy attorney general lisa monaco publicly described sanctions as the new fcpa the foreign corrupt practices act and remarked that he growth of sanctions enforcement follows the path that the fcpa traveled before it thus implying that the doj expects sanctions enforcement to be very active in the future as fcpa enforcement has been for some time 4 in addition u s treasury secretary janet yellen recently called out chinese companies perceived to be seeking to undermine sanctions with russia and discussed working toward transitioning supply chains to trusted nations 5 recent high profile sanctions enforcement actions include an august 2021 case brought by the u s department of treasury s office of foreign assets control ofac against bank of china s u k subsidiary resulting in a 2 3 million settlement regarding alleged violations of the sudan sanctions program through processing payments 6 the u s department of commerce s bureau of industry and security recently announced a three part strategy for enforcing export controls including fines public disclosure and requiring settling companies to publicly admit to misconduct 7 in may 2022 u s secretary of state antony j blinken announced a collaboration with the department of commerce on strengthening export controls 8 recent civil export controls actions include the commerce department s issuance of a temporary denial order against three u s 3d printing companies suspending their export privileges for 180 days 9 according to the commerce department the companies had exported controlled technology from the united states to china for 3d printing purposes without the required authorization from the u s government or consent from the companies clients recent sec enforcement trends regarding china sec cross border enforcement strategy post luckin coffee the sec enforcement action against luckin coffee in december 2020 was viewed as groundbreaking for several reasons including the size of the settlement related to a china based issuer 180 million in penalties the swiftness of the investigation and the cooperation between the sec and the china securities regulatory commission csrc 10 although the sec has opened numerous investigations related to china based issuers in the intervening years the agency faces significant obstacles including prc blocking statutes that make it more difficult to obtain information from china and hamper its ability to conduct those investigations these developments will continue to have a practical effect on the sec s cross border enforcement strategy the sec likely will focus on collecting evidence from sources outside of china such as third parties involved in initial public offerings short seller research firms and whistleblowers in addition the sec may find it more expedient to pursue nonfraud charges against alleged wrongdoers such as accounting or internal controls violations rather than fraud cases which typically depend on evidence of intent that are based on proof obtained through internal communications and witness testimony holding foreign companies accountable act in december 2020 congress passed the hfcaa which directs the sec to prohibit securities of a registrant from being listed on a u s exchange if the public company accounting oversight board pcaob determines that it was unable to inspect the auditor of the registrant s financial statements for three consecutive years legislation pending in the u s congress could shorten this time frame to two years 11 the pcaob has identified firms that it has not been able to inspect and the sec has listed on its website over 150 issuers that it views as potentially out of compliance with u s regulations as of july 29 2022 12 some media reports suggest that u s and prc authorities may be attempting to resolve these problems but yj fischer director of the sec s office of international affairs recently commented that significant issues remain and time is quickly running out 13 additionally the hfcaa has given rise to a great deal of uncertainty around the adequacy of the disclosures that companies have made and must continue to make variable interest entities prc regulations prohibit or restrict foreign investment in chinese companies operating in certain sensitive industries including media and telecommunications to comply with these regulations many china based issuers have formed foreign holding companies to enter into contractual arrangements with chinese operating companies under the contractual arrangements these china based issuers control and become the primary beneficiaries of the chinese operating companies the sec views the vie structure as potentially raising transparency issues the sec has instructed its staff to look through the vie structure to assess true ownership and control and to require disclosures for u s investors in july 2021 sec chairman gary gensler raised concerns over china based vie structures impact on u s investors and he asked the sec staff to seek certain disclosures from such entities before the registration for the issuer is declared effective 14 additionally in december 2021 the sec s division of corporation finance released a sample letter operationalizing some of chairman gensler s concerns including the areas of disclosure 15 the sec will likely continue to dig under complex legal structures to require compliance with u s laws including the hfcaa new chinese legal regime for cross border enforcement recent prc laws impacting cross border enforcement a number of prc laws that have made cross border enforcement efforts more challenging recently came into force these laws include two blocking statutes which appear to have been passed largely in response to u s congress enactment of the cloud act requiring overseas companies registered in the u s to cooperate with law enforcement by sharing data the international criminal judicial assistance law icja law mostly affecting doj investigations and article 177 of the revised prc securities law article 177 mostly affecting sec investigations the icja law enacted in october 2018 prohibits individuals and organizations in china from providing any evidence or assistance to foreign criminal authorities without first receiving prior approval from the chinese authorities enacted in december 2019 article 177 stipulates that no chinese entity or individual may transmit any securities related documents or information outside of china without the approval of the relevant chinese authorities there are also three prc laws on cyber and data security and protecting personal information the cybersecurity law which establishes a comprehensive framework for data protection and network security the data security law dsl which sets up a framework to classify data collected and stored in china based on its potential impact on chinese data security and the personal information protection law pipl which establishes strict requirements for data handlers operating in china collecting personal data on individuals questions for companies to consider when facing conflicts between us and prc legal regimes when does a foreign investigation become criminal or securities related the nature of the investigation whether criminal or civil determines which blocking statutes apply and which prc government agencies u s authorities should inform the distinction between a criminal investigation and a securities related investigation is not always clear however for example an initial investigation conducted by the sec could be purely civil in nature but criminal authorities such as the doj may become involved in the background with no indication to a company that there is an ongoing criminal investigation in addition chinese companies may need to decide when and to which prc authorities to report when they receive requests from self regulatory organizations such as the new york stock exchange nasdaq and the financial industry regulatory authority which tend to work closely with the sec will self reporting to u s regulators to claim cooperation credit violate prc laws the decision of whether to self report violations to u s regulators is particularly complex for china based companies given the prc s new laws concerning the protection of sensitive data on the one hand reporting infractions may risk running afoul of prc prohibitions on transporting certain data under the dsl and the pipl on the other hand companies that choose not to report may risk increased penalties from u s regulators it may be more efficient and productive to try to put the onus on the regulators to talk among themselves rather than having the company serve as a go between _______________ 1 assistant attorney general matthew olsen delivers remarks on countering nation state threats doj feb 23 2022 2 id 3 hearing oversight of the
