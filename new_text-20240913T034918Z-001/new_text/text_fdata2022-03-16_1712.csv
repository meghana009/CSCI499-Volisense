system continuous profit plus profit for the users recently many users on bitvito share images of their profits they often use profit plus system and bonus ratio they appear to be making good profits so what exactly is the profit plus system to provide ultimate trading experience to more users bitvito has offered a billion usdt or tether coin for bonuses namely the profit plus system in short the profit plus system has two dimensions the total net deposit and the total trading volume when these two values reach a certain number users will receive a corresponding percentage of bonuses based on the profit of each transaction order bitvito sets a very low access threshold with a total net deposit of 100usdt so that more users can enjoy the benefits of the profit plus system the vip system can be seen below the profit comparison table shows that bitvito has a higher percentage than other exchanges the original purpose of this profit plus system is that the production team of bitvito comes from top internet companies and traditional finance with rich experience and they want to create a product that is extremely user friendly and allows users to maximize the utilization of funds for biggest return to maximize users return is to maximize their profits more often than not most platforms only occasionally provide such profits by promotions for a certain of period instead of long term activities so to productize this strong demand into a long term system is one of bitvito s promises to their users driven by this strong vision the profit plus system was born the team encountered many problems when designing the system such as the access threshold usually exchanges are friendly to big money users but not small money users however most beginners start with small investments and they want to try little by little bitvito wanted to include these users in the profit plus system and let them share the benefits too so bitvito lowered the threshold to a very low level bitvito offers 100usdt deposits as threshold so the users can enjoy the benefits of the profit plus system and stay isolated from some of the risk beginners face when starting out to take beginner traders and investors into full consideration bitvito had the system divided users into 9 vip levels with different profit bonus rates based on total net deposit ranging from 100usdt to 5 million usdt of course these the it experts have set strict risk control measures to ensure the long term development of the platform and ensure that more users enjoy benefits of the profit plus system in the longer term the feedback from users so far about the profit plus system have shown great support and love bitvito have done a return visit to a large number of users who had made great profits and their feedback was that it is the first time they could see clear profit calculation on the order page bitvito has received screenshots of their trading profits and wonderful messages sharing their joys although their assets vary they all have enjoyed the benefit of the profit plus system from the very low entry threshold satisfied users are the best advocates and obviously they are more than happy to recommend more friends to trade with bitvito bitvito is tailored for users and spares no effort to provide a friendly experience so what other user friendly features are there on the platform bitvito has launched an era of zero funding rate and reduced transaction costs while increasing the capital utilization rate for the users the whole team wants to give the best to all the users at present most exchanges around the world have funding rates being a user friendly platform also includes lowering user costs lower costs mean higher returns no funding fees allows users to hold multiple contracts for longer periods similar to spot trading apart from no funding fees hayden shared some other advantages of the platform in addition to the advantages that maximizes the users benefits like the super high capital utilization rate and extremely low fees bitvito has also included other advantages that optimizes the user experience for example to support high leverage deep and

fluctuations and internet disconnections very little crossover with classic products in the traditional financial industry such as stocks crude oil precious metals etc they carried on discussing what makes bitvito different and why clients should choose to trade on bitvito hayden disclosed that bitvito has six key features with which bitvito will try to achieve the mission of changing the world with blockchain apart from profit and security other four features are below in terms of tech bitvito s technical team avoids the common practices of traditional exchanges and rather adopts the

western sanctions will cripple air travel in europe to the benefit of no one prosperity mzila correspondent sanctions whether targeted or not should be considered a crime against humanity their impact is like that of a full fledged war sanctions have the capacity to destroy a nation s infrastructure its economy but most of all they are responsible for the loss of lives and livelihoods of ordinary citizens be they targeted or not it is also the biggest contributor of migration across the globe hunger poor healthcare facilities inflation and folding industries push people to leave sanctioned nations in search of greener pastures nations such as libya afghanistan zimbabwe venezuela and iran once had thriving economies their crime was the vast resources in their countries that the united states us and her allies coveted and sought to possess the russia ukraine conflict has drawn a lot of interest globally with comparisons being drawn from previous conflicts some of which were not justified but because they were either instigated or supported by the us the united nations un never raised a finger questions have been raised on whether the un is an autonomous body or like the league of nations a puppet of a few powerful countries as if the mannequin state of the un is not enough it would appear the us has appointed itself arbitrator over global geo politics its influence is being felt across the globe as it tries with reckless abandon to circumnavigate resolutions across the globe in its favour it is a fact that global politics seeks to establish a balance of power so that no super power can emerge and terrorise other nations during the cold war talks it was agreed that ussr was enormous and if left in that state would present an overbearing force on other nations and the only way was for it to be dismantled by letting go of other states one of those states was ukraine it was further agreed in the minsk treaty that the north atlantic treaty organisation nato was not to expand towards eastern europe indeed documents show a pattern of promises us negotiators made to their russian counterparts as well as internal policy discussions opposing nato expansion to eastern europe however in its very shrewd way the us has been attempting to expand east thus violating its nato russia founding act which forbids it from doing so recently the us sweet talked ukraine into joining nato giving nato close proximity access to russia since ukraine shares the longest border with russia again ukraine joining nato creates a situation that enables the us to set up its military base very close to russia s borders presenting an imminent threat to the territorial integrity of russia as a sovereign state russia had no choice but to enforce the agreement it made with ukraine the minsk treaty that forbids ukraine from joining nato under any situation for this reason a conflict ensued between russia and ukraine it is therefore safe to say this russia ukraine war just like the war in iran afghanistan libya and kosovo was at the instigation of the us and its allies as it continues to pursue global dominance if it s not war that the us and its allies bring to any rival country s doorstep then it s the sanctions that have an equally devastating effect to the nation economy and the people s lives and livelihoods recently the us and her allies slapped russia with sanctions such as the barring of oil and gas imports from russia freezing of assets of russia s central bank limiting its ability to access us 630 billion 470 billion pounds of its dollar reserves the us uk and eu went further to ban people and businesses from dealing with the russian central bank its finance ministry and its wealth fund the russian banks were removed from the swift messaging system which enables the smooth transfer of money across borders this is meant to delay payments russia gets from exports of oil and gas the sanctions that have been imposed on russia by the nato allies are tantamount to shooting themselves in the foot the have killed any banking confidence that other countries might have held about the american dollar reserve as a way of saving money wise leaders whether friend or foe should start looking for other alternative banking ways the us has been freezing other nations assets and dollar reserves in their custody they did it to libya and to this day they have not refunded libya of its frozen assets yet it s in ruins in need of money to rebuild its ruined nation other options such as china panama brazil and south africa can be considered it has never been wise to put all eggs in one basket unlike smaller nations such as zimbabwe libya and afghanistan that the us bullies using its sanctions russia is a formidable force to reckon with an equal opposing force it recently refused to give another cheek but instead also slapped the us and her allies with sanctions russia more than doubled its key interest rate in an attempt to stem the decline of the rouble which fell 30 percent against the us dollar after sanctions were introduced it blocked interest payments to foreign investors who hold government bonds and banned russian companies from paying overseas shareholders foreign investors who hold tens of billions of dollars worth of russian stocks and bonds have been stopped from selling those assets many wealthy russians started converting their rouble into crypto currencies such as bitcoin to get around sanctions the eu is worried because many of the world s largest crypto exchanges are refusing to impose a blanket ban on russian clients meanwhile germany has ruled out sanctioning russia on its export of gas and oil because of the effects it would have on eu this is mainly due to the fact that eu imports a quarter of its oil and 40 percent of its gas from russia sanctioning russia would mean europe will have to brace up for a very cold winter this is tantamount to shooting self in the foot british airlines been banned from russian airspace or landing at russian airports recently the us the united kingdom uk and the european union eu took the russia ukraine conflict to the united nations un to discuss a way forward and 141 nations out of 193 member states voted for the resolution 35 abstained and 5 voted against nato s wish would have been to throw russia out of the five permanent members

columbus ohio ap several republicans competing for the party s nomination to run for u s senate in ohio are facing scrutiny for their ties to russia as the country intensifies its war against ukraine much of the attention has focused on former ohio republican party chair jane timken whose husband s family founded a company that does business in russia but other candidates in the race to succeed retiring gop sen rob portman including j d vance and mike gibbons also have links to business deals in russia that could become vulnerabilities in the may 3 primary while domestic issues generally dominate midterm political contests russia s invasion of ukraine with its harrowing images of civilian casualties has become an animating subject of the competitive senate race in ohio which has a large ukrainian american population in a race with several millionaire candidates the war is highlighting the risks that come with being wealthy and having tangled investment interests involving foreign countries the easiest target has long been timken whose husband sits on the board of the like named fortune 500 ball bearing manufacturer based in north canton ohio even before ukraine her adversaries sought to pin the timken co s international business dealings on timken timken co last week suspended its operations in russia where it has a manufacturing plant and an 8 year old relationship with united wagon co a moscow based manufacturer and servicer of freight cars the company signed the deal in 2014 around the time russia seized crimea conservative pacs mostly backing republican josh mandel in the race pilloried timken in attack ads as shameless for outwardly supporting ukraine and calling for tough sanctions on russia while making money off her investments in the company she has reported owning roughly 2 800 shares in timken co whose stock price initially rose after the feb 24 invasion timken campaign spokesperson mandi merritt calls the attacks on timken unfair it s a nonsense line of attack that jane is somehow responsible for every business decision of a multibillion dollar company where she never even worked merritt said in a statement jane s record of standing up for ukraine and championing ohioans is unmatched portman a co chair of the senate ukraine caucus has endorsed timken and campaigned with her around the state earlier this month after timken criticized vance for voicing indifference to the fate of ukraine in the days leading up to the invasion a vance ally tweeted no candidate has business ties in russia except for jane timken her husband s company has provided steel for their tanks rail and military the attacks continued from the left with one labor union ally trying to label timken russia jane but vance has business interests in russia of his own in may 2021 he joined peter thiel and other prominent conservative venture capitalists and invested in the video platform rumble a youtube alternative favored by the political right after tech companies including meta and twitter limited russia s state controlled news network rt to minimize the spread of propaganda the russian government announced it would move to rumble rumble has consistently supported free speech on its platform even speech it may find offensive vance campaign spokesperson taylor van kirk said in an email adding that this is unlike twitter which censors a sitting u s president while allowing the chinese communist party north korea and the ayatollah khomeini to name a few to continue their propaganda gibbons another senate candidate is distancing himself from a russian business deal announced by his company brown gibbons lang company in 2011 campaign spokesperson samantha cotten said bgl was merely promoting the transaction of another member of the 38 company global m a association the transaction sale of a 57 stake in a belarusian machine building plant to moscow headquartered hms group was exclusively executed by another company she said hms specializes in pipes for the russian oil industry and one of its main customers is gazprom the state owned gas giant and majority owner of the nord stream 2 pipeline whose operation was suspended because of the war lost in the ad attacks against timken is the fact that their intended beneficiary mandel has taken thousands of dollars in campaign contributions from timken family members employees and pacs over the years according to campaign finance data made available by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics so have many other candidates on ohio s 2022 ballot they include two other senate candidates republican state sen matt dolan and the best known democrat in the race u s rep tim ryan as well as republican gov mike dewine and a rival in the gop gubernatorial primary former u s rep jim renacci among other entanglements the real estate company owned at the time by the family of mandel s then wife ilana sold off its stake

there s a great british tradition of collecting plates my mum used to do it buying one from every seaside resort we ever visited on holiday capturing memories in a way that had far more impact than picking out a postcard once home these plates would be dutifully added to the wobbly rows creeping across the living room wall later she joined a plate club which produced a monthly series inspired by dickens and it all got a bit out of hand like generations of women who displayed their best china on a sideboard she cherished her collection seeing them as classier than hanging prints or pictures on the wall i meanwhile like many thought plate hanging was a bit naff and old fashioned but how the tables have turned for now i boast my own collection of ornamental plates and i m far from alone because displaying your chic crockery has become the ultimate interiors trend serving up a little elegance actress gwyneth paltrow displays 6 500 of hermes plates bowls and dishes in her designer home feeling dishy colour coded crockery worth 15 000 adorns the impressive dish room that is the pride and joy of kris jenner kris jenner seen leaving a hotel on september 11 2021 in new york city just look at kardashian matriarch kris jenner s jaw dropping dish room filled with 15 000 of colour coded crockery including a gucci teapot with matching teacups or gwyneth paltrow s dedicated plate wall shelves heaving with around 6 500 of blue and white hermes whether they get used or not is almost beside the point this is all about the aesthetic it started during the first lockdown with tablescaping the art of laying a gorgeous table as many of us searched for inventive ways to be distracted from the rolling news of doom spending so much time at home made us look at domestic items that we usually take for granted in a different way all lit up striking effect on the wall at homewood hotel near bath it was only a small step then to take the plates off the table and give them pride of place on our walls plus plates can be inexpensive and incredibly pretty little ready made artworks available everywhere throw in popular period dramas such as bridgerton which have us indulging a new found love for all things prints and chintz and that s how trends get made so move over gallery wall where multiple pictures are hung closely together it s all about the plate wall part of the appeal is that plates come in all manners of colours and sizes meaning that no matter what your taste or space requirements are you can find something that suits you can hang them in rows columns or clusters grouping by size colour or pattern on any wall of your choosing fine dining chinoiserie chic adorns this stylish room personally i love the idea of putting them somewhere unexpected such as a downstairs loo or even in the shower and while the likes of gwynnie can afford to splash out thousands on dish decoration this is a trend that s eminently achievable for those on all budgets with the market in antique porcelain at a historic low there is no need to spend hundreds of pounds on designer crockery because charity shops have a surfeit of plates and saucers the more flower strewn and gilt edged the better on the high street anthropologie regularly stocks all manner of dish decadence emma bridgewater has made a whole business out of jolly polka dotted crocks or check out eleanor bowmer s bone china cake plates at john lewis no need for wallpaper riot of colour above side table but if you did want something a bit more couture then some of my favourite looks include the work of canadian artist maggie hall who adds provocative statements to cute second hand finds meanwhile the serene blue and white of royal copenhagen services are classic and timeless and the quirky cabbage and artichoke platters from bordallo pinheiro are just plain fun however my absolute obsessionis for italian design atelier fornasetti and since 2005 one year after i started as editor in chief of elle decoration i have been fortunate enough to be gifted a limited edition annual calendar plate from the brand refined health and beauty shop mila london each one is uniquely themed for the year in question but always designed in the house s trademark black and white with a touch of gold they are artworks that just happen to be in porcelain the continuation of a tradition started more than 50 years ago by the brand s founder piero fornasetti the first plate i received i hung on the wall above my desk i had never owned anything quite like it before and i thought it was exquisite a year later a pair of plates was equally pleasing but as the years rolled on display became an issue not least because they needed to be regularly re hung if symmetry was to be a continuing factor sweet dreams homeware store with some tasty side dishes now i am trying to find the perfect place for them at home after all such plates are no good to anyone hidden away so if you have any pretty plates languishing unseen in a cupboard why not honour them on your wall instead or if room permits a dedicated open dresser you will get far more enjoyment out of them and you can always pull one off the wall if an extra guest pops by for dinner

washington the revelation that virginia ginni thomas the wife of supreme court justice clarence thomas attended president donald trump s rally ahead of the attack last year on the u s capitol has once again opened the couple up to scrutiny and raised questions about when members of the high court should recuse themselves ginni thomas acknowledged in an interview with the washington free beacon this week that she attended the rally outside the white house on jan 6 2021 where trump whipped up a crowd with false allegations of voter fraud before a group of his supporters descended on the capitol as lawmakers certified president joe biden s victory a longtime conservative activist ginni thomas said she left the rally before the president took the stage and had no part in the subsequent riot at the capitol but the acknowledgement was the latest example underscoring the unusual dynamic between justice thomas who has weighed in on several cases held over from the 2020 election and his wife who has questioned whether the election was fraudulent when the supreme court earlier this year allowed a house committee investigating the capitol attack to receive trump administration documents thomas was the only justice on the nine member court to publicly oppose the move in a blistering dissent in another case last year thomas disagreed with the court s decision not to take up a challenge to the expanded use of mail ballots in pennsylvania and raised questions about the reliability of mail in voting echoing some of the same arguments raised by trump ginni thomas has vigorously pushed back on the criticism and court observers note that justice thomas has been a leader of the conservative wing for decades long before trump emerged as a force in the republican party in the interview with the washington free beacon ginni thomas said the two keep their professional lives separate clarence doesn t discuss his work with me she said and i don t involve him in my work thomas like other justices has argued that politics do not play a role in the decision making on the nation s highest court the biggest misconception about the court is when the media portrays outcomes as being based on personal preferences on issues such as abortion rather than the law thomas told notre dame university last year i think that they think that we make policy thomas said they think you re for this or for that they think you become like a politician and i think that s a problem a biden commission studied the court and reviewed options for making recusals when a justice withdraws from a case because of a conflict of interest or lack of impartiality more transparent and lawmakers have proposed legislation to force justices to explain their recusals basic judicial ethics federal law and supreme court precedent require justices to recuse in a number of situations yet some of the justices refuse to heed those requirements said sen sheldon whitehouse d r i it contributes to the deep rot at the court the justices need to address it or their credibility will tumble even further clarence thomas speaks on sept 16 2021 at the university of notre dame the debate over supreme court recusals the latest acknowledgment of ginni thomas attendance at the rally drew attention to the debate over recusals a murky process that has drawn criticism from watchdog groups for years the scrutiny has been bipartisan directed at justices who were named by republican as well as democratic presidents the issue of recusals was thrust back into the fore recently in connection with biden s nominee to the supreme court u s circuit judge ketanji brown jackson jackson who appears to be on a glidepath for confirmation to the seat being vacated by retiring associate justice stephen breyer has faced questions over her role at harvard university and whether she should recuse from an upcoming blockbuster case involving affirmative action at the school jackson serves on harvard s board of overseers supreme court watchdogs have argued for years that additional clarity is needed for when justices should recuse and that push has received some bipartisan support in the rare instance when the justices actually talk about why they do or don t recuse in certain close calls they give completely different answers from one another said gabe roth executive director of fix the court a nonpartisan group that advocates for greater transparency in the federal judiciary president donald trump watches as supreme court justice clarence thomas administers the constitutional oath to amy coney barrett on the south lawn of the white house white house in washington monday oct 26 2020 after barrett was confirmed to be a supreme court justice by the senate earlier in the evening holding the bible is barrett s husband jesse barrett when do justices recuse themselves and how often do they do it federal law requires justices to disqualify themselves in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned the law goes on to cite specific circumstances for recusal including situations in which the justice has a personal bias or prejudice concerning a party or in which the justice or a spouse has a financial interest in the subject matter in controversy but there s a good deal of wiggle room in that language the decisions by justices about whether to recuse themselves from cases can t be challenged in court although the circumstances can be contentious in 1993 the court issued a statement of policy signed by seven of nine justices that said when relatives of justices are lawyers recusals are only required when the lawyer participated in an earlier stage of litigation or was a partner of a firm recusals were only required when the lawyer participates in a case at the high court from left justice clarence thomas chief justice john roberts and justice stephen breyer justices recused themselves from decisions about whether to hear cases 200 times per year on average from 2015 through 2020 according to a presidential commission biden appointed to study the court justices averaged about four recusals per year at the stage of deciding cases according to the commission roth s group fix the court tracks when a case arrives at the court that a justice participated in sometimes as a lower court judge or as solicitor general the government official who represents the federal government at the supreme court because recusal decisions can t be challenged justices rarely explain their reasoning for example breyer routinely recuses himself from cases involving his brother a u s district court judge in california chief justice john roberts recused himself from a 2020 case involving the smithsonian institute perhaps because he serves as a chancellor of the institution but that made a couple of cases where justices offered lengthy explanations more remarkable in 1981 then associate justice william rehnquist recused himself from a case lingering from the watergate era as he had in several other cases because of former attorney general john mitchell s personal participation in it rather than as a lawyer rehnquist had worked at the justice department with mitchell before being appointed to the court in 2004 the late associate justice antonin scalia issued a 21 page memo after participating in a case involving vice president dick cheney the sierra club a participant in the case filed a motion for scalia to remove himself because he went hunting with cheney but scalia refused explaining the case hadn t arrived at the court when the trip occurred it was not an intimate setting scalia wrote of about 13 hunters on the trip of course we said not a word about the present case republicans criticized the late associate justice ruth bader ginsburg s involvement in cases dealing with president donald trump s administration after she described him as a faker during the 2016 presidential campaign and said she couldn t imagine what the country would be with donald trump as our president roth s group has found three current justices who own individual stocks roberts breyer and associate justice samuel alito have in recent years failed to recuse themselves from deciding petitions to the court in which a company whose shares they own is a party it s just unforced errors that make people doubt the integrity of the judiciary roth said proposals for making recusals more transparent the debate over potential remedies to make recusals more transparent have focused on financial issues rather than the potential for political influence like in the thomas case in reviewing options for improving how recusals work the biden commission outlined proposals such as requiring justices to state their reasons for recusing establishing a procedure for another justice or the court to review recusal decisions and reforming recusal laws to make it easier to avoid financial conflicts justin driver a professor at yale law school who served on the commission noted that recusals occurred in 10 of the decisions about whether the high court will hear a case involving a forbes 100 company driver called that a reasonably large number driver suggested solutions could require justices divest investments when conflicts arrive or prohibit justices and their families from owning individual stocks i don t believe that this would succeed in transforming the judicial oath into anything like a vow of poverty driver said lower federal courts use a computer system to catch potential conflicts of interest but even that system has drawn scrutiny the wall street journal reported last year that more than 130 federal judges had overseen cases involving companies in which they or their families owned stock rep darrell issa r calif sponsored legislation in 2018 that would have mandated a code of conduct at the supreme court and required the justices at least explain their recusals that bill drew bipartisan support and some provisions have worked their way into subsequent proposals the sweeping voting rights legislation house democrats passed last year included a code of conduct for the supreme court but that bill failed to gain traction in the senate roberts asserted in a report in 2011 that congress has no constitutional authority to impose a code of ethics on the supreme court only on lower federal courts associate justice elena kagan told lawmakers during a hearing in 2019 that roberts was weighing a code of conduct for the high court but it s not clear what if any progress has been made in the three years since jackson nominated to fill the vacancy created by breyer s retirement is almost certain to face questions about whether she will recuse in the harvard case the supreme court announced in january that it would decide whether the use of race in the admissions process at harvard university and the university of north carolina violates civil rights law and the constitution reviving a controversial legal debate over affirmative action that has been years in the making that case will likely be heard in the fall after jackson would be seated former sen doug jones d ala who is guiding jackson through her senate confirmation said jackson would wait for her hearing to address the matter i don t really see a drawback for the recusal roth said of jackson s situation i think it would send an incredibly strong signal u s president donald trump greets supreme court associate justice stephen breyer and supreme court associate justice sonia sotomayor after addressing a joint session of the u s congress on february 28 2017 in the house chamber of the u s capitol in washington dc concerns about the supreme court appearing political legal observers and even supreme court justices fret that their decisions could lose authority if viewed as political rather than based on interpreting the law approval of the supreme court slipped to 40 in september a record low and down from 49 in july according to a gallup poll taken after the court declined to block a texas abortion law a c span poll released tuesday found 72 of voters support a code of ethics for the supreme court trust in the federal government has taken a powerful hit in recent years said robert green ceo of pierrepont consulting analytics which conducted the poll concerns about politicizing the court range across the political spectrum in a december case involving a mississippi abortion law associate justice sonia sotomayor questioned whether the public would view the court s actions as political will this institution survive the stench that this creates in the public perception that the constitution and its reading are just political acts sotomayor asked this article originally appeared on usa today

new york ap technology companies led stocks broadly higher on wall street tuesday as oil prices slid sharply for the second day and inflation worries ebbed the market rally came a day ahead of the federal reserve s highly anticipated interest rate policy update the s p 500 rose 2 1 ending a three day losing streak after a report showed inflation s rapid acceleration paused at the wholesale level last month the dow jones industrial average rose 1 8 and the tech heavy nasdaq composite rose 2 9 the wilder action was in oil and asian stock markets where tightened anti covid measures in china are raising worries about demand for energy and about disruptions to manufacturing and global trade oil prices tumbled more than 6 taking some pressure off the world s high inflation and a barrel of u s crude fell below 97 after starting the week above 109 stocks in hong kong sank more than 5 for a second straight day after the neighboring city of shenzhen was ordered into a shutdown renewed covid 19 worries come on top of a lengthy list of concerns for markets which have caused wild hour to hour swings in recent weeks the war in ukraine catapulted prices for oil wheat and other commodities the region produces that s raising the threat that already high inflation will persist and combine with a potentially stagnating economy some cautious optimism about the latest round of talks between russia and ukraine may have helped put traders in a buying mood ukrainian presidential aide ihor zhovkva said discussions via video held by representatives of the two nations tuesday were more constructive noting that russia has stopped airing its demands for ukraine to surrender if ever so slight at least there s still building optimism regarding ukraine combined with optimism regarding inflation oil in particular and optimism that the fed will not be more hawkish than is already built into the market said sam stovall chief investment strategist at cfra brand connections the s p 500 rose 89 34 points to 4 262 45 the dow gained 599 10 points to 33 544 34 and the nasdaq rose 367 40 points to 12 948 62 smaller company stocks also gained ground the russell 2000 index rose 27 25 points or 1 4 to 1 968 97 central banks around the world are preparing to pull the plug on the support they poured into the global economy after the pandemic struck the fed began a two day meeting on interest rates and the wide expectation is that it will announce on wednesday an increase of 0 25 percentage points to its key short term rate that would be the first increase since 2018 pulling it off its record low of nearly zero and likely the first in a series of rate hikes the fed is trying to slow the economy enough to tamp down the high inflation sweeping the country but not so much as to trigger a recession inflation is already at its highest level in generations and the most recent numbers don t even include the surge in oil prices that occurred after russia invaded ukraine data released tuesday showed inflation was still very high at the wholesale level last month but at least it wasn t accelerating producer prices were 10 higher in february from a year earlier the same rate as in january on a month to month basis inflation rose 0 8 in february from january versus forecasts for 0 9 that s a slowdown from january s 1 2 month over month inflation so the numbers are still very high and will keep the fed on track to raise rates on wednesday economists said but at least they weren t worse than expected a separate survey by the federal reserve bank of new york showed that manufacturing in the state declined for the first time since early in the pandemic a weakening economy could make the federal reserve less aggressive about raising rates treasury yields dipped immediately after the reports then edged higher by afternoon the yield on the 10 year treasury rose to 2 15 from 2 14 late monday the two year yield which moves more on expectations for fed policy changes fell to 1 86 from 1 87 also helping to pull down yields were the tumbling oil prices a barrel of u s crude dropped 6 4 to settle at 96 44 it had briefly topped 130 last week when worries about disruptions to supplies because of the war in ukraine were at their height brent crude the international standard fell 6 5 to settle at 99 91 per barrel a reprieve on fuel prices helped a wide variety of stocks and the majority of companies in the s p 500 were rising airlines led the way after several raised their forecasts for revenue this quarter american airlines delta air lines and united airlines all soared 8 or more tech and other high growth stocks also recovered some of their earlier losses as treasury yields fell higher interest rates can hurt such stocks more than others because they re seen as more expensive relative to their earnings in overseas stock markets european indexes were down modestly stocks in shanghai slumped 5 and hong kong s hang seng lost 5 7 despite the release of data showing strong increases in chinese retail sales industrial production and investment in january february it followed a decision by china s central bank not to ease interest rates to spur economic growth shares in hong kong have sunk to near six year lows after the neighboring city of shenzhen was ordered into a shutdown to combat china s worst covid 19 outbreak in two years fears continue to dog stock markets that lockdowns could spread which would severely impact china s growth jeffrey halley of oanda said in a commentary in other developments the london metal exchange said trading in nickel will resume wednesday just over a week after it was suspended when the price of the metal skyrocketed to over 100 000 per ton the announcement followed a notice

click to enlarge stock image by nicole koehler via wikimedia commons californians used 2 6 percent more water in january compared to before the drought emergency was declared a sign that urban residents are ignoring the state s pleas to take the drought seriously and cut back the increased water use in california s cities and towns came during the second driest january on record as the sierra nevada snowpack continues to dwindle and another dry summer looms the new data which details urban water use statewide shows that gov gavin newsom s repeated pleas for a 15 percent voluntary cutback in water use are failing to reach people in cities and towns yet newsom has stopped short of issuing a mandatory order with the voluntary call some areas were doing okay others not so well the message gets pretty garbled with a mandate it s a very clear message about the need said heather cooley research director with the pacific institute a global water think tank newsom spokesperson alex stack declined to answer whether newsom intends to set a mandatory conservation order a calmatters series investigates what s improved and what s worsened since the last drought and vividly portrays the impacts on california s places and people in january the state water resources control board adopted emergency regulations allowing water providers to bar certain wasteful water uses such as hosing down sidewalks with drinking water but water use nevertheless ticked up statewide in january compared to january 2020 the biggest increase was 19 percent in the desert region that includes the palm springs area and the imperial valley the south lahontan region spanning the sierra nevada mountain communities of southern california and death valley had the second highest increase at 9 percent the only regions that slightly reduced water consumption were the san francisco bay area which used 1 4 percent less and the southern san joaquin valley which used 0 2 percent less overall californians from july of last year through january conserved about 6 5 statewide compared to 2020 according to state data falling far short of newsom s requested 15 percent several years into the last devastating drought in 2015 gov jerry brown authorized state regulators to order reductions from water suppliers to conserve 25 percent more water across california now a year after newsom declared a drought emergency in hard hit northwest counties some experts say a state mandate is critical to keeping enough water in storage to survive a drought that could last a number of years newsha ajami a longtime water researcher said the mandate should have happened months ago when reservoirs were low and there was no precipitation in sight having a mandatory water restriction is in everyone s benefit said ajami who is the chief strategy and development officer for research at lawrence berkeley national laboratory the new state data only includes water use from urban water districts not rural irrigation districts that serve farms at a sacramento press conference last week california s natural resources secretary wade crowfoot thanked residents for their efforts but reiterated a plea for voluntary cutbacks i m also here on behalf of governor newsom to ask all of us to do more crowfoot said it s once again time for sacramentans residents of this region californians to step up and help us navigate through this drought with the voluntary call some areas were doing okay others not so well with a mandate it s a very clear message about the need heather cooley the pacific institute under the statewide mandate issued during the last drought water suppliers were required to conserve 25 percent statewide with regions assigned a certain percentage of water depending on their existing use or face escalating consequences that could result in fines californians responded they cut their water use by 23 9 percent between june 2015 and february 2016 compared to the same months in 2013 according to water board staff cities and towns still use less water daily than they did before the last drought began about 17 percent less per person this time however many water suppliers have relied on ramping up outreach and rebates rather than imposing new restrictions or fines ordering california s water suppliers to cut back further is likely to be a controversial move state sen melissa hurtado a democrat from hanford is skeptical that it would work if we re still not even over the covid 19 vaccine mandate and the testing mandate and now you re going to ask people to cut down on water consumption that you should take less showers and you can t get a new pool or whatever it may be she said yeah no that s going to make people really angry hurtado called for structural and technological changes like developing more drought resistant crops and fixing canals damaged by subsidence over behavioral ones those however take time water providers caution against reading too much into the low january conservation numbers it s harder for californians to squeeze out additional savings during the winter when many already cut back on watering their yards in december which had record setting storms californians used 15 6 percent less water compared to the previous year with the greatest savings in southern parts of the state it was the first time californians statewide crossed the 15 percent water conservation target that newsom urged residents to meet last july since july the greatest savings came from the hard hit north coast and the san francisco bay area the least from the inland mountains and deserts of central and southeast california water systems on the north coast were the canary in the coal mine said marielle rhodeiro research data specialist with the water board s conservation program they were the first to start running out of water i think there s a little bit more awareness up north probably because we re closer to the immediate problem some water suppliers crack down others coax for some local water agencies voluntary calls for conservation have come close to meeting their own goals though not the state s 15 target in the bay area the east bay municipal utility district upped its rates to fund improvements and asked residents to voluntarily cut water use by 10 percent the district ramped up rebates for replacing turf in yards and street medians and launched an advertising campaign on streaming audio platforms and social media recommending five minute songs for people to listen to while they showered it worked to a certain extent water use decreased by more than 10 percent from july through december compared to last year the district reported to the state but now the savings are slipping water use increased in february according to water conservation manager alice towey clearly it s becoming difficult to conserve this time of year when nature is normally watering our east bay gardens towey said february was california s second driest on record further south in san jose insufficient voluntary conservation prompted the local water company to institute surcharges for those who exceed mandatory limits based on 15 percent cuts to water used above a minimum threshold in 2019 in november the california public utilities commission approved the district s mandate which took effect in december clearly it s becoming difficult to conserve this time of year when nature is normally watering our east bay gardens alice towey east bay municipal utility district residents saved 20 percent more water in november compared to 2019 levels with little outdoor irrigation to cut back in winter months however the savings evaporated in december and january the area lost about half of its above ground water storage capacity due to earthquake retrofits for the region s largest reservoir for liann walborsky san jose water s director of corporate communications a statewide mandate would reinforce their efforts and drive home the message that conservation is critical i think it would just help validate all the work we ve been doing since june she said in the aerospace hub of palmdale in the mojave desert which received less than two inches of rain by last july local water officials faced the possibility of mandatory cuts last year before bolstering their supplies enough to last the summer the district called for 15 percent voluntary cutbacks to reverse a trend of increasing water use as residents weathered the coronavirus pandemic at home stepping up outreach and advertising for its rebate program to replace thirsty landscapes rebates increased by almost 70 percent from around 53 000 in 2020 to more than 89 000 in 2021 in the first half of 2021 water use was about 11 percent higher than 2020 but the latter half ended up about 5 percent lower still the water district s director of resources and analytics peter thompson is torn about whether it s time for a statewide mandate the momentum of having the state come out with a mandate makes our jobs easier thompson said but california is huge and it s diverse in terms of the different water agencies and their available water supplies so it makes a lot more sense to make that an individual choice for each agency for some water systems even mandatory calls for conservation haven t been enough to weather water shortages by may 2021 in the small coastal hamlet of mendocino residents and businesses were required to use 40 percent less water than their allocations wells still went dry water trucked from other districts climbed in cost when it was available and restaurants in a town reliant on tourism were forced to weigh whether staying open was worth the expense of washing the dishes ryan rhoades supervisor for the mendocino city community services district said he filled buckets of creek water to keep relatives toilets flushing he said most residents managed to stay below the mandatory target but estimates that about 5 percent didn t the county and state stepped in to help subsidizing trucks to haul water 60 miles from ukiah to a reservoir in nearby fort bragg to bolster the coastal towns supplies and though the conservation mandate was lifted after early winter rains replaced by a call to voluntarily reduce use by 15 percenet of each well owner s allotment the city is bracing for another dry summer and hoping to prevent more shortages ahead rhoades said he s awaiting word from the state on possible funding to tie into the local school district s water supply drill more wells and increase storage the wait he said is frustrating and challenging because people are aware that we have a problem and we need help the state budget last year included 5 2 billion for drought response and water resiliency since the drought began the department of water resources has awarded more than 195 million to projects aimed at addressing shortages and bolstering emergency and longer term supplies including those supporting disadvantaged communities and tribes with well repairs securing hauled water and other efforts the state water resources control board tallies 9 75 billion in loans and grants for drinking water wastewater groundwater cleanup and stormwater capture since 2014 board chair joaquin esquivel said at a press conference last week legislation enacted after the last drought called for urban water providers to develop water budgets based on a number of factors including indoor and outdoor water efficiency standards calculating water budgets is expected to take through the end of 2023 but could pave the way for more sophisticated targeted mandates going forward said the pacific institute s cooley but urban water use is just a small part of california s water supply problem of all the water californians use about 20 percent flows through urban taps hoses and sprinklers almost all of the rest is for agriculture which pumps water from wells and also gets supplies from rivers as well as state and federal aqueducts during the last drought in 2015 brown was criticized for not imposing conservation orders on agriculture we should be doing more conservation in general and particularly in drought years said jay lund a university of california davis professor of civil and environmental engineering but the quantities of water that we will save from this conservation will not be enough to take a tremendous amount of pressure off of farmers or off the environment calmatters environment coverage is supported by the 11th hour project

there are so many events that took place on the ecm turning point it is hard to cover them all aside from the fact that this target will most likely also see the first interest rate rise by the fed signally that this trend has changed the sec came out in full force warning about count party risks and that brokers need to collect full margins as they see a host of companies that were in russia taking major losses just as blackrock on its emerging market investment portfolio do not forget that blackrock is a money manager and the loss in one fund cannot be covered by taking money from another separate fund hence the bigger they are the harder they do fall and we must be mindful of a crisis that can easily appear based upon a run on one entity we have bond markets crashing and the stocks have continued to decline in many areas because of the profound damage the biden administration has done globally that nobody in washington seems to even comprehend we are facing shortages in everything from aluminum cans to paper cups which now even starbucks is discontinuing then the london metals exchange lme for the first time in history imposed a fixed price range for trading nickel after extreme volatility in prices triggered a rare market shut down last week the lme halted nickel trading and canceled trades after prices doubled on march 8 to more than 100 000 per tonne in a matter of hours naturally they have blamed short covering by one of the world s top producers nevertheless we are looking at a permanent disruption to world supplies and august looks to be exceptionally challenging ahead the lme also imposed 15 limits on other base metals including aluminum copper lead tin and zinc this is the first time in its 145 year history the lme has ever placed limits on outright contracts this conflict in ukraine has driven the prices of commodities higher from food to industrial metals with many reaching record highs supply from russia has declined russia is a key world producer of aluminum copper and nickel the price swings in nickel last week saw the price jump more than 18 000 on monday and then over 50 000 a day later which has sent the lme into a crisis adopting the suspension of trading what is unfolding is that the arrogance of the neocons and their personal hatred of russia and china has run its course they are now setting in motion the decline and fall of the west a crisis is unfolding this crisis of commodities that our computer has been forecasting for this wave 2020 2024 is actually helping to undermine the world economy and shifting even the use of the dollar internationally saudi arabia has agreed to accept the chinese yuan in return for oil that is the start of this shift and this too took place on this turning point the seizure of private russian assets was such a profound violation of international law that international capital realizes that the swift system is now political and no longer trustworthy the very foundation of the g7 has been undermined by the seizure of russia s fx reserves

perhaps its a reflection of the state of the world or our perception of it but many of the most popular genre films of the past decade or more have been of the relentlessly grim and gritty variety particularly when it comes to superheroes and especially batman whose films have only grown more dour across the decades glumness is even seen as a marker of quality fairly or otherwise happy endings are great and all but we re obsessed with genre movies that aren t just dark but wildly operatically grim at their best those movies show us a world that might not quite align with our day to day experience but perhaps aren t far off from the vision of life as we might see it in our bleakest imaginings at the darkest hours of the night on the other hand some seem to reflect a teenager s heightened sense of drama perhaps we simply find it highly relatable that even a character like batman with a life far more exciting than our own humdrum existences still has plenty of reasons to be sad just like us all of the following movies also feature people with plenty of reasons to crawl back into bed and yet they still manage to lead action packed lives good for them the crow 1994 a comic book movie from an era when they were much rarer the crow is a heavy on dark brooding emo style doing tim burton one better while it s best not to reduce the on set accidental death of brandon lee during filming to purely cinematic legend there s no question that the star s tragic end gave the crow an outsized resonance here was a movie with a well calculated appeal to goth teens about a dead musician returning from the dead for revenge whose star died on the cusp of fame heavy dark city 1998 woefully under appreciated despite contemporary critical adoration from the likes of gene siskel and roger ebert director alex proyas followed up his emo classic the crow with this even darker it s right there in the title sci fi neo noir that explores what goes on when a sunless rain soaked city literally goes to sleep like an old style movie detective rufus sewell tries to pull back the curtain on reality and ends up having cause to regret learning the truth donnie darko 2001 an instant cult classic and the movie that made a star of jake gyllenhaal even if it didn t make a ton of money initially donnie darko follows a deeply troubled teenager who survives a freak accident only to find himself accosted and manipulated by a truly disturbing creature in a rabbit costume warning him of a breach in reality discussions off time ravel and tangent universes come into play but ultimately it s all sci fi gloss on an exploration of teenage mental illness interview with the vampire 1994 though many author anne rice included had qualms about the casting of tom cruise he showed impressive range as the as sultry sassy vampire lestat alongside brad pitt s louis rice literally wrote the book s on the modern conflicted emo vampire and this is the sole film adaptation of one of her works to successfully capture that vibe kiss me deadly 1955 straightforward noir is a bit out of bounds here even if the era and style produced some of the most deliciously dark films in the history of the medium kiss me deadly though aside from being a great movie in its own right is decidedly weirder than most of its kind hardboiled detective mike hammer gets involved in a nearly inscrutable mystery involving a hitchhiker and a locked suitcase the contents of that suitcase while never fully explained wind up being the stuff of science fiction in the movie s explosive final act quentin tarantino took inspiration from the idea for the mysterious briefcase in pulp fiction hellraiser 1987 hellraiser as a property has always been a bit more successful in theory than in execution clive barker s dark queer and operatic works of otherworldly body horror has never translated all that well to film even when as in this case he s directing the movie himself still there are pleasures to be found in this debut instalment as well as pain with a twisted skin flaying love triangle at its centre and a memorable villain or is he just trying to show you a good time in doug bradley s pinhead it s the stuff of many a dark bdsm fantasy the lighthouse 2019 what s not to love about a lighthouse mystery fiction as well as history are replete with tales of dark doings and strange disappearances involving lonely men on remote islands but the lighthouse mixes lovecraftian horror and joyless masturbating into the mix making a bit of text out of what s usually left as subtext the movie is dark both literally and figuratively with a performance from robert pattinson that made it clear he was more than a mopey sparkly vampire jacob s ladder 1990 this was director adrian lyne s followup to his hit erotic thriller fatal attraction while it didn t have nearly the pop culture impact it s more impressive in its journey into the dark recesses of the mind tim robbins plays a vietnam vet experiencing horrific visions that might be hallucinations or visions of another life the twist ending while not entirely unexpected is a gut punch the mist 2007 director frank darabont s adaptation of one of stephen king s bleakest stories understands that it s not what s outside the walls that s most to be feared but whatever s locked up inside with you in the mist fearful friends and neighbours are at least as dangerous as the lovecraftian nightmares in the fog those creatures are also scary naturally a couple of dodgy digital effects aside and the dual antagonists lend the movie its tension and endings don t come much darker than the one here which does the book one better or worse night of the living dead 1968 like an old school noir with action and horror trappings romero s grim masterpiece makes clear from very early on that there s no hope of a happy ending for any of the characters carnival of souls 1962 predating romero s zombie classic by several years and pioneering to an extent the same highly creepy low budget style carnival of souls leans into existential dread like few films before or since trapping viewers in an unforgiving view of the afterlife the road 2009 though his novels aren t exclusively bleak cormac mccarthy is hardly a writer associated with anything resembling whimsy that being the case and though hollywood is certainly capable of going in wildly unexpected directions with source material it was unlikely that an adaptation of the road would ever be light entertainment and it sure isn t this is one of the bleakest major releases in american box office history a post apocalyptic fable that is ultimately about a modern america where happy endings aren t just hard to come by but virtually impossible to conceive of annihilation 2018 we re so used to plot driven science fiction stories in which the emotional beats are secondary here there s very little plot at all which is unsettling by itself a group of explorers is asked to enter the shimmer an expanding area in which mutations occur at wildly accelerated rates it s hard to say what happens from there with any specificity since so much of what goes on is up to interpretation needless to say it doesn t go entirely well for the explorers though destruction in this case might be a prelude to creation the skin i live in 2011 pedro almodóvar s foray into science fiction horror is as you might expect neither a straightforward sci fi experience nor an outright thriller but the grim vibes are very real the unexpected comedic moments along with the sudden shifts in tone and the fractured timeline only make the story of a plastic surgeon and the woman he keeps captive more unsettling flatliners 1990 it s not nearly as deep as it thinks it is but joel schumacher s gen x kinda classic about grad students exploring the realm of near death experiences has spooky style to spare and a perfect cast of then young stars led by kiefer sutherland and julia roberts it s probably not going to expand your mind on the topic of the afterlife but accompanied by an edible or two you just might feel like it has darkman 1990 the early 90s were positively the wild west for superhero movies though this one s an original property studios were keen to duplicate the success of batman but hadn t figured out the formula it was glorious while movies like dick tracy the crow the mask and the rocketeer weren t all classics they were at least more varied and less carefully managed than our current output case in point sam raimi s darkman is about a scientist liam neeson who s left for dead by a mobster only to be revived using a formula that leaves him wildly mentally unstable and obsessed with vengeance raimi characteristically lightens things with a bit of dark humour making darkman a fair bit more entertaining and weirder than so much of the stock grim and gritty superhero stuff we see today

as allocators continue to embrace environmental social and governance investing asset managers are turning their focus to the fight against modern slavery since the u k launched the landmark modern slavery act in 2015 global asset managers like abrdn bny mellon and lazard have pledged to remove modern slavery a term that includes human trafficking forced labor debt bondage and forced and early marriage from their operations and supply chains alliancebernstein for example has developed its own proprietary model to identify its portfolio companies exposures to modern slavery risks these risks are not trivial as of 2017 40 3 million people worldwide were victims of modern slavery which generates 150 billion in profits annually in the united states alone according to the international labor organization a subsidiary of the united nations but it s not easy for investors to reliably get information about companies supply chain conditions because shareholders have limited capacity to conduct on site research for individual companies they largely rely on the management to report key performance indicators and draft action plans this requires a certain degree of honesty and dedication from the management side supply chain monitoring is incredibly difficult said shivaram rajgopal a columbia business school professor with a research focus on shareholder value you might get into a world where you are relying on certificates based on certificates based on certificates without anybody actually doing the primary work that doesn t mean it s a lost cause michelle dunstan chief responsibility officer at alliancebernstein told institutional investor that most companies are relatively receptive and willing to act on ab s constructive feedback the conversation between ab and its portfolio companies would usually evolve into a long term exchange of ideas about supply chain management she said besides moral concerns investors are paying attention to modern slavery issues because they present both an emerging opportunity and risk dunstan said companies with unethical labor practices are subject to more regulatory concerns and reputational risks both of which could have an adverse impact on stock price and talent acquisition in alliancebernstein s modern slavery risk assessment model companies are first evaluated based on their geographical locations and products those relying on imports from countries with historical records of labor abuse for example are exposed to higher modern slavery risks in supply chains certain sectors such as raw materials and basic services also raise more concerns once ab spots red flags in the portfolio companies it has a discussion with management about the governance framework risk identification mechanism action plans and room for future improvement we are looking for companies that acknowledge that this is a material risk and are trying to actively do things to improve dunstan said this is not an exercise to name and shame or call things out another challenge in addressing modern slavery is that it does not necessarily bring immediate financial benefits to companies according to patricia jurewicz founder of the non profit organization responsible sourcing network unlike carbon footprint which is easy to quantify and can be related to direct tax benefits in certain countries reducing modern slavery is harder to translate into financial improvements if people are working under forced labor conditions for little or no pay and you are paying them more to resolve the issue that does not save you money jurewicz said while improved labor conditions might boost production and increase the employee retention rate from a longer term perspective companies that are under immediate performance pressure might be reluctant to take action she said rajgopal added that the lack of reliable audits can be an even bigger problem in emerging markets where there are fewer data disclosure requirements and anti fraud mechanisms according to msci 74 percent of companies in the msci world index which captures the large and mid cap representation in 23 developed countries are subject to modern slavery regulations in contrast only 15 percent of companies in the msci emerging markets index would be punished for violating similar codes of conduct many developed market consumer companies are dominant in their supply chains making them well placed to monitor adverse impacts and effect change msci said in a statement to ii china for example is responsible for more than a quarter of the global manufacturing output according to data from the united nations statistics division but given local restrictions it is almost impossible to independently verify claims about exploitive labor practices in the country jurewicz said companies are reluctant to speak out about the labor conditions in china given the pressure to sell into the chinese market as well as the pressure of producing so many of their goods modern slavery activists like the responsible sourcing network have had more success in other parts of the world in the late 2000s reports came out from bbc about the usage of child labor in uzbekistan s cotton industry rsn along with uzbek activists and international advocates started a campaign against the use of uzbekistan cotton among investors suppliers and retailers the nonprofit got over 300 retailers to pledge not to source cotton from uzbekistan until the systematic forced labor issue is properly addressed likewise alliancebernstein has worked with nestlé and panasonic to address forced labor in malaysia and madagascar still shareholder activism alone is not enough to reduce the negative societal impact of any corporate actions or what the economists call externalities according to rajgopal be it carbon emission or modern slavery any esg mandate needs to be translated into regulations to make an actual impact he said in the united states shareholders suing fund managers over externalities need to show proof of financial loss to win the case shareholders very rarely litigate or go after american companies for externality related issues raigopal said mostly because it s hard for them to prove that investment losses are directly associated with mishandling of such externalities in regions where modern slavery is a pronounced concern legislation varies by country or state in australia and the u k modern slavery has become part of the legal vocabulary in the united states the focus has been on human trafficking in terms of disclosure requirements california is the only state to have passed legislation related to modern slavery early this year new york proposed the fashion sustainability and social accountability act which goes much further than california according to msci the bill still needs to be passed into law but if successful it would make new york a global leader in terms of supply chain legislation msci said rajgopal said fundamental changes in supply chains will ultimately come down to political action how effective is the financial industry going to be a substitute he asked it s an open question

nine months ago it was revealed that the private tax files of thousands of americans covering a period of 15 years had been stolen and given to a progressive news organization the irs and the biden administration immediately vowed to investigate and prosecute yet here we are nine months later with no answers from the government while democrats push for even more power for the irs irs chief charles rettig is testifying thursday before the ways and means oversight subcommittee committee members must hold rettig accountable and get detailed answers after nine months of stonewalling as the biden treasury department claims it doesn t even know if the irs was the source of the stolen files progressive group pro publica described the cache as a vast amount of information it s not just tax returns it s also things like records of stock trades information that is sent to the irs about financial activities to pretend the source of these files is not the irs is to pretend the thief was able to steal comprehensive tax information of thousands of the highest earning americans year after year for 15 years from dozens or hundreds of different tax accountants doesn t pass the laugh test during the irs lois lerner era the agency stonewalled for years and repeatedly failed to notify congress of key developments in its investigation key evidence was allowed to be deleted and destroyed many hard drives of irs employees mysteriously crashed preservation orders were not followed this will happen again if rettig and yellen do not provide detailed answers here is a video compilation of yellen rettig testimony on the stolen taxpayer files in each instance they promise to investigate in each instance they claim not to know anything about who did or did not steal the data meanwhile the biden administration and congressional democrats push nonstop for more irs power and demand more personal information from americans the agency has proven itself unwilling or unable to safeguard taxpayer information below is a timeline of testimony from irs chief rettig and treasury secretary yellen as well as letters from congressional republicans to the irs the attorney general and the treasury inspector general seeking answers and accountability june 8 2021 when the existence of the theft was announced on june 8 irs commissioner charles rettig said under oath that an investigation was already underway i can confirm that there is an investigation with respect to the allegations that the source of the information in that article came from the internal revenue service upon reviewing the article the appropriate contacts were made as you would expect and the investigators will investigate 1 08 12 sen chuck grassley r iowa followed up and asked 1 09 42 when you said that you are investigating this propublica release of secret irs files i assume that if your investigation finds a violation of the law you are going to see that people are prosecuted is that right rettig replied absolutely june 9 2021 sen mike crapo and congressman kevin brady send a letter to irs commissioner charles rettig seeking answers june 11 2021 congressman mike kelly letter to irs

most widespread breaches in the agency s history in order to advance a political agenda this apparent leak a targeted leak a targeted attack i should say on a select few americans undermines the confidence in the agency and goes to the heart of public trust between taxpayers and the irs s ability to safeguard private information can you tell me how the treasury and the irs hold individuals accountable who broke federal law by sharing confidential tax information tax returns and will you commit to updating me on what steps the administration has taken to ensure this doesn t happen again and can you maybe tell us what steps you have taken so far yellen yes this was a very serious situation that i and the treasury department take very seriously the protection of government data we ve referred this matter to the treasury inspector general and to the department of justice the irs commissioner is looking into the matter as is the treasury s inspector general for tax administration but we are only one week out on this and i really want to emphasize we do not know what happened we don t have any facts at this point i promise to keep you updated on what we find but it is absolutely top priority to safeguard taxpayer data when we see the results of the investigations that are done if there are actions that we need to take to shore up the protection of this information you have my absolute word that we will do so and we will keep you and congress informed on what we are doing and what we are finding on this june 16 2021 seven republican senators send letter to fbi

june 23 2021 janet yellen testimony all is being done to get to the bottom of this yellen let me just say one final word about the irs many of you have expressed concern about the recent propublica report i am deeply troubled by it as well and it s important to stress that an unauthorized disclosure of taxpayer information is a crime and that it has been referred to the fbi federal prosecutors and treasury department oversight authorities we don t yet know what occurred but all is being done to get to the bottom of this criminal activity and we will be sure to update you as we learn more

information represented an illegal revelation of taxpayer information it s an illegal act and it is being investigated thoroughly by independent entities law enforcement and the inspector generals of treasury and the irs and there really can t be tolerance for that just to be clear we do not know the propublica information came from the irs that hasn t been established september 30 2021 janet yellen testimony looking into that rep david kustoff r tenn how did propublica publish and obtain the information from the irs about taxpayer information yellen independent agencies and law enforcement are currently looking into that and attempting to figure out how that occurred that is clearly a crime and an utterly unacceptable thing and it will be prosecuted when it s understood october 4 2021 sens mike crapo and chuck grassley send letter to treasury inspector general for tax administration russell george november 30 2021 janet yellen testimony i believe those investigations are moving forward sen bill hagerty r tenn secretary yellen i ll turn to another topic that we ve discussed before back in september we talked about the leak of confidential taxpayer information to propublica that was done in early 2021 for political purposes you testified then that it s an illegal act that it s being investigated thoroughly and there can t be any tolerance for that you and i agreed on that so given that testimony i want to ask you have the leakers been identified yellen there are independent agencies both within treasury the inspector general also the fbi and doj that are conducting investigations we re not privy nothing has been reported out yet from those investigations that i m aware of but i believe those investigations are moving forward hagerty well i take that as no update but after the lois lerner scandal after the scandal that occurred here in 2021 under this administration s watch i appreciate the fact that there s an investigation underway but i would say this until we have the results of that investigation until we have true accountability i cannot imagine how the biden administration is encouraging what is in effect a ten times increase in the audit capacity of the irs when there s no accountability there this is the d c swamp at its best yellen we don t know what the source of the leak of that information was and i would say it s premature to indicate that it came from the irs december 1 2021 republican members of senate finance committee send letter to irs commissioner rettig video compilation of rettig and yellen testimony

down the high inflation sweeping the country but not so much as to trigger a recession inflation is already at its highest level in generations and the most recent numbers don t even include the surge

shooters check this gun deals daniel defense m4v7s rifles up to 20 off with free shipping u s a prior to the introduction of stabilizing braces ar 15 pistols like the ddm4 v7 were of questionable usefulness they sacrificed ballistic efficacy and shoot ability in exchange for a more compact handy package but once these braces took off the market reacted by exploding with various ar pistols at this point there are nearly as many pistol variants of ar 15s as there are carbines on the market so while this made daniel defense s introduction of ar pistols a logical one it also presented a unique challenge for the company how to carve out a niche for a high end ar pistol in a market saturated by inexpensive blue collar priced options after all why would the average consumer buy something like the ddm v7 when they could buy a no name alternative for a quarter of the price well let s take a closer look and find out to start things off the daniel defense ddm4 is a direct impingement semi automatic pistol chambered in either 5 56mm or 300blk regardless of caliber all ddm4 pistols and rifles feed from standard ar 15 magazines and include one 32 round daniel defense magazine in the box in a nutshell the ddm4 v7 is your standard ar 15 pistol lightweight soft shooting with solid ergonomics so what makes this gun worth the difference in price features and performance ddm4 features the gun s unique color is one of the first things shooters notice about the ddm4 v7 the majority of ars follow henry ford s old mantra of being available in any color so long as it s black with fde coming in a close second and while the ddm4 v7 is available in these colors the one standout option is milspec while that might seem like some sort of marketing speak this milspec finish is an extremely hard dark brown almost like patriot brown cerakote that in my testing is more even than most cerakoted firearms and definitely more durable how exactly is that beyond mil spec it s physically harder and more durable than what is required from the military basically it s just a very tough finish whose color seems to blend in well in virtually any environment except white out conditions other instantly noticeable features of the daniel defense carbine include the extremely comfortable pistol grip and buttstock both are unique to the daniel defense series of firearms but are 100 compatible with any mil spec ar 15 what makes them so comfy is the combination of hard durable plastic and soft rubber like santoprene panels providing a nearly perfect balance of grippyness with strength and in my highly unscientific testing every shooter who handled the rifle went to buy a set of the furniture for their own guns within a few weeks that said the gun reviewed is a pistol so while it has the excellent daniel defense pistol grip it lacks a stock to make the gun nfa compliant in its place the ddm4 v7 pistol features a combination law tactical folding mechanism and sb tactical gen one brace while i would have personally preferred an sba3 pistol brace because it makes the gun fit me better this combination is still pretty solid provided the shooter isn t especially tall beneath this daniel defense utilizes its proprietary pistol grip that includes the awesome santoprene panels and features an integral trigger guard other features include one of my favorite ar 15 charging handles on the market today the grip n rip ambidextrous charging handle as the name implies the grip n rip handle is made for fast action and aggressive use for example clearing a malfunction in a competition or god forbid a gunfight it gives the shooter much greater purchase on the charging handle without being so oversized that it snags on gear or bangs into the shooter while they re carrying it on a sling ddm4 v7 performance ok so the ddm4 v7 pistol has some solid features but what about performance how did the little handgun perform in terms of reliability i encountered no malfunctions across 600 rounds of ammo fired without any sort of lubrication though this is to be expected from a high end brand like daniel defense ammo used in the test ranged from 55gr monarch re branded tula to sig s excellent 77gr match grade ammo the gun was run both as it ships from the factory and with the addition of a silencerco saker asr 762 suppressor provided by silencershop com and in both instances the gun just ran flawlessly accuracy too was excellent from the ddm4 i fired the ddm4 v7 pistol off of a lyman bag jack at an nra scaled rifle target 25 times in 5 shot strings allowing the barrel to cool two minutes between groups while the monarch ammo grouped somewhat poorly at three inches which makes sense as the chronograph showed up to a 5 swing in velocity between shots with premium sig ammo and mil spec federal hornady 55gr fmj the ddm4 v7 achieved groups as small as 1 73 inches given the relatively short barrel length and lack of a stock to properly stabilize the gun this is very good daniel defense ddm4v7 verdict bottom line is the daniel defense ddm4v7 pistol worth its 2 229 msrp for the sort of shooter who visits the range twice a year and fires 100 rounds through their gun objectively no sure if they decide to splurge on the purchase they won t be disappointed still the extra cost over a more affordable option would likely be better spent on training courses and practice ammunition but for shooters who need a gun that they can 100 rely on for home defense competition or survival use daniel defense s series of firearms will

u s a ammoland com constitutional carry in florida failed for the third year in a row not because florida gun owners don t support it but because it seems to have been ignored by the florida legislature even after governor desantis made the public announcement that he would sign a bill for constitutional carry if it made it to his desk and anthony sabatini presented the bill yet again the florida legislature seems to have an issue getting it to the floor for votes this particular group of legislators includes senate president wilton simpson r house speaker chris sprowls r and house chairman chuck brannan r wilton simpson is the author of the marjory stoneman douglas high school public safety act sb 7026 otherwise known as the parkland gun control bill this law now allows law enforcement to confiscate firearms without due process when used with the baker act it ended the ability for anyone to purchase a gun under the age of 21 it implemented a bump stock ban so vague that it included binary triggers and added a statewide 3 day waiting period for all long gun purchases for the first time in florida chris sprowls voted in favor of the parkland gun control bill in 2018 you would think after trying to get constitutional carry for florida residents two years in a row sabatini s bill would surely be a slam dunk the third time around especially considering the 22 other states that are now on board with constitutional carry and the fact that the legislature is comprised of republicans nope something went wrong again sabatini s constitutional carry bill was introduced and assigned to the house criminal justice and public safety sub committee chaired by representative chuck brannan but went exactly nowhere according to florida state director of gun owners of america luis valdes several floridians requested this bill be brought up in committee by brannan only to be ignored and petitions deposited in the trash valdes told ammoland florida s republican legislative leadership is instead following the national party platform of the democrats it may seem that this republican legislature is stalling the constitutional carry bill why would we think that representative michelle salzman said so on video during the 2022 legislative session salzman claimed that constitutional carry was extremely important to her but went on to say it s not the right time you have the leadership in place that were the ones that voted in the marjory stoneman douglas bill period like was it a bad bill yeah i mean i think it was they voted for it so they stand behind it and that s what they re doing they re standing behind their bill so they re not going to hear a bill that omits the bill that they stood behind it has nothing to do with what s good or bad it has to do with making a decision as a leader and following through with it and so i m not going to do anything to poke that bear that s a professional courtesy and many other things in what seems to be a vote of support for president wilton simpson usf executive director nra past president marion p hammer said in an email to nra members groups that have been attacking president wilton simpson should have been standing in line to thank him for not hearing the following 14 gun control bills that actually were filed in the senate hammer also said that the reason sabatini s bill wasn t heard in any committee was because he never requested to have the bill heard and never secured a senate companion bill she also wrote in an email to nra members that rep chuck brannan has a solid a rating with nra and is a true friend to gun owners and the second amendment is it possible that sabatini didn t follow the proper protocol maybe is it likely that the same people who voted for a gun control bill are quietly trying to resist constitutional carry possibly could this be a case of politicians playing ball to suit their own interests you decide then get out and vote for the representatives who actually take action in support of your right to keep and bear the 2nd amendment is not a privilege it s your right about dan wos author good gun bad guy dan wos is available for press commentary for more information contact pr here dan wos is a nationally recognized 2nd amendment advocate and author of the good gun bad guy series he speaks at events is a contributing writer for many publications and can be found on radio stations across the country dan has been a guest on the sean hannity show nratv and several others speaking on behalf of gun rights dan exposes the strategies of the anti gun crowd and explains their mission to disarm law abiding american gun owners

located in the palestinian west bank jericho s claim to fame lies in being the oldest continually inhabited city in the world surrounded by springs the city has attracted humans for thousands of years and archaeologists have unearthed over 20 different settlement layers that go back as far as 11 000 years the seven trumpets of jericho by james tissot public domain the ancient city of jericho in the bible then the lord said to joshua see i have delivered jericho into your hands along with its king and its fighting men march around the city once with all the armed men do this for six days have seven priests carry trumpets of rams horns in front of the ark on the seventh day march around the city seven times with the priests blowing the trumpets when you hear them sound a long blast on the trumpets have the whole army give a loud shout then the wall of the city will collapse and the army will go up everyone straight in joshua 6 2 5 the ancient city of jericho is well known from the biblical story where god commands joshua to destroy the city because of its inhabitants disobedience to god as the above abstract mentions but the story of the city goes back to about 8 000 bc when it was occupied during the natufian period making the structures in it the oldest man made structures on earth the battle of jericho is an amazing tale with the description of the ark of the covenant and the trumpets used as a weapon under the command of joshua and the orders of god himself it wasn t just a simple fight these weapons were so powerful that they were capable of completely destroying an entire city in seven days with the exception of a prostitute who was thought to have betrayed her fellow citizens and her family every single living being died after that the city was cursed by joshua to never be built again nevertheless the city was rebuilt many times after that event jericho was a city heavily fortified and stocked with enough food and water to last for months it would have taken many months even years to destroy such a city and yet joshua did it according to the bible in seven days ancient astronaut theorists have argued that some kind of superior weaponry provided by external perhaps even alien interference was used in the destruction of jericho this is a mystery still unresolved birdseye view of the unearthed foundations at tell es sultan in jericho and the surrounding area in 2008 public domain excavations at tell es sultan in jericho jericho attracted the attention of archaeologists since it was first identified and excavated in 1868 by charles warren as part of the palestine exploration fund his work centered on tell es sultan just a couple of kilometers north of jericho center warren believed this to be the site of ancient jericho due to the existence of an important spring this spring known as elisha s spring is famed as being the location where elisha was healed according to the bible excavations have unearthed walls which have been subject of much discussion and research due to their importance for evaluating the historicity of the biblical narrative of the ancient israelite invasion of canaan the biblical narrative describes the city as having nearly impregnable walls which were intimidating to anyone who tried to take the city remains of a tower at tell es sultan in ancient jericho salamandra123 cc by sa 3 0 some claim that the archaeological evidence has verified the biblical story is accurate with excavations showing that jericho was once fortified and that it was subsequently attacked and burned sometime in the middle or late bronze age between 1550 bc and 1400 bc in the same way these archaeological findings at jericho do not necessarily prove that the biblical narrative happened exactly as described but they do lend credence to the story described on the pages of the bible argued caleb strom in ancient origins although sometimes archaeology casts doubt on traditional stories about the past other times it confirms them in surprising ways excavations by kathleen kenyon from the 1950s discovered 17 early bronze age walls some of which showed signs of destruction by earthquakes and others showing signs of destruction by nomadic invaders in fact willem boshoff explains that her work concluded that jericho s walls did not correspond to biblical joshua s assumed time slot predating the assumed date by centuries and finding that much of the wall rubble actually dated to the early bronze age during her excavations kenyon also discovered an 8 5 meter 28 ft stone tower dating back to 8 000 bc making it one of the earliest stone constructions ever built the mount of temptation in jericho aleksandar todorovic adobe stock visiting jericho this historic city with more than 10 000 years of history clearly deserves a visit if you re in the west bank in palestine due to check points it s easier to get there from ramallah the main attraction is of course the jericho tell or tell al sultan which can be found 2 5 kilometers from jericho s main square this ancient settlement mound is 21 meters 69 ft high and while it may be hard to decipher for the untrained eye this is a fundamental location for understanding the history of human civilization as the world s oldest continually inhabited city another important location is the mount of temptation a stunning pilgrimage site where jesus is said to have fasted after being baptized by john the baptist if you don t feel like walking up the steep path there is a cable car to take you there top image tell al sultan in jericho is an

matthew v crawford chairman and chief executive officer stated our business continued to show solid revenue momentum in all segments through the end of 2021 despite significant volatility in the marketplace unfortunately supply chain inflation and labor challenges took a toll on our ability to perform as we expected especially within our assembly components segment many operational and expense reduction initiatives completed in 2021 were offset by these costs but we expect to see meaningful impact to our results in the first half of 2022 and anticipate near record revenue and solid profits during 2022 as a whole in the fourth quarter of 2021 net sales were 369 9 million compared to 360 4 million in the 2020 period an increase of 3 net loss attributable to parkohio common shareholders in the fourth quarter of 2021 was 17 8 million or 1 48 per diluted share compared to net income attributable to parkohio common shareholders in the fourth quarter of 2020 of 5 6 million or 0 46 per diluted share excluding special items adjusted eps loss was 1 08 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to income of 0 53 per diluted share in the 2020 period full year 2021 net sales were 1 4 billion compared to 1 3 billion in 2020 an increase of 11 net loss attributable to parkohio common shareholders in 2021 was 24 8 million or 2 07 per diluted share compared to a loss of 4 5 million or 0 37 per diluted share in 2020 excluding special items adjusted eps was a loss of 1 20 per diluted share in 2021 compared to adjusted eps income of 0 01 per diluted share in 2020 our adjusted eps losses in the fourth quarter and full year 2021 of 1 08 and 1 20 respectively were due primarily to operating losses in the general aluminum business of our assembly components segment driven by production volatility caused by the ongoing semiconductor micro chip shortage raw material price inflation higher labor costs and other increased manufacturing costs for the full year 2021 the operating losses at general aluminum were approximately 28 million including a goodwill write off of 4 6 million and one time restructuring start up and other costs of 4 0 million excluding the charges for goodwill and the other special items the negative impacts of the fourth quarter and full year 2021 losses at general aluminum on our adjusted eps were 0 76 and 1 38 respectively fourth quarter segment results in our supply technologies segment net sales in the fourth quarter of 2021 were 152 8 million an increase of 7 compared to the fourth quarter a year ago due to stronger customer demand in most of our key end markets with the largest increases in the semiconductor heavy duty truck agricultural and industrial equipment and civilian aerospace markets average daily sales in our supply chain business were up 7 compared to the same period a year ago segment operating income approximated 10 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 and 2020 on an adjusted basis segment operating income was 0 7 million higher in the 2021 fourth quarter compared to the same period of 2020 this improvement was due to profit flow through on higher sales levels and successful pricing initiatives which helped drive positive financial results in spite of challenging macroeconomic factors including global supply chain constraints and higher freight costs in our assembly components segment fourth quarter and full year revenue continued to benefit from new business launches and continued customer focus on light weighting products and direct inject fuel systems quoting activity is extremely high due to ongoing product platform changes and overall investment in light weighting and electrification which directly support the growth in our aluminum business net sales were 126 8 million in the fourth quarter 2021 compared to 131 5 million in the fourth quarter a year ago as customer demand was volatile due to the ongoing unpredictable impact of the chip shortage and supply chain disruptions in the automobile industry operating loss was 17 8 million in the 2021 fourth quarter compared to operating income of 9 7 million in the same period a year ago on an adjusted basis operating loss was 12 9 million in the 2021 period compared to income of 10 1 million a year ago the operating loss in the fourth quarter of 2021 was due primarily to an operating loss at general aluminum of 10 6 million lower profitability in our fuel rubber and plastic products businesses driven by the micro chip shortage commodity inflation higher labor costs and production inefficiencies and expenses related to plant closure and consolidation activities of 3 0 million we expect improved results in this segment in 2022 as a result of implemented customer price increases changes to improve plant productivity exiting nonprofitable products and relocating production of certain products to lower cost facilities in our engineered products segment fourth quarter sales were up 5 compared to the fourth quarter a year ago due to stronger demand in our capital equipment business which had its highest sales quarter since the start of the covid 19 pandemic in early 2020 bookings in this business were up 23 in the fourth quarter and 76 for the full year compared to the corresponding periods in 2020 sales in our forged and machined products group were flat compared to the same period a year ago as customer demand has been slow to recover from the covid 19 pandemic especially in the oil and gas rail and aerospace markets the segment operating loss in the fourth

economy print this the imf s agreement with argentina could be a game changer by joseph e stiglitz and mark weisbrot from project syndicate after long pushing failed belt tightening policies the international monetary fund has agreed to a deal that will allow argentina s government to pursue a pro growth strategy the task now will be to manage the inevitable shocks that will come from today s tumultuous global economic environment a new draft agreement between argentina and the international monetary fund has eschewed austerity pending approval by argentinaâ s congress and the imf board it will allow the argentine economy to grow while the government continues its efforts to reduce poverty and gradually bring down inflation with so many countries facing debt distress from the pandemic the imf will need to adopt similar changes to its policies elsewhere it is well known that the old model of austerity does not work not only does it cause the economy to contract and inflict excessive hardship on the population it also fails to meet even the narrow objectives of reducing deficits and increasing a countryâ s capacity to repay creditors advocates of austerity have claimed success in a few countries but these were small economies lucky enough to have trading partners that were enjoying a boom at the time that austerity was being implemented those positive spillover effects offset the cutbacks in public expenditure but these same economies might have grown even more if they had they not embraced herbert hoover style austerity policies argentina meanwhile has demonstrated the merits of an alternative strategy focused on growth when the economy is allowed to expand tax revenues can increase rapidly the announcement of a new imf agreement with argentina has elicited some critical comments suggesting there is something in argentinesâ blood that makes their country untrustworthy â as if it were a nation of deadbeats the assumption is that the only way to deal with a serial defaulter is to be ruthlessly tough otherwise fiscally profligate â left wingâ peronist governments supposedly will leave a mess for the next center right administration to clean up with the cycle repeating endlessly this rote criticism could not be further from the truth when the most recent center right president mauricio macri took office in late 2015 argentinaâ s foreign public debt was relatively small at 35 of gdp owing to the preceding governmentsâ growth and debt restructuring policies macri then went on a borrowing spree winning praise from wall street lenders happy to capitalize on the high interest rates he offered within a couple of years however everything began to unravel by 2019 argentinaâ s foreign public debt had risen to 69 of gdp the imf made its largest loan ever to the macri government in 2018 without even imposing conditions to prohibit the money from being used to finance capital outflows or service unsustainable debts to private creditors what happened next was no surprise capital flight economic contraction and soaring inflation which reached 53 8 in 2019 the same pattern had played out in the 1990s under president carlos menem a darling of the imf menem had been brought to washington and showcased as an exemplar of good governance and sound economic policymaking but following a period of massive government borrowing from abroad argentina fell into a devastating depression that lasted from 1998 to 2002 in 2003 nã stor kirchnerâ s peronist administration was able to achieve a rapid recovery it did so by implementing a broad based growth strategy financial markets often have an obsession with inflation and inflation can be a problem for the workings of a market economy obviously argentine president alberto fernã ndez would have preferred not to have inherited a high inflation economy when he took office in 2019 but every government must play the hand it is dealt and there will always be difficult tradeoffs in economic policymaking traditional imf programs have often put aside concerns about the cost to people and the economy the loss in growth and the increase in poverty and pursued a slash and burn strategy of budget cutting austerity with inflation at 50 9 in 2021 there are people who insist that argentina needs a recessionary program to bring prices under control but even if renewed austerity were to deliver on this objective the cure would be worse than the disease in a country where 40 of the population is already living below the poverty line no program that increases unemployment enough to bring down inflation quickly would be sustainable or justifiable argentinaâ s new agreement with the imf is just the beginning but there will always be those who long for the old imf with its contractionary often harsh or pro cyclical conditionalities these policies would be a disaster for argentina and the world they would deepen the divide between the advanced economies and developing and emerging market countries further undermining the credibility of the imf which is tasked with ensuring global financial stability at a time when measures to improve this stability are critically needed during the new programâ s implementation argentina will inevitably experience shocks â positive and negative with covid 19 still pervasive and in view of ongoing geopolitical conflicts the risk of negative shocks is real a large adverse shock would imply lower growth and larger deficits than anticipated requiring a recalibration in that case the imfâ s old language â â the country has gone off trackâ â would need to be scrapped hereâ s a replacement â the government and the imf are continuing to work together to ensure that the country responds effectively to the shock so that shared growth is restored because it is only through such growth that the agreed upon objectives can be attained â old ideas die hard no matter how many times they are proved wrong and rebuilding institutions is a slow process fortunately the imfâ s new agreement will allow argentina to tackle the challenges it faces rather than tying its hands joseph e stiglitz a nobel laureate in economics and university professor at columbia university is a former chief economist of the world bank 1997 2000 chair of the us presidentâ s council of economic advisers and co chair of the high

by marc jones london reuters the economic cost of russia s assault on ukraine was further exposed on wednesday as the sanctions hit country teetered on the brink of its first default on international debt since the bolshevik revolution moscow is due to pay 117 million in interest on two dollar denominated sovereign bonds it sold in 2013 but the limits it now faces in making payments and talk from the kremlin that it might pay in roubles triggering a default anyway has left even veteran investors guessing at what might happen one described it as the most closely watched government debt payment since greece s default at the height of the euro zone crisis others said a grace period that allows russia another 30 days to make the payment could drag the saga out the thing about defaults is that they are never clear cut and this is no exception said pictet emerging market portfolio manager guido chamorro there is a grace period so we are not really going to know whether this is a default or not until april 15 he said referring to the situation if no coupon payment is made anything could happen in the grace period creditors had not received funds by close of business in london two sources familiar with the situation said russian finance minister anton siluanov meanwhile said moscow had made the payment which had reached the correspondent american bank and it was now down to washington to clarify whether settlement is possible a default by the russian government was unthinkable until what russian president vladimir putin calls a special military operation in ukraine began in late february it had nearly 650 billion of gold and foreign currency reserves investment grade credit ratings with s p global moody s and fitch and was raking in hundreds of millions of dollars a day selling its oil and gas at soaring prices then the tanks rolled and the united states europe and their western allies fired back with unprecedented sanctions that froze two thirds of russia s reserves which it turned out were held overseas i think the market now expects russia not to make the bond payments said the head of emerging market debt at aegon asset management jeff grills adding that the conflict was one of the few emerging market events capable of really unsettling global markets that is because russia s role as one of the world s top commodity producers has sent prices and global inflation skywards at the same time it has left russia a virtual pariah state crippled by sanctions and watching hundreds of the world s largest firms quit the country after deciding their presence there is no longer feasible default scenarios as for russia s battered government bonds most are now changing hands at just 10 20 of their face value the two payments on wednesday are the first of several with another 615 million due over the rest of march and the first principal final full payment of a bond on april 4 worth 2 billion alone experienced investors see three potential scenarios for how wednesday s crucial deadline plays out the first is that moscow pays in full and in dollars meaning default worries go away for the time being big russian energy providers gazprom and rosneft have both made payments on international bonds over the last 10 days so there is still a sliver of hope it could be done if moscow feels it is in its interests the second possibility is that moscow doesn t pay starting the 30 day grace period countdown clock until default a third option where russia pays but in roubles is also possible although the legal terms of the bonds would mean that is still tantamount to a default the 30 day grace rule would still apply maybe we will know today if they pay but maybe we won t said pictet s chamorro his firm doesn t hold the bonds but does hold other russian debt and when a country defaults on one of its bonds it tends to mean all its bonds cross default in situations like these it s safest to expect the unexpected you can t really rule anything out reporting by marc jones editing by lincoln feast catherine evans and philippa fletcher

example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video retirement redevelopment pressure and changes in the industry are just a few reasons why the store is closing denver after 51 years in business turin bicycles will close its doors why it s closing is a mix of things including the retirement of the shop s owner and pressure for redevelopment in the neighborhood we became tenants in our building and at this point the lease was up and they re getting ready to tear things down so it was pretty obvious the time had come owner alan fine said but how do you sum up five decades of memories for fine it s been all about the people i m just proud of having built a business that so many people appreciated he said for me retail was always more than just selling things it was about meeting people talking to people that was the real pleasure of it for me he said the original turin bicycles started out in chicago but fine had the itch to move to denver in 1971 by november of that year at just 23 years old he became the sole proprietor and opened his store on grant and 7th avenue i love the old denver you know it was nice i mean there s been benefits to growth always a boom in cultural activities in denver there s more opportunities for everything but i miss the old days he said at first fine said they started out with 1 000 square feet but their need for more space grew and grew eventually in 1990 they moved to their current location on lincoln and 7th avenue he had many opportunities to move onto other ventures but his heart and his work have always stayed right in his bike shop we kind of clawed our way up initially we were just a little neighborhood bike store but we became involved in the bike racing scene here early on which was really small back then he said we got involved in that and started to build our reputation so we became not just that little neighborhood store anymore we were turin we were the place the bike racers went to because we had the parts the bikes they were looking for that maybe a lot of other bike shops didn t have but then the time finally came for fine to retire it was time for me i m 73 years old at this point and after doing it for 50 years i thought it s time he said i had planned to get out of the business then and sell the business to a couple of my employees sell the building and basically be done after receiving several offers fine said he sold the turin bicycles building two years ago to a close friend at st charles town company charlie woolley woolley said it s likely the building will be demolished and potentially redeveloped as mixed use for both retail and residential purposes though it s not certain there s also potential for two of the shop s long term employees mike stejskal and dave wileden to continue the turin bicycles business in the future everybody was buying for redevelopment the neighborhood has changed so dramatically fine said over the last 8 10 years of course and even more recently so many of the buildings around there have come down and been redeveloped as large apartment buildings fine said it s tough to be an independent retailer nowadays no matter what your business is there s a lot of pressure in the neighborhood driving rents up driving small retailers out he said the bike business has also changed a lot over the years fine said there s more direct to consumer sales now competition with bigger companies covid 19 caused sales to drop and issues with supply chains have made it all more difficult to stay afloat ed sealover senior reporter at the denver business journal said it s been tough for smaller family owned businesses in denver that rising rent that rising property value is just a symptom of denver being a place people want to be and until it isn t that s not going to change sealover said the businesses that have been in place for a long time are the ones you hate to see leave but at the same time there are opportunities for those businesses elsewhere he said those opportunities for businesses are away from the city center in less expensive areas like in the overland and montbello neighborhoods there could be options out there though that s certainly not what most businesses want to be looking at sealover said maybe some of these businesses will be reborn as online marketplaces and we see a lot of startup businesses that are going that direction already but for fine and his many customers and employees the memories will always remain i enjoyed every one of you i enjoyed meeting you talking to you i appreciate your business over the years i appreciate your friendship fine said it goes way beyond business so many of my customers became friends really friends and it means a lot to me turin bicycles is currently having a liquidation sale to sell off their remaining stock the shop will close at the end of the month
i don t want to start counting chickens before they re hatched but on today s bearing arms cam co we re taking stock of the current crop of constitutional carry bills around the country and compared to just a couple of weeks ago the odds of a clean sweep with one notable exception are looking much better now that two of the five gop controlled states that have pursued constitutional carry bills this year have now enshrined the measures into law advertisement with ohio gov mike dewine signing sb 215 into law on monday and alabama gov kay ivey signing a constitutional carry bill late last week the number of constitutional carry states has now grown to 23 and there are two other bills that are awaiting signatures in georgia gov brian kemp has already indicated he ll sign the constitutional carry measure that received final legislative approval last friday but so far indiana gov eric holcomb has been mum about what he plans to do with the bill that was sent to his desk last week holcomb doesn t have long to act if he plans on vetoing the measure because even if he doesn t sign the bill it will become law seven business days after the legislation was transferred to his office unlike kemp and dewine holcomb is not up for re election this year so he doesn t have to worry about shoring up his base of support ahead of a contested primary douglas carter who is holcomb s superintendent of state police has also been a staunch opponent of the constitutional carry legislation this year and holcomb recently said he stands behind the superintendent while still putting some distance between himself and the content of carter s testimony holcomb may genuinely be torn about what to do with the bill on his desk but i don t think he really wants to be the only republican governor to veto a constitutional carry bill this year in fact i can t recall a single republican governor who has ever vetoed constitutional carry though we have seen democrats like john bel edwards in louisiana and tom wolf in pennsylvania shoot down the proposals after they were approved by lawmakers i wouldn t want to be a part of that club if i were holcomb even if i didn t have to face voters this november advertisement there s also the constitutional carry bill that s currently on the floor of the nebraska senate while the legislation still needs a final vote it did survive an attempted filibuster by democrats last friday and gov pete ricketts has said that he will not only sign the bill if it gets to him but that he wants to see the measure approved by lawmakers in lincoln of the six constitutional carry bills introduced in republican controlled states this year the only one that has no chance of passage is the bill in florida which was withdrawn from consideration last week after it failed to get a committee hearing the untimely demise of that particular piece of legislation is worthy of a blog post of its own but it also shouldn t detract too much from the continued progress that we re seeing when it comes to the full recognition of our right to bear arms in self defense already more than half of the u s population now lives in a constitutional carry state and by the time the supreme court issues its ruling in a key case dealing with the right to carry in a few months more than half of the 50 states may very well have constitutional carry laws on the books we re not across the finish line yet and i d encourage gun owners in indiana to contact gov holcomb s office in support of the measure but i m impressed by what second amendment activists have been able to accomplish this year and i suspect that we ll have more to celebrate in the days ahead

everything we do and 2022 is expected to be another exciting year for isc fourth quarter 2021 highlights revenue was 44 2 million for the quarter an increase of 13 per cent compared to the fourth

diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2020 the increase is due to the increased revenue in registry operations and services lower professional and consulting expenses in 2021 and a reduction in share based compensation expense in the quarter ebitda was 17 6 million compared to 15 7 million for the same quarter in 2020 this increase was largely driven by the same reasons as net income increased revenue lower professional and consulting expenses and a reduction in share based compensation during the quarter ebitda margin was 39 8 per cent for the quarter compared to 40 2 per cent in 2020 resulting from lower ebitda in technology solutions largely due to covid 19 impacts and in services with the transition of customers to the registry complete platform which provides additional services and changes our revenue recognition by accounting on a gross instead of net basis adjusted ebitda was 17 2 million for the quarter compared to 17 0 million in the same quarter in 2020 the increase is due to the strong ebitda however during the quarter our total share based compensation expense reduced which caused adjusted ebitda to be marginally lower than ebitda adjusted ebitda margin was 38 9 per cent compared to 43 6 per cent in 2020 free cash flow for the quarter was 13 7 million an increase of 9 per cent compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 due to the strong free cash

entity registrations this was accompanied by continued organic growth in our services segment through new customer acquisition and the use of technology including registry complete offering an integrated suite of services to our clients and a full year of operations from our new recovery solutions division compared to five months in the prior year net income was 32 1 million or 1 83 per basic share and 1 78 per diluted share compared to 20 8 million or 1 19 per basic share and 1 18 per diluted share in 2020 the increase was the result of increased revenue in registry operations and

services due to revenue growth consolidated ebitda margin was 35 7 per cent compared to 31 7 per cent in 2020 adjusted ebitda was 67 8 million compared to 49 2 million in 2020 the increase is due to

expenditures for 2021 were 2 5 million compared to 1 5 million in 2020 outlookthe following section includes forward looking information including statements related to the industries in which we operate growth opportunities our future financial position and results of operations capital and operating expectations and the expected impact of covid 19 refer to caution regarding forward looking information in management s discussion analysis for the year ended december 31 2021 the company expects to see continued strength in 2022 across its two largest operating segments registry operations and services both have benefitted from strong economic conditions in 2021 including an overall positive impact on transaction and seasonality trends during the pandemic while the pandemic has disrupted various sectors of the saskatchewan economy registry operations has experienced exceptional results in 2021 mainly due to the robust real estate sector in saskatchewan while we do not expect the strong economic activity experienced in 2021 will continue indefinitely we believe 2022 will still exceed pre pandemic levels saskatchewan s economy and registry transactions are expected to begin to return to more normalized levels midway through 2022 and finish the year just below 2021 record levels consequently we expect that registry operations will continue to be a robust contributor to our results in 2022 due largely to the strong cash flow this business generates on a consistent basis additional investments in 2022 related to people and technology will be made within this segment to ensure continued high levels of service as well as secure and efficient systems we expect services to continue to deliver organic growth in 2022 driven by continuous technology advancements driving operational efficiency and new product innovation we are deliberate in growing our business with existing customers and the acquisition and onboarding of new customers particularly with our new cloud based registry complete software a focus on investments in people and technology to advance our growth will be important this will allow us to expand our offering to existing customers and facilitate the acquisition of new customers throughout the year in technology solutions we expect to see continued progress and completion of solution delivery projects where covid 19 and other related delays have resulted in certain milestones being deferred to 2022 governments are expected to continue directing their efforts to managing covid 19 but we are seeing the re commencement of early stage procurement activity which could translate into additional projects commencing later in 2022 an investment in our sales and technology development teams will be necessary to support these activities as well as provide support across the organization on our technology initiatives we have also begun the search to find an irish based leader for our dublin subsidiary to support and drive their growth as economic trends potentially revert to pre covid 19 levels we expect our results to mildly follow suit over the past two years registry operations has delivered exceptionally strong ebitda which is above historical levels this strong ebitda has been propelled by a combination of a robust saskatchewan real estate market driving higher average transaction values increased high value transactions and slightly higher transaction volumes in the land registry while we expect continued strength in registry operations ebitda margin we anticipate it to trend closer to pre pandemic levels as depicted in section 3 1 of management s discussion analysis based on the previous details in 2022 we expect revenue to be between 168 0 million and 173 0 million net income to be between 23 0 million and 27 0 million and ebitda to be between 48 0 million and 53 0 million our results from the last seven quarters have demonstrated the resilience of our business to economic adversity as well as its ability to benefit from a strong economy and we expect that to continue the company s diversified range of services pursuit of growth opportunities and strong core offerings have positioned us well for continued success in the years to come in keeping with our strategy the company will also actively explore appropriate acquisition targets in 2022 that complement or add value to our existing lines of business

prime numbers are crucial for cryptography which uses large primes to help keep communications secure fifth place neil chowdhury 18 of bellevue wash received a 90 000 award for creating a computer model to study the role of a histone protein implicated in colon cancer and found that the histone caused changes to two key processes regulating the way dna folds itself to fit into the nucleus of cells his simulations of polymers using data from a colon cancer cell line accurately reproduced recent experimental results and showed that the histone modification caused changes in the dna s physical formation specifically compartmentalization and loop extrusion sixth place aseel rawashdeh 17 austin texas received a 80 000 award for developing an inexpensive way to kill the larvae of mosquitos that spread viral illnesses by incorporating an essential oil such as cinnamon garlic or orange into baker s yeast microcapsules she made a cost effective bait that kills the larvae of

counsel to the company the march 11 letter requesting confirmation that the board will not seek to adjourn the meeting in the march 11 letter 22nw indicated that it intended to initiate legal action

by providing notice to the company that it would seek to nominate 7 rather than 6 persons to the board despite the march 11 letter and 22nw s subsequent supplement to its requisition the company does not intend to change the meeting date 22nw s march 4 2022 press release in its march 4 2022 press release 22nw claimed that the alberta securities commission the asc had dismissed all claims against 22nw on march 4 2022 the asc rendered its decision concluding that the respondents in such proceedings were not acting jointly or in concert and declined to grant any of the relief sought by the company however the asc found 22nw s 29 day late filing to be an ordinary course compliance issue under the alternative monthly reporting regime designed to protect minority shareholders but the asc declined to determine whether 22nw had also made an incorrect alternative monthly report the asc held that no remedy against 22nw was warranted since the disclosure 22nw was otherwise required to make under the applicable securities laws had subsequently been made the asc observed that the delinquent or inaccurate filings were not properly the subject of enforcement orders under its public interest

below 5 included in both the expense ratio and the combined ratio is amortization expense predominately associated with the amco iic and fsh acquisitions which cause comparative differences among periods 36 united insurance holdings corp definitions of non gaap measures we believe that investors understanding of upc insurance s performance is enhanced by our disclosure of the following non gaap measures our methods for calculating these measures may differ from those used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited combined ratio excluding the effects of current year catastrophe losses and prior year reserve development underlying combined ratio is a non gaap measure that is computed by subtracting the effect of current year catastrophe losses and prior year development from the combined ratio we believe that this ratio is useful to investors and it is used by management to highlight the trends in our business that may be obscured by current year catastrophe losses and prior year development current year catastrophe losses cause our loss trends to vary significantly between periods as a result of their frequency of occurrence and magnitude and can have a significant impact on the combined ratio prior year development is caused by unexpected loss development on historical reserves we believe it is useful for investors to evaluate these components separately and in the aggregate when reviewing our performance the most directly comparable gaap measure is the combined ratio the underlying combined ratio should not be considered as a substitute for the combined ratio and does not reflect the overall profitability of our business net loss and lae excluding the effects of current year catastrophe losses and prior year reserve development underlying loss and lae is a non gaap measure that is computed by subtracting the effect of current year catastrophe losses and prior year reserve development from net loss and lae we use underlying loss and lae figures to analyze our loss trends that may be impacted by current year catastrophe losses and prior year development on our reserves as discussed previously these two items can have a significant impact on our loss trends in a given period we believe it is useful for investors to evaluate these components both separately and in the aggregate when reviewing our performance the most directly comparable gaap measure is net loss and lae the underlying loss and lae measure should not be considered a substitute for net loss and lae and does not reflect the overall profitability of our business 37 united insurance holdings corp results of operations consolidated results net loss attributable to uihc for the year ended december 31 2021 decreased by 38 535 000 to 57 919 000 compared to 96 454 000 for the year ended december 31 2020 the decrease in net losses was primarily driven by a 186 182 000 decrease in loss lae expense for the year this was driven by our decision to lower the retention related of our core catastrophe reinsurance program for the 2021 2022 hurricane season coupled with a lower frequency of catastrophic weather activity when compared to 2020 and an increase in ceded losses to our quota share reinsurance program this was partially offset by a decrease in revenue driven by a 127 418 000 decrease in gross written premiums as described below in addition the company experienced a 177 365 000 increase in ceded premium earned as the result of the changes to the company s quota share reinsurance agreements described below as well as a decrease in realized investments gains in 2021 revenues our gross written premiums decreased by 127 418 000 or 8 7 to 1 329 445 000 for the year ended december 31 2021 from 1 456 863 000 for the year ended december 31 2020 driven primarily by a decline in written premiums across our personal lines business due to underwriting actions taken at the end of 2020 and throughout 2021 in

income from our fixed maturity investment portfolio as a result of lower yields as well as a decrease in the size of our fixed maturity portfolio in 2021 our equity securities have also produced lower returns during the year ended december 31 2021 driven by decreased holdings during 2021 as the result of our decision to dispose of our equity portfolio at the end of 2020 causing a 1 460 000 decrease

agreements in addition there was a 11 678 000 decrease in expenses incurred such as premium taxes and agent commission expenses which fluctuate in conjunction with the year over year decrease in written premium this was partially offset by an 18 576 000 increase in external management fees incurred during 2021 as the result of an increased volume of commercial written premium year over year

to preserve capital maximize after tax investment income maintain liquidity and minimize risk to accomplish our goals we purchase debt securities in sectors that represent the most attractive relative value and we maintain a moderate equity exposure limiting equity exposure manages risks and helps to preserve capital for two reasons first bond market returns are less volatile than stock market returns and second should the bond issuer enter bankruptcy liquidation bondholders generally have a higher priority than equity holders in a bankruptcy proceeding our investment strategy is the same for both our personal lines and commercial lines operating segments we must comply with applicable state insurance regulations that prescribe the type quality and concentrations of investments our insurance subsidiaries can make therefore our current investment policy limits investment in non investment grade fixed maturities and limits total investment amounts in preferred stock common stock

during the year in which it occurred see note 9 in our notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our reinsurance program unpaid losses and loss adjustments we generally use the term loss es to collectively refer to both loss and lae we establish reserves for both reported and unreported unpaid losses that have occurred at or before the balance sheet date for amounts we estimate we will be required to pay in the future including provisions for claims that have been reported but are unpaid at the balance sheet date and for obligations on claims that have been incurred but not reported at the balance sheet date our policy is to establish these loss reserves after considering all information known to us at each reporting period at any given point in time our loss reserve represents our best estimate of the ultimate settlement and administration costs of our insured claims incurred and unpaid unpaid losses and lae totaled 1 084 450 000 and 1 089 966 000 as of december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively of this total 230 377 000 and 349 882 000 is related to our commercial lines operating segment respectively the remaining 854 073 000 and 740 084 000 is related to our personal lines operating segment respectively on a consolidated basis this balance has remained relatively flat year over year despite decreased current year catastrophe losses incurred in 2021 driven by a decrease in the frequency of catastrophe activity in 2021 this decrease in activity is offset by the increase in severity of current year losses driven primarily by hurricane ida which made landfall in the third quarter of 2021 despite unpaid losses and lae remaining flat year over year we have seen an increase in our reinsurance recoverables year over year due to the decrease in our core catastrophe reinsurance program s retention levels in 2021 and our increase in quota share cessions in 2021 since the process of estimating loss reserves requires significant judgment due to a number of variables such as fluctuations in inflation judicial decisions legislative changes and changes in claims handling procedures our ultimate liability will likely differ from these estimates we revise our reserve for unpaid losses as additional information becomes available and reflect adjustments if any in our earnings in the periods in which we determine the adjustments as necessary see note 10 in our notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our losses and lae 52 united insurance holdings corp liquidity and capital resources we generate cash through premium collections reinsurance recoveries investment income the sale or maturity of invested assets the issuance of debt and the issuance of additional shares of our stock we use our cash to pay reinsurance premiums claims and related costs policy acquisition costs salaries and employee benefits other expenses and stockholder dividends acquire subsidiaries and pay associated costs as well as to repay debts and purchase investments as a holding company we do not conduct any business operations of our own and as a result we rely on cash dividends or intercompany loans from our management subsidiaries to pay our general and administrative expenses insurance regulatory authorities heavily regulate our insurance subsidiaries including restricting any dividends paid by our insurance subsidiaries and requiring approval of any management fees our insurance subsidiaries pay to our management subsidiaries for services rendered however nothing restricts our non insurance company subsidiaries from paying us dividends other than state corporate laws regarding solvency our management subsidiaries pay us dividends primarily using cash from the collection of management fees from our insurance subsidiaries pursuant to the management agreements in effect between those entities in accordance with state laws our insurance subsidiaries may pay dividends or make distributions out of that part of their statutory surplus derived from their net operating profit and their net realized capital gains the rbc guidelines published by the naic may further restrict our insurance subsidiaries ability to pay dividends or make distributions if the amount of the intended dividend or distribution would cause their respective surplus as it regards policyholders to fall below minimum rbc guidelines see note 15 in our notes to consolidated financial statements and part ii item 5 for additional information during the year ended december 31 2021 we contributed 17 000 000 8 000 000 and 17 500 000 to our insurance subsidiaries upc fsic and acic respectively during the year ended december 31 2020 we contributed 12 000 000 and 3 000 000 to our insurance subsidiary upc and reinsurance subsidiary upc re respectively we may make future contributions of capital to our insurance subsidiaries as circumstances require during february 2021 we received a dividend of 3 500 000 from iic during february 2020 we received a dividend of 12 000 000 from iic during august 2019 we received a dividend of 13 579 000 from our insurance subsidiary acic in 2019 the 1 764 000 dividend paid by iic in 2018 was returned by uihc on december 13 2017 we issued 150 000 000 of senior notes senior notes that will mature on december 15 2027 and bear interest at a rate equal to 6 25 per annum payable semi annually on each june 15 and december 15 commencing june 15 2018 the senior notes are senior unsecured obligations of the company we may redeem the senior notes at our option at any time and from time to time in whole or in part at a redemption price equal to the greater of i 100 of the principal amount of the senior notes to be redeemed and ii the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon from the date of redemption to the date that is three months prior to maturity on and after that date we may redeem the senior notes at par as a result of claim activity from the current and prior years we have an obligation related to the unpaid policyholder losses and unpaid loss adjustment expenses associated with the settling of these claims as of december 31 2021 our total obligation related to these claim payments was 1 084 450 000 of which we estimate 608 615 000 to be short term in nature due in less than twelve months based upon our cumulative claims paid over the last 21 years while we believe that historical performance of loss payment patterns is a reasonable source for projecting future claim payments there is inherent uncertainty in this estimated projected settlement and as a result these estimates will differ perhaps significantly from actual future payments in addition to our unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses as of december 31 2021 we have outstanding debt obligations related to our notes payable totaling 158 559 000 this is exclusive of interest costs which we estimate will total 65 629 000 over the life of the debt based on the current fixed and variable interest rates of these notes our short term obligation related to these notes payable total 1 523 000 in principal payments and 9 506 000 in estimated interest payments for more information regarding these outstanding notes please see note 11 in connection with entering into contracts with our outside vendors we have minimum obligations due to our vendors over the life of the contracts our main vendor obligations are related to underwriting tools claims and policy administration systems and software used by our information technology department in their daily operations our total obligation related to these three categories of obligations are 2 370 000 8 031 000 and 6 250 000 respectively of these obligations 1 257 000 5 940 000 and 1 250 000 respectively are short term in nature 53 united insurance holdings corp cash flows for the year ended december 31 in millions operating activities the principal cash inflows from our operating activities come from premium collections reinsurance recoveries and investment income the principal cash outflows from our operating activities are the result of claims and related costs reinsurance premiums policy acquisition costs and salaries and employee benefits a primary liquidity concern with respect to these cash flows is the risk of large magnitude catastrophe events during the year ended december 31 2021 several balance sheet items were impacted by our increased reinsurance coverage entered into at the end of 2020 and in 2021 reinsurance recoverable on paid and unpaid losses increased during the period driven by our increased ceding on catastrophe losses related primarily to hurricane ida and increased quota share cessions ceded unearned premiums also increased driven by the increase in ceded written premiums associated with these additional agreements in addition to these items we also saw a decrease in our unearned premium balance at december 31 2021 driven by our decreased personal lines written premium in 2021 as the result of underwriting actions taken by the company at the end of 2020 and throughout 2021 investing activities the principal cash inflows from our investing activities come from repayments of principal proceeds from maturities and sales of investments we closely monitor and manage these risks through our comprehensive investment risk management process the principal cash outflows relate to purchases of investments and cost of property equipment and capitalized software acquired additional cash outflows relate to the purchase of fixed assets the primary liquidity concerns with respect to these cash flows are the risk of default by debtors and market disruption during the year ended december 31 2021 cash provided by investing activities increased 214 811 000 as the result of net sales of investments totaling 256 648 000 in 2021 compared to 47 414 000 in 2020 financing activities the principal cash inflows from our financing activities come from issuances of debt and other securities the principal cash outflows come from repayments of debt and payments of dividends the primary liquidity concern with respect to these cash flows is market disruption in the cost and availability of credit we believe our current capital resources together with cash provided from our operations are sufficient to meet currently anticipated working capital requirements during the year ended december 31 2021 cash used in financing activities increased by 552 000 due to a 588 000 increase year over year in cash outflows related to our repayment of our outstanding debt offset by a 73 000 decrease year over year in our tax withholding payments related to the net settlement of equity awards 54 united insurance holdings corp recent accounting standards please refer to note 2 v in our notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting standards that may affect us application of critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to adopt accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements the most critical estimates include those used in determining reserves for unpaid losses fair value of investments investment portfolio credit allowances and goodwill in making these determinations management makes subjective and complex judgments that frequently require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain many of these policies estimates and related judgments are common in the insurance industry it is reasonably likely that changes in these estimates could occur from time to time and result in a material impact on our consolidated financial statements in addition the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with gaap prescribes when we may reserve for particular risks including litigation exposures accordingly our results for a given reporting period could be significantly affected if and when we establish a reserve for a major contingency therefore the results we report in certain accounting periods may appear to be volatile and past results may not be indicative of results in future periods reserves for unpaid losses and lae reserves for unpaid losses and lae represent the most significant accounting estimate inherent in the preparation of our financial statements these reserves represent management s best estimate of the amount we will ultimately pay for losses and we base the amount upon the application of various actuarial reserve estimation techniques as well as considering other material facts and circumstances known at the balance sheet date as discussed in note 10 in our notes to consolidated financial statements we determine our ultimate losses by using multiple actuarial methods to determine an actuarial estimate within a relevant range of indications that we calculate using generally accepted actuarial techniques our selection of the actuarial estimate is influenced by the analysis of our historical loss and claims experience since inception for each accident year we estimate the ultimate incurred losses for both reported and unreported claims in establishing this estimate we reviewed the results of various actuarial methods discussed in note 10 in our notes to consolidated financial statements fair value of investments fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date we are responsible for the determination of fair value of financial assets and the supporting assumptions and methodologies we use quoted prices from active markets and we use an independent third party valuation service to assist us in determining fair value we obtain only one single quote or price for each financial instrument as discussed in note 4 in our notes to consolidated financial statements we value our investments at fair value using quoted prices from active markets to the extent available for securities for which quoted prices in active markets are unavailable we use observable inputs such as quoted prices in inactive markets quoted prices in active markets for similar instruments benchmark interest rates broker quotes and other relevant inputs we also have investments in limited partnerships that require us to use the net asset value per share method of valuation to determine fair value see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for more information regarding the sensitivity of our fixed maturity portfolio to changes in interest rates 55 united insurance holdings corp investment portfolio credit allowances for investments classified as available for sale the difference between fair value and cost or amortized cost for fixed income securities is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss on our consolidated balance sheet and is not reflected in our net income loss of any period until reclassified to net income loss upon the consummation of a transaction with an unrelated third party we have a portfolio monitoring process to identify and evaluate each fixed income security whose carrying value may be impaired as the result of a credit loss for each fixed income security in an unrealized loss position if we determine that we intend to sell the security or that it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of the cost or amortized cost basis for reasons such as liquidity needs contractual or regulatory requirements the security s entire decline in fair value is recorded in earnings if our management decides not to sell the fixed income security and it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell the fixed income security before recovery of its amortized cost basis we evaluate whether the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses or other factors this is typically indicated by a change in the rating of the security assigned by a rating agency and any adverse conditions specifically related to the security or industry among other factors if the assessment indicates that a credit loss may exist the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security are compared to the amortized cost basis of the security if the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit losses will be recorded in earnings credit loss is limited to the difference between a security s amortized cost basis and its fair value any additional impairment not recorded through an allowance for credit losses is recognized in other comprehensive income if the estimated recovery value is less than the amortized cost of the security a credit loss exists and an allowance for the difference between the estimated recovery value and amortized cost is recorded in earnings the portion of the unrealized loss related to factors other than credit remains classified in accumulated other comprehensive income loss if we determine that the fixed income security does not have sufficient cash flow or other information to estimate a recovery value for the security we may conclude that the entire decline in fair value is deemed to be credit related and the loss is recorded in earnings due to the adoption of accounting standards update asu 2016 01 asu 2016 01 as of january 1 2018 equity securities are reported at fair value with changes in fair value including impairment write downs being recognized in the revenue section of our consolidated statements of comprehensive loss see note 2 b in our notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our credit loss testing measurement of goodwill and related impairment goodwill is the excess of cost over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances such as adverse changes in the business climate indicate that there may be justification for conducting an interim test we test goodwill for impairment by performing a qualitative assessment if the assessment indicates that an impairment may exist a quantitative assessment is performed goodwill is impaired when it is determined that the carrying value of a reporting unit is in excess of the fair value of that reporting unit the valuation methodologies utilized are subject to key judgments and assumptions that are sensitive to change estimates of fair value are inherently uncertain and represent only management s reasonable expectation regarding future developments please refer to note 2 k and note 8 in our notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our measurement of goodwill and related impairment related party transactions please

to some san diegans the sound of a crowing rooster is a familiar and welcome one it can be a deeply rooted part of their cultural heritage or upbringing but to others that cock a doodle doo is an unwelcomed squawk interrupting sleep early in the morning or disturbing their daily routine it s partly why local lawmakers updated the city ordinance in 2012 and made rooster ownership illegal as people look for ways to stay entertained during the coronavirus pandemic raising backyard chickens has grown in popularity nbc 7 s ashley matthews shares what you need to know about this hobby before you get started but that law didn t eliminate the problem which was easy to spot when nbc 7 investigates looked through code enforcement investigations san diegans filed more than 200 complaints due to loud rooster noises in just the last three years alone get san diego local news weather forecasts sports and lifestyle stories to your inbox sign up for nbc san diego newsletters none of those cases resulted in fines against rooster owners instead city officials told nbc 7 investigates they send out two letters when a case is filed one notification letter goes to the person who complained letting them know that a warning letter was sent to the homeowner rooster owners are told to remove the animals but there is no information about possible monetary fines nbc 7 investigates asked the city what repercussions rooster owners face if they don t comply the only answer city officials repeatedly told us civil action brought against them by their neighbors rooster noise complaints fall in the lowest tier in the priority of cases that the code enforcement division investigates priority 1 cases involve imminent health and safety hazards like unstable structures leaking sewage and exposed electrical wires noise complaints are referred to as alternative compliance cases inspectors don t visit sites instead as an option they refer neighbors to a mediation service to work out the issue without involving the city one of those letters arrived at the home of 16 year old efrain zamora in city heights in mid october zamora said they had two roosters and two hens for a couple of months we even named them you know due to their characteristics and everything efrain said efrain spoke for the family with permission from his mother after getting the warning letter he said the family moved quickly to comply with the ordinance which they weren t aware of it was a bit sad efrain said but we knew we had to just because it was the city the family opted to rehome the entire flock with relatives because they didn t want to split up the birds allison wall the administrator of the facebook group san diego backyard chickens said chicken ownership has boomed in popularity in recent years it took wall s facebook group four years to reach 1 500 members but she said that number doubled in size when the covid 19 pandemic hit and it keeps rising she said the trend made for big business for local country stores they couldn t keep chicks in stock wall said wall said that it s hard to tell the sex of a chick even for experts in summer all of a sudden there were a lot more roosters that needed to be rehomed wall said that was definitely tied to people rushing to get chickens and not really knowing what they were getting into wall has 40 chickens in her backyard including her two roosters she lives in lakeside where it is legal to own them each one has a name and wall will tell you each has its own personality she jokes that chickens are a gateway to farming hens provide a majority of their eggs in their first year so keeping a couple of roosters on hand allows you to naturally replenish an existing flock roosters are great wall said they re colorful i don t just mean their feathers but their personalities they re definitely the protector of the flock but roosters can be loud and in some parts of the county like the city of san diego they re illegal to own which is why before you get chickens wall said you need to make sure you have someone who can take roosters nbc 7 investigates spoke with the san diego humane society which said it regularly takes in both stray and owner surrendered roosters over the past three calendar years 331 have gone through its intake system but less than half were owner surrendered wall believes the ordinance and the rooster ban are partly to blame for those numbers she said the ordinance should be reconsidered from a holistic standpoint and that it needs to be looked at from a much larger picture and an entire overhaul of the system she hopes lawmakers can update the ordinance by factoring in everything it takes to raise a healthy flock like the hen to rooster ratio and the size of the coop etc i can tell you exactly what s in my eggs and that makes me feel really good about the food we re eating wall said so i don t think that s going to die down and in general i think it causes a problem to not be able to have roosters there are multiple private animal rescue organizations that will take in unwanted farm animals like roosters you can reach out to organizations like rescue roos to learn more

photo the canadian press an association of window blind makers is warning of a steep financial hit to companies and potentially the loss of thousands of jobs in a few weeks unless the federal government delays enacting a new set of safety rules a sign is displayed in front of health canada headquarters in ottawa on friday january 3 2014 the canadian press sean kilpatrick an association of window blind makers is warning of a steep financial hit to companies and potentially the loss of thousands of jobs in a few weeks unless health canada delays enacting a new set of safety rules ralph vasami executive director of the window covering manufacturers association says his members want to see their products made safer but are facing a new set of hurdles to meet the upcoming requirements the changes would alter how blinds are tested as part of a years long effort by federal regulators to prevent children from strangling themselves on cords vasami says supply chain disruptions have meant that manufacturers aren t able to get parts or materials to have finished products ready for may 1 when the new regulations take effect he also says that major retailers are similarly unable to source new products on time to replace stock that will no longer be permissible to be sold in a few weeks health canada says the industry has had three years to prepare for the coming regulatory change far more than the usual six month time frame for new rules to take effect the plea from the association is similar to one it made a year ago which yielded a one year extension vasami s pitch to the government echoes a slew of other requests provided to the house of commons finance committee in advance of this year s federal budget what they have in common is that they don t ask for new spending to help their organizations or industries survive and thrive over the coming years instead several submissions ask the government to reduce eliminate or rejig existing regulations and programs to provide an economic boost without a parallel increase in federal spending for example the canadian airports council asks the government to modernize customs rules so their members can offer duty free sales to arriving passengers while the canadian vehicle manufacturers association is looking for greater regulatory alignment with our north american neighbours vasami said he doesn t see how his association s ask would increase government spending arguing that costs would instead be incurred by his members he estimates that total losses for manufacturers would amount to 800 million in lost economic output and potentially cost more than 3 900 jobs for retail vasami estimates the drop in economic output could amount to 755 million and cost a further 6 100 jobs the association and some of its members have offered the government suggestions on how the regulations could still address safety concerns but vasami says they have been repeatedly brushed off just have a science based approach to this that leads to the outcome that everybody s really looking to lead to which is safe products and there s no opposition on that vasami said in an interview how do we get there that allows for an industry to remain viable is really what we re looking for the rules were to take effect last may two years after they were publicly posted but the government granted a one year extension because of pandemic related supply chain impacts over the past three years many manufacturers have complied with the new regulations and already discontinued certain types of blinds or have made changes to provide safer options health canada said in a statement

march 14 2022 at this point itâ s safe to say that trust in the system has not merely left the building it has fled the planet there have now been 25 summit meetings of the conference of the parties to the un framework convention on climate change unfccc since the first cop1 took place in 1995 despite grave pronouncements of â alarm and concern â none has managed to do much of anything to curb humanityâ s thirst for fossil fuels meanwhile the bind of the climate crisis has only tightened the cliffâ s edge of disaster only drawn nearer after a short steep slump due to the pandemic â when engines were cut plane tickets binned supply chains severed and the world briefly ground to a smog lifting halt â demand for coal oil and gas is expected to all but recover in 2021 and lead to the second biggest annual jump in co2 emissions in history few will have forgotten that the last couple of years have seen a historic spate of storms floods droughts wildfires and heatwaves as well as some of the highest temperatures on record â all disquieting harbingers of whatâ s to come the number of those who havenâ t yet felt the heat firsthand is dwindling daily with that in mind heads of government walked away from cop26 hosted in glasgow in early november having promised to cut down on methane and move to end deforestation but largely abstained from touching combustibles an eleventh hour intervention made sure that parties agreed to â phase downâ rather than â phase outâ coal the number one source of co2 by fuel type as well as â inefficient fossil fuel subsidies â incredibly this marks the first mention of the words â fossil fuelsâ in any cop communiquã though naturally what is meant by â phase downâ and â inefficientâ isnâ t specified even before the proceedings began it was clear that the worldâ s wealthiest countries had fallen well short of coming up with the 100 billion they had agreed a decade ago to give the poorest so that the latter might have a shot at staving off the worst of the gathering swelter â plainly undeserved punishment doled out by the former incidentally or not at over five hundred strong the fossil fuel lobby outnumbered any one countryâ s delegation to the scottish summit in the words of john kerry it was environmental diplomacyâ s â last best chance â seemingly squandered it gets worse according to a report by climate action tracker the net zero consensus formed in the lead up to cop26 is hugely inadequate putting the rise in global temperatures on track to handily surpass the paris agreementâ s hard upper limit of two degrees celsius by centuryâ s end thatâ s assuming however that national governments make good on their pledges if you read the fine print youâ ll find that in order to offset the roughly 140 million tons of greenhouse gases spewed into the atmosphere tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow they count on the feasibility of large scale carbon capture technologies the problem is those donâ t yet exist all the same governments and corporations the world over have cited the mere wish for these quick fix gimmicks to justify an approach to â net zeroâ that essentially amounts to â burn now remediate later â even amazon has gotten on board having made its vow to go carbon neutral by 2040 in the first year of covid 19 â the same year its annual emissions rose nearly 20 percent to trot out an already much used phrase itâ s all just a kick of the can down the road to dusty death â original spin â between the urgency of the crisis and copâ s unreadiness to act faith in the process now demands either profound gullibility or plain ignorance yet was there ever any good reason to believe in truth signs of trouble could be seen from the start for one the bureaucratic nature of the unfccc as with any intergovernmental body was bound from the beginning to make change slow going to the point of tedium but if time ever seemed in decent supply today the bottom of the well has been all but reached for another the interests of the fossil fuel industry â remain stitched into global networks of power directly descended from the age of imperialism â as adam tooze puts it the force of the industryâ s presence in glasgow and the nearly seven percent of global gdp 5 9 trillion it received last year in subsidies are stark reminders of its unyielding supremacy last for all their self congratulatory fanfare and high minded rhetoric the cop summits have never amounted to much more than just that fanfare and rhetoric mostly they have served as neat opportunities for governments to launder their environmentalist credibility and affirm their geopolitical standing while doing nothing to address the perilous economic incentives underlying the crisis in this deluded paradigm talk is as good as action the fossil fuel industry is a tameable beast and the stock of â next yearsâ is inexhaustible at its core lurk the fatal logic of capitulation and the deadly promise of doomsday so exactly what if anything has cop accomplished its signal achievements are the kyoto protocol adopted at cop3 and the paris agreement adopted at cop21 the secondâ s existence suggests the failure of the first the us refused to ratify the kyoto protocol the senate having unanimously resolved to reject any climate treaty that would either mandate emissions reduction commitments for â developedâ countries but not for â developingâ ones or do â serious harmâ to the american economy when it formally withdrew its signature in 2001 the us was the worldâ s top emitter as developing countries china and india then the worldâ s number two and number five emitters respectively were exempt from the protocolâ s binding targets to reduce annual emissions to five percent below what they were in 1990 â targets to be reached in the four short years between 2008 and 2012 when the time came to reaffirm the treaty many developed countries didnâ t take on new targets while canada then a top ten emitter dropped out altogether by 2012 emissions worldwide had gone up by almost 55 percent relative to 1990 the need for a new and truly global charter was then not only plain but paramount coming into force four years later the paris agreement effectively supplanted kyoto and is the reigning climate treaty to this day its nearly 200 parties have sworn to undertake â ambitious effortsâ to fulfil their â nationally determined contributions â which unlike kyoto are non binding targets self determined by each participating country yet even if all signatories were to live up to their current ndcs which most are failing to do they still wouldnâ t go nearly far enough to hold the increase in temperature â well belowâ two degrees celsius above pre industrial levels â one of the agreementâ s signature goals designed to â significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate changeâ or in plain terms avoid the total collapse of civilization at this point seeing that goal through would require a herculean curtailing of emissions a cutback of 45 percent relative to 2010 by 2030 now halfway towards that due date emissions have gone not down but up by four percent as things stand we are poised to see the mercury climb nearly three degrees by the end of this century or just over two degrees if against all odds all the shirkers and truants together go far above and well beyond the status quo whatever the paris agreement has achieved thus far it has been neither to keep fossil fuels below ground nor to forestall the mounting heat to say nothing of spreading the misery fairly it certainly hasnâ t compelled the carbon tipped pencil pushers to stick to their word the fire next time if hope no longer dwells within the building might it linger seething just outside the doors with cop26â s deliberations underway one hundred thousand people marched in the streets of glasgow in the name of climate justice â the message is that the system of cops â isnâ t working so we need to uproot that system â a young activist affiliated with fridays for future told the bbc â the message is you need to listen to the people in the streets the young people the workers â needless to say despite their numbers and their earnestness those in the streets were decidedly not heeded by those nodding off in the conference hall stand by for the uprooting of the system indeed in a quarter century of summits cop has done a stellar job of ignoring the pleas of demonstrators milling among fellow activists playing dead in the middle of a thoroughfare â protesters in un delegate costumes carried signs saying â blah blah blahâ and did nothing â recalls a certain swede â on signal we marched to the and tried to prevent the delegates from leaving by locking ourselves to the gates â all the while chanting â no more blah blah blah â action now â â this had nothing to do with extinction rebellion xr it had nothing to do with fridays for future or with greta thunberg either in fact greta wasnâ t there or anywhere she hadnâ t been born yet â this happened in 1995 the scene was cop1 â writes activist and scholar andreas malm â the delegates snuck out through a backdoor â in the twenty five years after left more carbon was released from underground stocks than in the seventy five years before they met â malm has travelled the civil disobedience path further than most not least alongside german coal mine occupiers ende gelã nde â we march we block we stage theatres we hand over lists of demands to ministers we chain ourselves we march the next day too â over the years the crowds have grown bigger and bigger and the rhetoric has become more desperate â we talk of extinction and no future â all the same â business continues very much as usual â how long can this go on for when if ever will environmentalists consider other means other strategies to achieve their aims how high do the flames have to get before we reach for the axe on the wall in brief â at what point do we escalate â this question is at the heart of malmâ s rigorous and seriously considered book how to blow up a pipeline to be clear it isnâ t an instruction manual nor is it a reckless provocation itâ s a carefully reasoned historically informed and principled case for forms of resistance beyond non violence in the face of an immovable fossil fuel hegemony in malmâ s eyes itâ s only when all peaceable means appeals to reason dialogue demonstrations have been exhausted that the first tentative step in the direction of escalation is justified consider the futility of thirty yearsâ worth of intergovernmental summits and always accompanying protests might the time to up the ante have come already â to say that the signals have fallen on the deaf ears of the ruling classes of this worldâ â those who have the money the political might and the law at their backs â â would be an understatement â malm declares in his other writing he has argued that fossil fuels are so deeply imbedded in the logic of capitalism as to be inextricable â after the past three decades there can be no doubt that are constitutionally incapable of responding to the catastrophe in any other way than by expediting it â the better question is given the urgency and the scale of the present crisis â is there a good reason we have waited this long â whatâ s most striking in all this as malm points out isnâ t even so much that he takes this radical tack after providing a brief history of politically motivated pipeline vandalism he puzzles as to â why these things donâ t happen â or rather why they happen for all sorts of reasons good and bad but not for the climate â it isnâ t a matter of technical difficulty as pipeline and gas journal conceded in 2005 amid hard bitten resistance to the us led occupation of iraq the titular infrastructure is â very easily sabotaged a simple explosive device can put a critical section â out of operation for weeks â rather the remarkable rarity of this kind of action is explained by â the general demise of revolutionary politics â no thanks to neoliberalismâ s dissent stifling triumph and â insufficient politicisation of the climate crisis â in other words though many might agonise over humanityâ s impending doom â they rarely see a means for fighting back â resistance is futile in malmâ s account this state of anguished resignation is largely due to a self imposed limitation on tactics while the stakes have steadily risen a quasi theological commitment to non violence has only taken faster hold of the climate movement he distinguishes between this tenetâ s two major strains moral pacifism ã la bill mckibben â says that it is always wrong to commit acts of violence â whereas strategic pacifism contends that whether right or wrong â violence committed by social movements always takes them further from their goal â belief in the efficacy of strategic pacifism is closely clung to by creeds such as xr which claims that absolute peacefulness has shown itself historically to be the only admissible route to social transformation violence on the other hand â almost always leads to fascism and authoritarianism â from the suffragettes to gandhi the civil rights movement to nelson mandela the non violent â civil resistance modelâ has proved not only morally but tactically superior to any other means â violent confrontation above all so the story goes but does it stand up to scrutiny as malm takes some pains to show it would be a mistake to read such strict pacifism into these struggles the suffragettes â their tactic of choice was property destruction â indian independence â subaltern violence marked the route to india from the mutiny of 1857 to that of 1946 â the civil rights movement â herbert h haines recaps the dialectic â nonviolent direct action struck at the heart of powerful political interests because it could so easily turn to violence â â nelson mandela â sabotage remained the main modus operandiâ of anti apartheid militants but by mandelaâ s own account â if sabotage did not produce the results we wanted we were prepared to move on to the next stage guerrilla warfare and terrorism â the point here isnâ t to suggest that non violence is impotent that violence is glorious or that violence alone can solve the problems of our time malm is quick to assert that â non violent mass mobilisation should â be the first resort militant action the lastâ and keen to celebrate all that has been done without taking up arms instead itâ s to ask â whether it is possible to locate even one minimally relevant analogue to the climate struggle that has not contained some violence â if not then the historical basis for the doctrine of strategic pacifism long and inflexibly upheld must be put into question as to the climate how far has it gotten us until now in the struggle to reel our species back from the brink of annihilation how much more time can we afford to waste in niggling over what malm sees as false niceties steady loving hands the answer of course is less than none so whatâ s to be done this is the smouldering question facing todayâ s climate existentialists malmâ s answer is to â announce and enforce the prohibitionâ of co2 emitting devices â put them out of commission pick them apart demolish them burn them blow them up â send the message to investors that henceforth the filthy flow of profits will cease to the rich and profligate that their luxuriating at the cost of a liveable future will no longer be suffered â property destruction â however â doesnâ t have to come in the form of explosions projectiles pyromania â note that hurting people doesnâ t come into it either let alone the bogeyman known as terrorism credibly defined as â the deliberately indiscriminate killing of innocent civilians for the purpose of instilling terrorâ the word of the day is â sabotage â and it â can be done softly even gingerly â whatâ s less clear is what it would do to the climate movement clearly not everyone is bound to be on board with blowing up pipelines malm looks askance at â total tactical conformityâ and speculates that support for intensified resistance will only grow as the ecological noose tightens he admits that â climate militancy would have to be articulated to a wider anti capitalist groundswellâ and acknowledges that a tactical escalation of the kind he proposes risks provoking not only mainstream vilification but a crippling crackdown from on high as in the case of jessica reznicek and ruby montoya who after â exploring and exhausting all avenues of process â proceeded with â steady loving handsâ to tamper with the dakota access pipeline pleading guilty they were indicted on charges carrying a sentence of over a century yet he presupposes that a radical flank within the movement will more likely than not be capable of pushing past these obstacles and recalibrating the conversation around a more proactive midpoint exactly how this might happen though â cannot be known beforehand it can be found only through immersion in practice â adam tooze likens this attitude to â a revolutionary cadre hedging his bets â it places a lot of faith in the persuasive power of the deed yet even if militant action were met with censure and repression even if it became obvious that it had arrived too late to accomplish anything of substance malm maintains that it would still hold symbolic even transcendent value he compares this sort of foredoomed defiance to the jewish resistance to the nazis â beyond the immediate outcome of the struggle which most often was inevitable their combat was for history for memory â he quotes approvingly from alain brossatâ s and sylvie klingbergâ s revolutionary yiddishland â this affirmation of life by way of a sacrifice and combat with no prospect of victory is a tragic paradox that can only be understood as an act of faith in history â as the analogy pertains to the climate crisis malm reckons that if â it is too late for resistance to be waged within a calculus of immediate utility the time has come for it to vindicate the fundamental values of life even if it only means crying out to the heavens â as it happens making â that statement would require some forceful type of action â itâ s not hard to imagine what he has in mind before weâ re left with no option but to go out in a blaze the chance remains that peaceful protestors might have their way that the powers that be listen to the kids get their act together and make some semblance of good undoubtedly itâ s the scenario most would prefer to see happen even malm in light of the catastrophic shortcomings of all hands efforts like cop26 however the likelihood that things could actually go down in this manner appears increasingly meagre yet there do exist unplumbed ways to proceed that sidestep the perils of succumbing to despair â that is of giving in to suicidal fatalism malm makes a compelling case for one plausible if pause giving approach to breaking up the moral intellectual and political deadlock currently seizing the climate struggle his penetrating analysis alone is nigh on essential to a clear eyed understanding of the present dilemma can our species save itself by any means short of revolution that depends â alarmingly and against all precedent â on the willingness of those commanding some of historyâ s most propulsive forces to dismantle the very conditions that have seen them behind the worldâ s control panel for the past 150 years regardless of whether you find his conclusions palatable malm has dared prompt the most pressing question of the hour the inward challenge everyone must meet at this fateful juncture in the human story in the face of terrible urgency and in the name of all you love how far are you willing to go
the general assembly s housing committee sent a diverse package of bills to the floor or to other committees with joint favorable reports tuesday afternoon renter and landlord issues housing affordability and availability and an act establishing a right to housing among other related measures are covered in the legislation that made it out of the housing committee the right to housing bill seeks to establish a right to housing for all residents of the state and a right to housing committee according to its summary it shall be the goal of this state to implement policies that will respect protect and fulfill a right to affordable decent safe and stable housing for every resident of this state the proposed bill language reads state agencies would be compelled to consider the right to housing when implementing policies and to give priority to assisting families of low and moderate income in public testimony for the bill evonne klein the ceo of the connecticut coalition to end homelessness said that in connecticut we believe that housing is a human right today we have the opportunity as a state to codify those words and those beliefs in s b 168 klein said in her testimony ensuring the right not to be evicted unfairly the right to safe and decent housing the right to live in communities with good schools and supports for health and safety the right to equal access regardless of race gender disability or other status deb monahan executive director of the nonprofit thames valley council for community action which assists low income and disadvantaged residents in southeastern connecticut said tuesday that it would be great to pass something like this but there are two things people need the money to pay the rent and the availability of the housing stock sometimes those are the biggest barriers monahan continued it s great to say we all have a right to safe and stable housing and i couldn t agree with that any more but sometimes the barrier is if the rents are too high and there s an affordability issue or there s an availability issue the connecticut conference of municipalities said in its testimony that it is in favor of the intent behind the bill but is concerned about the possibility of unfunded mandates the ccm said the bill would require municipalities to consider the right to housing and the components established under the bill some of these components include the right to 1 protection from housing loss 2 safe housing that meets basic needs 3 housing affordability 4 rehousing assistance for those who have become homeless and 5 the recognition of special circumstances the ccm wrote adding that it supports providing affordable housing and combatting homelessness with that being said the bill as currently drafted is vague and potentially opens the door to burdensome unfunded mandates the ccm added in its testimony the financial commitments regarding the components listed are unknown ccm would ask the committee to clearly state the responsibilities of the municipality as it relates to the committee establishing a right to housing the bill also is supported by the connecticut coalition against domestic violence which includes safe futures of new london this piece of legislation expresses the need to progressively implement policies to respect protect and fulfill a right to affordable decent safe and stable housing the coalition wrote in its testimony state rep kimberly fiorello r greenwich referenced the right to housing bill during a tense exchange with a member of the public testifying

to extended collection losses and drive up rental prices if tenants get extended non payment opportunities the state judicial branch also submitted testimony asking that the bill language be changed

our gaap results allows management to better understand our consolidated financial performance from period to period and better project our future consolidated financial performance as forecasts are developed at a level of detail different from that used to prepare gaap based financial measures moreover we believe these non gaap financial measures provide our stakeholders with useful information to help them evaluate our operating results by facilitating an enhanced understanding of our operating performance and enabling them to make more meaningful period to period comparisons there are limitations to the use of the non gaap financial measures presented in this press release for example our non gaap financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies other companies including companies in our industry may calculate non gaap financial measures differently than we do limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes the non gaap financial measures are not meant to be considered as indicators of performance in isolation from or as a substitute for net income loss prepared in accordance with gaap and should be read only in conjunction with financial information presented on a gaap basis reconciliations of each of ebitda and adjusted ebitda to its most directly comparable gaap financial measure net income loss

its outlook and guidance regarding adjusted ebitda which is a non gaap financial measure and excludes certain charges management has not reconciled these non gaap financial measures to the corresponding gaap financial measures because guidance for the various reconciling items are not provided management is unable to provide guidance for these reconciling items because we cannot determine their probable significance as certain items are outside of our control and cannot be reasonably predicted since these items could vary significantly from period to period accordingly

slowdown in fighting absurd claims nato worries that russia is gearing up to carry out a chemical attack in ukraine secretary general jens stoltenberg said citing absurd claims that ukraine possesses biological weapons labs and warning that russia would pay a high price if it did so on tuesday chinese foreign minister wang yi said beijing did not want to be impacted by western sanctions on russia as us pressure grows on beijing to withdraw support from moscow china is not a party to the crisis still less wants to be affected by the sanctions mr wang said reports this week said moscow had turned to beijing for military and economic help prompting what one us official called very candid talks between high ranking us and chinese officials a britain based war monitor said moscow had drawn up lists of 40 000 fighters from syrian army and allied militias to be put on standby for deployment in ukraine kyiv s allies meanwhile have piled economic pressure on mr putin s regime
by marc jones london reuters the economic cost of russia s assault on ukraine was fully exposed on wednesday as vladimir putin s sanctions ravaged government teetered on the brink of its first international debt default since the bolshevik revolution moscow was due to pay 117 million in interest on two dollar denominated sovereign bonds it had sold back in 2013 but the limits it now faces making payments and talk from the kremlin that it might pay in roubles triggering a default anyway meant even veteran investors were left guessing at what might happen one described it as the most closely watched government debt payment since greece s default at the height of the euro zone crisis others said an emergency grace period that allows russia another 30 days to make the payment could drag the saga out the thing about defaults is that they are never clear cut and this is no exception said pictet emerging market portfolio manager guido chamorro there is a grace period so we are not really going to know whether this is a default or not until april 15 he said referring to the situation if no coupon payment is made anything could happen in the grace period a russian government debt default was unthinkable until what putin called a special military operation in ukraine began in late february it had nearly 650 billion of currency reserves coveted investment grade credit ratings with s p global moody s and fitch and was raking in hundreds of millions of dollars a day selling its oil and gas at soaring prices then the tanks rolled and the united states europe and their western allies fired back with unprecedented sanctions which froze two thirds of russia s reserves that it turned out were held overseas i think the market now expects russia not to make the bond payments the head of emerging market debt at aegon asset management jeff grills adding the conflict was one of the few emerging market events capable of really unsettling global markets that is because russia s role as one of the world s top commodity producers has sent prices and global inflation skywards at the same time it has left russia a virtual pariah state crippled by sanctions and watching hundreds of the world s largest firms now quit the country after deciding their presence there is no longer feasible graphic russia international debt default looming default scenarios as for russia s battered government bonds most are now changing hands at just 10 20 of their face value the two payments on wednesday are the first of several with another 615 million due over the rest of march and the first principal final full payment of a bond on april 4 worth 2 billion alone experienced investors see three potential scenarios for how wednesday s crucial deadline plays out the first is that moscow pays in full and in dollars meaning default worries go away for the time being big russian energy providers gazprom and rosneft have both made payments on international bonds over the last 10 days so there is still a sliver of hope it could be done if moscow feels it is in its interests the second possibility is that moscow doesn t pay starting the 30 day grace period countdown clock until default a third option where russia pays but in roubles is also possible although the legal terms of the bonds would mean that is still tantamount to a default the 30 day grace rule would still apply maybe we will know today if they pay but maybe we won t said pictet s chamorro his firm doesn t hold the bonds but does hold other russian bond and when a country defaults on one of its bonds it tends to mean all its bonds cross default in situations like these it s safest to expect the unexpected you can t really rule anything out graphic fortress russia crumbled under sanctions reporting by marc jones editing by lincoln feast

appointed dr ivy estabrooke as a director of energy fuels bringing to the company experience in commercial stage biotech research and development program leadership and technology solutions for national security and public health challenges mark s chalmers energy fuels president and ceo stated in 2021 we believe energy fuels further strengthened its position as america s leading multi commodity critical mineral company as we made excellent progress on our uranium rees vanadium and medical isotope initiatives we are deploying our one of a kind licenses facilities and expertise to responsibly recover the critical elements needed for carbon free nuclear energy electric vehicle powertrains wind generation advanced electronics grid scale batteries other clean energy and advanced technologies and potentially cancer therapeutics we are particularly proud of our accomplishments in rees we announced our entry into the ree business less than two years ago and today we are ramping up our production of commercial quantities of re carbonate which is a more advanced ree material than any other u s company is producing as we are chemically recovering the rees in a high purity material that is ready for ree separation we are also moving toward licensing and installing the infrastructure needed to produce separated ree oxides on a full commercial scale in the coming years the proven processing technology for producing separated ree oxides is solvent extraction or sx and our white mesa mill has over 40 years of experience producing uranium and vanadium using sx with the support of carester a leading global consultant in the production of separated ree products we believe it is a logical next step for energy fuels to produce separated ree oxides on a full commercial scale at the mill we have already successfully performed la ce and ndpr separations at pilot scale in the mill s lab over the past several months and we recently began ramping up our commercial separation of la and ce from our re carbonate on a small scale using an existing sx circuit at the mill our primary ree focuses in 2022 will be building our supply of monazite ore designing and licensing a new full commercial scale ree separation circuit at the mill and advancing our innovative ree metal initiative with nsp with the recent events in ukraine security of supply in the u s for uranium is crucial energy fuels continues to be the leading low cost u s uranium producer with more production facilities and capacity than any other u s company and we stand ready to be a reliable large scale supplier to u s nuclear utilities we are seeing an increase in utility interest for long term contracts we are pursuing uranium sales contracts with pricing and terms that return acceptable project margins and maintain exposure to further uranium market upside vanadium prices are rising as well in 2019 we built a significant inventory of vanadium to sell into the abrupt upside price volatility that vanadium markets often experience most recently in late 2018 the next upward cycle may have begun as prices have risen sharply in the first months of 2022 and we are selling some of our inventory as we sell we will evaluate the potential to resume production from the mill s pond solutions or our conventional deposits to replace our sold inventory we estimate our pond solutions alone contain another 1 0 to 3 0 million pounds of recoverable v 2 o 5 and would be first and lowest cost to market a few words on our medical isotope initiative this is another area where we are able to deploy our unique facilities licenses and expertise to potentially help create a domestic supply chain for emerging cancer therapies recovering radioisotopes for use in cancer treatments from our existing process streams thereby recycling valuable material that would otherwise be lost to direct disposal would if successful be a great way to maximally use all of our feeds and we would be accomplishing this in a way that is environmentally beneficial and highly congruent with energy fuels recycling and sustainability goals we are also very pleased to announce that on january 25 2022 dr

december 31 2020 the net income in 2021 was primarily due to the sale of non core conventional uranium assets to cur the company spent 10 75 million for development of the company s properties primarily due to the development and ramping up of the re carbonate production program at the mill the company also incurred underutilized capacity production costs applicable to rare earth concentrates during the year of 0 53 million the underutilized capacity production costs are due to low throughput rates as the mill ramps up to commercial scale production at full capacity to date the mill has focused on producing commercially salable re carbonate at low throughput rates and has been very pleased with the resulting product it is shipping for separation the mill expects to increase its throughput rates as its supplies of monazite sands increase the company is in advanced discussions with several additional sources of monazite sands that if successfully secured we expect to result in sufficient throughput to reduce underutilized capacity production costs and allow the company to realize its expected margins on a continuous basis rare earth achievements in 2021 and to date in 2022 on march 1 2021 the company and neo performance materials limited neo announced a new rare earth production initiative spanning european and north american critical material supply chains under an agreement in principle signed on march 1 2021 and finalized into a definitive agreement in july 2022 energy fuels will process natural monazite sands currently being mined in the state of georgia by the chemours company into an re carbonate at the mill and ship a portion of the produced re carbonate to neo s rare earth separations facility in sillamäe estonia silmet silmet will then process the re carbonate into separated rare earth materials for use in rare earth permanent magnets and other rare earth based advanced materials on july 7 2021 the company announced that the first container approximately 20 tonnes of product of an expected 15 containers of mixed re carbonate had been successfully produced by energy fuels at the mill and was en route to silmet this commercial scale production of re carbonate by energy fuels from a u s mined rare earth resource positions energy fuels as the only company in north america that currently produces a monazite derived enhanced rare earth material the physical delivery of this product also represents the launch of a new environmentally responsible rare earth supply chain that allows for source validation and tracking from mining through to final end use applications for manufacturers in north america europe japan and other nations the company also announced on march 1 2021 that in addition to supplying re carbonate to neo energy fuels is evaluating the potential to develop u s separation capabilities at the mill or nearby as it works to increase its monazite sand supplies thereby fully integrating a u s rare earth supply chain in the coming years in addition to supplying re carbonate to european markets on april 27 2021 the company announced it had engaged carester to prepare a scoping study for the development of a solvent extraction ree separation circuit at the mill utilizing the mill s existing equipment and infrastructure to the extent applicable to create a continuous integrated and optimized rare earth production sequence based in lyon france carester is one of the world s leading global consultants on rare earth supply chains with expertise in designing constructing operating and optimizing ree production facilities globally carester s scoping work included an evaluation of the mill s current monazite leaching process preparation of an ree separation flow sheet capital and operating expense estimates incorporation of new technologies where applicable and recommendations on equipment vendors the company is planning to install a full separation circuit at its white mesa mill to produce both light and heavy separated ree oxides in the coming years subject to successful licensing financing and commissioning and continued strong market conditions the company has hired carester to perform a second scoping study to support these ree separation initiatives during q1 2022 the company began commercially separating la and ce from its re carbonate on a small scale using an existing solvent extraction circuit at the mill this represents the first commercial level ree separation to occur in the u s in many years the company has been performing laboratory scale ree separations for the last several months on a 24 7 basis successfully executing the la ce and ndpr separations at high purities and with excellent recoveries on december 15 2021 the company announced the execution of an mou with nsp for the development of a novel technology for the potential production of ree metals subject to the finalization of definitive agreements we believe this technology which was initially developed by nsp and will be advanced by the company and nsp working together has the potential to revolutionize the rare earth metal making industry by reducing costs of production reducing energy consumption and significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions producing ree metals and alloys is a key step in a fully integrated ree supply chain after production of separated ree oxides and before the manufacture of neodymium iron boron ndfeb magnets used in electric vehicles wind generation and other clean energy and advanced technologies in addition during 2022 the company announced the execution of a non binding memorandum of understanding mou for the supply of natural monazite sands from iperionx limited s iperionx s formerly known as hyperion metals limited titan project in tennessee if and when the project is developed and mined iperionx s titan project covers a large area of heavy mineral sands properties in tennessee prospective for titanium zircon monazite and other valuable minerals such as high grade silica sand and other refractory minerals in 2021 the company also announced that the u s department of energy doe office of fossil energy and national energy technology laboratory had exercised its option to award energy fuels working with a team from penn state university an additional 1 75 million to complete a feasibility study on the production of ree products from natural coal based resources as well as from other materials such as ree containing ores like the natural monazite sands the company is currently processing at the mill this award follows the doe providing energy fuels a 150 000 contract in 2020 for the successful completion of a conceptual design for the same initiative resulting in a total award to energy fuels of 1 9 million update on medical isotope initiative on july 28 2021 the company announced the execution of a strategic alliance agreement with radtran llc a technology development company focused on closing critical gaps in the procurement of medical isotopes for emerging tat cancer therapeutics and other applications under this strategic alliance the company is evaluating the feasibility of recovering th 232 and ra 226 from its existing re carbonate and uranium process streams at the mill and together with radtran is evaluating the feasibility of recovering ra 228 from the th 232 th 228 from the ra 228 and concentrating ra 226 at the mill using radtran technologies recovered ra 228 th 228 and ra 226 would then be sold to pharmaceutical companies and others to produce pb 212 ac 225 bi 213 ra 224 and ra 223 which are the leading medically attractive tat isotopes for the treatment of cancer existing supplies of these isotopes for tat applications are in short supply and methods of production are costly and currently cannot be scaled to meet the demand created as new drugs are developed and approved this is a major roadblock in the research and development of new tat drugs as pharmaceutical companies wait for scalable and affordable production technologies to become available under this initiative the company has the potential to recover valuable isotopes from its existing process streams therefore recycling back into the market material that would otherwise be lost to disposal for use in treating cancer establishment of san juan county clean energy foundation on september 16 2021 the company announced its establishment of the san juan county clean energy foundation a fund specifically designed to contribute to the communities surrounding the mill in southeastern utah the company made an initial deposit of 1 million into the foundation and anticipates providing ongoing annual funding equal to 1 of the mill s future revenues

city of blanding san juan county the white mesa ute community the navajo nation and other area communities sale of non core assets to consolidated uranium inc on october 27 2021 cur and the company jointly announced the closing of a transaction whereby cur acquired a portfolio of energy fuels non core conventional uranium projects located in utah and colorado including the daneros mine the tony m mine formerly a part of the henry mountains project the rim mine the sage plain project and several doe leases located in colorado in consideration for a 19 9 share ownership interest in cur as of the 2021 year end 19 1 and other consideration the company reported a gain on the value of this transaction of 35 7 million resulting in a significant improvement in the company s results of operations and net income for 2021 proposed u s uranium reserve on december 27 2020 congress passed the covid relief and omnibus spending bill which includes 75 million for the proposed establishment of a strategic u s uranium reserve the u s uranium reserve and was signed into law by the president then serving this key funding opens the door for the u s government to purchase domestically produced uranium to guard against potential commercial and national security risks presented by the country s near total reliance on foreign imports of uranium russia s recent invasion of ukraine has raised concerns about the united states reliance on imports of russian uranium and enrichment services which could provide further impetus for the u s government to bring this program into effect the company stands ready to benefit from this program through future production from its mines and facilities and potentially sales out of its existing uranium inventories however because the u s uranium reserve has yet to be established at this time the details of implementation of activities pursuant to the new law have not yet been defined as a result there can be no certainty as to the outcome of the u s uranium reserve including the process for and details of its development and any resulting support for the company s ongoing and planned activities or for any further evaluations of the working group appointment of new director on january 25 2022 the board appointed dr ivy estabrooke as a director of energy fuels bringing to the company experience in commercial stage biotech research and development program leadership and technology solutions for national security and public health challenges dr estabrooke is currently the vice president of operations and corporate affairs at idbydna inc a venture backed commercial stage biotech company she has led innovative research and development programs in both the public and private sectors delivering technology solutions for national security and public health challenges prior roles include as a technical program manager for the u s department of the navy the executive director of the state of utah s technology based economic development agency and science advisor to the governor of utah she earned her doctorate in neuroscience at georgetown university in 2005 received a master s degree in national resource strategy from the national defense university in 2013 and a bachelor s degree in biological sciences from smith college in 1998 dr estabrooke is also an engaged member in her local community serving on the board of the girl scouts of utah and as a member of the utah district export council operations update and outlook for 2022 overview the company continues to believe that uranium supply and demand fundamentals point to higher sustained uranium prices in the future in addition russia s recent invasion of ukraine and the recent entry into the uranium market by financial entities purchasing uranium on the spot market to hold for the long term has the potential to result in higher sustained spot and term prices and perhaps induce utilities to enter into more long term contracts with non russian producers like energy fuels to ensure security of supply and more certain pricing however the company has not yet entered into sufficient long term supply agreements to justify commencing uranium production at the company s mines and in situ recovery isr facilities as a result the company expects to maintain uranium recovery at reduced levels until such time when sustained increased market strength is observed additional suitable term sales contracts can be procured or the u s government buys uranium from the company following the establishment of the proposed u s uranium reserve the company also holds significant uranium inventories and is evaluating selling all or a portion of these inventories on the spot market in response to future upside price volatility or for delivery into contracts the company will also continue to seek new sources of revenue including through its emerging ree business as well as new sources of other uranium bearing materials not derived from conventional material and sourced by third parties alternate feed materials and new fee processing opportunities at the white mesa mill that can be processed under existing market conditions i e without reliance on current uranium sales prices the company is also seeking new sources of natural monazite sands for its emerging ree business is evaluating the potential to recover radioisotopes for use in the development of tat medical isotopes for the treatment of cancer and continues its support of u s governmental activities to assist the u s uranium mining industry including the proposed establishment of the u s uranium reserve extraction and recovery activities overview during the year ended december 31 2021 the company did not package any significant quantities of its final uranium product u 3 o 8 at any of its facilities at the mill the company focused on ramping up its mixed re carbonate production and produced approximately 120 tonnes of mixed re carbonate during 2021 the company recovered small quantities of uranium at the mill during 2021 but such uranium was retained in circuit and was not packaged in 2021 the company also continued to maintain its nichols ranch and alta mesa isr facilities on standby during 2022 the company plans to recover 100 000 to 120 000 pounds of uranium at the mill the company does not plan to extract and or recover any amounts of uranium of any significance from its nichols ranch project in 2022 which was placed on standby in the second quarter of 2020 due to the depletion of its seven constructed wellfields in addition the company expects to keep the alta mesa project and its conventional mining properties on standby during 2022 during 2022 the company expects to recover approximately 650 to 1 000 tonnes of mixed re carbonate containing approximately 300 to 450 tonnes of treo at the mill subject to the receipt of sufficient quantities of natural monazite ore no vanadium production is currently planned during 2022 though the company is currently evaluating potential vanadium production in light of recent market improvements in vanadium pricing isr activities the company expects to produce insignificant quantities of u 3 o 8 in the year ending december 31 2022 from nichols ranch until such time when market conditions improve sufficiently suitable term sales contracts can be procured or the proposed u s uranium reserve is established the company expects to maintain the nichols ranch project on standby and defer development of further wellfields and header houses the company expects to continue to keep the alta mesa project on standby until such time that market conditions improve sufficiently suitable term sales contracts can be procured or the proposed u s uranium reserve is established conventional activities conventional extraction and recovery activities during the year ended december 31 2021 the mill did not package any material quantities of u 3 o 8 focusing instead on developing its ree recovery business during the year ended december 31 2021 the mill produced approximately 270 tonnes of re carbonate containing approximately 120 tonnes of treo the mill recovered small quantities of uranium in 2021 which were retained in circuit during 2022 the company expects to recover 100 000 to 120 000 pounds of uranium at the mill the company expects to recover approximately 650 to 1 000 tonnes of mixed re carbonate containing approximately 300 to 450 tonnes of treo at the mill subject to the receipt of sufficient quantities of natural monazite ore the company is in advanced discussions with several sources of natural monazite sands including the company s existing supplier to secure additional supplies of monazite sands which if successful would be expected to allow the company to increase re carbonate production in addition to its 691 000 pounds of finished uranium inventories currently located at a north american conversion facility and at the mill the company has approximately 355 000 pounds of u 3 o 8 contained in stockpiled alternate feed material and mineralized material inventory at the mill that can be recovered relatively quickly in the future as general market conditions may warrant totaling about 1 046 000 pounds of u 3 o 8 of total uranium inventory in addition there remains an estimated 1 0 to 3 0 million pounds of solubilized recoverable v 2 o 5 inventory remaining in tailings solutions awaiting future recovery as market conditions may warrant conventional standby permitting and evaluation activities during the year ended december 31 2021 standby and environmental compliance activities continued at the company s fully permitted and substantially developed pinyon plain project the company is selectively advancing certain permits at its other major conventional uranium projects such as the roca honda project which is a large high grade conventional project in new mexico the company is also continuing to maintain required permits at its conventional projects including the sheep mountain project la sal complex and whirlwind project in addition the company will continue to evaluate the bullfrog project all of these projects serve as important pipeline assets for the company s future conventional production capabilities as market conditions may warrant uranium sales during the year ended december 31 2021 the company elected not to complete any sales of uranium however the company is now actively engaged in pursuing selective long term uranium sales contracts with suitable quantities pricing and other terms vanadium sales during the year ended december 31 2021 the company sold 5 000 pounds of ferrovanadium fev for an average weighted price of 14 74 per pound the company expects to sell the remaining finished vanadium product when justified into the metallurgical industry as well as other markets that demand a higher purity product including the aerospace chemical and potentially the vanadium battery industries rare earth sales the company commenced its ramp up to commercial production of a mixed re carbonate in march 2021 and has shipped all of its re carbonate produced to date to silmet where it is currently being fed into their separation process all re carbonate produced at the mill in 2022 is expected to be sold to neo for separation at silmet until such time as the company expects to permit and construct its own separation circuits at the mill production in future years is expected to be sold to neo for separation at silmet and potentially to other ree separation facilities outside the u s to the extent not sold the company expects to stockpile mixed re carbonate at the mill for future separation and other downstream ree processing at the mill or elsewhere as the company continues to ramp up its mixed re carbonate production and additional funds are spent on process enhancements improving recoveries product quality and other optimization profits from this initiative are expected to be minimal until such time when monazite throughput rates are increased and optimized however even at the current throughput rates the company is recovering most of its direct costs of this growing initiative with the other costs associated with ramping up production process enhancements and evaluating future separation capabilities at the mill being expensed as development expenditures throughout this process the company is gaining important knowledge experience and technical information all of which will be valuable for current and future mixed re carbonate production and expected future production of separated ree oxides and other advanced ree materials at the mill about energy fuels energy fuels is a leading u s based uranium mining company supplying u 3 o 8 to major nuclear

washington afp us central bankers on wednesday are poised to take the first step to raise borrowing costs in a bid to cap rising inflation before it surges out of control advertising read more the federal reserve will have to walk a tightrope to ensure its efforts don t derail the recovery from the covid 19 pandemic as russia s invasion of ukraine introduces new uncertainty in an economy battered by supply chain snarls and labor shortages there is no good answer to that in any economics textbook david wilcox a former senior fed advisor told afp stressing that communication from the central bank about its willingness to act will be key in pulling off its balancing act the central bank s federal open market committee is due to announce its rate decision at 1800 gmt when its two day meeting concludes fed chair jerome powell has said he favors increasing the benchmark interest rate by 0 25 percentage points from zero where it has been since march 2020 it would be the first in a series of hikes which would pull back on the stimulus rushed into place at the start of the covid 19 pandemic the fed chief has expressed confidence that inflation will retreat in the coming months as supply chain issues and shortages are resolved in the world s largest economy but china s latest lockdowns of several cities affecting tens of millions of people and closing off a key supplier to american tech giant apple shows the pandemic and its disruptions are not over policymakers are better equipped to handle inflation that is too high rather than too low as was the case in the decade following the 2008 global financial crisis during which inflation and employment were slow to recover us federal reserve benchmark interest rate afp however with the annual consumer price index growing 7 9 percent in february its fastest pace in four decades the central bank faces intense criticism that it missed the inflation danger and has moved too slowly in response to rising prices for cars housing and food and the war in ukraine together with western sanctions on russia have sent oil prices surging although they retreated tuesday closing below 100 a barrel for the first time in three weeks raising rates a must the federal reserve s delays in raising interest rates and its continued misreading of inflation monetary and fiscal policies are now complicated by the negative supply shock imposed by russia s invasion of ukraine said mickey levy of berenberg capital markets even without the surge in oil and commodity prices the fed is wrong on every count levy wrote in a column in the wall street journal saying the central bank must begin to raise rates us inflation eléonore hughes afp but wilcox now with the peterson institute for international economics and bloomberg economics defended the fed s performance saying officials have adjusted to changing circumstances i think the allegation that the fed is behind the curve is considerably over done he said they have been caught by surprise as the vast majority of prognosticators were but they ve had the guts and the courage to change their mind publicly economists project six or seven rate increases this year which would still leave the policy rate below two percent assuming central bankers raise it in quarter point steps however powell and other policymakers have stressed that they will do whatever is needed to tamp down inflation after it begins ratcheting up borrowing costs the fed is next expected to begin offloading its massive stockpile of assets purchased to provide liquidity to the economy during the pandemic a process expected to start in the summer and proceed gradually to avoid roiling financial markets the most important thing for the fed to communicate in an environment of enormous uncertainty is to make clear how it will respond wilcox said 2022 afp

ph d co founder president and chief scientific officer of regeneron and a winner of the 1976 science talent search having been a winner of the sts back in 1976 i can say from first hand experience that this is only the beginning of a great path forward for our winners finalists and scholars never stop being curious never stop exploring and never stop looking for answers other top honors from the competition include fourth place daniel larsen 18 of bloomington ind received a 100 000 award for answering an important math question about the abundance of carmichael numbers which resemble prime numbers even though they are not true primes he showed that for any sufficiently large number there is always a carmichael number hidden between it and its double daniel hopes his work will lead to a better understanding of these intriguing pseudoprimes prime numbers are crucial for cryptography which uses large primes to help keep communications secure fifth place neil chowdhury 18 of bellevue wash received a 90 000 award for creating a computer model to study the role of a histone protein implicated in colon cancer and found that the histone caused changes to two key processes regulating the way dna folds itself to fit into the nucleus of cells his simulations of polymers using data from a colon cancer cell line accurately reproduced recent experimental results and showed that the histone modification caused changes in the dna s physical formation specifically compartmentalization and loop extrusion sixth place aseel rawashdeh 17 austin texas received a 80 000 award for developing an inexpensive way to kill the larvae of mosquitos that spread viral illnesses by incorporating an essential oil such as cinnamon garlic or orange into baker s yeast microcapsules she made a cost effective bait that kills the larvae of mosquitos that spread malaria equally important in early tests her larvicide s encapsulated oils appear to be harmless to nearby algae and non targeted insect larvae seventh place pravalika gayatri putalapattu 17 of centreville va received a 70 000 award for designing a video assisted workflow recognition program to monitor laparoscopic gall bladder surgeries in real time verify the surgeons actions and flag errors so immediate corrective action can be taken her work was inspired after a close cousin died from a preventable surgical mistake by a tired overworked underpaid surgeon in india her new system is five times faster than similar systems used currently eighth place neil rathi 17 of palo alto calif received a 60 000 award for identifying common linguistic patterns in four languages that support the theory that human language evolved for greater efficiency in communication using a machine learning model neil studied how our minds optimize language by fusing multiple informational elements into the smallest meaningful unit of a word such as ed in talked which conveys both past tense and word completion and he found patterns of informational fusion in all four languages ninth place amara orth 18 of glenwood iowa received a 50 000 award for eavesdropping on her family s honeybees so she could identify the changes in vibroacoustic patterns in each hive she measured the sounds and vibrations from bees in 25 hives and developed an ai model to analyze the colony s health with an accuracy of 92 if the data is gathered and decoded in time her system may give beekeepers time to prevent colony collapse tenth place luke robitaille 18 of euless texas received a 40 000 award for using the mathematical concept of topological entropy to study simple braids a formal way to describe the complicated patterns that arise from intertwining multiple lengths of string luke proved that most simple braids are orderly for low numbers of strands but as the number of strands grows large nearly all simple braids are chaotic his work could help researchers better understand the chaotic mixing of fluids hailee han byur youn 17 of roslyn n y was named the seaborg award winner and given the opportunity to speak on behalf of the regeneron science talent search class of 2022 the 40 finalists chose hailee as the student who

audience in more than 10 countries including new zealand the usa britain japan thailand and vietnam etc it was very well received more than 100 thousands of people has joined this live broadcast the interview was mainly related to the products and trading the unique profit plus system from bitvito hayden clarified the beginnings of the profit plus system including its original purpose its design elements and some of user feedback firstly hayden did an introducation on bitvito bitvito is newly created crypto exchange from a group of internet and finance veterans which is headquartered in new zealand and has registered with top tier countries and jurisdictions it provides trading services like fiat currencies crypto spot futures and cfds users only need to hold one base currency so they can easily trade global assets whether it is in traditional finance or in crypto space bitvito currently provides services in three languages english chinese and thai and in response to the call of the global fans bitvitowill launch more languages soon including vietnamese and japanese to help serve the global users bitvito has six product features 1 usdt m and coin m swaps that work together plus cross and isolated margin that work concurrently 2 multiple mechanisms for take profit and stop loss long short switch and close all trades 3 1 million per sec matching speed including no upper limit for high performance 4 bitvito are a part of a new era of zero funding rate to reduce transaction costs 5 billion of reserve fund the lifeline of safety and stability 6 unique vip profit plus system continuous profit plus profit for the users recently many users on bitvito share images of their profits they often use profit plus system and bonus ratio they appear to be making good profits so what exactly is the profit plus system to provide ultimate trading experience to more users bitvito has offered a billion usdt or tether coin for bonuses namely the profit plus system in short the profit plus system has two dimensions the total net deposit and the total trading volume when these two values reach a certain number users will receive a corresponding percentage of bonuses based on the profit of each transaction order bitvito sets a very low access threshold with a total net deposit of 100usdt so that more users can enjoy the benefits of the profit plus system the vip system can be seen below the profit comparison table shows that bitvito has a higher percentage than other exchanges the original purpose of this profit plus system is that the production team of bitvito comes from top internet companies and traditional finance with rich experience and they want to create a product that is extremely user friendly and allows users to maximize the utilization of funds for biggest return to maximize users return is to maximize their profits more often than not most platforms only occasionally provide such profits by promotions for a certain of period instead of long term activities so to productize this strong demand into a long term system is one of bitvito s promises to their users driven by this strong vision the profit plus system was born the team encountered many problems when designing the system such as the access threshold usually exchanges are friendly to big money users but not small money users however most beginners start with small investments and they want to try little by little bitvito wanted to include these users in the profit plus system and let them share the benefits too so bitvito lowered the threshold to a very low level bitvito offers 100usdt deposits as threshold so the users can enjoy the benefits of the profit plus system and stay isolated from some of the risk beginners face when starting out to take beginner traders and investors into full consideration bitvito had the system divided users into 9 vip levels with different profit bonus rates based on total net deposit ranging from 100usdt to 5 million usdt of course these the it experts have set strict risk control measures to ensure the long term development of the platform and ensure that more users enjoy benefits of the profit plus system in the longer term the feedback from users so far about the profit plus system have shown great support and love bitvito have done a return visit to a large number of users who had made great profits and their feedback was that it is the first time they could see clear profit calculation on the order page bitvito has received screenshots of their trading profits and wonderful messages sharing their joys although their assets vary they all have enjoyed the benefit of the profit plus system from the very low entry threshold satisfied users are the best advocates and obviously they are more than happy to recommend more friends to trade with bitvito bitvito is tailored for users and spares no effort to provide a friendly experience so what other user friendly features are there on the platform bitvito has launched an era of zero funding rate and reduced transaction costs while increasing the capital utilization rate for the users the whole team wants to give the best to all the users at present most exchanges around the world have funding rates being a user friendly platform also includes lowering user costs lower costs mean higher returns no funding fees allows users to hold multiple contracts for longer periods similar to spot trading apart from no funding fees hayden shared some other advantages of the platform in addition to the advantages that maximizes the users benefits like the super high capital utilization rate and extremely low fees bitvito has also included other advantages that optimizes the user experience for example to support high leverage deep and wide liquidity low slippage and no loss from liquidation support hedging mode allowing users to trade both long and short bitvito stands out in security with eight key advantages technology strength and financial strength integration security stability and overall service up to a billion of reserve fund bitvito are audited by external institutions for compliance bitvito have very high level security protection mechanisms cold and hot wallets separate storage solutions 24 7 expert security monitoring all round protection of user assets then hayden and professor v discussed the problems with crypto exchanges people frequently see in the following frequent technical problems high access thresholds high funding rates high transaction fees limited investment portfolios available drastic fluctuations and internet disconnections very little crossover with classic products in the traditional financial industry such as stocks crude oil precious metals etc they carried on discussing what makes bitvito different and why clients should choose to trade on bitvito hayden disclosed that bitvito has six key features with which bitvito will try to achieve the mission of changing the world with blockchain apart from profit and security other four features are below in terms of tech bitvito s technical team avoids the common practices of traditional exchanges and rather adopts the architectural approaches of first tier internet companies these technologies have gone through numerous iterations over nearly 30 years of handling hundreds of millions of users in the internet world in terms of cost bitvito allows more users to own crypto assets at a lower cost bitvito pioneers an era of 0 funding fee allowing users to hold perpetual contracts for a long time like spot meanwhile low transaction fees also greatly reduce users costs which is very beneficial for short term traders the low cost itself is a high return in terms of experience bitvito features a lightning fast engine with latency of less than 1 millisecond and support for ultra high frequency transactions thanks to the underlying architecture from first tier internet companies bitvito users will experience the smoothness just as using usual internet products in terms of compliance bitvito comes from new zealand which has a first tier financial regulatory system and holds licenses that have high fund requirement and are hard to obtain in the crypto market however bitvito doesn t stop there bitvito has applied for financial licenses in the u s canada and australia as part of its globalization process in the end hayden talked about the next step for bitvito in terms of product and ecology bitvito responds to diversified market demands with a rich product matrix fully integrates technology products and ecology this lowers the threshold for blockchain use promotes industry development and empowers more industry ecological partners to achieve a win win situation bitvito will launch multi national fiat currencies contract spot games nfts daos and other projects this will allow users to trade global assets including traditional financial and crypto assets with just one currency the

us federal reserve chair jerome powell is confident the central bank can contain rising inflation pressures with interest rate increases copyright getty images north america afp joe raedle heather scott us central bankers on wednesday are poised to take the first step to raise borrowing costs in a bid to cap rising inflation before it surges out of control the federal reserve will have to walk a tightrope to ensure its efforts don t derail the recovery from the covid 19 pandemic as russia s invasion of ukraine introduces new uncertainty in an economy battered by supply chain snarls and labor shortages there is no good answer to that in any economics textbook david wilcox a former senior fed advisor told afp stressing that communication from the central bank about its willingness to act will be key in pulling off its balancing act the central bank s federal open market committee is due to announce its rate decision at 1800 gmt when its two day meeting concludes fed chair jerome powell has said he favors increasing the benchmark interest rate by 0 25 percentage points from zero where it has been since march 2020 it would be the first in a series of hikes which would pull back on the stimulus rushed into place at the start of the covid 19 pandemic the fed chief has expressed confidence that inflation will retreat in the coming months as supply chain issues and shortages are resolved in the world s largest economy but china s latest lockdowns of several cities affecting tens of millions of people and closing off a key supplier to american tech giant apple shows the pandemic and its disruptions are not over policymakers are better equipped to handle inflation that is too high rather than too low as was the case in the decade following the 2008 global financial crisis during which inflation and employment were slow to recover however with the annual consumer price index growing 7 9 percent in february its fastest pace in four decades the central bank faces intense criticism that it missed the inflation danger and has moved too slowly in response to rising prices for cars housing and food and the war in ukraine together with western sanctions on russia have sent oil prices surging although they retreated tuesday closing below 100 a barrel for the first time in three weeks raising rates a must the federal reserve s delays in raising interest rates and its continued misreading of inflation monetary and fiscal policies are now complicated by the negative supply shock imposed by russia s invasion of ukraine said mickey levy of berenberg capital markets even without the surge in oil and commodity prices the fed is wrong on every count levy wrote in a column in the wall street journal saying the central bank must begin to raise rates but wilcox now with the peterson institute for international economics and bloomberg economics defended the fed s performance saying officials have adjusted to changing circumstances i think the allegation that the fed is behind the curve is considerably over done he said they have been caught by surprise as the vast majority of prognosticators were but they ve had the guts and the courage to change their mind publicly economists project six or seven rate increases this year which would still leave the policy rate below two percent assuming central bankers raise it in quarter point steps however powell and other policymakers have stressed that they will do whatever is needed to tamp down inflation after it begins ratcheting up borrowing costs the fed is next expected to begin offloading its massive stockpile of assets purchased to provide liquidity to the economy during the pandemic a process expected to start in the summer and proceed gradually to avoid roiling financial markets the most important thing for the fed to communicate in an environment of enormous uncertainty is to make clear how it will respond wilcox said
