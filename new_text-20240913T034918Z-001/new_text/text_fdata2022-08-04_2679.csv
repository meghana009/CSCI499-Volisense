missoula housing officials added details wednesday to the recent study conducted on short term rentals in missoula and further explained the rationale behind their recommendations that city council increase the registration fee but refrain from placing a moratorium on the practice doing the latter could prompt the montana legislature to change state law early next year in a bid to protect private property rights doing so would make it harder for the city to monitor short term rentals and make future regulatory changes officials said for now the city s housing officials have recommended an increase to the registration fee and updating the city s registration form so that it captures more real time data on the short term rental market that will help us collect more information from operators to really have that qualitative data on what s happening on the ground said emily harris shears the city s housing policy specialist it might be something we can learn with more information from operators the report compiled by granicus software found 445 unique short term rental listings with 110 registered with the city the disparity doesn t mean the other listings are out of compliance with city ordinance but rather that they re owner occupied most of the year rikki henderson the city s housing program manager said around 61 of the current listings are single family units and 95 rent the entire unit most listings are one and two bedroom units that list for the average price of 150 a night housing officials believe many property owners use the revenue as supplemental income they also said that while the study was conducted in april a more recent look suggested the number of listings have remained consistent we have a relatively small number of listings per 100 000 households she henderson we re a bit higher than billings but significantly lower than resort style communities gathering more information could go far in answering additional questions housing officials said including who is renting the units and why currently the city s housing experts said short term rentals are used by local residents not just tourists they re people between rentals people displaced from a long term rental folks who had damage to their house who lived in a short term rental while awaiting repairs said henderson we heard from folks that members of our refugee community are utilizing these as they wait for long term housing there s a lot of nuances it s why we proposed more active monitoring of these units despite the data some community members have called for an outright ban on short term rentals suggesting they have a negative impact on the city s stock of available housing the granicus study suggested that just 1 5 of the city s housing was being used as a short term rental city officials also suggested that a moratorium might be illegal under both state and federal law other cities have tried but have been overturned in court montana s state constitution has inalienable rights which include acquiring possessing and protecting property there s also the equal protection clause under the u s constitution and there are powers denied to local governments which include any power affecting any private or civil relationship said council member gwen jones we can t regulate in that form or fashion it s been a common refrain but we can t really go there taking a harder tact at this point in time could also draw push back from the legislature when it convenes in january said harris shears we re mindful about measures that would potentially inspire intervention she said we re thinking about a new session and want to be thoughtful about measures that we might implement or propose that could potentially inspire intervention by the legislature that might challenge our ability to implement our current approach or any potential future recommendations
by li yang china daily updated 2022 08 04 07 26 us house speaker nancy pelosi in her statement ahead of her trip to asia on friday us house speaker nancy pelosi claimed that an important purpose of her visits to singapore malaysia the republic of korea and japan is to advance common interests and values of these countries and the united states notably she also mentioned that she was briefed by the indo pacific command of the us military when her plane stopped in hawaii for refueling that clearly shows her tour is a business trip however it has been motivated more by personal reasons on the one hand pelosi needs to repay her sponsors in asia having led democrats in the house of representatives for about 20 years pelosi is well connected and strong at fundraising especially with the taiwan lobby the hoopla her tour has generated is a reward for the secession desiring donors who have supported her for years on the other hand by making her tour pelosi intends to divert domestic public attention from her family and party as the midterm election showdown is approaching polls are showing the democratic party has no advantage over the gop more important it diverts attention from a scandal even closer to home as pelosi s husband has been caught drunken driving and is embroiled in the impropriety of a multimillion dollar stock purchase before a vote on a chip bill so any noble purpose purported for her four country tour of asia is nothing but hogwash even the us military expressed its unhappiness before she left yet an entire aircraft carrier strike group has been mobilized to escort her on her sojourn in asia what pelosi can do to advance the common interests and values between the us and the four asian countries she is visiting for a few hours each is actually quite limited even the joe biden administration has not been able to convince the rok singapore and malaysia to wholeheartedly join its indo pacific gang targeting china and everyone knows japan s participation is more out of its own agenda to seek its own rise on the wings of the us selfishly and needlessly pelosi has escalated the tensions in the region and caused substantial harm to sino us relations any pride she may take from simply crying the wolf is coming pales to insignificance beside the shame she has brought the us by exposing how the tail can wag the dog

after 13 years at least three crashes dozens of scams and ponzi schemes and hundreds of billions of dollars made and evaporated cryptocurrencies finally have the full attention of congress whose lawmakers and lobbyists have papered capitol hill with proposals on how to regulate the industry the latest bipartisan proposal came wednesday from sen debbie stabenow d michigan and top republican member sen john boozman of arkansas which would hand the regulatory authority of bitcoin and ether to the commodities futures trading commission that would be in contrast with bills proposed by other members of congress and consumer advocates who have suggested giving the authority to the securities and exchange commission related what is cryptocurrency this year crypto investors have seen prices plunge and companies crater with fortunes and jobs disappearing overnight and some firms have been accused by federal regulators of running an illegal securities exchange bitcoin the largest digital asset trades at a fraction of its all time high down from more than 68 000 in november 2021 to about 23 000 on wednesday wrapped bitcoin logo displayed on a phone screen and representation of bitcoin are seen in this illustration photo taken in krakow poland on june 10 2022 jakub porzycki nurphoto via getty images while cryptocurrencies have had crashes before most recently in 2018 this crash has been broader and more systemic a major hedge fund filed for bankruptcy earlier this summer which in turn has caused other cryptocurrency brokers to collapse as well some crypto brokers have falsely claimed that its customers deposits are backed by deposit insurance like a bank lawmakers who have run out of patience with the cryptocurrency industry s attempts to live out an unregulated libertarian bank free world are now desperate to implement stringent oversight the industry spent 9 million in 2021 on lobbying fees according to a report by public citizen a figure that is certain to be higher with all the congressional proposals this year related cryptocurrency prices collapse wiping out billions of dollars the stabenow boozman bill would be a win for the cryptocurrency industry who see the cftc as more industry friendly regulator than the sec the cftc which a budget last year of 304 million with roughly 666 employees is a fraction of the size of the sec which had a budget of nearly 2 billion and 4 500 full time employees the cryptocurrency industry is trying to get anyone other than the sec to regulate them said cory klippsten ceo of swan bitcoin while an advocate for bitcoin klippsten is deeply skeptical of much of broader crypto industry which has produced a myriad of tokens and other coins that he considers to be nothing more than scams in a press conference stabenow and boozman both acknowledged that the while they have faith that the cftc is up to the task of regulating cryptocurrencies the agency would need support the bill attempts to alleviate this issue by imposing on the crypto industry user fees which in turn would fund more robust supervision of the industry by the cftc related bitcoin tumbles a stablecoin plunges in wild week in crypto obviously if the ctfc is to move aggressively in this area they are going to need more resources stabenow said the legislation can be added to the list of proposals that have come out of congress this year sens cory booker d n j and john thune r s d are also co sponsors of the stabenow boozman bill booker has publicly advocated for the cryptocurrency industry particularly because black americans and other racial minorities are more statistically likely to invest in crypto compared to traditional investments like stocks and bonds sen pat toomey r pa in april introduced legislation called the stablecoin trust act that would create a framework to regulate stablecoins which have seen massive losses this year stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency pegged to a specific value usually the u s dollar another currency or gold additionally in june sens kirsten gillibrand d n y and cynthia lummis r wyo proposed a wide ranging bill called the responsible financial innovation act related scammers steal 1 2m in cryptocurrency from bloomfield township man that bill proposed legal definitions of digital assets and virtual currencies would require the irs to adopt guidance on merchant acceptance of digital assets and charitable contributions and would make a distinction between digital assets that are commodities and those that are securities which has not been done along with the toomey legislation and the lummis gillibrand legislation a proposal is being worked out in the house financial services committee though those negotiations have stalled committee chair maxine waters d calif said last month that while she top republican member patrick mchenry of north carolina and treasury secretary janet yellen had made considerable progress toward an agreement on the legislation we are unfortunately not there yet and will therefore continue our negotiations over the august recess president joe biden s working group on financial markets last november issued a report calling on congress to pass legislation that would regulate stablecoins and biden earlier this year issued an executive order calling on a variety of agencies to look at ways to regulate digital assets
washington legislative republicans were taking stock wednesday of their less than dazzling performance in the initial returns of the august primary in most of the key swing districts incumbent democrats were polling above 50 percent and in some cases their republican challengers were trailing by as much as 10 points those weren t the results republicans or for that matter many democrats expected heading into tuesday s primary for months republican legislative leaders had been bullish about their ability to pick up seats and possibly even the majority in one or both chambers this year in july after a round of positive polling the republican state leadership committee a national group that helps elect gop candidates to state legislatures added washington to its opportunities to flip chambers list leading up to the primary republican backed independent expenditure campaigns poured money into key legislative districts negative ads hammered democratic candidates on issues like rising crime inflation and sky high gas prices the spending wasn t contained to just key swing districts for instance public disclosure commission records show 233 000 was spent against incumbent democrat manka dhingra in kirkland s 45th district which used to be a swing district but is now considered reliably democratic but instead of badly bruising democrats in advance of the general election the unusual blast of early spending and ads didn t appear to have the intended effect their attacks went nowhere said adam bartz the executive director of the washington senate democratic campaign people are solidly embracing democratic leadership of the legislature dhingra for instance had 66 percent of the vote in her race on tuesday night one of the most closely watched primary races was the 26th district state senate contest on the kitsap peninsula there first term democrat emily randall has been viewed as highly vulnerable but on tuesday evening she was polling at 53 percent compared to her closest republican challenger state rep jesse young who had 43 percent another republican in the race david crissman earned 4 percent of the initial count feeling so much joy gratitude this morning randall tweeted wednesday noting her support for reproductive rights the u s supreme court s recent overturning of roe v wade may have bolstered the electoral fortunes of democrats in recent weeks certainly in the wake of that ruling many democrats made access to abortion a front and center issue in their campaigns for republicans the early primary results served as a buzzkill to what they thought was their best chance in years at fundamentally altering the political makeup of the washington legislature but on wednesday they also emphasized that later arriving ballots might favor republican candidates and tighten up some of the races disappointed with the initial results naturally but i think it s too early to draw any real conclusions until we get more of the votes counted said senate republican leader john braun in a text message wednesday house republican leader j t wilcox conceded that his hope to have 10 to 12 seats in play was no longer viable i think we still have an opportunity for some reasonable gains but certainly not what i thought at one time was the best case wilcox said currently democrats enjoy a 57 to 41 advantage in the house and a 28 to 21 majority in the senate to win the house republicans would have to net nine additional seats to take back the senate would require a net gain of four seats other closely watched legislative races included federal way s 30th district kent s 47th district and island county s 10th district in all of those races the democratic candidates were racking up more votes than the republicans in the early count the most competitive legislative races appeared to be in whatcom county s 42nd district where republicans are trying to hold onto a state senate seat and democrats are seeking to retain two house seats in those races the combined vote totals for the democratic candidates were falling short of 50 percent after the first ballot count so far more than a million ballots have been counted likely representing half or more of the total ballots that will ultimately be cast in the primary

the second quarter of 2022 was higher by 6 12 011 ounces compared to the second quarter of 2021 mainly due to record quarterly mill throughput achieved at the fekola mine in the second quarter of 2022 in addition processed grade was higher at the otjikoto mine in the second quarter of 2022 due to significant waste stripping operations at both the wolfshag and otjikoto pits in the first half of 2021

2021 and consolidated cash operating costs were higher in the first half of 2022 compared to 615 per ounce produced 606 per ounce sold in the first half of 2021 mainly as a result of higher costs for

budget by 205 per ounce sold 16 these favourable budget variances were attributable to lower than budgeted cash operating costs higher than budgeted realized gains on the settlement of fuel derivatives and lower sustaining capital expenditures the lower sustaining capital expenditures are mainly a result of timing of expenditures and are expected to be incurred later in 2022 for full year 2022 b2gold remains well positioned for continued strong operational and financial performance and remains on track to achieve its total gold production guidance of between 990 000 and 1 050 000 ounces including 40 000 and 50 000 attributable ounces projected from calibre due to the timing of high grade ore mining consolidated gold production from the company s three operating mines is expected to increase significantly in the second half of 2022 to between 560 000 and 590 000 ounces consolidated cash operating costs for the first half of 2022 were below the first half guidance range of between 760 and 800 per ounce based mainly on the weighting of production and timing of stripping consolidated cash operating costs are still expected to significantly improve compared to the first half of 2022 after factoring in current fuel price increases at all sites consolidated cash operating costs for the second half of 2022 are now expected to be between 550 and 590 per ounce original second half guidance was between 490 to 530 per ounce in addition consolidated aisc for the first half of 2022 were significantly below the guidance range of between 1 250 and 1 290 per ounce after factoring in current fuel price increases at all sites and the timing of remaining capital expenditures consolidated aisc for the second half of 2022 are now expected to be between 960 and 1 000 per ounce original second half guidance range was between 820 to 860 per ounce overall and after factoring in the positive operating results in the first half of 2022 the company s total consolidated costs guidance ranges for full year 2022 remain unchanged for full year 2022 total consolidated cash operating costs are forecast to be at the upper end of the company s guidance range of between 620 and 660 per ounce and total consolidated aisc are forecast to be within the company s original guidance range of between 1 010 and 1 050 per ounce as previously disclosed the company s operations continue to be impacted by global cost inflation with fuel costs reflecting the most significant increases however despite these ongoing cost pressures the draw downs of existing inventories proactive management and the revised sequencing of some capital costs means that consolidated cash operating costs and aisc in the first half of 2022 were lower than budget and for full year 2022 the company expects to be at the upper end of its original total consolidated cash operating cost guidance range and within its original total consolidated aisc guidance range the company will continue to closely monitor the levels of cost inflation over the remainder of 2022 b2gold s projects and operations continue to target long term cash flow and value at industry leading costs per ounce of gold produced second quarter and first half of 2022 financial results for the second quarter of 2022 consolidated gold revenue was 382 million on sales of 205 300 ounces at an average realized gold price of 1 861 per ounce compared to 363 million on sales of 200 071 ounces at an average realized gold price of 1 814 per ounce in the second quarter of 2021 the increase in gold revenue of 5 19 million was attributable to a 2 5 increase in the average realized gold price and a 2 5 increase in gold ounces sold for the second quarter of 2022 cash flow provided by operating activities was 125 million compared to cash flow used by operating activities of 8 million in the second quarter of 2021 the significant increase of 133 million was mainly due to lower working capital outflows in the second quarter of 2022 most significantly for current income taxes with cash taxes paid in the second quarter of 2022 being 138 million lower than the second quarter of 2021 higher gold revenues of 19 million higher realized gains on fuel contracts of 9 million partially offset by higher production costs of 26 million cash income and withholding tax payments in the second quarter of 2022 totaled 39 million q2 2021 177 million in the second quarter of 2021 income tax payments were significantly higher as a result of tax installments to settle the final 2020 tax liability of 138 million including payment of the final 2020 priority dividend of 47 million due to the state of mali after a record earnings year in 2020 based on current assumptions including a realized gold price of 1 700 per ounce in the second half of 2022 the company now expects to generate consolidated cashflows from operating activities of approximately 575 million for full year 2022 previous guidance at q1 2022 was 625 million assuming an 1 800 per ounce gold price for full year 2022 expected to be significantly weighted to the second half of 2022 the benefit of higher gold prices realized in the first half of 2022 is expected to be offset by the impacts of lower gold prices in the second half of 2022 as well as cost inflation and delays in the recovery of value added tax receivables in addition based on current assumptions the company is forecasting to make total cash income and withholding tax payments including priority dividend payments for full year 2022 of approximately 280 million net income for the

performance through the second quarter of 2022 producing 123 066 ounces of gold in line with budget in the second quarter of 2022 fekola s processing facilities achieved record quarterly throughput of 2 42 million tonnes 8 above budget and 6 higher than the second quarter of 2021 due to favourable ore characteristics and continuous optimization of the grinding circuit the higher than budgeted mill throughput in the second quarter of 2022 was mainly offset by lower than budgeted mill feed grade 6 as fekola s low grade stockpiles were used to provide additional unbudgeted mill feed required as a result of the higher than budgeted processed tonnes gold production in the second quarter of 2022 was higher by 8 9 455 ounces compared to the second quarter of 2021 mainly due to higher mill throughput fekola s gold production is expected to be significantly weighted to the second half of 2022 when mining reaches the higher grade portion of phase 6 of the fekola pit for the second quarter of 2022 mill feed grade was 1 71 grams per tonne g t compared to budget of 1 81 g t and 1 65 g t in the second quarter of 2021 mill throughput was 2 42 million tonnes compared to budget of 2 24 million tonnes and 2 29 million tonnes in the second quarter of 2021 and gold recovery averaged 92 4 compared to budget of 94 4 and 93 2 in the second quarter of 2021 in the second quarter of 2022 as noted above the higher than budgeted mill throughput 8 was mainly offset by lower than budgeted mill feed grade 6 as fekola s low grade stockpiles were used to provide additional unbudgeted mill feed required as a result of the higher than budgeted processed tonnes in addition in the second quarter of 2022 low availability of lime led to reduced gold recoveries however all reagents are now available without constraint and operations continue normally for the second quarter of 2022 fekola s cash operating costs were 639 per ounce produced 711 per ounce sold well below budget by 64 per ounce produced 9 mainly as a result of lower than budgeted total mining processing and site general costs and 22 per ounce produced 4 higher compared to the second quarter of 2021 mainly due to higher fuel and consumables costs and increased mining costs from operating deeper in the fekola pit in the second quarter of 2022 fekola s total mining costs were below budget due to lower overall tonnes mined compared to budget partially offset by higher than budgeted fuel prices mined tonnes were lower than budgeted due to a temporary change in mine sequencing resulting from the availability of supplies due to the ecowas sanctions in the second quarter of 2022 all of which have now been removed as of july 3 2022 fekola s aisc for the second quarter of 2022 were 949 per ounce sold q2 2021 854 per ounce sold well below budget by 76 per ounce sold 7 mainly due to lower than budgeted sustaining capital expenditures and higher than budgeted realized gains on the settlement of fuel derivatives for the first half of 2022 the fekola mine produced 224 714 ounces of gold slightly above budget 901 ounces and as expected lower by 6 13 985 ounces compared to the first half of 2021 mainly due to planned significant waste stripping and lower mined ore tonnage as phase 6 of the fekola pit was developed in the first half of 2022 for the first half of 2022 fekola s cash operating costs were 632 per ounce produced 652 per gold ounce sold well below budget by 106 per ounce produced 14 mainly due to lower overall tonnes mined compared to budget as outlined above and lower than budgeted fuel prices realized in the first quarter of 2022 fuel prices are set in advance by the state and therefore subject to timing delays between market fuel price increases and those experienced at the fekola mine fekola s fuel prices were significantly lower than budgeted in the first quarter of 2022 but following the reset of state fuel pricing in the second quarter of 2022 fuel prices were higher than budget in the second quarter of 2022 in total overall for the first half of 2022 fekola s fuel prices were lower than budgeted as expected compared to the first half of 2021 fekola s cash operating costs per ounce produced were higher by 75 per ounce produced 13 mainly due to the higher fuel and consumables costs and increased mining costs from operating deeper in the fekola pit fekola s aisc for the first half of 2022 were 967 per ounce sold first half 2021 811 per ounce sold well below budget by 195 per ounce sold 17 mainly attributable to lower than budgeted cash operating costs as outlined above and lower than budgeted sustaining capital expenditures relating to pre stripping costs and site capital projects together with higher than budgeted realized gains on the settlement of fuel derivatives the lower than budgeted sustaining capital expenditures are mainly due to timing of expenditures and expected to be incurred later in 2022 capital expenditures for the second quarter of 2022 totaled 20 million primarily consisting of 10 million for mobile equipment purchases and rebuilds and 6 million for the tailings storage facility expansion and studies capital expenditures for the first half of 2022 totaled 48 million primarily consisting of 19 million for mobile equipment purchases and rebuilds 14 million for pre stripping and 10 million for the tailings storage facility expansion and studies the company welcomes the recent announcement by ecowas of the removal on july 3 2022 of the economic financial and diplomatic sanctions imposed on mali in january 2022 the sanctions were removed by ecowas after the interim malian government announced a two year transition to presidential elections and promulgated a new electoral law mali s borders with its neighbouring countries have now re opened to normal commercial traffic and ordinary supply routes are available throughout the period of the sanctions the fekola mine continued to operate normally and meet its production targets while maintaining a good working relationship with the interim government the low cost fekola mine remains on track to produce between 570 000 and 600 000 ounces of gold in 2022 fekola s gold production is expected to significantly increase from the first half of 2022 to between 350 000 and 370 000 ounces during the second half of 2022 fekola s cash operating costs for the first half of 2022 were below its first half guidance range of between 720 and 760 per ounce and due to the weighting of fekola production are expected to still significantly decrease in the second half of 2022 for the second half of 2022 after factoring in current fuel price increases at fekola fekola s cash operating costs are now expected to be between 430 to 470 per ounce original second half guidance was between 380 to 420 per ounce fekola s aisc for the first half of 2022 were below its first half guidance range of between 1 140 and 1 180 per ounce and are expected to significantly decrease in the second half of 2022 for the second half of 2022 after factoring in current fuel price increases at fekola and the expected timing of remaining sustaining capital expenditures fekola s aisc are now expected to be between 790 and 830 per ounce original second half guidance was between 660 and 700 per ounce overall and after factoring in the positive operating results in the first half of 2022 fekola s costs guidance ranges for full year 2022 remain unchanged for full year 2022 fekola s cash operating costs are expected to be within its guidance range of between 510 and 550 per ounce and fekola s aisc are expected to be at the upper end of its guidance range of between 840 and 880 per ounce masbate gold mine the philippines the masbate mine in the philippines continued its strong operational performance with second quarter of 2022 gold production of 54 375 ounces above budget by 2 995 ounces as processed tonnage 6 above budget more than offset lower than budgeted processed grade 4 gold production in the second quarter of 2022 was lower by 4 2 503 ounces compared to the second quarter of 2021 due to higher grade and recoveries in the second quarter of 2021 for the second quarter of 2022 mill feed grade was 1 09 g t compared to budget of 1 13 g t and 1 17 g t in the second quarter of 2021 mill throughput was 1 99 million tonnes compared to budget of 1 88 million tonnes and 1 86 million tonnes in the second quarter of 2021 and gold recovery averaged 78 4 compared to budget of 78 2 and 81 5 in the second quarter of 2021 in the second quarter of 2022 higher than budgeted mill throughput 6 resulted from the continuous optimization of the grinding circuit whereas the lower than budgeted processed grade 4 resulted from lower than budgeted mined grades at the bottom of the montana pit where mining was completed at the end of july 2022 processed grade was higher in the second quarter of 2021 compared to the second quarter of 2022 due to mining of higher grade zones of the main vein and montana pits in the second quarter of 2021 gold recoveries for processed ore were also higher in the second quarter of 2021 compared to the second quarter of 2022 as mill recoveries outperformed masbate s modelled mine plan recoveries in the second quarter of 2021 for the second quarter of 2022 masbate s cash operating costs were 840 per ounce produced 764 per ounce sold above budget by 108 per ounce produced 15 mainly due to higher than budgeted diesel and heavy fuel oil hfo costs and higher compared to 616 per ounce produced 673 per ounce sold in the second quarter of 2021 mainly due to higher fuel and consumable costs masbate s cash operating costs per ounce sold for the second quarter of 2022 were higher than budget by 32 per ounce 4 but the impact of higher second quarter of 2022 fuel costs was partially offset by lower cost inventory produced in the first quarter of 2022 being sold in the second quarter of 2022 masbate s aisc for the second quarter of 2022 were 1 082 per ounce sold q2 2021 899 per ounce sold in line with budget as higher than budgeted realized gains on the settlement of fuel derivatives offset higher than budgeted cash operating costs as described above and higher than budgeted capital expenditures due to timing differences for the first half of 2022 masbate mine s gold production of 114 139 ounces was well above budget by 6 6 706 ounces as a result of higher than budgeted mill throughput and comparable to the first half of 2021 for the first half of 2022 masbate s cash operating costs were 772 per ounce produced 773 per ounce sold slightly above budget by 25 per ounce produced 3 as higher than budgeted diesel and hfo costs were largely offset by higher than budgeted gold production as expected masbate s cash operating costs were higher in the first half of 2022 compared to 612 per ounce produced 627 per ounce sold in the first half of 2021 mainly as a result of higher fuel and consumable costs masbate s aisc for the first half of 2022 were 1 054 per ounce sold first half of 2021 860 per ounce sold below budget by 90 per ounce sold 8 mainly attributable to lower than budgeted capital expenditures and higher than budgeted realized gains on the settlement of fuel derivatives which were partially offset by slightly higher than budgeted cash operating costs and lower than budgeted gold ounces sold the lower than budgeted sustaining capital expenditures were primarily a result of timing of expenditures and expected to be incurred later in 2022 capital expenditures in the second quarter of 2022 totaled 14 million primarily consisting of 9 million for mobile equipment purchases and rebuilds 2 million for an additional powerhouse generator and 2 million for tailings storage facility projects capital expenditures in the first half of 2022 totaled 20 million primarily consisting of 10 million for mobile equipment purchases and rebuilds 3 million for an additional powerhouse generator and 2 million for tailings storage facility projects in light of the masbate mine s positive production performance to date in 2022 it is now expected to produce between 215 000 and 225 000 ounces of gold in 2022 original guidance range was between 205 000 and 215 000 ounces of gold masbate s gold production is scheduled to be relatively consistent throughout 2022 masbate s cash operating costs for the first half of 2022 were above its first half guidance range of between 730 and 770 per ounce after factoring in current fuel price increases at masbate masbate s cash

full year 2022 with the increases being experienced in fuel prices masbate s cash operating costs are now expected to be in the range of between 820 and 860 per ounce original guidance range was between 740 and 780 per ounce masbate s aisc annual guidance range remains unchanged with masbate s aisc expected to be at the upper end of its guidance range of between 1 070 and 1 110 per ounce for full year 2022 otjikoto gold mine namibia the otjikoto mine in namibia produced 31 417 ounces of gold in the second quarter of 2022 2 027 ounces 6 below budget the lower than budgeted gold production in the second quarter of 2022 was due to a slower than planned ramp up in development of the wolfshag underground mine resulting in lower than budgeted mined grade the company recently appointed a new underground mining contractor and development rates in the wolfshag underground mine have recovered with development ore now expected in the third quarter of 2022 and stope ore production commencing in the fourth quarter of 2022 as a result of this change in ore production timing the 2022 annual production guidance range for otjikoto has been revised to between 165 000 and 175 000 ounces of gold as expected gold production in the second quarter of 2022 was higher by 17 4 526 ounces compared to the second quarter of 2021 due to significant waste stripping operations at both the wolfshag and otjikoto pits in the first half of 2021 for the second quarter of 2022 mill feed grade was 1 17 g t compared to budget of 1 25 g t and 0 99 g t in the second quarter of 2021 mill throughput was 0 85 million tonnes compared to budget of 0 85 million tonnes and 0 86 million tonnes in the second quarter of 2021 and gold recovery averaged 98 4 compared to budget of 98 0 and 97 8 in the second quarter of 2021 as noted above processed grade in the second quarter of 2022 was lower than budgeted due to delays in the development of the wolfshag underground mine and higher compared to the second quarter of 2021 due to significant waste stripping at both the wolfshag and otjikoto pits in the first half of 2021 for the second quarter of 2022 otjikoto s cash operating costs were 1 136 per ounce produced 1 018 per ounce sold slightly below budget by 24 per ounce produced 2 mainly due to the benefits of a weaker than budgeted namibian dollar and delay in incurring wolfshag underground mining operating costs partially offset by higher than budgeted fuel prices otjikoto s cash operating costs in the second quarter of 2022 were higher compared to 854 per ounce produced 885 per ounce sold in the second quarter of 2021 mainly as a result of higher fuel costs in 2022 otjikoto s aisc for the second quarter of 2022 were 1 403 per ounce sold q2 2021 1 613 per ounce sold significantly below budget by 214 per ounce sold 13 mainly due to slightly lower than budgeted cash operating costs lower than budgeted sustaining capital expenditures and higher than budgeted realized gains on the settlement of fuel derivatives partially offset by lower than budgeted gold ounces sold the lower sustaining capital expenditures are mainly a result of timing of expenditures and expected to be incurred later in 2022

fekola north and anaconda exploration on march 23 2022 the company announced additional positive exploration drilling results from fekola north and the anaconda area which is comprised of the menankoto permit and the bantako north permit located approximately 20 kilometres from the fekola mine high grade results from the fekola north target area such as drill hole fkd_641 which returned 4 28 g t gold over 19 15 metres from 529 0 metres provides strong support for ongoing evaluation of underground development of the deepest portions of the fekola mine deposit in the anaconda area drill hole msd_212 which returned 8 09 g t gold over 15 8 metres from 431 1 metres confirms the presence of high grade sulphide approximately 100 metres below the limits of the current mineral resource pit boundary the good grade and width combinations at the anaconda area continue to provide a strong indication of the potential for fekola style plunging bodies of sulphide mineralization which remain open at depth ongoing drilling by the company on the anaconda area to infill and extend the saprolite mineral resource area and to follow up on the sulphide mineralization including the mamba and adder zones as well as several other targets below the saprolite mineralization continues to generate positive drill results in both saprolite and sulphide domains and demonstrates strong potential to further increase the updated anaconda area mineral resource estimate see below on march 23 2022 the company announced an updated and significantly increased mineral resource estimate for the anaconda area the updated and significantly increased anaconda mineral resource estimate as at january 11 2022 constrained within a conceptual pit shell at a gold price of 1 800 per ounce included an initial

project fekola complex regional development in 2022 the company budgeted 33 million for development of infrastructure for phase i saprolite mining at the anaconda area including road construction based on the updated mineral resource estimate and b2gold s preliminary planning the company has demonstrated that a pit situated on the anaconda area could provide selective higher grade saprolite material average grade of 2 2 g t to be trucked to and fed into the fekola mill at a rate of 1 5 million tonnes per annum with the anticipated closing of the acquisition of oklo and its flagship dandoko project in mid september 2022 the company is currently evaluating its options for the timing and sourcing of material on a regional basis from all deposits within the fekola complex area including fekola cardinal dandoko bakalobi and the anaconda area this updated evaluation is expected to be completed by the end of 2022 with first saprolite production now anticipated in the second quarter of 2023 subject to obtaining all necessary permits and completion of a final development plan the company intends to commence its planned phase 1 infrastructure development in the fourth quarter of 2022 trucking of selective higher grade saprolite material to the fekola mill would increase the ore processed and annual gold production from the fekola mill with the potential to add an average of approximately 80 000 to 100 000 ounces per year to the fekola mill s annual gold production based on this updated mineral resource estimate and the 2022 exploration drilling results the company has commenced a phase ii scoping study to review the project economics of constructing a stand alone mill near the anaconda area subject to receipt of a positive phase ii scoping study the company expects that the saprolite material would continue to be trucked to and fed into the fekola mill during the construction period for the anaconda area stand alone mill gramalote project b2gold 50 anglogold 50 colombia based on the preliminary results of the optimized feasibility study for the gramalote gold project in colombia the gramalote project a joint venture between b2gold and anglogold both partners have determined that the project does not currently meet their investment thresholds for development of the project at this time therefore in conjunction with finalizing the gramalote feasibility study by the end of the third quarter of 2022 b2gold and anglogold have jointly made the decision to review the alternatives for the gramalote project over the coming months following a review of the gramalote project s optimized feasibility study work completed to date which included revisiting the original gramalote project design parameters in the existing mining permit as applied in the gramalote preliminary economic assessment in january 2020 and historical anglogold studies and further optimizing project design together with a review of the additional drilling of indicated and inferred portions of the mineral resource area and updating capital and operating costs to reflect both optimized project development and expected capital and operating costs the outcome was that the gramalote project does not meet the internal investment indicators that would support further project development at this time while the general characteristics of the gramalote project remain constant and the project benefits from a low strip ratio low processing costs and a favourable relationship with the local and regional stakeholders key changes to the project economics were identified during the optimized feasibility study work which combine to preclude development of the project by the joint venture on a global scale cost inflation has resulted in estimated capital cost increases of approximately 12 coupled with uncertain long term operating costs more detailed resource modelling indicates that the grade tonnage characteristics of the ore body resulted in lower than expected processing head grade and annual ounce production specifically within the first five years of production including the payback period these changes result in lower than expected project net present value and internal rate of return below the investment threshold of each joint venture partner the gramalote project continues to benefit from strong federal and local government support as well as continuing support from local communities b2gold and anglogold intend to jointly complete a comprehensive review of the alternatives relating to the gramalote project and consider the interests of all stakeholders in making a decision on the future of the project summary and outlook the company is pleased with its second quarter of 2022 results particularly given the challenges mining companies are facing around the world based on a strong operational and financial first half of 2022 the company is on track to meet its annual gold production guidance for 2022 of between 990 000 and 1 050 000 ounces including 40 000 and 50 000 attributable ounces projected from calibre consolidated cash operating costs and aisc were below budget for the first half of 2022 cash operating costs and aisc guidance for each operation for the second half of 2022 have been revised to reflect the current increases in fuel pricing and expected timing of remaining sustaining capital expenditures for 2022 however after factoring in the positive cost results in the first half of 2022 total consolidated costs guidance ranges for full year 2022 remain unchanged total consolidated cash operating costs for full year 2022 are expected to be at the upper end of the company s original guidance range of between 620 and 660 per ounce and within its total consolidated aisc guidance range of between 1 010 and 1 050 per ounce following the receipt of the menankoto permit in mali the company is expanding the scope of its exploration activities on the anaconda area comprised of the menankoto permit and the bantako north permit to build on the successful exploration programs already completed to date the company will continue to follow up on the sulphide mineralization at the mamba adder and several other targets below the saprolite mineralization in 2022 on april 21 2022 the company completed the acquisition of the bakolobi permit in mali from a local malian company the bakolobi permit is located between the menankoto permit to the north and the fekola mine s medinandi permit wrapping around the latter to its south west end covering an area of 100 km2 the acquisition of the bakolobi permit results in the ownership by the company of four contiguous exploration and or exploitation permits covering 237 km2 in 2022 the company budgeted 33 million for development of infrastructure for phase i saprolite mining at the anaconda area including road construction based on the updated mineral resource estimate and b2gold s preliminary planning the company has demonstrated that a pit situated on the anaconda area could provide selective higher grade saprolite material average grade of 2 2 g t to be trucked to and fed into the fekola mill at a rate of 1 5 million tonnes per annum with the anticipated closing of the acquisition of oklo and its flagship dandoko project in mid september 2022 the company is currently evaluating its options for the timing

processed and annual gold production from the fekola mill with the potential to add an average of approximately 80 000 to 100 000 ounces per year to the fekola mill s annual gold production after a very successful year for exploration in 2021 b2gold is conducting an aggressive exploration campaign in 2022 with a revised budget of approximately 75 million excluding the gramalote project exploration will focus predominantly in mali other operating mine sites in namibia and the philippines and continued focus on grassroots targets around the world many years of target generation and pursuing opportunities in prospective gold regions has culminated in the company allocating a record 29 million for its grassroots exploration programs including several new regions included in the grassroots exploration program is 8 million allocated to finland for the central lapland joint venture with aurion resources ltd most significantly the westward extension of rupert resources ikarri discovery trends directly onto the joint venture ground this trend named the helmi trend on the joint venture ground coincides with b2gold s base of till drilling and the same interpreted structure as defined by airborne geophysics diamond drilling in 2021 has confirmed the presence of mineralization on this structure and is being successfully followed up with 11 600 metres planned in 2022 the company s ongoing strategy is to continue to maximize profitable production from its mines further advance its pipeline of remaining development and exploration projects evaluate new exploration

the bill would charge the cftc a much smaller agency than the sec with regulating cryptocurrency transactions and markets example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video washington a bipartisan group of senators on wednesday proposed a bill to regulate cryptocurrencies the latest attempt by congress to formulate ideas on how to oversee a multibillion dollar industry that has been racked by collapsing prices and lenders halting operations the regulations offered by senate agriculture committee chair debbie stabenow and top republican member john boozman would authorize the commodities futures trading commission to be the default regulator for cryptocurrencies that would be in contrast with bills proposed by other members of congress and consumer advocates who have suggested giving the authority to the securities and exchange commission this year crypto investors have seen prices plunge and companies crater with fortunes and jobs disappearing overnight and some firms have been accused by federal regulators of running an illegal securities exchange bitcoin the largest digital asset trades at a fraction of its all time high down from more than 68 000 in november 2021 to about 23 000 on wednesday industry leaders have referred to this period as a crypto winter and lawmakers have been desperate to implement stringent oversight the bill by stabenow a democrat from michigan and boozman of arkansas would require all cryptocurrency platforms including traders dealers brokers and sites that hold crypto for customers to register with the cftc the cftc is historically an underfunded and much smaller regulator than the sec which has armies of investigators to look at potential wrongdoing the bill attempts to alleviate these issues by imposing on the crypto industry user fees which in turn would fund more robust supervision of the industry by the cftc our bill will empower the cftc with exclusive jurisdiction over the digital commodities spot market which will lead to more safeguards for consumers market integrity and innovation in the digital commodities space boozman said in a statement sens cory booker d n j and john thune r s d are co sponsors of the bill it s critical that the cftc has the proper tools to regulate this growing market thune said the legislation can be added to the list of proposals that have come out of congress this year sen pat toomey r pa in april introduced legislation called the stablecoin trust act that would create a framework to regulate stablecoins which have seen massive losses this year stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency pegged to a specific value usually the u s dollar another currency or gold additionally in june sens kirsten gillibrand d n y and cynthia lummis r wyo proposed a wide ranging bill called the responsible financial innovation act that bill proposed legal definitions of digital assets and virtual currencies would require the irs to adopt guidance on merchant acceptance of digital assets and charitable contributions and would make a distinction between digital assets that are commodities and those that are securities which has not been done along with the toomey legislation and the lummis gillibrand legislation a proposal is being worked out in the house financial services committee though those negotiations have stalled committee chair maxine waters d calif said last month that while she top republican member patrick mchenry of north carolina and treasury secretary janet yellen had made considerable progress toward an agreement on the legislation we are unfortunately not there yet and will therefore continue our negotiations over the august recess president joe biden s working group on financial markets last november issued a report calling on congress to pass legislation that would regulate stablecoins and biden earlier this year issued an executive order calling on a variety of agencies to look at ways to regulate digital assets

by gail tverberg the price of energy has been too low for producers in recent years while the price of extraction has increased this will cause the global economy to shrink as the economy changes from growth to shrinkage the rate of shrinkage of gdp will be greater than the rate of shrinkage of energy consumption as interest rates rise energy supplies will become even tighter leading to a shortage of goods a potential increase in conflict and rising debt it is my view that when energy supply falls it falls not because reserves run out it falls because economies around the world cannot afford to purchase goods and services made with energy products and using energy products in their operation it is really a price problem prices cannot be simultaneously high enough for oil producers such as russia and saudi arabia to ramp up production and remain low enough for consumers around the world to buy the goods and services that they are accustomed to buying figure 1 chart showing average annual brent equivalent oil prices in 2021 based on data from bp s 2022 statistical review of world energy together with bars showing periods when prices seemed to be favorable to producers we are now in a period of price conflict oil and other energy prices have remained too low for producers since at least mid 2014 at the same time depletion of fossil fuels has led to higher costs of extraction often the tax needs of governments of oil exporting countries are higher as well leading to even higher required prices for producers if they are to continue to produce oil and raise their production thus producers truly require higher prices governments of countries affected by this inflation in price are quite disturbed higher prices for energy products mean higher prices for all goods and services this makes citizens very unhappy because wages do not rise to compensate for this inflation prices today are high enough to cause significant inflation about 107 per barrel for brent oil europe and 97 for wti us but still not high enough to satisfy the high price needs of energy producers it is my expectation that these and other issues will lead to a very strangely behaving world economy in the months and years ahead the world economy we know today is in fact a self organizing system operating under the laws of physics with less energy it will start coming apart world trade will increasingly falter fossil fuel prices will be volatile but not necessarily very high in this post i will try to explain some of the issues i see the issue causing the price conflict can be described as reduced productivity of the economy the ultimate outcome of reduced productivity of the economy is fewer total goods and services produced by the economy figure 2 shows that historically there is an extremely high correlation between world energy consumption and the total quantity of goods and services produced by the world economy in my analysis i use purchasing power parity ppp gdp because it is not distorted by the rise and fall of the us dollar relative to other currencies figure 2 correlation between world gdp measured in purchasing power parity ppp 2017 international and world energy consumption including both fossil fuels and renewables gdp is as reported by the world bank for 1990 through 2021 as of july 26 2022 total energy consumption is as reported by bp in its 2022 statistical review of world energy the reason such a high correlation exists is because it takes energy to perform each activity that contributes to gdp such as lighting a room or transporting goods energy consumption which is cheap to produce and growing rapidly in quantity is ideal for increasing energy productivity since it allows factories to be built cheaply and raw materials and finished goods to be transported at low cost humans are part of the economy food is the energy product that humans require reducing food supply by 20 or 40 or 50 cannot be expected to work well the economy suffers the same difficulty in recent years depletion has been making the extraction of fossil fuel resources increasingly expensive one issue is that the resources that were easiest to extract and closest to where they were needed were extracted first leaving the highest cost resources for extraction later another issue is that with a growing population the governments of oil exporting countries require higher tax revenue to support the overall needs of their countries intermittent wind and solar are not substitutes for fossil fuels because they are not available when they are needed if several months worth of storage could be added the total cost would be so high that these energy sources would have no chance of being competitive i recently wrote about some of the issues with renewables in limits to green energy are becoming much clearer rising population is a second problem leading to falling efficiency in order to feed clothe and house a rising population a growing quantity of food must be produced from essentially the same amount of arable land more water for the rising population is required for the rising population often obtained by deeper wells or desalination clearly the need to use increased materials and labor to work around problems caused by rising world population adds another layer of inefficiency if we also add the cost of attempting to work around pollution issues this further adds another layer of inefficiency in the use of energy supplies more technology is not a solution either because adding any type of complexity requires energy to implement for example adding machines to replace current workers requires the use of energy products to make and operate the machines moving production to cheaper locations overseas another form of complexity requires energy for the transport of goods from where they are transported to where they are used figure 2 shows that the world economy still requires more energy to produce increasing gdp even with the gains achieved in technology and efficiency because of energy limits the world economy is trying to change from a growth mode to a shrinkage mode this is something very much like the collapse of many ancient civilizations including the fall of rome in 165 to 197 ce historically such collapses have unfolded over a period of years or decades in the past the growth rate of gdp has exceeded that of energy consumption as the economy changes from growth to shrinkage we should expect this situation to reverse the rate of shrinkage of gdp will be greater than the rate of shrinkage of energy consumption figure 3 shows that historically world economic growth has been slightly higher than the growth in energy consumption this growth in energy consumption is based total consumption of fossil fuels and renewables as calculated by bp figure 3 annual growth in world ppp gdp compared to annual growth in consumption of energy supplies world ppp gdp is data provided by the world bank world energy consumption is based on data of bp s 2022 statistical review of world energy in fact based on the discussion in section this is precisely the situation we should expect gdp growth should exceed energy consumption growth when the economy is growing unfortunately section also suggests that we can expect this favorable relationship to disappear as energy supply begins to shrink because of growing inefficiencies in the system in such a case gdp is likely to shrink even more quickly than energy supply shrinks one reason this happens is because complexity of many types cannot be maintained as energy supply shrinks for example international supply lines are likely to break if energy supplies fall too low interest rates play an important role in encouraging the development of energy resources generally falling interest rates are very beneficial rising interest rates are quite detrimental as the economy shifts toward shrinkage the pattern we can expect is higher interest rates rather than lower as limits of energy extraction are hit these higher rates will tend to make the economy shrink even faster than it would otherwise shrink part of what has allowed growing energy consumption in the period shown in figures 2 and 3 is rising debt levels at generally lower interest rates falling interest rates together with debt availability make investment in factories and mines more affordable they also help citizens seeking to buy a new car or home because the lower monthly payments make these items more affordable demand for energy products tends to rise allowing prices of commodities to rise higher than they would otherwise rise thus making their production more profitable this encourages more fossil fuel extraction and more development of renewables once the economy starts to shrink debt levels seem likely to shrink because of defaults and because of the reluctance of lenders to lend for fear of defaults interest rates will tend to rise partly because of higher inflation rates and partly because of the higher level of expected defaults this debt pattern will reinforce the tendency toward lower gdp growth compared to energy consumption growth this is a major reason that raising interest rates now is likely to push the economy downward with fewer goods and services produced by the economy the world economy must eventually shrink we should not be surprised if this shrinkage in some ways echoes the shrinkage that took place in the 2008 2009 recession and the 2020 shutdowns we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us the gdp of the world economy is the goods and services produced by the world economy if the economy starts to shrink total world gdp will necessarily fall what happens in the future may echo what has happened in the past figure 4 world energy consumption per capita based on information published in bp s 2022 statistical review of world energy central bank officials felt it was important to stop inflation in oil prices and indirectly in food prices back in the 2004 to 2006 period this indirectly led to the 2008 2009 recession as parts of the world debt bubble started to collapse and many jobs were lost we should not be surprised if a much worse version of this happens in the future the 2020 shutdowns were characterized in most news media as a response to covid 19 viewed on an overall system basis however they really were a response to many simultaneous problems covid 19 a hidden shortage of fossil fuels that was not reflected as high enough prices for producers to ramp up production hidden financial problems that threatened a new version of the 2008 financial collapse factories in many parts of the world that were operating at far less than capacity workers demonstrating in the streets with respect to low wages and low pensions airlines with financial problems citizens frustrated by long commutes very many old sick people in care homes of various types passing around illnesses an outsized medical system that still desired to increase profits politicians who wanted a way to better control their populations perhaps rationing of output would work around an inadequate total supply of goods and services shutting down non essential activities for a while would temporarily reduce demand for oil and other energy products making it easier for the rest of the system to appear profitable it would give an excuse to increase borrowing and money printing to hide the financial problems for a while longer it would keep people at home reducing the need for oil and other energy products hiding the fossil fuel shortage for a while longer it would force the medical system to reorganize offering more telephone visits and laying off non essential workers many individual citizens could reduce time lost to commuting thanks to new work from home rules and internet connections the homebuilding and home remodeling industries were stimulated offering work to those who had been laid off the impacts of the shutdowns were greatest on poor people in poor countries such as those in central and south america for example many people in the vacation and travel industries were laid off in poor countries people making fancy clothing for people going to conferences and weddings were laid off as were people raising flowers for fancy events these people had trouble finding new employment they are at increased risk of dying either from covid 19 or inadequate nutrition making them susceptible to other illnesses we should not be surprised if some near term problems echo what has happened in the past debt defaults and falling home prices are very real possibilities for example also making a new crisis a huge focal point and scaring the population into staying at home has proven to be a huge success in temporarily reducing energy consumption without actual rationing some people believe that monkeypox or a climate change crisis will be the next area of focus in an attempt to reduce energy consumption and thus lower oil prices there is likely to be more conflict in a world with not enough goods and services to go around with a shrinking amount of finished goods and services we should not be surprised if we see more conflict in the world many wars are resource wars the conflict between russia and ukraine with other countries indirectly involved certainly could be considered a resource war russia wants higher prices for its exports of many kinds including energy exports i wrote about the conflict issue in a post i wrote in april 2022 the world has a major crude oil problem expect conflict ahead world war i and world war ii were almost certainly about energy resources peak coal in the uk seems to be closely related to world war i inadequate coal in germany and lack of oil in japan and elsewhere seem to be related to world war ii we seem to be facing a new set of problems in addition to the problems that gave rise to the covid 19 shutdowns these are likely to shape how any new crisis plays out some recently added problems include the following debt has risen to a high level relative to 2008 this debt will be harder to repay with higher interest rates the us dollar is very high relative to other currencies the high level of the us dollar causes problems for borrowers from outside the us in repaying their loans it also makes energy prices very high outside the us oil coal and natural gas are all in short supply worldwide leading to falling productivity of the overall system item 1 if extraction is to continue prices need to be much higher difficulties with broken supply lines make it hard to ramp up production of manufactured goods of many kinds inadequate labor supply is an increasing problem baby boomers are now retiring not enough young people are available to take their place increased illness associated with covid 19 and its vaccines is also an issue these issues point to a situation where rising interest rates seem likely to send the world economy downward because of debt defaults and failing businesses of many kinds the high dollar relative to other currencies leads to the potential for the system to break apart under stress alternatively the us dollar may play a smaller role in international trade than in the past many parts of the economy are likely to find that the promised payments to be made to them cannot really take place we have been taught that money is a store of value we have also been taught that government promises such as pensions unemployment insurance and health insurance can be counted on if there are fewer goods and services available in total the whole system must change to reflect the fact that there are no longer enough goods and services to go around there may not even be enough food to go around as the world economy hits limits we cannot assume that the money we have in the bank will really be able to purchase the goods we want in the future the goods may not be available to purchase or the government may put a restriction such as 200 per week on how much we can withdraw from our account each week or inflation may make goods we currently buy unaffordable if we think about the situation the world will be producing fewer goods and services each year regardless of what the promises that have been made in the past might say for example the number of bushels of wheat available worldwide will start falling as will the number of new cars and the number of computers somehow the goods and services people expected to be available will start disappearing if the problem is inflation the affordable quantity will start to fall we don t know precisely what will happen but these are some ideas especially as higher interest rates become a problem many businesses will fail they will default on their debt the value of their stock will go to zero they will lay off their employees employees and governments will also default on debts banks will have difficulty remaining solvent pension plans will have nowhere nearly enough money to pay promised pensions either they will default or prices will rise so high that the pensions do not really purchase the goods that recipients hoped for the international system of trade is likely to start withering away eventually most goods will be locally produced with whatever resources are available many government agencies will become inadequately funded and fail intergovernmental agencies such as the european union and the united nations are especially vulnerable governments are likely to reduce services provided because tax revenues are too low even if more money is printed it cannot buy goods that are not there citizens may become so unhappy with their governments that they overthrow them simpler cheaper governmental systems offering fewer services may follow it is likely that in inflation adjusted dollars energy prices will not rise very high for very long we are likely dealing with an economy that is basically falling apart factories will produce less because they cannot obtain financing purchasers of finished goods and services will have difficulty finding jobs that pay well and loans based on this employment these effects will tend to keep commodity prices too low for producers while there may be temporary spurts of higher prices finished goods made with high cost energy products will be too expensive for most citizens to afford this will tend to push prices back down again conclusion we are dealing with a situation that economists politicians and central banks are ill equipped to handle raising interest rates may squeeze out a huge share of the economy the economy was already at the edge we can t know for certain virtually no one looks at the economy from a physics point of view for one thing the result is too distressing to explain to citizens for another it is fashionable for scientists of all types to produce papers and have them peer reviewed by others within their own ivory towers economists politicians and central bankers don t care about the physics of the situation even those basing their analysis on energy return on energy invested eroei tend to focus on only a narrow portion of what i explained in section once researchers have invested a huge amount of time and effort in one direction they cannot consider the possibility that their approach may be seriously incomplete unfortunately the physics based approach i am using indicates that the world s economy is likely to change dramatically for the worse in the months and years ahead economies in general cannot last forever populations outgrow their resource bases resources become too depleted in physics terms economies are dissipative structures not unlike ecosystems plants and animals they can only exist for a limited time before they die or end their operation they tend to be replaced by new similar dissipative structures while the current world economy cannot last indefinitely humans have continued to exist through many bottlenecks in the past including ice ages it is likely that some humans perhaps in mutated form will make it through the current bottleneck these humans will likely create a new economy that is better adapted to the earth as it changes by gail tverberg

quarterly calls i will update you on our performance and our current overall operating environment jerry will then discuss our business development efforts our portfolio events and our markets and dan will detail our operating performance and financial condition we will then take some questions today we are reporting the results of our strong performance in the second quarter despite a challenging macroeconomic environment we hit on all cylinders in the second quarter validating the power of the lending platform of our advisor horizon technology finance management our earnings exceeded our distributions for the quarter and first half of 2022 while we significantly grew our portfolio maintained our credit quality and further strengthened our balance sheet in order to provide ample capacity to fund our growth we are keeping a watchful eye on the impacts of inflation rising interest rates and volatile markets on our portfolio but we are proud of our execution and results in these challenging times for the quarter we generated net investment income of 0 35 per share above our distributions of 0 30 per share based on our results and outlook we declared monthly distributions of 0 10 per share through the end of the year which will mark six straight years of monthly distributions at this level we maintained undistributed spillover income of 0 53 per share as of june we grew the portfolio by 62 million another quarterly record for hrzn which resulted in a portfolio value at quarter end of 577 million the horizon brand has gained significant traction in the venture debt community and our advisor continues to be successful in sourcing and winning high quality venture debt investments we finished the quarter with a record committed and approved backlog of 221 million and a pipeline of opportunities of over 1 billion this momentum in the market provides us with the capability to be selective and disciplined as we look to further grow our portfolio we strengthened our balance sheet by issuing over 57 million of 2027 notes at 6 1 4 further increasing our investment capacity and reflecting our ability to raise capital in a challenging environment in addition during the quarter we raised approximately 10 million of equity capital at a premium to nav through our at the market program as a result we ended the quarter with over 120 million of liquidity we achieved a portfolio yield on our debt investments of 14 2 for the quarter we ended the quarter with nav of 11 69 per share up 0 01 from march 31 2022 and up 0 49 from the end of q2 2021 and finally we maintained a stable credit profile with 96 of our portfolio rated three or higher as of june 30 as always we are consistently and actively managing our portfolio of investments to maintain its credit quality looking forward there continues to be very strong demand for venture debt within our targeted industries as evidenced by our committed backlog and pipeline we are keenly aware of the current environment and are prudent with respect to structuring and originating new high quality investments for the quarter the advisor s platform funded a record 192 million in new venture debt investments spread throughout our targeted industries including a record 137 million funded by the public company we believe our advisor continues to build us a portfolio with the opportunity for enhanced yields utilizing our advisor s predictive pricing strategy this strategy predicts our borrowers early exits from refinancings and liquidity events and the additional income and accelerated income that we received from such events we are proud of the team efforts of our advisor not just over the first half of the year but for all it has accomplished over the past few years to successfully grow and manage its platform and our portfolio team is stronger than ever prepared to address the changing macro environment and we believe well positioned to navigate through this environment and continue generating sustainable growth and profitability with that i will now turn the call over to jerry and dan to give you more details and color on our performance jerry jerry michaud president thanks rob and good morning to everyone it was another historically strong quarter of growth for horizon even in the face of increasingly challenging macro environment we grew our portfolio by 62 million in the quarter a second consecutive quarterly record and finished the quarter with a portfolio of 577 million we funded 15 transactions totaling a record 137 million including 63 million in debt investments to seven new portfolio companies consisting of four new life science investments two new technology investments and one new healthcare tech investment providing further diversification to our portfolio we also funded 74 million to eight of our existing portfolio companies our onboarding yield of 11 6 during the quarter reflected the continued discipline in pricing transactions that we expect to produce strong net investment income we experienced three loan prepayments during the quarter totaling 57 million which included a portfolio loan that we refinanced the repayment fees and accelerated income from such prepayments contributed to a strong debt portfolio yield of 14 2 once again among the top of the bdc industry given the current macro environment we anticipate prepayments for the remainder of the year may be lighter than we ve typically seen in the second half of prior years as of june 30 we held warrant and equity positions in 90 portfolio companies with a fair value of 26 million as we ve consistently noted structuring investments with warrants and equity rights is a key aspect of our venture debt strategy and an additional value generator in the second quarter we closed 203 million in new loan commitments and approvals and ended the quarter with a record committed and approved backlog of 221 million compared to 151 million at the end of the first quarter while there is no guarantee we will fund all these transactions and our committed or awarded backlogs we are clearly well positioned to further grow our investment portfolio in the second half of the year our portfolio s credit quality remained solid as the fair value of 96 of our debt portfolio consisted of three and four rated loans as of june 30 consistent with our prior quarter end during the quarter one investment was downgraded to a two rating and one investment was downgraded to a one rating at the end of the quarter we had a total of five credits with a one or two rating with the remaining 50 portfolio credits rated three or better since the quarter end one of our one rated credits maculogix sold its assets and we received an initial cash payment and equity in the acquiring company as well as potential future value from the collection of ar and royalty payments on future sales turning now to the venture capital environment as expected we saw a reduction in vc investment activity compared to the record setting entire prior year according to pitchbook approximately 62 billion was invested in vc backed companies in the second quarter of 2022 less than the first quarter but still a healthy flow vc fundraising momentum continued in the second quarter as 48 billion was raised making it likely that last year s full year fundraising record will be surpassed in the third quarter larger vc funds continued to drive the bulk of the fundraising meanwhile vc backed exit activity was markedly lower given the current environment and the near shutting of the ipo window total exit value for the quarter was 13 billion the lowest quarter total since 2016 while the economic environment and investor sentiment have clearly shifted in the first half of 2022 we again note that vc firms continue to maintain record levels of dry powder that may provide liquidity for new investment opportunities and support for existing portfolio of companies as is evident in our recent performance the severe tightening of the ipo market and significant reduction in spac exits is in part driving increased demand for venture debt a key source of additional liquidity for growth stage companies while we expect demand for venture debt to remain strong in the second half of 2022 we also anticipate that vc firms will participate alongside most new debt investments with follow on equity fundings in order to provide additional liquidity and runway to reach better equity and m a markets the vc community and venture debt community will need to work collaboratively to provide the necessary and appropriate funding to their portfolio companies in order to successfully navigate through the current environment based on horizon s knowledge and experience and its long standing and favorable position in the venture capital ecosystem we expect to work closely with the vc community to support our portfolio companies as well as fund new portfolio companies with our advisor s strong and active lending platform and the solid investment capacity of horizon we believe we are well situated to continue competing and winning in the current environment subsequent to the end of the second quarter we continued our growth momentum funding four transactions totaling 38 5 million in july our committed approved and awarded backlog as of today stands at 364 million which includes new awards during july our advisor s pipeline of new opportunities today is still approximately 1 billion among historically high levels of opportunities to further grow our venture portfolio over the coming quarters looking ahead with an abundance of demand from attractive quality companies for venture debt solutions for which to grow our committed backlog and our advisor s pipeline we remain very mindful of the current environment and are pleased to be in a position where we can afford to be selective in making new investments we also continue to hold an active and regular dialogue with each of our portfolio companies and their investors in order to manage our credit quality and identify changes in the vc ecosystem accordingly because of such efforts we believe we remain well positioned to continue to deliver additional long term shareholder value with that i will now turn the call over to dan dan trolio chief financial officer thanks jerry and good morning everyone during the second quarter we built on our efforts from the beginning of the year and further enhanced our capital resources first we increased our lending capacity through the issuance of 57 5 million of 2027 notes at 6 1 4 which includes 7 5 million issued in early july from the exercise of the over allotment second through our atm program we successfully and accretively sold 868 000 shares of stock opportunistically raising over 10 million these actions provide us with further capacity to grow the portfolio turning to our operating results as of june 30 we had 123 million in available liquidity consisting of 76 million in cash and 47 million in funds available to be drawn under our existing credit facilities as of june 30 there was 75 million outstanding under our 125 million keybank credit facility and 137 million outstanding on our 200 million new york life credit facility leaving us with ample capacity to grow the portfolio debt to equity ratio stood at 1 27 to 1 as of june 30 which was slightly higher than our target leverage of 1 2 to 1 but netting out our leverage with cash on the balance sheet our net debt to equity ratio was one to one based on our cash position and our borrowing capacity on our credit facilities our potential new investment capacity at june 30 was 190 million for the second quarter we earned total investment income of 18 6 million an increase of 38 compared to the prior year period interest income on investments increased primarily as a result of a higher average earning debt investment portfolio for the quarter our debt investment portfolio on a net cost basis stood at 563 million as of june 30 a 13 increase from march 31 2022 for the second quarter of 2022 we achieved onboarding yields of 11 6 compared to 11 4 achieved in the first quarter our loan portfolio yield was 14 2 for the second quarter compared to 14 7 for last year s second quarter total expenses for the quarter were 9 9 million compared to 7 3 million in the second quarter of 2021 our performance based incentive fee increased to 2 1 million from 1 5 million for last year s second quarter our interest expense increased to 4 2 million from 3 million in last year s second quarter due to an increase in average borrowings our base management fee was 2 5 million up from 1 8 million in last year s second quarter due to an increase in the average size of our portfolio net investment income for the second quarter of 2022 was 0 35 per share compared to 0 26 per share in the first quarter of 2022 and 0 31 per share for the second quarter of 2021 the company s undistributed spillover income as of june 30 was 0 53 per share we anticipate that our larger portfolio with our predictive pricing strategy will enable us over time to generate nii that covers distributions as we have said in the past we will experience prepayments throughout the year but the timing is difficult to predict to summarize our portfolio activities for the second quarter net new originations totaled 137 million which were partially offset by 5 million in scheduled principal payments and 65 million in principal prepayments and principal paydowns we ended the quarter with a total investment portfolio of 577 million given the macro environment we would expect portfolio growth to normalize from the first half of 2022 levels the portfolio consisted of debt investments in 55 companies with an aggregate fair value of 552 million and a portfolio of warrant and equity and other investments in 91 companies with an aggregate fair value of 26 million based upon our outlook for 2022 our board declared monthly distributions of 0 10 per share for october november and december 2022 we have now declared monthly distributions of 0 10 per share for six consecutive years we remain committed to providing our shareholders with distributions that are covered by our net investment income over time our nav as of june 30 was 11 69 per share compared to 11 68 as of march 31 2022 and 11 20 as of june 30 2021 the 0 01 increase in nav on a quarterly basis was primarily due to our net investment income partially offset by paid distributions and adjustments to fair value as we ve consistently noted 100 of the outstanding principal amount of our debt investments bear interest at floating rates with coupons that are structured to increase as interest rates rise with interest rate floors as of june 30 over 90 of our portfolio will benefit from additional increases in the prime rate this concludes our opening remarks we ll be happy to take questions you may have at this time questions answers operator our first question comes from paul johnson with kbw please proceed paul johnson kbw analyst yeah good morning guys thanks for taking my questions i have several for you this morning the first is just basically around growth expectations kind of looking out over the next year or so i know you said first half likely not to be as robust maybe as the first half of this year but i mean on a net basis are we talking about roughly kind of flat to no growth for the bdc is what we could expect or do you think there s a little bit of ability to continue to grow the portfolio through the end of the year jerry michaud president paul this is jerry yes i still think there is room for growth if you look at our numbers on our committed backlog and what s been awarded just recently we certainly think that the demand is there to continue to grow the business but of course what we what s a little bit more difficult to predict is prepayments over the second half we do think that they will slow i think we ve been pretty much indicating that now for a couple of quarters given the slowdown in the equity markets and the choppiness of the environment in general so i do think there could be room for growth maybe not as robust as it was in the first half we do have some potential prepayments here in the second half we have a couple of companies that are well along in the spac process which if those transactions happen we d probably get prepayments and then there s a couple of others that were also there seems to be some indication that we might be prepaid over the second half so there will be some prepayments i do think even with that though given our strong backlog given strong demand from what we re hearing in the marketplace we do think there will be some level some opportunity to continue to grow the portfolio but probably not at the level we did in the first half paul johnson kbw analyst got it and as far as like the activity that you re seeing the demand for venture capital how much of it would you say here recently in the second quarter and today in general quarter to date i mean is that driven by companies essentially looking to kind of avoid down rounds or lower valuation equity raises that are good companies just essentially kind of seeking a longer runway versus kind of higher tax burn potentially earlier stage companies that are just quite frankly just in need of capital and already financing those types of companies today jerry michaud president yes so that s the right question i think most of what we re seeing today are and i had mentioned this and i wanted to get some of this into my comments because i think it is really important based on some articles that i have just seen recently too venture debt in this kind of environment doesn t replace equity that s not the idea now to your point and it s a good one if it s a high quality company with really strong investors and they ve demonstrated continued support that s certainly something we re interested in looking at and funding a significant amount of what we re seeing today is we re providing debt along with equity so yes valuations are down vcs don t want to have to put more money than they need to into some of their portfolio companies to get to a better m a market but they re still very good companies and the vcs are going to continue to support them and in fact they have the ability to do that because of the fundraising that the vc community has experienced over the last couple of years actually so most of what we re seeing is really quality companies coming to the market for both debt and equity and those are the kinds of transactions that we are we obviously have a high level of interest in and that is most of what we are seeing to your to the second part of that companies that need to raise capital there s been definitely vcs have definitely put pressure on their portfolio companies to reduce costs reduce burn and we are seeing a lot of that for the most part those are not transactions that we probably are prepared to step up to put debt in in replace of what should be some additional equity we re not really seeing that many of them either though in fairness so most of it is a pretty strong market it s opportunistic but the demand is so high as we had mentioned we actually can be fairly selective and still meet what we hope to be our growth numbers for the remainder of the year but it is a choppy market and we are paying very close attention to what the vc community in general is doing we re paying very close attention to specifically what venture capitalists are doing relative to our portfolio companies and that is guiding us relative to looking at new opportunities and the last thing i would just add is one another area we re probably staying away from is we re not really interested in refinancing debt that companies already have because they probably at the time they got the leverage it was probably ok but given valuations have come down we think some of those companies are probably over leveraged at this point paul johnson kbw analyst right yes makes sense and appreciate all the color on that my next question is really for having jerry or dan either way just has to kind of do with just the marks on book this quarter curious as to a quarter where we kind of expect to have nav headwinds of mid single digits probably not at higher end for vcs with more public equity exposure i understand your equity investments aren t quite as large as some of the other venture bdcs out there but can you just kind of walk us through kind of how you guys look at the mark for this quarter for the assets and i m also interested just as far as the equity investments go looks like they were marked higher this quarter was there anything particular in there that drove that dan trolio chief financial officer yes paul this is dan what we said every quarter is for a venture debt portfolio we look at the fair value of each investment every quarter there really is no one specific index that would allow us to take a fair value adjustment across the board for our asset class that really wouldn t be fair value and so we go through each investment on a quarterly basis and based on the information we have at the time that we up until the day we file we adjust and make our fair value changes and that is reflected in the q there were our normal migration between two and one rated and three and four rated credits so on the debt side that has been reflected in the fair value and then yes on the warrant piece we don t hold a significant portion of warrants in public equity but you re right the warrants portion of our fair value did increase and that is specific to handful of our deals our portfolio companies were able to raise equity in this environment at a pretty significant up round and that drove the increase in the fair value that you re looking at paul johnson kbw analyst got it appreciate it that answers my question i guess last question i had i apologize for so many questions i ll get back in the queue after this but it s just around the unfunded commitments i mean we touched on this earlier the quarter but how much visibility do you guys have around the unfunded commitments that s building over the last few quarters i imagine with all the new investment activity that you ve had yes just curious about how much visibility that you have around any of that getting drawn down from quarter to quarter jerry michaud president yes so we actually have some visibility because a great portion of our committed backlog is based on companies meeting certain milestones and we know based on projections they have given us when they expect to meet those milestones so we do have good visibility in terms of when there would be an opportunity for the company to draw it down now whether they meet those milestones in this market of course is certainly something that is not as probably clear as it would be in a better environment so that will really be the question is our company is able to meet their milestone requirements in order to actually draw the capital now we had a pretty active second quarter in terms if you look at the portfolio existing portfolio companies that we funded some of those were a result of companies meeting milestones one company we actually refinanced the debt package they raised a very significant equity round and we refinanced their debt package which extended the runway for the company along with the significant equity they ve raised and we were also able to get our final payment pulled forward so it was actually an income event from that transaction as well so it is a little bit more difficult to determine if milestones will be met but we certainly have pretty good visibility when the expectation is that they ll meet those milestones that s not necessarily a whole lot different than even in a better market but in a better market we probably have a little bit more confidence that milestones would be met paul johnson kbw analyst thank you for

with enough monkeypox vaccine to fully vaccinate only 743 people in wisconsin public health organizations are finding demand is quickly outpacing supply in cities across the state the city of milwaukee health department announced it was opening a vaccine clinic wednesday warning right out the gate that supply is limited all initial appointments were filled as of wednesday and it was unclear when more would be made available milwaukee health officials said they have received 200 doses of the jynneos monkeypox vaccine from the state the health department is working with clinical and community organizations including but not limited to sexual health clinics and hiv prep providers to reach out to eligible people and get the word out this is a significant step in combating monkeypox in milwaukee but unfortunately there is currently not enough vaccine for everyone eligible said milwaukee health commissioner kirsten johnson i understand the urgency to get vaccinated but we ask for you to please be patient while in this time of scarcity we need to focus on protecting those who are most vulnerable public health madison and dane county began offering the vaccine monday its first two weeks of available appointments are already booked according to a statement released wednesday morning the public health department emphasized it would not schedule appointments without sufficient vaccines in stock according to morgan finke a spokesperson for phmdc dane county is able to vaccinate a maximum of 75 people per week because vaccination for monkeypox is a two dose series the number in stock has been cut in half to accommodate the second doses due in four weeks time we re hoping to increase that as soon as we get more access finke said and i do know that there are plans to scale that up as we move along and even in a much smaller milwaukee county community slots to get vaccines are all filled the cudahy health department s started offering the vaccine wednesday and also has clinics planned for friday and tuesday the spots filled up very quickly public health manager teresa ortiz said health officials there have not scheduled additional clinics at this time but plan to schedule more when additional doses are made available as of noon on tuesday wisconsin has 22 presumed cases of monkeypox according to the wisconsin department of health services dhs identified three priority groups for vaccination those who have had sexual relations in the last two weeks with someone diagnosed with monkeypox people who have attended an event or venue with known monkeypox exposure and notably gay and bisexual men trans men and women gender non conforming people and any man who has had sex with men in the last 14 days finke with dane county said the department is underscoring that people who have had exposure must get vaccinated within a 14 day window she said it has a certain number of reserves for those individuals who fall into this critical category that supply issue is a problem for many in the lgbtq community especially gay and bisexual men and trans men and women who want to stay safe as states across the country declare monkeypox a medical emergency for marginalized and minoritized populations it often takes one person who gets the message that there s a barrier a hurdle something not available to them warren scherer director of the gender and sexuality campus center at university of wisconsin madison said that message ripples across the community in a variety of ways it ramps up the fear according to the cdc 99 of male patients diagnosed with monkeypox with information on sexual activity reported male to male sexual contact with the caveat that publicly reported data are still missing but the spread is not exclusively among men who have sex with men anyone can get monkeypox but because it is not easily spread from person to person public health experts maintain there is no immediate risk to the general public the virus spreads through close intimate physical contact i think one important piece of information to get out to the public is that the risk to the general public is low and therefore the vaccine is not recommended for everyone ortiz said for those who are eligible but waiting on more vaccines to become available ortiz recommended that people avoid having sex with their partners if they have monekypox ortiz also recommended people avoid handling or touching the bedding or clothing of an infected person people who are exposed to monkeypox should monitor for symptoms for 21 days and contact their doctor immediately if they develop any she said washing your hands with soap and water or using an alcohol based hand sanitizer is enough to kill the monkeypox virus condoms do not prevent the spread of the virus more monkeypox has spread to wisconsin here s what you need to know about the disease and how to avoid it at froedtert hospital in milwaukee medical director for infection prevention and control dr mary beth graham said wednesday the hospital has been allocated 150 first doses of the vaccine and expects to receive them later this week the state is also holding 150 second doses to deliver to froedtert at a later time graham said she s hopeful they ll be able to start vaccinating people at two health centers run by froedtert and the medical college of wisconsin next week mcw serves as one of five monkeypox vaccine hubs for dhs the others are ssm health mayo clinic health system in eau claire the state agency s headquarters in madison and prevea health with these hubs in place individual health care providers do not store monkeypox vaccines at this time said dr ashok rai ceo of prevea health in an email wednesday public health officials have stated that if you think you have monkeypox you should communicate closely with your doctor and keep them apprised of developing symptoms most people isolate until they recover in the meantime they should avoid

after 13 years at least three crashes dozens of scams and ponzi schemes and hundreds of billions of dollars made and evaporated cryptocurrencies finally have the full attention of congress whose lawmakers and lobbyists have papered capitol hill with proposals on how to regulate the industry the latest bipartisan proposal came wednesday from sen debbie stabenow d michigan and top republican member sen john boozman of arkansas which would hand the regulatory authority of bitcoin and ether to the commodities futures trading commission that would be in contrast with bills proposed by other members of congress and consumer advocates who have suggested giving the authority to the securities and exchange commission related what is cryptocurrency this year crypto investors have seen prices plunge and companies crater with fortunes and jobs disappearing overnight and some firms have been accused by federal regulators of running an illegal securities exchange bitcoin the largest digital asset trades at a fraction of its all time high down from more than 68 000 in november 2021 to about 23 000 on wednesday wrapped bitcoin logo displayed on a phone screen and representation of bitcoin are seen in this illustration photo taken in krakow poland on june 10 2022 jakub porzycki nurphoto via getty images while cryptocurrencies have had crashes before most recently in 2018 this crash has been broader and more systemic a major hedge fund filed for bankruptcy earlier this summer which in turn has caused other cryptocurrency brokers to collapse as well some crypto brokers have falsely claimed that its customers deposits are backed by deposit insurance like a bank lawmakers who have run out of patience with the cryptocurrency industry s attempts to live out an unregulated libertarian bank free world are now desperate to implement stringent oversight the industry spent 9 million in 2021 on lobbying fees according to a report by public citizen a figure that is certain to be higher with all the congressional proposals this year related cryptocurrency prices collapse wiping out billions of dollars the stabenow boozman bill would be a win for the cryptocurrency industry who see the cftc as more industry friendly regulator than the sec the cftc which a budget last year of 304 million with roughly 666 employees is a fraction of the size of the sec which had a budget of nearly 2 billion and 4 500 full time employees the cryptocurrency industry is trying to get anyone other than the sec to regulate them said cory klippsten ceo of swan bitcoin while an advocate for bitcoin klippsten is deeply skeptical of much of broader crypto industry which has produced a myriad of tokens and other coins that he considers to be nothing more than scams in a press conference stabenow and boozman both acknowledged that the while they have faith that the cftc is up to the task of regulating cryptocurrencies the agency would need support the bill attempts to alleviate this issue by imposing on the crypto industry user fees which in turn would fund more robust supervision of the industry by the cftc related bitcoin tumbles a stablecoin plunges in wild week in crypto obviously if the ctfc is to move aggressively in this area they are going to need more resources stabenow said the legislation can be added to the list of proposals that have come out of congress this year sens cory booker d n j and john thune r s d are also co sponsors of the stabenow boozman bill booker has publicly advocated for the cryptocurrency industry particularly because black americans and other racial minorities are more statistically likely to invest in crypto compared to traditional investments like stocks and bonds sen pat toomey r pa in april introduced legislation called the stablecoin trust act that would create a framework to regulate stablecoins which have seen massive losses this year stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency pegged to a specific value usually the u s dollar another currency or gold additionally in june sens kirsten gillibrand d n y and cynthia lummis r wyo proposed a wide ranging bill called the responsible financial innovation act related scammers steal 1 2m in cryptocurrency from bloomfield township man that bill proposed legal definitions of digital assets and virtual currencies would require the irs to adopt guidance on merchant acceptance of digital assets and charitable contributions and would make a distinction between digital assets that are commodities and those that are securities which has not been done along with the toomey legislation and the lummis gillibrand legislation a proposal is being worked out in the house financial services committee though those negotiations have stalled committee chair maxine waters d calif said last month that while she top republican member patrick mchenry of north carolina and treasury secretary janet yellen had made considerable progress toward an agreement on the legislation we are unfortunately not there yet and will therefore continue our negotiations over the august recess president joe biden s working group on financial markets last november issued a report calling on congress to pass legislation that would regulate stablecoins and biden earlier this year issued an executive order calling on a variety of agencies to look at ways to regulate digital assets

s more important now than ever to review your retirement plan with a fiduciary financial advisor here s why the pandemic has shown us just how quickly decades of planning investing and saving can be completely upended this could mean your current financial plan might leave you without enough money to last your retirement additionally emotionally charged decisions to sell off large quantities of stocks or other investments now lock in your losses removing any chance for future growth research suggests people who work with a financial advisor feel more at ease about their finances and could end up with about 15 more money to spend in retirement 1 consider this example a recent vanguard study found that on average a hypothetical 500k investment would grow to over 3 4 million under the care of an advisor over 25 years whereas the expected value from self management would be 1 69 million or 50 less in other words an advisor managed portfolio would average 8 annualized growth over a 25 year period compared to 5 from a self managed portfolio 2 a 2020 northwestern mutual study found that 71 of u s adults admit their financial planning needs improvement however only 29 of americans work with a financial advisor 3 assuming 5 annualized growth of 500k portfolio vs 8 annualized growth of advisor managed portfolio over 25 years the hypothetical study discussed above assumes a 5 net

marin tomas getty images stock photo scranton kan officials in scranton kansas suspect heat played a role in the death of a 2 year old who died after being found unresponsive in a car sunday afternoon it would mark the 14th hot car death this year based on data from kids and cars safety a national nonprofit that tracks hot car deaths and aims to prevent vehicle related risks to children and pets osage county sheriff chris wells said the child apparently got into the car by themself and had not been left in there by an adult the topeka capital journal reported details on the child s name and gender have not yet been released every year approximately 38 children die from being left in a hot car according to kids and cars safety with 87 of them age 3 and under as the u s copes with more heat waves this summer and temperatures in the midwest south and west continue to soar into the triple digits there is a concern for parents about hot car deaths one parent peter hansen opened up about the issue on social media i have severe anxiety about leaving our kids in a hot car on accident hansen a father of three in chicago wrote in a linkedin post it s 100 degrees in chicago today and the heat is intense across the country working from home has me multitasking more than usual which can distract me from the kids some days especially if driving on a work call this is simply a post to make sure your kids are not left in your car in this heat the 40 year old told good morning america an episode with two of his three kids one morning gave him a scare and prompted him to reflect on the dangers of hot cars and how easily things can go wrong we got doughnuts and came back in the house hansen recalled it s still 7 in the morning it wasn t 100 degrees yet but five minutes later i was in the house and my 4 year old walked through the door five minutes later she s like daddy you forgot me and it was like i swear i saw her get out of the car but i was like oh my gosh it really terrified me that i thought both of them got out of the car together like they normally do why do hot car deaths happen amber rollins a director at kids and cars safety said the issue is often misunderstood and even dismissed by many parents and caregivers i think the no 1 misconception is that this will never happen to me and that it only happens to bad parents and nothing could be further from the truth rollins told gma i ve worked with families that this has happened to for 16 years and they are engineers school teachers principals nurses doctors you name it it s the type of people that i aspire to be as a parent the kind that read every safety book about the most expensive car seat and strapped him in so tight and covered every outlet that s the kind of person this is happening to according to rollins hot car deaths have also been trending upwards for the last three decades with an exception during the last two years of the pandemic when more families stayed at home in the 90s we realized children were being killed by overpowered airbags and children are still safer riding in the back seat we moved them to the back seat because that s where they re the safest however now they re out of sight of the driver rollins explained so they re in the back seat they re rear facing now until age 3 or even longer depending on the size of the child and that car seat looks the same for the driver whether there s a baby in there or not this is not like parents didn t just all of a sudden overnight become neglectful and irresponsible she added this is an unintended consequence of moving them to the back seat how to prevent hot car deaths multiple solutions have been proposed to avert a hot car death before they occur among the high tech options include carbon dioxide detection lidar or light detection and ranging technology car alarm systems car camera systems and car seats with weight sensors each with its own pros and cons a new idea called cabin awareness from toyota would use radar technology powered in part by a car s battery to notify drivers who have left a toyota vehicle that a child or a pet remained inside the car brian kursar chief technology officer for toyota connected north america and toyota motor north america has led the cabin awareness project since its inception in 2018 and said the project is moving now toward a testing phase with may mobility a michigan based company that develops autonomous technology including vehicles the cabin awareness concept uses millimeter wave radar to detect micro movements and so micro movements really are the things that a camera can t see so it s also able to understand breathing heartbeat and ultimately provides us a solution to something that we ve not been able to really touch which is the ability to understand life in a vehicle kursar explained to gma adding that radar could see through things like cloth and go beyond a camera s line of sight toyota s cabin awareness could link up to a driver s cell phone a smart device such as smart lights a smart speaker or smart tv inside their home or possibly other toyota vehicles in an environment such as a parking lot and ultimately contact emergency services when other alerts go unanswered based on our algorithms we re able to understand where in the vehicle that movement is coming from and then we re able to now take a number of options to escalate to let the customer know that there is life potentially at risk in a vehicle kursar said we see this as an opportunity not just to contact the customer you can give the system a list of contacts such as grandma right such as your neighbor right and these are additional folks that can start helping to resolve this problem with the vehicle kursar added maybe we can now do a vehicle to vehicle ping to say if you re within proximity of a child or an adult at risk in a car now you have this almost community outreach where people in their cars they turn on their cars and it says a green sienna within your proximity may be at risk for heat exhaustion for now cabin awareness is not available in toyota vehicles just yet and the timeline for a potential rollout will depend on testing results in the meantime kids and cars safety s rollins recommends several solutions that parents can keep in mind and adopt this summer adopt the look before you lock habit we want to use that habit system to prevent it from happening rollins said no matter what even if the child is not with you open the back door and check the back seat every single time you leave the car it takes two seconds she continued and it s a great way to make sure you re never forgetting anything including your children or inanimate objects that aren t as important but make that a 100 habit in addition to being left in a car a child or pet can gain access to a car when they re unlocked so rollins also emphasized the importance of utilizing car door locks you want to keep your car locked 100 of the time even if you don t have children little ones can get into neighbors cars it happens all the time you want to keep keys and remote openers out of reach of children 100 of the time and childproof your home you want to check the inside trunk and floorboards of all vehicles in the area immediately even if they re locked rollins added a lot of times kiddos will get in and they try to

over the distribution for the second quarter of 2021 reaffirmed full year 2022 financial guidance which includes net income loss in the range of a 30 million net loss to 10 million of net income adjusted ebitda in the range of 230 million to 270 million and full year 2022 dividend of 3 62 per share announced four contract additions with customers across a range of use cases with terms and conditions reflecting the current strong pricing environment for wood biomass conversion of an mou with an industrial products customer to a take or pay off take contract with a tenor of 15 years and deliveries starting in 2023 volumes anticipated to ramp to approximately 600 000 metric tons per year mtpy by 2031 conversion of an loi with a german manufacturer to a take or pay off take contract

a new tranche of contracted deliveries to a longstanding european union based customer which is expected to total 720 000 incremental metric tons mt through 2027 for the second quarter of 2022 enviva delivered results at the top end of our expectations and i m pleased to report that many of the short term challenges we experienced in the first half of the year are proving either transitory or manageable over time said john keppler chairman and chief executive officer while the broader energy markets continue to demonstrate volatility and uncertainty we are excited to highlight the success we are realizing in near term higher priced sales and converting new customer opportunities into long term take or pay supply contracts with durable pricing increases including terms and conditions that should enable us to extend our track record of delivering stable cash flows that grow sustainably well into the future as a result we are not only on track to deliver a very strong back half of the year but as previously described we see material margin expansion for the business not only in 2023 but also in 2024 and beyond keppler continued the sheer volume and size of market opportunities with high quality counterparties across a range of use cases from renewable energy generation to displacement of fossil fuel based carbon in hard to abate industries is creating an unprecedented pace of contracting for us which in turn is underwriting the acceleration of our capacity expansions we have recently commenced construction of our plant in epes alabama we are making swift progress on our plans to start construction of a new plant in bond mississippi and we have recently filed for a permit for a highly accretive expansion of our ahoskie north carolina plant the growth in our production volume outlook coupled with the strong pricing environment for biomass is driving our expectations for an adjusted ebitda compound annual growth rate of over 25 from 2022 to 2024 this tremendous fully contracted growth profile combined with the strong stable dividend we are paying makes us well positioned to continue our track record of generating significant returns for our investors even in an environment of potential economic contraction second quarter 2022 financial results millions unless noted 2q22 2q21 recast presentation 2q21 non recast as reported net revenue 296 3 286 0 285 0

reconciliation of non gaap measures to their most directly comparable gaap measure please see the non gaap financial measures section below please refer to the non gaap financial measures section below for a description of recast and non recast presentations the recast presentation was required for gaap purposes due to the simplification transaction announced on october 15 2021 net revenue for the second quarter of 2022 was 296 3 million as compared to 286 0 million and 285 0 million for the second quarter of 2021 on a recast and non recast basis respectively the increase of approximately 4 year over year was driven primarily by an increase in average sales price per ton as a result of annual price escalators in our contracts as well as the elevated pricing environment for biomass enviva was able to help address dislocations in our customers and other producers supply chains during the second quarter of 2022 rescheduling certain contracted deliveries into future periods which enabled prompt deliveries at elevated pricing to other customers requiring incremental deliveries recent biomass spot market prices as well as forward curve prices in certain european indices have exceeded 300 per mt representing a substantial premium to the current long term contracted pricing of roughly 200 to 220 per mt across enviva s weighted average portfolio and we were able to capture some of that differential during the second quarter of 2022 net revenue for the second quarter of 2022 was dampened given the timing shift of two shipments from june to july which also drove higher than average finished product inventory at the end of the period adjusted gross margin was 54 8 million for the second quarter of 2022 as compared to 51 7 million and 56 1 million for the second quarter of 2021 on a recast and non recast basis respectively adjusted gross margin per mt agm mt for the second quarter of 2022 was 42 94 as compared to 37 80 and 41 02 per mt for the second quarter of 2021 on a recast and non recast basis respectively the year over year increase in both adjusted gross margin on a recast basis and agm mt was primarily driven by higher pricing due to the same factors which benefited net revenue during the period the year over year decrease in adjusted gross margin on a non recast basis is primarily due to a decrease in product sales volumes resulting from a reduction in procured volumes as a result of lower availability of third party pellets resulting from the war in ukraine and related sanctions adjusted ebitda for the second quarter of 2022 was 39 5 million as compared to 25 7 million and 48 9 million for the second quarter of 2021 on a recast and non recast basis respectively distributable cash flow dcf for the second quarter of 2022 was 21 3 million as compared to 5 7 million and 33 0 million for the second quarter of 2021 on a recast and non recast basis respectively enviva s liquidity as of june 30 2022 which included cash on hand including cash generally restricted to funding a portion of the costs of the acquisition construction equipping and financing of our epes plant and availability under our 570 0 million senior secured revolving credit facility was 184 1 million enviva s liquidity as of june 30 2022 does not include any proceeds resulting from the tax exempt green bonds issued in july 2022 notable capital markets activity in july 2022 the industrial development authority of sumter county alabama completed the issuance of 250 million in aggregate principal amount of tax exempt green bonds and loaned the proceeds to enviva the tax exempt green bonds which were issued at par bear an annual interest rate of 6 and mature in 2052 with the option for holders to redeem at par in 2032 the net proceeds to enviva of 246 million will be used to fund a portion of the costs associated with the acquisition construction equipping and financing of enviva s fully contracted wood pellet production plant currently under construction in epes alabama this is the first time enviva has accessed the municipal bond market which is expected to provide an attractive financing option for future greenfield projects including our planned production plant in bond mississippi for which the mississippi business finance corporation the proposed conduit issuer has approved an inducement resolution to issue similar tax exempt bonds to finance the project enviva also amended and restated its senior secured revolving credit facility the amended restated credit facility on june 30 2022 the amended restated credit facility extends the maturity to june 2027 from april 2026 and includes other improved terms and conditions which add incremental flexibility as compared to the terms of the credit facility prior to the amendment the amended terms and additional flexibility more appropriately reflect the conversion of the company from a master limited partnership to a corporation at the end of 2021 and the benefits of the increased scale diversification and accelerating growth plans of enviva while continuing to maintain the conservative financial policies to which the company is committed additionally on june 24 2022 enviva was added to both the russell 3000 and russell 1000 indices since enviva s conversion from a master limited partnership to a corporation on december 31 2021 enviva has significantly increased both its passive and international investor ownership which was a key objective of the simplification and corporate conversion transactions dividend on august 3 2022 enviva s board of directors declared a dividend of 0 905 per share for the second quarter of 2022 an increase of 11 over the corresponding period in 2021 the quarterly dividend will be paid on friday august 26 2022 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on monday august 15 2022 the dividend declared for the second quarter of 2022 is consistent with enviva s dividend guidance for 2022 enviva expects to pay a dividend of 3 62 per share for full year 2022 with quarterly dividends of 0 905 per share expected to be declared for the remaining two quarters of 2022 2022 guidance millions unless noted

presented on a recast basis for net loss and a non recast basis for adjusted ebitda and dcf 3 not meaningful similar to previous years we expect net income adjusted ebitda and dcf for the second half of 2022 to be significantly higher than for the first half of the year due to the predictable seasonality in our business as well as in this case the ramp of production at our newest plant in lucedale mississippi like previous years we also expect over two thirds of our forecasted annual adjusted ebitda to be generated in the second half of 2022 importantly we are projecting a significant step up in results for the fourth quarter of 2022 as compared to the third quarter of 2022 based on what we know today we are projecting adjusted ebitda for the third quarter of 2022 to be roughly 50 higher than results for the second quarter of 2022 with the fourth quarter of 2022 alone representing around 40 of 2022 adjusted ebitda in addition to our increased production and improving supply chain conditions the constructive pricing environment particularly in europe is expected to not only provide modest opportunities late in the year to drive incremental margin and cash flow but also set the stage for a substantial increase in annual adjusted ebitda for 2023 and beyond said thomas meth president put simply the price escalation and pass through provisions in our contracts are durable and effective and we are realizing price increases at a higher rate than the cost pressures we have seen within portions of our operations given the cost reductions we see in some of the transitory costs notably logistics and diesel and the structural cost reductions we are generating from improved fixed cost absorption across our asset base we expect material margin expansion over the next twelve to eighteen months and beyond enviva reaffirmed its capital expenditures guidance range for full year 2022 of 255 million to 275 million inclusive of capitalized interest currently enviva is evaluating a potential increase to its capital expenditures guidance range related to the opportunity to accelerate purchases of long lead time equipment associated with the construction of enviva s greenfield plant in bond mississippi enviva continues to expect to build new plants at a project level return of an approximately 5 times adjusted ebitda investment multiple as we outlined when we announced our simplification and conversion transactions 2022 represents a transition year for us as we settle into our new corporate structure and commence the execution of our plans to double in size over the next five years we are very pleased with our recent tax exempt green bond financing which not only provides attractive financing today but also offers a replicable structure for future greenfield project financing down the road said shai even executive vice president and chief financial officer we are projecting meaningful year over year step changes in the cash flow generation of our asset base as we bring new fully contracted capacity online in a favorable pricing environment for our products going forward our capital allocation policy is focused on reinvesting retained cash flows into our business while maintaining ample liquidity and conservative leverage and preserving a stable dividend that has the opportunity to grow over time contracting and market update in the current geopolitical environment customers purchasing decisions are being driven by both the urgent need to decarbonize their supply chains while seeking to secure reliable affordable low carbon feedstocks over the long term countries and companies are not only facing extremely high and volatile fossil fuel prices while they navigate toward net zero goals but they now also need to revisit the long term security of supply for the carbon feedstocks they are sourcing this congruence creates an increased ability to pay for our customers but is further complicated by the fact that there are limited large scale alternatives available for renewable baseload and dispatchable power and heat generation and even fewer low carbon feedstocks to substitute in hard to abate sectors as a result our current customers are increasingly looking for supply in a structurally short market and are willing and able to collaborate with suppliers like enviva to develop mutually beneficial solutions including pricing new contracted volumes at terms more reflective of the current pricing environment in which pricing for prompt delivery of biomass has almost doubled in the past year and also at times repricing original contracted volumes at a significant premium to our historical weighted average contract prices in consideration of the overall transaction today enviva announced the conversion of an mou with a european industrial customer to a take or pay off take contract pursuant to which enviva will supply wood pellets to be used in facilities across continental europe and the united kingdom as a replacement feedstock for lignite coal and natural gas in the manufacturing of an industrial product enviva announced this mou in february 2022 and as expected the binding contract was completed within six months of the mou signing initial shipments are expected to start during 2023 with planned volumes ramping to approximately 600 000 mtpy by 2031 the contract has a 15 year tenor and is subject to certain conditions precedent enviva also announced the conversion of the loi signed in may 2022 to a binding take or pay off take contract with a new german industrial customer that intends to use enviva s wood pellets to phase out fossil fuels and generate green process heat in manufacturing facilities in germany the initial shipment is expected to be delivered during the third quarter of 2022 with delivered volumes expected to be approximately 60 000 mtpy this contract which serves a new industrial vertical for enviva has a 10 year tenor and is subject to certain conditions precedent furthermore enviva announced the signing of a binding take or pay off take contract with another new german customer to provide wood pellets to be used primarily in thermal heating systems the contract has a 5 year tenor with planned volumes ramping to approximately 150 000 mtpy subject to certain conditions precedent the initial shipment is expected to be delivered during the second half of 2022 additionally enviva announced the upsizing of a contract with a longstanding european union based customer under which deliveries of an incremental 720 000 mt are expected over the contract s remaining term through 2027 at prices that more closely reflect the favorable current market environment incremental volumes are expected to be supplied largely from our expanding production capacity consistent with the strategy we have outlined enviva continues to steadily diversify its customer base not only by the number of companies served but also the geographies in which they are located and the industries in which they operate as of july 1 2022 enviva s total weighted average remaining term of take or pay off take contracts is approximately 14 5 years with a total contracted revenue backlog of over 21 billion this contracted revenue backlog is complemented by a customer sales pipeline exceeding 40 billion which includes contracts in various stages of negotiation our customer sales pipeline comprises long term take or pay off take opportunities in our traditional markets for biomass fired power and heat generation in geographies ranging from the united kingdom to the european union including opportunities in germany and poland to asia including incremental demand in japan and emerging potential in taiwan as well as in developing industrial segments across the globe including steel cement lime chemicals sustainable aviation fuel saf biomethanol and biodiesel we are negotiating long term wood pellet supply contracts with several leading industrial companies in each of these hard to abate sectors that are actively and urgently pursing large scale decarbonization over the next 12 months we expect to progress negotiations and convert several sales pipeline opportunities including mous into binding contracts expected to represent approximately 1 5 million to 2 million mtpy european union progress on the renewable energy directive update european union policymakers have long recognized that sustainable biomass is a renewable low carbon baseload and dispatchable heat and power source today bioenergy accounts for almost 60 of renewable energy used in europe addressing each of the urgent and critical issues facing the eu decarbonization affordability and security of its energy supply eu policymakers are currently updating the renewable energy directive red iii which was put in place in 2009 and revised in 2018 red ii and establishes common rules and targets for the development of renewable energy across all sectors of the economy to help the eu reach its ambitious energy and climate goals these were increased by the european green deal with the goal of reducing net greenhouse gas emissions by 55 by 2030 red iii is part of a package amending or creating 15 climate and energy laws to increase and accelerate climate mitigation which includes reviewing existing criteria for sustainable biomass the final law will be a negotiated piece of legislation reflecting a compromise position of the trilogue which includes the eu parliament eu council of ministers council and eu commission both the council and the commission have published proposals and positions on red iii which outline which renewable energy sources qualify for subsidies and keep the biomass sustainability framework from red ii largely intact the proposal from the eu parliament will likely be finalized this fall in a plenary session we were encouraged by the recent vote of the eu parliament s industry research and energy itre committee making further progress on the proposal in particular their decision to expand the scenarios under which power only plants using forest biomass can continue to receive support this step demonstrates the alignment of the itre committee not only with four of the six other eu parliament committees but also the council and the commission on the importance of sustainable biomass to the eu s efforts to mitigate climate change according to leading scientific advisory panels and policy makers in order for the eu to reach their objective of climate neutrality by 2050 biomass use in power and heat plants alone will need to double as such we strongly believe that the final compromise on the biomass sustainability criteria will remain consistent with enviva s practices and the leading academic and scientific research and data which has consistently supported the essential role of sustainable bioenergy as a climate change solution germany s chancellor olaf scholz recently said we have to get out of coal oil and gas we will now ensure that the expansion of renewable energies finally moves forward wind power on the high seas on land solar energy biomass we need all of these to produce electricity and to be able to produce hydrogen so that we have an industrial future without co 2 emissions chancellor scholz has pledged that germany will proceed with its plan for adoption of renewable sources such as wind biomass solar energy and hydrogen to reach net zero emissions by 2045 taiwan recently the taiwan power company taipower taiwan s state owned electric company announced plans to convert a large coal fired unit of the hsinta power plant to biomass in order to meet the taiwanese government s policy objectives around increasing renewable energy generation the project is scheduled to produce approximately 3 000 gigawatt hours of renewable energy after 2025 which translates into demand for roughly 1 8 million mt of biomass annually given enviva s size scale and track record delivering into the asian market we expect to be an important partner in taipower s biomass supply chain it s an incredible time to be a global leader in bioenergy as we not only play a valuable role in the large scale decarbonization efforts of utilities and hard to abate industries but we are also playing an important role as customers urgently secure long term affordable carbon feedstocks said thomas meth president we are seeing very encouraging progress in taiwan and today we are announcing our first binding contracts with german counterparties which is an exciting milestone as germany represents a significant market for us going forward today s contracts and the continued increases in demand from our existing utility counterparts also underscore the confidence our customers have in the european union s ongoing support for biomass as a critical pathway to achieving eu climate change goals sustainability update on july 13 2022 enviva launched the enviva heirs property fund ehpf which is dedicated to combating involuntary land loss in the u s southeast through the ehpf initiative enviva is committing 250 000 on an annual basis and will work with families and landowners to achieve clear title unlock sustainable land value and advocate for public policy that supports land retention for disenfranchised families this initiative is another example of enviva s unrelenting commitment to making a positive impact in the communities and states in which we operate as previously announced enviva entered into a partnership with mitsui o s k lines mol to develop and deploy an environmentally friendly bulk carrier the goal of the agreement is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the ocean transportation of sustainable wood pellets with one of the projects being the wind challenger a cargo ship design with a hard sail that harnesses wind energy recently mol announced its first installation of the hard sail system on board a bulk carrier and is now ready to proceed to the commissioning stage and sea trials the first hard sail equipped vessel is slated for delivery in october 2022 when it is expected to start transporting cargoes asset update enviva is making solid progress on our path to more than double production capacity over the next five years from 6 2 million mtpy to approximately 13 million mtpy enviva s lucedale mississippi plant the first plant in our pascagoula cluster continues to ramp production and is on track to reach nameplate capacity of 750 000 mtpy by the end of this year recently we commenced construction of the fully contracted 1 1 million mtpy plant in epes alabama the second plant in our pascagoula cluster we also formally announced plans to build the third plant in our pascagoula cluster in bond mississippi subject to receiving the necessary permits our facility in bond will be our next state of the art manufacturing facility with capacity to produce more than one million mtpy of wood pellets and similar to the lucedale and epes plants will export from our terminal at the port of pascagoula enviva is also progressing plans for an accretive expansion at our ahoskie north carolina plant consistent with our recently announced project to increase production capacity by approximately 45 from 410 000 mtpy to 600 000 mtpy subject to receiving the necessary permits our business model of fully contracting plants and expansions before commencing construction remains unchanged given the current pace of contracting with new and existing customers enviva plans to accelerate the timing of a fourth wood pellet production plant in our pascagoula cluster we continue to make progress in our evaluation of site location options and anticipate making a decision by year end 2022 we also are in the process of securing sites in both georgia and south carolina and will continue the evaluation process in the coming months to determine which site is most suitable for a new greenfield project in our savannah cluster consistent with prior updates we expect enviva s previously announced multi plant expansions to be completed by year end 2022 second quarter 2022 earnings call details enviva will

rogue valley microdevices workers fabricate microchips at rogue valley microdevices the 280b investment package is intended to bolster domestic microchip production and observers are cautiously optimistic about how the investment will affect intel and other chip makers share this article last week congress passed a landmark act intended to increase domestic semiconductor production but whether it will help intel and oregon remains to be seen president joe biden is expected to sign the chips science act a 280 billion bipartisan spending package to boost the domestic semiconductor production following its passage in both chambers of congress last week the bill s name is an acronym for creating helpful incentives to produce semiconductors and includes 52 billion in subsidies to companies manufacturing microchips domestically and another 200 billion for research into computer related fields including quantum computing artificial intelligence and robotics the bill could act as a lifeline for intel which reported 22 year over year revenue decline at the end of july and whose stock prices plummeted this summer to a 52 week low but its effect on oregon is in question particularly after announced factory expansions in arizona and ohio shocking oregon legislators hoping to expand chip production in state optimists say oregon workforce development opportunities and its research and development sector will put it the state position to reap the rewards rep suzanne bonamici d or a member of the house science space and technology committee and vocal supporter of the chips act tells oregon business the bill s investment in research and development gives intel reason to invest in its home state rep suzanne bonamici d or one thing intel does a lot of here in oregon and will continue to do is research and development says bonamici who adds that of the 52 billion allocated to microchip manufacturers 11 billion is allocated for research and development projects she points to intel s 700 million 200 000 square foot hillsboro data center research lab expansion as evidence the company plans to expand its oregon footprint bonamici says that workforce development is also a major part of the bill addressing a critical need oregon tech manufacturers have reported talent shortages for microelectronic workers since 2021 the shortage led intel to develop programs for hiring students still in school the bill allocates 200 million for the chips america workforce and education fund this funding will support microelectronic workforce development activities of the national science foundation bonamici pointed to portland community college s semiconductor manufacturing workforce program as a way oregon is already solving its workforce challenges while making sure high paying tech sector jobs are available to historically marginalized groups there are good jobs in terms of fabrication construction and design making sure everyone benefits from this is really going to make a difference bonamici says we want to make sure jobs in in these fields are available to those groups who have historically left behind the chips act also contains the coastal and ocean acidification research which the congresswoman introduced and innovation act and the building steam education act which she sponsored the coastal and ocean acidification research and innovation act provides resources to coastal communities and research and development opportunities to monitor ocean health which bonamici says will directly benefit those living on the oregon coast she says the steam bill which adds arts and creativity to conventional stem education will create more innovative students and workers able to address challenges of the future david lee vice president of semiconductor at colorado based coorstek says the chips act goes beyond helping intel oregon is also home to lam research a key company that manufactures the equipment used to produce chips as well as a coorstek facility that manufactures specialized ceramic materials that are used in their microchips the entire supply chain that supports semiconductor manufacturing stands to benefit from the chips act lee writes in an email to ob incidentally coorstek currently has open positions in our hillsboro facility a direct example of how a robust semiconductor industry supports oregon oregon exported 15 billion in electronics in 2021 totaling 60 of the state s exports reflecting high demand for microchips jessica gomez ceo of rogue valley microdevices who sought the republican nomination for governor in 2022 tells ob the chips act may be pushing up against the state s current ability to grow gomez says oregon s regulatory environment and undeveloped workforce is not positioned to take advantage of all the spending opportunities the chips act provides jessica gomez ceo of rogue valley microdevices credit jason kaplan we were now looking at some pretty decent incentives for chip makers when you have a situation where someone says they are going to foot the bill to the tune of 25 it s pretty hard for a builder to ignore says gomez and we are seeing different states are working really hard to attract those new facilities states like ohio and florida have a pretty good head start on us she says she is not surprised intel has chosen to invest in other states gomez says oregon has kept pace by offering companies incentives but the state s environmental regulations high tax rate and land use laws disincentivize companies from making large investments in the region gomez also says oregon universities have lagged behind in developing chip manufacturing programs to develop the workforce to fill open chipmaking positions she says she has had to source out of state employees for her medford factory workers since state universities do not produce sufficient workforce to meet demand she says initiatives like pcc s program and future ready oregon a 200 million investment package that supports education and training for next generation jobs like chip production are a good start but that these initiatives will take some time before they reach their full potential in the meantime she thinks chip makers looking to make long term investments may look elsewhere skip newberry president and ceo of the technology association of oregon presents a different view he says state workforce development and community college programs make businesses view oregon as a place committed to a long term investment in the future of tech production having a center of excellence like the oregon manufacturing innovation center and future ready oregon plan is fantastic for oregon and we are looking for opportunities to further scale and expand that says newberry it used to be there was this notion that you had to have like a phd to be able to work in the semiconductor industry increasingly our community colleges workforce system and higher ed are paying attention to how we provide certifications and making sure more people are getting access to these career opportunities he adds where talent is being developed and is staying and is relocating that s where companies are going to

duckwrth performs on stage at lollapalooza saturday july 30 2022 at grant park in chicago il photo by barry brecheisen following it s run as a touring tastemaker for alternative music between 1991 and 1997 and again in 2003 lollapalooza settled in chicago s grant park as a two day destination festival in 2005 expanding to three days the following year and to four in 2016 each chicago installment defined by an increasingly diverse array of artists during that initial chicago incarnation the lineup still skewed heavily alternative with headlining performances by artists like weezer the killers and a reunited pixies alternative emo group dashboard confessional hit the main stage on day one five years removed from their debut album the swiss army romance it was always a big deal but it did feel slightly more homespun maybe boutiquey in an artisanal way said dashboard confessional singer chris carrabba saturday prior to a performance on the coinbase stage observing how lollapalooza has evolved over 17 years in the windy city it s always been about community community of bands community of fans all of that coming together but then there were these weird moments of grandeur that you remember i remember we were about here where we re sitting and billy idol came in to do a press conference and he took his shirt off and it was just very charismatic it was like oh right ok there s that this is big rock and roll chris carrabba of dashboard confessional poses in the artist lounge at lollapalooza saturday july 30 2022 at grant park in chicago il photo by barry brecheisen in 2020 dashboard confessional launched a 20th anniversary tour that was ultimately cut short amidst pandemic releasing their ninth studio album all the truth that i can tell earlier this year on tour alongside andrew mcmahon in the wilderness armor for sleep cartel and the juliana theory carrabba is acutely aware 20 is not a point most groups reach nobody thinks about that you know for a fact that s not going to be the case said the singer i remember thinking to myself if i do everything right here maybe i could do this for five years and feeling like that would be an amazing accomplishment and a beautiful accomplishment to have and then i could get on with the business of living a quote unquote regular life and feel really fulfilled from that experience carrabba said i just can t believe that i ve never had to get a square job after that i m in awe of it and i m really grateful quite frankly at the risk of sounding too earnest though i famously will always risk that i m really grateful to have this and shocked i hope i get another 20 years gracie abrams performs on stage at lollapalooza saturday july 30 2022 at grant park in chicago il photo by barry brecheisen fresh off her first ever tour as opening act for pop mega star olivia rodrigo in mid sized clubs and theaters across america l a singer songwriter gracie abrams made her lollapalooza debut saturday on the discord stage backed by a two piece band during a 45 minute set where lyrics mattered can you believe this is lollapalooza and we re all here abrams asked the audience i m so overwhelmed by you showing up following better abrams moved to her right sitting down at the keyboards as she delivered the emotive lead vocal on minor waving to a group of fans assembled on the side of the stage abrams also pointed fans in the direction of the national network of abortion funds which seeks to promote a more open conversation on the subject gracie abrams poses backstage at lollapalooza saturday july 30 2022 at grant park in chicago il photo by barry brecheisen we had our aftershow last night but this is my very first time playing and attending so it s all very new to me said abrams backstage taking stock of her lollapalooza experience prior to her set it was unbelievable it was the greatest learning experience of my life and it ripped me right out of my comfort zone but i have made the best friends that i have she said of the rodrigo tour meeting everyone that comes to the shows has been the coolest thing that i ve ever been a part of abrams 22 has frequently mentioned artists like joni mitchell and simon garfunkel as influences saturday at lollapalooza she added aaron dessner of the national drilling down on the importance of storytelling as she continues to grow as a songwriter and artist narrative is the coolest thing to me storytelling and passing that down is one of the most human things that we can do she said and to learn as a fan of music from the greatest songwriters of all time is something that i hope to continue to do for the rest of my life duckwrth poses backstage at lollapalooza saturday july 30 2022 at grant park in chicago il photo by barry brecheisen one of the highlights of the weekend was a late afternoon performance by singer dancer rapper and artist duckwrth who took to the discord stage for an energetic uplifting 45 minutes following tour dates alongside billie eilish duckwrth made his return to lollapalooza for the first time since 2018 chicago i feel like we re getting closer today he said setting up coming closer a beautifully rhythmic affair which saw him backed by a full band the highly danceable power power coming later in addition to self expression an array of influences spill out during duckwrth s lollapalooza set a sound defined by an immediate catchiness that belies what he was hearing early on duckwrth poses backstage at lollapalooza saturday july 30 2022 at grant park in chicago il photo by barry brecheisen mainly gospel gospel and classical my mom wouldn t allow me to listen to much of anything else so not being classically trained but hearing those complex compositions and super musicality it definitely built my ear he explained saturday it s a fact that most modern music came from gospel r b soul pop they still use gospel arrangements in certain ways so the fact that there s so many genres that came from that lets you know how thick and layered and intentional and how powerful the music was duckwrth studied graphic design at san francisco s academy of arts and applies the idea of branding to everything from his look and sound to the presentation of his music a significant impact on the storytelling that ties much of it together i think you need to have kind of like a stitch between everything where the songs are not just random assorted thoughts it s best to have some type of theme in mind because it helps a person walk through it duckwrth explained it s like anything else a lot of what we take in as entertainment in everything that we watch has some type of plot there s a beginning climax end and crescendo branding continues the story having a stitch between the music the visuals the performance what you wear your color palette your font type it s everything but i think it s important to tell the story coin performs on stage at lollapalooza saturday july 30 2022 at grant park in chicago il photo by barry brecheisen performing on the tito s stage at grant park s petrillo music shell nashville s coin rocked out in front of a fun backdrop with a summer vibe a video screen flanked by grassy hills and a giant ladybug one of the weekend s cooler stagings with fans still streaming in early in the set the band performed in front of one of the larger crowds at petrillo all weekend rolling out the gnarly guitar riff that defines one of the summer s biggest alternative hits in chapstick second in the set on the group s fourth full length album uncanny valley released at the end of march the impact of technology on the human experience emerges as a theme tying together 14 songs written during the pandemic left to right chase lawrence joe memmel and ryan winnen of coin pose backstage at lollapalooza saturday july 30 2022 at grant park in chicago il photo by barry brecheisen we explored this idea of kind of writing from a more objective standpoint and using artificial intelligence as almost a literary device explained singer chase lawrence before coin s set we re just a collection of our own experiences but it was fun to kind of play dress up and write from a different perspective a lot of the time we would actually just treat ourselves like we were the ai our brains were the engine and we would input gorillaz rolling stones talking heads the cure put all these things in the human blender and just see what came out and i think it s the most uniquely coin thing to date he said summing up uncanny valley humans made the parts but that is technically how we went about it blurring the lines added guitarist joseph memmel blurring the lines big time lawrence agreed that was the first day we started writing for the album he said recalling chapstick s formative moments we used that like ai device where we were like ok we are the computer let s write from this objective standpoint let s see what happens if we write from like this idea of artificial intelligence having the first kiss we said rolling stones start me up versus gorillaz feel good inc that s what we re putting into our engine and we just pressed compute two hours later that wacky song came out idles performs on stage at lollapalooza saturday july 30 2022 in chicago il photo by barry brecheisen one of saturday s most anticipated lollapalooza sets came courtesy of british rock act idles drawing on everything from noise rock to punk the group put forth a relentlessly raucous set during their hour on the bud light seltzer main stage hello said singer joe talbot are you ready to collide are you ready to love he asked the lollapalooza crowd good the vip section in front of the stage was virtually empty as the group got going in front of a throng of fans in chicago name checking stone cold steve austin and more during a rollicking take on colossus making their way out into the crowd a feedback drenched cacophony of sound greeted band members upon return to the stage idles making their way into car crash joe talbot left and mark bowen right of idles pose backstage at lollapalooza saturday july 30 2022 at grant park in chicago il photo by barry brecheisen we re very grateful we ve learned a lot about gratitude over the last few years said idles guitarist mark bowen about returning to the stage we knew how lucky we were in the pandemic and what we were coming back to so now we re just making sure that we show that gratitude with gumption and writing following a frenzied thursday night aftershow the focus for talbot three hours before idles saturday evening performance was squarely on the live set the shows are always great in between is always alright he said with a smirk to be honest apart from playing i

rep david cicilline d r i michael brochstein zuma press newscom a week before the house of representatives approved a ban on assault weapons a federal judge in denver explained why such laws are unlikely to pass constitutional muster house democrats either were not paying attention or did not care because they view the second amendment as an outmoded provision that imposes no meaningful limits on gun control unfortunately for them the supreme court has repeatedly held otherwise ruling that the government may not prohibit law abiding americans from keeping handguns at home or carrying them in public for self defense the court also has said the second amendment covers bearable arms in common use for lawful purposes which presents a problem for democrats who want to ban many of the most popular rifles sold in the united states on july 22 u s district judge raymond p moore an appointee of former president barack obama issued a temporary restraining order that bars superior colorado from enforcing its ban on assault weapons the city defines that category to include semi automatic center fire rifles that accept detachable magazines and have any of four features a pistol grip a folding or telescoping stock a flash suppressor or a barrel shroud two gun rights groups argued that superior s ordinance which also bans magazines that hold more than 10 rounds violated the second amendment moore concluded that they had a strong likelihood of success on the merits
the reason to be sceptical about the rally in america is that you have a double whammy tightening of higher rates and shrinking balance sheets which is negative for liquidity the rally is driven on hopes that inflation pressures have peaked inflation may have peaked but the key issue is whether inflation has settled offering college course website iim kozhikode iimk chief product officer programme visit iim lucknow iiml chief operations officer programme visit iim lucknow iiml chief executive officer programme visit indian school of business isb chief digital officer visit originally published on aug 04 2022 global head of equity strategy at says the recent run up in equities is more of a bear market rally in the us which indian stocks are tailing in an interview with et wood said india is not among his top investment destinations at the moment edited excerpts my view is that it is a bear market rally in the us the reason to be sceptical about the rally in america is that you have a double whammy tightening of higher rates and shrinking balance sheets which is negative for liquidity the rally is driven on hopes that inflation pressures have peaked inflation may have peaked but the key issue is whether inflation has settled the real issue is whether the fed is going to try and meet its 2 target india is just following the us i am suspicious of this rally in the us and india the market rally in india is closely connected to the rally on wall street correction in oil has also helped india i personally remain bullish on oil i want to continue to own energy stocks i have not changed my view on india the key issue here in india is how much rates go up and how far the rupee declines the fed is talking hawkish but at the end of the day i m sceptical they are going to stick to the 2 target my guess is inflation is running about 4 or 5 in america at the end of this year the inflation issue in america or europe is much bigger than in india they have not bought that much compared to what they sold one reason that foreigners sold so much in india earlier this year was because they were putting more money into china china was easing policy and india was tightening so china looked more attractive but in recent months the chinese economy investment story has been damaged significantly by the continued covid suppression policy so that has caused investors to become less constructive on china by the end of the year i see oil prices going higher the main reason why oil prices are not higher is because of the weak demand from china which is related to the covid suppression policy the covid suppression policy is a negative for china but it s a positive for the indian economy and the indian market i remain structurally bullish on oil because of the lack of supply the other good news for india is the cheaper russian oil the covid suppression policy has caused a significant slowdown in the chinese economy and weakened chinese consumer confidence which has led to reduced demand for energy this year india is not the best market because of the monetary tightening cycle the best performing market when i last checked in asia was indonesia my biggest overweight in asia this calendar year so far has been indonesia india is fine but india has got a lot of crosscurrents on a 10 year view india is my favourite bet but not in 2022 the rbi is tightening it was behind the curve but it is not as bad as it was i still believe oil is going higher i m overweight on india but not dramatically only a little overweight india has done better than i expected at the start of the year because of geopolitical factors of which the most important is china s covid suppression policy if china did not have the covid suppression policy the chinese stock market would be doing much better and india would be underperforming for india the important thing is what the rbi does the interesting point about india this year is the resilience of the stock market given the large amount of foreign selling in the long term one should remain invested in india but definitely the risk of a correction is rising what the rbi does is important the indian currency is going to be vulnerable so long as there is tightening going on so the good news is that the rbi was very behind the curve at the start of this year i have gotten less nervous on the indian currency in the last few months because the rbi has started raising rates i was more nervous in january and february before we had the inter meeting hike india s inflation issue is a more severe one than in china or indonesia for example so that s why india s currency has been weaker

equinox gold commented although we experienced operational challenges at several of our sites this quarter we expect improved performance in the second half of the year with increased production and lower costs inflation has certainly increased the cost of consumables and our team is working hard to find offsetting savings so we can maintain a strong business during this market downturn the new resin in leach circuit at the santa luz plant is performing well recoveries are consistently above 70 and as high as 82 with commercial production anticipated in q3 2022 santa luz will contribute to increased production in the fourth quarter and into 2023 during the first half of the year we achieved excellent construction progress at our greenstone project in ontario which is 35 complete and remains on schedule and on budget the team has done an exceptional job to control costs in this inflationary environment and is on track to have the majority of buildings enclosed by year end which is key to maintaining productivity during the winter months we also strengthened our balance sheet reduced our cost of capital and improved our liquidity by expanding and amending our credit facility we appreciate the strong support and confidence from our lending syndicate looking forward equinox gold is on track to deliver significant growth over the next few years commercial production at santa luz and higher grade ore at los filos should both contribute to increased production and lower costs in 2023 the big jump will come in 2024 when we achieve production at greenstone which will contribute more than 200 000 ounces of low cost production annually once it has ramped up to full capacity we also continue to advance the castle mountain los filos and aurizona expansions which could collectively contribute more than 300 000 ounces of annual production as we plan for greg smith to take over as ceo i am confident that equinox gold has the foundational assets the team and the

may not sum due to rounding the company sold fewer gold ounces for the three and six months ended june 30 2022 compared to the comparative periods of 2021 the decrease was mainly driven by decreased production at aurizona and rdm and by lower gold sales at mercedes as the operation was sold on april 21 2022 lower gold production at aurizona was in part due to processing stockpile ore with lower gold grades as high rainfall impeded access to higher grade ore from the piaba open pit lower gold production at rdm was mainly due to the temporary suspension of mining and plant operations in mid may due to a delay in receiving permits for the scheduled tsf raise these reductions were partially offset by increased production at mesquite and los filos and the contribution of pre commercial production from santa luz higher gold production at mesquite was due to mining the core of the brownie ore body resulting in higher grades and a lower strip ratio higher gold production at los filos was due to more recoverable ounces placed due to better grades from the open pit although there was a contribution of gold from pre commercial production at santa luz the ramp up was slower than anticipated due to modifications required to handle resin in leach processing at an industrial scale rectification of some piping and leach tank issues following construction and also working to achieve a steady blend of ore feed commercial production at santa luz is expected in q3 2022 in q2 2022 earnings from mine operations were 17 0 million q2 2021 41 3 million and for the six months ended june 30 2022 were 45 5 million six months ended june 30 2021 85 5 million earnings from mine operations were impacted by lower gold production higher operating costs due to supply constraints and inflationary pressures particularly from increased prices of oil and consumables that impacted input prices the company incurred a net loss in q2 2022 of 78 7 million q2 2021 net income of 403 7

amortization accretion and sustaining exploration expenditures 4 non sustaining capital includes non sustaining exploration expenditures 5 group total is the sum or average of the individual mine level amounts numbers may not sum due to rounding guidance for rdm was withdrawn on may 16 2022 to reflect the disruption to operations in both q1 and q2 2022 as previously mentioned rdm guidance has been updated to reflect these disruptions and also to reflect a change to the mine plan to defer waste stripping and instead focus on the processing of low grade stockpiles while the tsf raise is completed and water in the open pit is pumped out and evaporated rdm was in the midst of a waste stripping campaign at the time of the suspension of operations in may the current plan of operations minimizes cash outflow while the tsf raise is completed and during a period in which greenstone is in a high capital expenditure phase while maintaining the long term value of rdm low grade dumps are sufficient to sustain operations for approximately two years albeit resulting in lower gold production the santa luz ramp up has been slower than anticipated and resulted in lower gold production during the period than expected the longer ramp up was due to modifications required to handle resin in leach processing at an industrial scale rectification of some piping and leach tank issues following construction and also working to achieve a steady blend of ore feed see development projects section for discussion of throughput and recoveries which are approaching expected levels in q3 2022 los filos production guidance has been lowered slightly to reflect a delay in accessing higher grade ore zones in the bermejal underground guidance for the other mines remains as originally disclosed on january 25 2022 as a result consolidated production for 2022 is forecast at 550 000 to 615 000 oz of gold compared to the original forecast of 625 000 to 710 000 oz of gold cost escalation for certain consumables during the first half of 2022 including diesel cyanide and grinding media and lower grades processed than projected has resulted in increased cash costs at several of the company s mines as a result although production is expected to increase at all of the mines in the second half of the year guidance for cash costs and aisc per oz has been increased at all of the mines with the exception of mesquite updated consolidated cash costs are estimated at 1 200 to 1 250 per oz with aisc of 1 470 to 1 530 per oz sold compared to the original forecast of 1 080 to 1 140 per oz cash costs with aisc of 1 330 to 1 415 per oz of gold sold sustaining capital guidance has decreased principally due to the delayed santa luz commercial production which has resulted in some sustaining capital being reclassified as non sustaining capital and an updated mine plan at mesquite that anticipates less deferred stripping despite the reduction to sustaining capital an increase in cash costs per oz due to cost escalation and changes to mine sequences driving weaker than expected production are reflected in a 10 increase to the aisc per oz guidance range non sustaining capital guidance is generally consistent with previous guidance with the exception of santa luz where modifications to the plant have resulted in an additional estimated 20 million of non sustaining capital in addition greenstone will spend more in 2022 on plant and mill buildings in part due to steel price inflation although these increases have been offset by cost reductions in other areas and there is no change to the overall construction budget the company may revise guidance during the year to reflect changes to expected results conference call and webcast equinox gold will

told us tv she was continually on verge of financial bankruptcy she and ex husband prince andrew live in the queen s royal lodge in windsor the duchess of york has reportedly splashed 5million on a luxury property in the upmarket borough of mayfair in central london despite frequent gripes about her financial woes sarah ferguson 62 is said to have purchased the home from her friend the duke of westminster 31 who became one of the wealthiest men in the country when he inherited his father s 10billion fortune in 2016 it comes despite the red headed royal complaining of financial difficulties in recent years describing herself as continually on the verge of financial bankruptcy in a 2010 tv interview in the us a spokesperson for fergie s ex husband prince andrew said he had not been personally involved in the purchase mailonline has contacted buckingham palace for comment fergie and andrew currently reside in the royal lodge in windsor owned by the queen 96 sources told the sun the new mayfair property is thought to be a long term investment for daughters princess beatrice and eugenie describing it as picturesque and in one of the very smartest areas of london they added it had previously been a couple of flats but has been converted to a single property sarah ferguson pictured with ex husband prince andrew in 2019 62 is said to have purchased the home from her friend the duke of westminster 31 who became one of the wealthiest men in the country when he inherited his father s 10billion fortune in 2016 the duke of westminster pictured 31 is believed to have sold a 5million mayfair property to sarah ferguson reports the sun one source told the sun the new mayfair home is picturesque and in one of the very smartest areas of london stock image of mayfair in central london if the girls are going to inherit it at some stage they re extremely lucky it s a short walk from the best bars and restaurants in the city beautiful parks and other hot spots but god knows where the money has come from everyone thought they were totally skint fergie s representatives confirmed the purchase to the sun but were unable to provide any more specifics of the sale which has yet to be published by land registry officials it is not the first time the couple s property deals have come under scrutiny in january mps called for a dirty money probe into the 15million sale of prince andrew s sunninghill estate to a kazakh oligarch who became the centre of corruption claims the duke 61 sold the home in ascot berkshire to timur kulibayev 55 the son in law of kazakhstan s autocratic former president nursultan nazarbayev in 2007 but questions had been raised over the sale of the property originally gifted by the queen to andrew when he married sarah ferguson after it went for 15million 3million over its asking price that is despite the property languishing on the property market for five years at an asking price of 12million then sunninghill house on the edge of windsor great park near to ascot which was sold by prince andrew in 2007 in 2015 kulibayev razed sunninghill park which had been compared to a tesco superstore due to its ugly appearance so that he could build a new home last year images above showed how the home s sprawling ultra modern replacement was nearing completion andrew who has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing was once a special trade envoy for the uk asked about the deal mr kulibayev said at the time that the decision to pay 3million over the asking price for a property that had been on the market unsold for five years had come about because of a briefing from prince andrew s camp that other parties were interested in it we can confirm at the time of purchase we were told that there were several interested parties said his spokesman andrew is also struggling to sell his 18m ski chalet in verbier switzerland due to an alleged 1 6m debt to a swiss couple according to reports in the swiss media the debt to the mystery couple is preventing the duke of york from completing the sale of his much loved chalet helora it has been claimed that the disgraced royal was intending to use money from the sale of the property to help finance his 10million sex assault lawsuit settlement with accuser virginia giuffre in february of this year it was reported that andrew had found a buyer for the chalet after settling a separate 6 6million debt to french socialite isabelle de rouvre 74 who he purchased the property from in 2014 but the process appears to have stalled because the chalet is under sequestration as a result of the alleged debt the chalet was frozen as an asset by swiss authorities on december 15 2020 according to le temps newspaper the chalet in verbier has an indoor pool sauna boot room and terrace with spectacular views sources close to prince andrew previously told mailonline that the dispute will not prevent the property s sale and that while the duke did not deny owing the money to the couple he was questioning the amount the source said this has nothing to do with the original purchase of the chalet it s a completely separate business transaction between the couple and the duke it shouldn t affect the sale of the property despite what the swiss media says and is expected to go through as planned talks are underway to resolve the matter which are expected to be concluded satisfactorily for all parties prince andrew has not been to the chalet in verbier for several years but his ex wife sarah and two daughters beatrice and eugenie spent the new year in the luxury property with their families he stepped back as a senior royal in may 2020 after allegations emerged over his relationship with the disgraced sex abuser jeffrey epstein a high profile court case in which virginia guiffre a victim of epstein s accused the duke of york of rape and other sexual crimes was settled out of court in march of this year the total settlement is believed to be around 12 million and includes ms guiffre s legal bills and an unspecified amount to a charity of ms guiffre s choice advertisement he did not accept any liability when he made the settlement and vehemently denies the claims

woodcliff lake n j aug 03 2022 globe newswire hudson technologies inc nasdaq hdsn announced results for the second quarter ended june 30 2022 for the quarter ended june 30 2022 hudson reported revenues of 103 9 million an increase of 72 compared to revenues of 60 5 million in the comparable 2021 period second quarter revenue growth was driven by increased selling prices for certain refrigerants during the period gross margin in the second quarter of 2022 increased to 55 compared to 36 in the second quarter of 2021 mainly due to the increase in selling price without a material appreciation in the cost basis of certain refrigerants sold hudson reported operating income of 49 8 million in the second quarter of 2022 compared to operating income of 14 4 million in the prior year period the company recorded net income of 39 8 million or 0 89 per basic and 0 84 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2022 compared to net income of 11 3 million or 0 26 per basic and 0 24 per diluted share in the same period of 2021 net income during the second quarter of 2022 included an incremental non cash tax benefit of 11 6 million associated with the release of an income tax valuation allowance as a result of increased profitability for the six months ended june 30 2022 hudson reported revenues of 188 3 million an increase of 100 compared to revenues of 94 3 million in the first six months of 2021 revenue growth in the first half of 2022 was driven by an increase in selling prices for certain refrigerants during the period gross margin in the first six months of 2022 increased to 55 compared to 33 in the first six months of 2021 mainly due to the increase in selling price without a material appreciation in the cost basis of certain refrigerants sold hudson reported operating income of 88 1 million in the first six months of 2022 compared to operating income of 16 1 million in the prior year period the company recorded net income of 69 4 million or 1 55 per basic and 1 48 per diluted share in the first six months of 2022 compared to net income of 10 2 million or 0 23 per basic and 0 22 per diluted share in the same period of 2021 as stated above net income during the first six months of 2022 included an incremental non cash tax benefit of 11 6 million associated with the release of an income tax valuation allowance as a result of increased profitability brian f coleman president and chief executive officer of hudson technologies commented we delivered strong second quarter results as evidenced by substantial revenue growth significantly enhanced margins and increased profitability we re seeing consistent momentum as our selling season progresses and our second quarter results reflect sustained strength in the pricing of certain refrigerants moreover our first half profitability and increased cash flow have strengthened our balance sheet by reducing our total debt by 11 1 million during the second quarter of 2022 as we ve mentioned before 2022 marks the start of industry compliance with the aim act which mandates a 10 stepdown in production and consumption allowances for virgin hfcs in both 2022 and 2023 and a 40 baseline reduction in 2024 this phasedown is expected to drive a significant inflection point for our business as the industry begins to rely on reclaimed refrigerant to meet its hfc needs as a leading reclaimer hudson is uniquely positioned to fill the anticipated hfc supply gap as virgin production is phased out as well as meeting the demand of all other refrigerants including cfcs hcfcs and hfos we remain committed to providing the products and services to enable an industry wide transition to cleaner refrigerants and more efficient equipment this is an exciting time for our company and we are intent on growing our leadership role and strategic partnerships in the refrigerant marketplace and as a steward of environmentally sound sustainable refrigerant management company increases 2022 forecast and provides new 3 year target mr coleman continued given the pricing dynamics to date for the current selling season we are increasing our previously stated 2022 forecast and longer term targets based on current pricing levels we should see revenues in excess of 290 million for full year 2022 while we continue to believe margin performance for the full year will moderate due to increases in inventory cost and anticipated stabilization in sales prices during the balance of this season with our visibility today we now believe full year blended gross margin will be at least in the mid 40 range in 2022 we are seeing the accelerated shift to what we expect will be significantly higher and sustained profitability for the business going forward assuming further hfc price increases related to the hfc phasedown under the aim act albeit at a slower pace than we saw in 2022 we are targeting annualized revenue of greater than 400 million by 2025 with gross margins remaining above historical levels but moderating over the next three years to approximately 35 this shift we are seeing to significantly increased profits for the business provides considerably enhanced financial flexibility for us to invest in our long term growth while also continuing to reduce debt mr coleman concluded conference call information the company will host a conference call

turn it over to marcel to get started marcel verbaas chairman and chief executive officer thanks amanda and good afternoon to all of you joining our call today momentum in our business picked up meaningfully since our last earnings call in early may as we reported this morning revpar grew 2 in the second quarter as compared to 2019 marking the first quarter since the onset of the pandemic where quarterly revpar exceeded the same period in 2019 with a strong leisure base higher levels of corporate transient and group demand allowed our properties to grow revenues and profits above our expectations in the second quarter net income was 27 6 million adjusted ebitdare was 88 6 million and adjusted ffo per share was 0 57 as demand continues to recover in what has historically been the seasonally strongest quarter for our portfolio all of our properties generated positive hotel ebitda revpar for the quarter was 186 75 with a 2 growth over the same period in 2019 reflecting a substantial sequential improvement from the first quarter when revpar was 19 and a half percent below 2019 the revpar growth was primarily driven by strong results in the months of april and june and was fueled by substantial adr growth throughout the quarter average daily rate increased 16 6 offset partially by about 10 points lower occupancy as compared to the second quarter of 2019 revpar growth exceeded 30 in four of our top 10 markets including key west phoenix san diego and napa we continue to be pleased with our operators ability to control costs in this inflationary environment second quarter hotel ebitda margin improved 365 basis points as compared to 2019 benefiting from the combination of robust rate growth and favorable expense controls as a result same property hotel ebitda for the quarter exceeded the 2019 level by 15 while our adjusted ebitdare came within 1 of the amount we generated in the second quarter of 2019 like many of our peers our portfolio of premium hotels in top 25 markets and key leisure destinations has benefited from a rapid recovery in leisure demand in recent quarters however we believe we are in the early innings of a multiyear recovery in overall lodging demand and our portfolio remains well positioned to experience the tailwinds of improving corporate transient and group demand near term trends remain favorable and while visibility remains limited we are not seeing signs of a meaningful slowdown in demand we are off to a solid start to the third quarter which historically has been the seasonally weakest quarter for our current same property portfolio preliminary revpar for the month of july was approximately 157 driven by occupancy of approximately 64 and average daily rate of approximately 247 july estimated revpar was approximately 4 below the results achieved in july of 2019 and approximately 16 higher than july of 2021 rate growth continues to be impressive as our estimated adr exceeded july 2019 by approximately 18 midweek demand improved steadily after the 4th of july holiday caused business travel to be muted in the early part of the month we continue to be well positioned to benefit from a diverse set of demand drivers even as the summer travel season winds down over the next month we have been pleased that our properties have been able to pivot to capture substantial leisure demand in their respective markets however pre pandemic revenues at the majority of our hotels were primarily generated by corporate transient and group demand particularly after labor day we expect that improving demand from group and corporate transient on top of continuing strong leisure demand will enable our operators to drive occupancy gains in the months and quarters ahead so where are the greatest opportunities for growth in the portfolio let me highlight two key areas first we have meaningful growth left in our same property portfolio same property hotel ebitda in the first half of 2022 was down 7 as compared to the first half of 2019 seven of our top 10 markets as measured by contribution to 2019 ebitda have yet to fully recover back to 2019 levels which is reflective of the greater dependence on corporate transient and group demand in the hotels we own in those markets six of our larger corporate and group focused hotels namely marriott san francisco airport hyatt regency santa clara our two dallas hotels and our two westins in the houston galleria markets were collectively more than 20 million behind in terms of hotel ebitda in the first half of 2022 as compared to the first half of 2019 these six hotels generated approximately 30 of our same property hotel ebitda in 2019 significantly above the approximately 18 of hotel ebitda they generated during the first half of this year while 2019 did not reflect peak earnings for every market it is a good starting point to assess opportunities for recovery and growth in the back half of this year and into 2023 importantly our hotels in most of the markets that have lagged thus far are currently experiencing good pickup in both group and corporate transient demand we believe that this momentum will help us continue to close the ebitda gap to 2019 the second significant driver of growth for our portfolio is represented by our two most recent acquisitions as previously discussed we expect w nashville and hyatt regency portland to generate between 40 million and 45 million in hotel ebitda annually upon stabilization both properties are building their books of group business in addition to corporate transient and leisure demand hyatt regency portland is already starting to benefit from citywides and events that are adjacent to the oregon convention center and the moda center the hotel s group base has steadily improved throughout the year with almost 60 000 group room nights actualized and on the books for 2022 as of the end of the second quarter profitability and revpar improved significantly in the quarter with the hotel achieving occupancy of approximately 68 in june the highest level since opening although the pandemic has caused stabilization to be delayed compared to underwriting when we acquired the hotel in late 2019 we remain confident in our belief that the hotel will reach the stabilized ebitda we expected upon acquisition meanwhile w nashville continues to perform well and in line with our expectations revpar exceeded 250 every month during the second quarter and significant upside remains as the outstanding food and beverage facilities are optimized from an operating perspective and corporate transient and group demand builds the hotel has a unique offering for groups with 18 000 square feet of meeting space in what is a very rapidly growing market we believe this is an important element to achieve the optimal demand segmentation mix to drive maximum profitability we continue to expect that the hotel will deliver between 13 million and 15 million of ebitda during our ownership period this year while potential recession may slow the rate of recovery in the lodging industry in the short term we remain very optimistic about our growth prospects in the years ahead we believe our strategic focus will add in a multitude of demand generators to drive portfolio performance as well as a balanced mix between group corporate transient and leisure demand will continue to serve us well in the next phase of the industry recovery with that i will turn the call over to barry who will provide additional details on our second quarter performance and an update on significant capex projects we have scheduled for this year and early 2023 barry bloom president and chief operating officer thank you marcel and good afternoon everyone for the second quarter our same property portfolio occupancy was 69 8 at an average daily rate of 267 72 resulting in revpar of 186 75 on an absolute basis this marks our highest revpar quarter since the start of the pandemic building on a very strong start in april revpar of the quarter ended up 2 as compared to the second quarter of 2019 as marcel mentioned in his remarks the portfolio drove an average daily rate increase of 16 6 in the quarter as compared to the same period in 2019 on a monthly basis results during the quarter exceeded our expectations april continued the strong occupancy trend with an occupancy of 72 at an average daily rate of 280 62 both post covid records reflecting occupancy down 9 8 points to 2019 while rate increased by 18 3 reflecting continued strength in leisure business and strengthening group business particularly our large resort hotels may is a seasonally slower month for our portfolio than april and achieved occupancy of 69 and an adr of 264 98 an occupancy decline of 9 1 points compared to 2019 with rate up 12 8 june occupancy of 68 3 reflects historically lower levels of group and leisure business which was offset by continued strength in individual corporate business and a decline of 11 1 occupancy points to 2019 however adr was 256 97 up 18 8 the largest monthly rate increase over 2019 achieved to date out of 32 same property hotels all but four achieved higher average daily rates in the second quarter of 2022 than they did in the second quarter of 2019 we ve been pleased to see resilience in leisure pricing and continue to be optimistic regarding corporate rates particularly as we achieve higher midweek occupancies and sellouts in a number of our markets on tuesday and wednesday nights we continue to be proud of the work we and our hotels have done to identify opportunities to maximize rate and ensure we are providing the right mix of amenities and services to satisfy our guests as noted demand in the quarter was broad based the portfolio benefited from very strong leisure demand along with the buildup of group business and corporate transient in the quarter our group business benefited from solid in the quarter for the quarter bookings and strong rate growth resulting in higher groups revenue group higher group rooms revenue as compared to the second quarter of 2019 which were high quality reflecting healthy corporate group demand particularly in our larger resorts and we saw a notable improvement in citywide conventions which benefited our hotels in san francisco dallas denver portland and new orleans corporate transient demand continued to recover with monday tuesday and wednesday occupancies building through the second quarter although still down in the low to mid teens occupancy point range compared to 2019 the monday tuesday and wednesday night occupancies we achieved in the quarter represent an improvement of more than 10 points from the level we saw in the first quarter and are clearly indicative of an acceleration in business travel that has continued into july we remain optimistic on the recovery in corporate transient which will be of increasing importance as we look beyond labor day and into next year early indications from our operators suggest that negotiated corporate rates could increase in the high single or low double digits next year now switching to profit second quarter hotel ebitda was 86 5 million an increase of 15 on a total revenue increase of 2 4 compared to the second quarter of 2019 resulting in 365 basis points of margin improvement hotel ebitda margin grew significantly during the quarter as the flow through on rate and our operators continuing success in effectively managing expenses for the quarter departmental expenses declined by 3 7 compared to 2019 while undistributed expenses declined by 1 7 though labor remains challenging in select markets our operators report that they continue to fill open positions and there seems to be increasing availability of labor in markets that have nearly fully recovered our operators report that open positions are in line with pre pandemic levels wage increases seem to have stabilized in the mid single digit range as compared to last year which is in line with our initial expectations turning to capex during the quarter we invested 14 3 million in portfolio improvements bringing our year to date spend to 21 8 million at park hyatt aviara resort golf club spa the renovation of the golf course began in the second quarter and is expected to be complete early in the fourth quarter we are also planning for a significant upgrade to the resort s spa and wellness amenities which will be branded as a miraval life in balance spa on its completion in the first quarter of 2023 we expect this world class facility will perfectly complement the five star five diamond hotel experience and attract a new demand segment to the resort during the quarter we substantially completed the restaurant lobby meeting space and rooftop renovations at kimpton canary hotel santa barbara and continued planning of the guest room renovation which is expected to occur in the fourth quarter this year and first quarter of 2023 we also began work on the comprehensive renovation of grand bohemian hotel orlando which will continue into the second quarter of 2023 as a reminder this will include renovation of the guest rooms including substantial tub to shower conversions meeting space lobby restaurant and bar and the rooftop pool which will include the addition of a stand alone bar and entertainment zone we also commenced the renovation of bathrooms at marriott woodlands waterway hotel convention center including the conversion of bathtubs to walk in showers in approximately 75 of the guest rooms additional projects that are planned to commence this year include renovation of the meeting space and lobby including the addition of a starbucks outlet at fairmont pittsburgh renovation of meeting space at royal palms resort spa and our renovation and reconfiguration of suites at the ritz carlton denver which will result in the addition of three keys to the hotel we have also started planning work on a comprehensive renovation of kimpton hotel monaco salt lake city and is expected to commence in the first quarter of 2023 with that i will turn the call over to atish atish shah executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks barry i will cover two topics this afternoon first i ll discuss our balance sheet and second i ll discuss our full year guidance as to our balance sheet we have the flexibility needed to grow the company and create long term shareholder value we exited from covenant waivers on our corporate credit facilities after the end of the second quarter as such the restrictions on both paying dividends and repurchasing shares have now lapsed by way of reminder we paid an annualized dividend of 1 10 per share prior to covid which reflected a payout ratio of approximately 65 of funds available for distribution while we have nols which should offset to some degree the requirement to pay dividends in the near term we continue to monitor the trajectory of the recovery as that may enable reinstatement of its modest dividend over the next couple of quarters as to share repurchase this is a tool we utilized in the past to drive shareholder returns by way of reminder since our listing in 2015 we repurchased 80 million of stock at an average price of about 15 per share we currently have about 95 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization as to the overall leverage level on a trailing 12 month basis our net debt to adjusted ebitda was approximately five and a half times as of june 30 turning to our liquidity at the end of the second quarter it was approximately 675 million as compared to approximately 625 million at the end of the first quarter our liquidity reflects approximately 225 million of unrestricted cash and approximately and 450 million undrawn on our line of credit we continue to have a well diversified balance sheet with no debt maturities until 2024 turning to my second topic our guidance we have provided full year guidance consistent with prior practice our guidance reflects current business conditions and does not anticipate any meaningful changes in the economic environment or any additional covid related impacts looking forward we continue to believe our hotels are well positioned to capture business transient and group demand as they more fully recover at the midpoint of guidance we expect revpar to be down approximately 5 from 2019 levels and adjusted ebitdare of 266 million or about 10 lower than 2019 the greater variance in adjusted ebitdare reflects changes in portfolio composition and the recovery potential of certain of our properties at the midpoint our guidance implies a slight decline in second half revpar compared to 2019 which reflects the transition from a leisure driven recovery to one that is more broad based and likely to be slightly more gradual we expect both continued adr and margin growth versus 2019 our guidance reflects improving corporate transient demand as the year continues and group demand continuing to build turning to group more specifically group room revenue pace is strengthening with 2022 pace 18 below 2019 levels at the end of june this compares to 2022 group revenue pace of down 23 at the end of the first quarter the second half of 2022 continues to look better as well for the second half group rooms revenue pace is about 18 lower than 2019 second half group pace was down 21 at the end of the first quarter so that reflects an approximately 300 basis point improvement in pace versus a quarter ago the rate story on the group side is quite positive rates for the second half are up 10 versus the second half of 2019 the other items that we provided guidance on in this morning s release have not changed much since last quarter interest expense is unchanged from prior guidance and reflects interest rate hedges expiring this fall and roughly 15 of our total debt cash g a expense guidance is up 1 million and capital expenditure guidance is down 5 million as our estimates of each has been fine tuned to wrap up the company continues to be well positioned for an extended lodging recovery no matter the exact trajectory we ve prepared the company well with high quality well located primarily branded hotels and a healthy liquidity and balance sheet to be able to grow in the years ahead that concludes our prepared remarks today and with that we will turn the call back over to bailey for our q a session questions answers operator thank you the first question today comes from the line of dori kesten from wells fargo please go ahead your line is now open dori kesten well fargo securities analyst thanks good morning i know you said you haven t seen a slowing in demand yet but where would you expect to eventually see that slowing is it more on the leisure side business transient barry bloom president and chief operating officer well it certainly wouldn t be on business transient and group where we continue to see stronger results i think if there was anything that you might see but again we ve not seen it is in the leisure demand in fact our drive to markets continue to be as strong if not stronger than they were in the summer of 2021 so we view that as very positive thus far dori kesten well fargo securities analyst ok and how has the quantity of hotels that you re underwriting changed since last quarter and how has your forecasting changed if at all if you look out several years marcel verbaas chairman and chief executive officer it hasn t changed too much in either one of those categories we haven t clearly the current environment doesn t lend itself to be overly aggressive on acquisitions when we re looking at potential capital uses and clearly as atish pointed out we have no longer we no longer have any restrictions as it relates to repurchasing shares we also have some debt that even though we don t have any maturities until 2024 we do have some debt that we could be paying off especially after with some of the hedges that are expiring that atish talked about so there are various potential uses of our available capital and that still includes potential acquisitions to the extent that we find interesting opportunities i wouldn t say that the volume has changed very dramatically over the last quarter we continue to look at a number of potential opportunities clearly we haven t found anything that we think really hits all the marks for us here over the last few months so as it relates to the longer term underwriting i pointed out that we remember that we continue to be pretty bullish on the longer term growth prospects not only for our portfolio but also for the lodging industry overall and we re going into a period where we expect supply increases to be relatively muted we do expect that group business and corporate transient will continue to build even though that may be a little bit more gradual in the short term if we do get some hiccups if there is a recession going we still are very bullish on the longer term process dori kesten well fargo securities analyst ok thank you operator thank you the next question today comes from the line of david katz from jefferies please go ahead your line is now open david katz jefferies analyst hi afternoon everyone thanks for taking my questions for all of the remarks and perspective today i really wanted to just go a little further and get a sense for what the discussions are like with respect to assets that may be for sale how are the underwriting processes changed given that we re all trying to contemplate whether there is something out there recession wise or not and what the intensity of it is how do those discussions get around that uncertainty marcel verbaas chairman and chief executive officer well clearly we haven t gotten around to it on the acquisition side since we haven t bought anything but we continue to david katz jefferies analyst still working around it marcel verbaas chairman and chief executive officer what you re seeing in the short term for sure david is obviously the debt markets that have changed pretty dramatically over the last four or five months if you will so that does change some of the discussion as far as who s out there potentially buying assets obviously people there are higher level buyers are probably not as can t be as aggressive in the current environment so that is the most immediate impact as you look at whether it s on the acquisition side where maybe you have a little less competition potentially looking at some acquisitions but you balance that with at least having a little bit of caution in the short term when you re underwriting potential assets on the disposition side we talked we have talked consistently about that we re a company that looks to improve its quality of its portfolio over time both through acquisitions and dispositions so that certainly could still include some dispositions on the lower end of the portfolio and the same things we ve done before as it relates to that we have assets that have significant capex needs coming up other assets that we think have kind of been optimized from an asset management standpoint so we re continuing to have some of those discussions and potentially looking at doing some more on the disposition side but nothing dramatic just particularly in a few smaller assets that we re considering that so as you re thinking about selling those you clearly look at your potential buyers through a little bit of a different lens where you just have to make sure that you re very confident about their source of equity and their ability to close on transactions david katz jefferies analyst all right understood and just as a follow up assuming that you could get around the current circumstances are there particular markets where you would prefer to lighten up rather than acquire and just given your sort of market updates would be really helpful marcel verbaas chairman and chief executive officer not necessarily we re not necessarily looking at markets where we absolutely want to lighten up i think we ve as you know we ve done a lot of heavy lifting over the last few years to shape the portfolio to where it is today so i wouldn t say that we look at our portfolio and say we really want to get out of this market i do think that there might be some opportunities to sell some assets in our current environment that are still particularly attractive or because of some of the shorter terms you ve seen as it relates to strong leisure demand in some markets that people really want to get into that may not be absolutely a long term strategically important asset for us but that being said nothing specific as it relates to any kind of reshaping of the portfolio as it relates to markets whether on the acquisition side or on the disposition side david katz jefferies analyst understood thanks very much operator thank you the next question today comes from the line of bill crow from raymond james please go ahead your line is now open bill crow raymond james analyst thank you very much good afternoon guys two questions for you first of all if you could just if you could fast forward a little bit to the first quarter of 23 and i m not looking for guidance but it s just a really interesting setup with omicron this year but offset by really strong leisure demand and i m just wondering how you think that quarter might play out fundamentally for the industry marcel verbaas chairman and chief executive officer well we thought you would be excited that we at least gave guidance for the rest of this year bill so we as we bill crow raymond james analyst we always ask for more of that stuff marcel verbaas chairman and chief executive officer as you have noted i mean visibility is obviously still relatively limited and there s a lot of macro forces going on that could obviously shape things differently as we get into next year but i think you pointed out some of the things that will be impacting this year versus last year omicron really hit hard in january of last year and most properties weren t really prepared for that from an operational standpoint so as you recall in the first quarter it was much harder to drive the type of margin improvements that we were able to drive here in the second quarter just because demand slipped so much in the early part of the first quarter versus what the expectations were so overall that obviously sets things up better for the first quarter of 23 than it did for the first quarter of 2022 and as we pointed out we are expecting this continued kind of gradual recovery of the corporate transient and group side that hopefully will offset some of the historic strength that you ve seen in leisure here over the last few quarters bill crow raymond james analyst all right and then my other question is really on seasonality in nashville and i asked that because i assume summer is the big season from a tourist perspective but with all the new supply opening up i m just wondering if we were to look at how the seasonality and demand plays out if you could just kind of give us a road map of what to expect barry bloom president and chief operating officer yeah so we re still learning obviously what the seasonality looks like and i think we were actually quite frankly very surprised in q2 by this hotel s ability to attract short term corporate group to the hotel in a way that we had not expected when we closed on the hotel at the end of march i think summer has been an interesting period for us because that group business doesn t really want to be there in the summer so we ve certainly seen and worked to pick up even more leisure business and really do a good job of marketing and advertising the food and beverage amenities which are largely outdoor focused i think we re optimistic about q3 in the same way as it relates to corporate demand which we think this hotel is set up very nicely for as well as group demand which we expect to be significantly different in q3 than it was and into q4 than it has been in early q3 so far so i think we re still learning the market and i think what we re really learning is how this asset can best penetrate the market both in line with our original business plan but also additional opportunities that we think set the hotel up well for success bill crow raymond james analyst ok all right i appreciate it thank you operator thank you the next question today comes from the line of ari klein from bmo capital markets please go ahead your line is now open ari klein bmo capital markets analyst thanks and good afternoon i appreciate that there are some moving parts between leisure and business and group and how that recovers but how are you thinking about occupancy moving forward and getting back to 2019 levels it seems like in the back half of the year expecting more normal seasonality but at the same time you do have business and group travel picking up atish shah executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i mean ari it s a good question i mean the way we thought about and what we provided that is embedded in our guidance is in the second half we expect occupancy to still be kind of off to 2019 by high single digits to 10 sort of 10 points so that gives you kind of a short term perspective on what s embedded in our guidance i think over a longer period of time we obviously expect the recovery to be full and complete both in terms of corporate transient and group and so while it might take a little bit longer we definitely feel confident that the business is coming back based on what we ve seen thus far ari klein bmo capital markets analyst got it and then maybe just on the florida keys revpar growth was i think 3 in the second quarter versus last year is that just tough comps and is that a market that you would anticipate seeing decline second half of the year barry bloom president and chief operating officer yeah it s a market that s performed incredibly well for us and for others over time we like the hotel we have there a lot the hyatt centric it s continued to perform well and through every month of q2 and now into q3 we ve been really impressed with the ability to continue to drive rate there and the resilience of that market in terms of people that want to be there and are really want to be in the property doing things we re actually we are doing some infrastructure work at the property in august and september so we will see by our own design a little bit of impact to where the hotel has been and the growth year over year but long term and strategically we feel really good about the market and it s a market that the people have long enjoyed being in and quite frankly it does suffer suffer is not the right word it has the great benefit of constrained supply and when people want to go there they re willing to pay terrific rates to be there and that s been the case over many years marcel verbaas chairman and chief executive officer i think coming into this year one of the questions is there any part of the year whereabouts does a market like that does it actually have the potential to go down this year versus where we were because of the massive growth that it has gone through over the last few years so we re actually quite encouraged about the fact that we re continuing to see very healthy occupancies and adrs in the markets and haven t really seen any kind of setback in the market and are still very bullish on the longer term ari klein bmo capital markets analyst got it operator thank you the next question today comes from the line of michael bellisario from baird please go ahead your line is now open michael bellisario baird analyst good afternoon everyone barry i wanted to ask on your markets that were not up versus 2019 dallas houston and then denver too looks like it s all occupancy driven but what s the mix of business there today versus where you want it to be and then any signs you re seeing on the ground that those markets may or may not close the gap versus some of your better performing markets at least over the near term barry bloom president and chief operating officer the mix in those markets is actually not substantially different from what it s been historically in terms of the actual components of business it s resulting in lower occupancy i think in each of those cases in q2 whereas marcel and i both mentioned some of the markets that had citywide outperformance those markets all have relative citywide underperformance relative to prior years which impacted each of those hotels denver has had a very strong comeback in the in july in particular and dallas and houston are markets where our hotels rely really heavily on in house group business and we re in a seasonally softer period here in the summer but i think we have much higher expectations as we get past labor day and get into more definitive corporate travel and the return of group demand to those properties michael bellisario baird analyst got it and just on the group topic i know you gave volume and adr for the rest of the year but what about contractual f b and other out of room spend that groups are booking today are those effective prices up more or less than the adr figures you quoted earlier barry bloom president and chief operating officer they re up around the same range we our operators have gone through every one of our hotels obviously in terms of not just restaurants but in particular looking at and refocusing on banquet pricing and we ve seen really good commitments from groups on food and beverage they may not be committing to it upfront when they sign a contract when they get on property they are typically the largest and most and the good quality corporate groups are way out spending what they originally committed to and the contribution is at or in excess of where it was in 2019 michael bellisario baird analyst got it and then just last one for me just on the 8 1 million maybe for atish the 8 1 million of noncomp ebitda could you provide the split between nashville and portland on those atish shah executive vice president and chief financial officer yes it was five and three nashville and portland michael bellisario baird analyst thank you operator thank you the next question today comes from tyler batory from oppenheimer please go ahead your line is now open unknown speaker oppenheimer and company analyst good afternoon this is jonathan on for tyler thank you for taking our question first one for me is on capex with the grand bohemian renovation underway and the planning stages of the kimpton in salt lake is there any large scale renovations that might be on the table or do you think the portfolio is in a good place once those are completed and i guess and maybe if you could just remind us the quality of the portfolio given the capex you ve spent over the past few years barry bloom president and chief operating officer we have a long track record of continually improving the assets so while we re not prepared to talk about them today we ve got a number of projects quite frankly that we re looking at and planning for further into 23 and 24 some of which we may be able to talk about on our call in november but we ve continually reinvested in the portfolio and we do think the portfolio is in really good shape in part because we do really high quality renovations we ve talked before about us using our own in house project management team to manage our projects which we think lets us deliver those projects at a good cost with a lot of really good control over the decision making and what we re doing in those properties but capex is i think is clearly an ongoing process for us and we continue to reinvest in the assets including assets where we have done comprehensive renovations marcel verbaas chairman and chief executive officer and i ll just add to that i ve spoken about it in the last few quarters on in our prepared remarks and i believe in some of the questions i ve answered too that we are continuously looking at whether there are some outsized roi opportunities within the portfolio too and as we you mentioned for example grand bohemian orlando as we really dug into those projects we looked at do we do a more limited room renovation and more limited renovation of that asset but we strongly believe in the long term potential of that property and feel like the type of renovation that we re doing at that asset now is really taking it to the next level and should provide some very strong roi for us so similarly we re continuing to look at some additional opportunities and going back to your other part of your question clearly we believe we have an extremely high quality portfolio and if you walk through all of our assets you re not going to say this asset needs a ton of money we have a really good team that has stayed on top of these assets clearly we re looking to spend more in the range of what we historically did this year and as we get into next year and then to barry s point as we start talking about some of the opportunities we have going into next year and what our capex plan looks like for next year there may be a couple of other things that we ll talk about where we believe we can drive some very strong rois unknown speaker oppenheimer and company analyst ok good thank you for all the color there and then switching gears to the guidance can you provide some color on the move to issue the guidance and why that made sense now this quarter compared to maybe next quarter or last quarter given the seemingly swirling macro backdrop that s going on right now is it a sign of confidence in the recovery or more clarity any color there atish shah executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah that s a good question it is definitely a sign of a little bit more confidence in the recovery and are just a view that we should be providing a little bit more visibility on what we re thinking so that s really the chief driver of the timing i think our view is also that we would refer to the type of guidance we ve been providing before so full year guidance and the other piece is that the ranges on the guidance if you look back to where the types of ranges we have provided back in midyear in 2019 they were much tighter so i think embedded in our guidance is the view that there are generally speaking a broader range of potential outcomes which is why the guidance is quite a bit much wider than it was back in 2019 at this time unknown speaker oppenheimer and company analyst very helpful thank you for all the color guys that s all for me operator thank you there are no additional questions waiting at this time so i would like to pass the conference over to marcel verbaas for closing remarks marcel verbaas chairman and chief executive officer thanks i know it s been a long day for everyone a lot of people reporting today we appreciate you joining us for our call today and we look forward to updating you again next quarter operator duration 0 minutes call participants amanda bryant marcel verbaas chairman and chief executive officer barry bloom president and chief operating officer

value ownership the same way our parents did we share because that s how we ve gotten by dare i say we re a less entitled generation as a result the pandemic may have taken the heat off the gig

eurasia group analyst told reuters as a political gesture it is almost insulting they re baaaaack yesterday an obscure hong kong based company that trades on the new york stock exchange saw its shares rise 126 in a single day not bad but for a company that ipo d less than three weeks ago it was just the latest in a dizzying stock surge that even its executives couldn t explain in less than a month shares of amtd digital have shot up around 21 000 from 7 80 apiece to 1 679 if you re feeling some déjà vu you re not alone here s the deal the reddit army is back in action it seems amtd digital is a firm you ve almost certainly never heard of the company is an arm of amtd idea group an investment bank based in hong kong that is also listed in new york and singapore the unit was founded in 2019 and provides fintech services in asia including a virtual bank called airstar with all due respect to amtd it s borrrrrring and yet this little known fintech firm which brought in just over 25 million in revenue last year now boasts a market cap of more than 310 billion that s more valuable than shell or costco it s on par with companies like walmart and exxonmobil my colleague michelle toh reports just to underscore the absurdity of this whole thing the company released a statement basically shrugging that their extreme turn of fortune to our knowledge there are no material circumstances events

reddit crowd but even some of those investors appeared befuddled by the surge according to bloomberg some analysts are pointing to the amtd s low free float which makes it easier for big shareholders to push up the price given the speed of its ascent i have a feeling this one will nosedive oktay kavrak director at leverage shares told bloomberg i hope investors take profits along the way as the

republican attorney general eric schmitt and democratic beer heiress trudy busch valentine won the party nominations for u s senate in missouri on tuesday night riding well financed campaigns to victory in competitive races on both sides of the aisle schmitt who ran a campaign defined by frequent and headline grabbing litigation against political opponents and public schools was propelled in the final weeks of the campaign by a storm of outside spending and criticism aimed at one of his chief opponents former gov eric greitens schmitt came out on top against greitens u s reps vicky hartzler and billy long as well as a slew of other gop candidates earning more than 45 percent of the vote hartzler earned 22 percent and greitens garnered just under 19 percent according to preliminary totals from the secretary of state an heiress to the anheuser busch beer fortune registered nurse and philanthropist worth up to 215 million busch valentine was a last minute entrant to the race but gained immediate momentum thanks to a raft of mostly self funded tv ads and endorsements from elected democrats past and present she defeated u s marine veteran lucas kunce who ran a populist campaign criticizing corporations and elites including busch valentine herself earning 43 percent of the vote to kunce s 38 percent more what springfield voters are saying about tuesday s primary elections in missouri schmitt is the heavy favorite to succeed the retiring u s sen roy blunt in november as missouri increasingly has voted for republicans in recent statewide elections in his victory speech in st louis on tuesday night he took a shot at his democratic opponent the missouri independent reported saying i don t come from billions i come from bridgeton i m proud of my working class roots busch valentine meanwhile said in a statement that whether you vote for me or not in the senate i will work hard every day for you i m going to approach politics the same way i approached nursing and my life i m going to treat others with compassion respect and integrity i m going to put our differences aside and embrace what unites us eric schmitt prevailed in chaotic gop race schmitt represented st louis county in the state senate before a stint as state treasurer he was appointed attorney general by gov mike parson in late 2018 after his predecessor and soon to be senior u s senator josh hawley won his election schmitt won another four year term in 2020 before announcing his run for senate as attorney general schmitt has filed a flurry of lawsuits that have garnered headlines he touts the litigation as evidence that he is a conservative fighter who will take a blowtorch to biden s socialist agenda he has sued school districts over curriculum transparency requests the biden administration over covid 19 vaccine requirements and the nation of china for liability over early infections from the virus moments after the u s supreme court overturned roe v wade he issued an opinion activating the state s ban on abortion throughout the campaign he has frequently derided democrats proponents of pandemic guidelines and climate scientists and advocates alike mocking the experts tm on social media and arguing that they were manufacturing crises to gain power more missouri ag schmitt demands springfield public schools others provide student surveys schmitt was the beneficiary of significant outside spending during the primary with more than 7 million spent in support of his campaign according to opensecrets the most of any candidate while super pacs backing him attacked greitens and hartzler he has received the most money of any candidate in the country from americans for prosperity action a pac extension of the libertarian conservative group founded by the koch brothers the group has backed him to the tune of 4 3 million schmitt also was one of the beneficiaries of a last minute endorsement from former president donald trump who simply backed eric and said he trusts the great people of missouri on this one to make up their own minds both he and greitens claimed the vague endorsement as their own more donald trump backs eric in eleventh hour u s senate sort of endorsement greitens who entered the race with the highest name recognition in the field resigned the governorship in 2018 facing allegations of sexual misconduct and potential campaign finance violations new accusations from his ex wife of domestic abuse toward her and their children sparked a fresh wave of criticism and scrutiny that led to millions of dollars of opposition outside spending from republican officials and donors around the country which paid for frequent television online and mail ads that center around his litany of scandals hartzler who has represented west central missouri in the house since 2011 ran a campaign touting herself as the reliable conservative choice with a proven record in washington she was endorsed by soon to be senior senator hawley and touted a platform defined by faith family and freedom but was publicly rebuked by trump in the final weeks of the campaign hawley congratulated schmitt on his victory on twitter writing now on to victory in november long who frequently touted his early support for trump in an effort to earn his endorsement failed to receive it or gain momentum throughout the race earning 5 percent of the vote before the winner was officially called tuesday night he conceded on twitter i just called eric schmitt and congratulated him on a big victory tonight and offered my full endorsement and cooperation going forward long wrote anything i can do to help i will and he and his great team know that on to november st louis attorney mark mccloskey who gained national attention in 2020 when he and his wife pointed guns at protesters outside their home and senate president pro tem dave schatz also vied for the nomination they earned 3 percent and 1 percent of the vote respectively trudy busch valentine defeats populist lucas kunce for democratic nod a registered nurse in missouri busch valentine asked voters to send her to the u s senate while calling for integrity and honesty and respect in washington she was inspired to enter the race she said by two tragedies in her family the death of her younger sister from a car accident when she was a teen and her son s death in 2020 from an opioid overdose and to safeguard the future of her family which includes six children and three grandchildren busch valentine has called for the end of the filibuster in the u s senate enshrining the right to an abortion in federal law advancing more stringent gun safety measures and protection of voting rights but she came under fire in the final weeks of the campaign for wavering answers on lgbtq rights and education as well as needing clarification on the landmark campaign finance supreme court decision citizens united her entrance into the race came just before the deadline to file for candidacy and prompted former state sen scott sifton to immediately drop out and endorse her in the months that followed she was backed by a number of democratic state lawmakers as well as other prominent officials including st louis mayor tishaura jones she also attracted immediate criticism from the left wing online publication the intercept which reported her attendance and prominent role at an all white gala for the secretive veiled prophet organization in 1977 later reporting from the intercept in may revealed a planned fundraiser from the national rifle association at grant s farm the busch family s property the family s total wealth was estimated by forbes magazine in 2020 to be 17 6 billion among the largest fortunes in the united states busch valentine apologized for her role in the veiled prophet ball saying she failed to fully grasp the situation she also said she persuaded the board of grant s farm to cancel the planned fundraiser saying you can always count on me to stand up to the gun lobby kunce s failed bid for the nomination featured frequent national cable news appearances and sweeping criticisms of government and institutions he advocated for a ban on members of congress trading stocks for returning investment and manufacturing to the u s through a marshall plan for the midwest and for the abolition of corporate pacs influencing politics kunce earned the endorsement monday of u s sen bernie sanders of vermont the two time progressive presidential candidate who has similarly called for broad action against corporations and existing institutions more can a democrat win back missouri how u s senate candidates plan to win he contrasted himself to busch valentine by showing in advertisements the abandoned jefferson city home where he grew up talking about how his family went bankrupt due to a flood of expensive hospital bills he referenced his time on tour in the middle east when speaking about domestic issues calling abortion bans the work of big brother governments like in iraq and afghanistan thank you for fighting kunce wrote on twitter after the race was called never stop spencer toder a st louis entrepreneur who focused on grassroots service and democratic infrastructure in his campaign earned fervent support online but failed to garner significant support in the final

despite early attacks by republicans incumbent democrats fared better than expected in wa legislative races washington legislative republicans were taking stock wednesday of their less than dazzling performance in the initial returns of the august primary in most of the key swing districts incumbent democrats were polling above 50 percent and in some cases their republican challengers were trailing by as much as 10 points those weren t the results republicans or for that matter many democrats expected heading into tuesday s primary for months republican legislative leaders had been bullish about their ability to pick up seats and possibly even the majority in one or both chambers this year in july after a round of positive polling the republican state leadership committee a national group that helps elect gop candidates to state legislatures added washington to its opportunities to flip chambers list leading up to the primary republican backed independent expenditure campaigns poured money into key legislative districts negative ads hammered democratic candidates on issues like rising crime inflation and sky high gas prices the spending wasn t contained to just key swing districts for instance public disclosure commission records show 233 000 was spent against incumbent democrat manka dhingra in kirkland s 45th district which used to be a swing district but is now considered reliably democratic but instead of badly bruising democrats in advance of the general election the unusual blast of early spending and ads didn t appear to have the intended effect their attacks went nowhere said adam bartz the executive director of the washington senate democratic campaign people are solidly embracing democratic leadership of the legislature dhingra for instance had 66 percent of the vote in her race on tuesday night one of the most closely watched primary races was the 26th district state senate contest on the kitsap peninsula there first term democrat emily randall has been viewed as highly vulnerable but on tuesday evening she was polling at 53 percent compared to her closest republican challenger state rep jesse young who had 43 percent another republican in the race david crissman earned 4 percent of the initial count feeling so much joy gratitude this morning randall tweeted wednesday noting her support for reproductive rights the u s supreme court s recent overturning of roe v wade may have bolstered the electoral fortunes of democrats in recent weeks certainly in the wake of that ruling many democrats made access to abortion a front and center issue in their campaigns for republicans the early primary results served as a buzzkill to what they thought was their best chance in years at fundamentally altering the political makeup of the washington legislature but on wednesday they also emphasized that later arriving ballots might favor republican candidates and tighten up some of the races disappointed with the initial results naturally but i think it s too early to draw any real conclusions until we get more of the votes counted said senate republican leader john braun in a text message wednesday house republican leader j t wilcox conceded that his hope to have 10 to 12 seats in play was no longer viable

video embed a new report paints a damning picture of how health officials in the biden administration miscalculated the need for vaccines to combat monkeypox sources who spoke to the new york times fault the department of health and human services for failing early on in the outbreak to ask denmark based manufacturer bavarian nordic to prepare bulk stocks of the two dose vaccine already owned by the united states for distribution the u s government which invested more than 1 billion in the vaccine s development is now distributing 1 1 million doses which is less than the 3 5 million health officials estimate is necessary per the report who declares monkeypox global health emergency as outbreak spreads worldwide further the report notes hhs does not expect the next delivery of half a million doses until october and much of another 5 5 million ordered by the u s is not scheduled for delivery until next year among the factors fueling the dilemma was the u s failing to replenish its national stockpile of roughly 20 million doses and waiting weeks after the first case was detected in mid may to request delivery on may 23 hhs officials allowed bavarian nordic to deliver roughly 215 000 fully finished doses already purchased by the federal government to europe instead of holding them for the u s the report said at that time the report added there were only eight confirmed cases in the u s and the food and drug administration had not yet certified the plant where the jynneos vaccine was poured into vials monkeypox california lawrence gostin a former adviser to the centers for disease control and prevention who has consulted with the white house about monkeypox said there have been the same kinds of bureaucratic delays and forgetfulness and dropping the ball that we did during the covid pandemic the biden administration is taking steps to remedy the shortage including searching for another firm to take over the final manufacturing phase of bottling capping and labeling frozen bulk vaccine stored at bavarian nordic s headquarters outside copenhagen discussions are underway with grand river aseptic manufacturing a michigan factory that has helped produce covid 19 vaccines according to the report the administration has also ramped up testing capacity from around 6 000 tests performed per week to over 80 000 tests per week our response has accelerated to meet evolving needs on the ground and it will keep accelerating we will use every lever possible to continue allocating doses ahead of timelines as possible hhs assistant secretary for public affairs sarah lovenheim told the news outlet president joe biden who according to the report is upset by the vaccine shortage has formed a team led by two veteran public health experts to lead the national response to the monkeypox outbreak robert fenton a regional administrator for the federal emergency management agency is serving as the white house monkeypox coordinator with him dr demetre daskalakis director of the division of hiv prevention at the cdc and an expert in health issues affecting gay and transgender people is serving as deputy coordinator click here to read more from the washington examiner monkeypox typically spreads via skin to skin contact with such symptoms as headaches fevers swollen lymph nodes and rashes among others the cdc reported 6 617 confirmed monkeypox orthopoxvirus cases as of wednesday evening another vaccine acam2000 is available for the prevention of monkeypox although the cdc says there is a larger supply of acam2000 this vaccine should not be used in people who have certain health conditions such as a weakened immune system skin conditions like eczema or other exfoliative skin conditions or pregnancy the administration appointments came after democratic govs gavin newsom ca and j b pritzker il declared states of emergency over monkeypox on monday following gov kathy hochul s d ny declaration last week
this past april gov kathy hochul and democratic lawmakers had a rare luxury in the world of new york state government a budget surplus to spend boosted federal aid and increased taxes on the rich filled the stats coffers enabling the spending plan to increase funding for schools and health care provide bonuses to frontline suspend some gas taxes and increase pay for public workers but with an economic downturn potentially looming alarm bells are ringing in budget offices how the state s budget is shaped affects millions of new yorkers from where they go to school to how they get to work a recession could end the flush times of this year and lead to tough questions over taxes and spending it significantly changes the discussion because the financial plan was balanced over the next four years which was a great thing for the state said patrick orecki of the citizens budget commission this changes that discussion the division of budget this week project billions of dollars in gaps an estimation that revenue from taxes will not be enough to meet spending expectations and an acknowledgement the state s economy is likely sailing into headwinds it really changes the landscape and how the governor and legislature will have to approach the budget going forward orecki said the reality is with 6 billion budget gaps that s a big amount of money to tackle even under the status quo peter warren of the right leaning empire center think tank wrote in a post this week the development was a signal spending needs to be restrained next year where the economy and financial markets go from here is unknown he wrote but in retrospect it seems clear at least that the governor and the legislature should have showed more fiscal restraint in april thereâ s still time for hochul to go back and exercise some budget negotiations each year in albany are a push and pull between taxes and where to send the revenue the state relies on a relatively small number of very rich people to fund its priorities with education and health care being the most expensive items each year but the budget also provides aid to programs that support people with developmental disabilities boost measures to combat climate change and increase affordable housing on the other end is taxation fiscal hawks have warned that turning the tax dial too far on the rich could send them fleeing to cheaper states leaving fewer households to draw revenue from to pay for it all michael kink the executive director of the progressive organization strong economy for all hopes cuts to services won t be the case and doing so in a recession would hurt vulnerable people everyone knows that prices are skyrocketing and regular people poor people working people are having a tough time making ends meet kink said state government has a role to play can actually improve peoples lives kink pointed to the experience of previous recessions in which spending was cut and the state s economy was slow to recover we have a track record from prior recessions state governments that invest in their people and maintain public services do better he said we know have a tax system that actually reflects where the money is there s not really a recession for the super rich

on a reported basis and rebased basis as compared to the prior year period growth was driven by subscriber additions over the past twelve months resulting from investments in our networks products and

reduced consumer mobile revenue was due to a decline in prepaid subscribers and arpu vtr revenue was 28 and 16 lower on a reported and rebased basis respectively the year over year revenue decline was primarily driven by residential fixed revenue performance over the past twelve months intense competitive pressures have led to a reduction in arpu and subscriber numbers in addition strategic

million for the three months ended june 30 2022 and 2021 respectively and 162 million and 354 million for the six months ended june 30 2022 and 2021 respectively the declines during the 2022 periods are primarily due to goodwill impairments incurred during the second quarter of 2022 which were partially offset by decreases in depreciation and amortization expense as we ceased recording

june 30 2022 was flat and 1 lower respectively as compared to the corresponding prior year periods reported adjusted oibda performance in q2 and h1 2022 resulted from the net impact of organic declines in vtr and puerto rico which were mostly offset by 24 million and 42 million respectively contributed by operations acquired from telefónica in costa rica and organic growth at c w caribbean networks q2 2022 adjusted oibda growth segment highlights c w caribbean and networks adjusted oibda increased on a reported and rebased basis by 11 and 12 respectively this performance was driven by the aforementioned rebased revenue growth and our focus on cost control leading to an improved adjusted oibda margin of 46 1 c w panama adjusted oibda was 3 lower on a reported and rebased basis the decline was driven by higher equipment costs related to increased mobile handset sales and additional b2b projects and higher bad debt provisions as challenging economic conditions impacted customers in lower socio economic groups liberty puerto rico adjusted oibda declined by 8 on a reported and rebased basis the decline in the quarter was impacted primarily by a higher negative equipment sales margin as well as a lower net roaming margin and net incremental integration costs while the year over year decline was impacted by a tough comparison to last year we reported a sequential improvement from q1 and we expect continued improvement in the second half of the year vtr adjusted oibda was lower on a reported and rebased basis by 45 and 35 respectively the rebased decline was driven by the aforementioned decrease in revenue and a lower overall adjusted oibda margin as the revenue reduction was only partially offset by declines in variable costs including programming and commissions we continue to strive for operating efficiencies and our call center volume in june reached a two year low following improvements across key repair and installation metrics liberty costa rica adjusted oibda grew by 180 and 4 on a reported and rebased basis respectively reported growth benefited from the inclusion of telefónica s costa rica operations in the quarter rebased performance was driven by the aforementioned rebased revenue growth partly offset by 2 million of additional integration costs and a negative non functional fx impact of approximately 3 million as compared to the prior year period the costa rica colon depreciated by 9 in q2 as compared to the prior period quarter net earnings loss attributable to shareholders net earnings loss attributable to shareholders was 473 million

passed statistics based on those reviews non gaap reconciliations we include certain financial measures in this press release that are considered non gaap measures including i adjusted oibda adjusted oibda margin and adjusted oibda less p e additions ii adjusted free cash flow iii rebased revenue and rebased adjusted oibda growth rates and iv consolidated leverage ratios the following sections set forth reconciliations of the nearest gaap measure to our non gaap measures as well as information on how and why management of the company believes such information is useful to an investor adjusted oibda and adjusted oibda less p e additions adjusted oibda and adjusted oibda less p e additions each a non gaap measure are the primary measures used by our chief operating decision maker to evaluate segment operating performance adjusted oibda and adjusted oibda less p e additions are also key factors that are used by our internal decision makers to determine how to allocate resources to segments as we use the term adjusted oibda is defined as operating income or loss before share based compensation depreciation and amortization provisions and provision releases related to significant litigation and impairment restructuring and other operating items other operating items include i gains and losses on the disposition of long lived assets ii third party costs directly associated with successful and unsuccessful acquisitions and dispositions including legal advisory and due diligence fees as applicable and iii other acquisition related items such as gains and losses on the settlement of contingent consideration our internal decision makers believe adjusted oibda and adjusted oibda less p e additions are meaningful measures because they represent a transparent view of our recurring operating performance that is unaffected by our capital structure and allows management to i readily view operating trends ii perform analytical comparisons and benchmarking between segments and iii identify strategies to improve operating performance in the different countries in which we operate we believe our adjusted oibda and adjusted oibda less p e additions measures are useful to investors because they are one of the bases for comparing our performance with the performance of other companies in the same or similar industries although our measures may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other public companies adjusted oibda and adjusted oibda less p e additions should be viewed as measures of operating performance that are a supplement to and not a substitute for operating income or loss net earnings or loss and other u s gaap measures of income a reconciliation of our operating income or loss to total adjusted oibda and adjusted oibda

adjusted free cash flow definition and reconciliation we define adjusted free cash flow adjusted fcf a non gaap measure as net cash provided by our operating activities plus i cash payments for third party costs directly associated with successful and unsuccessful acquisitions and dispositions ii expenses financed by an intermediary iii insurance recoveries related to damaged and destroyed property and equipment and iv certain net interest payments or receipts incurred or received including associated derivative instrument payments and receipts in advance of a significant acquisition less a capital expenditures b distributions to noncontrolling interest owners c principal payments on amounts financed by vendors and intermediaries and d principal payments on finance leases we believe that our presentation of adjusted fcf provides useful information to our investors because this measure can be used to gauge our ability to service debt and fund new investment opportunities adjusted fcf should not be understood to represent our ability to fund discretionary amounts as we have various mandatory and contractual obligations including debt repayments which are not deducted to arrive at this amount investors should view adjusted fcf as a supplement to and not a substitute for u s gaap measures of liquidity included in our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows

acquired entities and d other items we deem appropriate we do not adjust pre acquisition periods to eliminate nonrecurring items or to give retroactive effect to any changes in estimates that might be implemented during post acquisition periods as we did not own or operate the acquired entities during the pre acquisition periods no assurance can be given that we have identified all adjustments necessary to present their revenue and adjusted oibda on a basis that is comparable to the corresponding post acquisition amounts that are included in our historical results or that the pre acquisition financial statements we have relied upon do not contain undetected errors in addition the rebased growth percentages are not necessarily indicative of the revenue and adjusted oibda that would have occurred if these transactions had occurred on the dates assumed for purposes of calculating our rebased amounts or the revenue and adjusted oibda that will occur in the future the rebased growth percentages have been presented as a basis for assessing growth rates on a comparable basis and should be viewed as measures of operating performance that are a supplement to and not a

washington ap republicans see inflation taxes and immigration as democratic weak spots worth attacking and two opposition senators as prime targets in the upcoming battle over an economic package the democrats want to push through the senate the measure embodies some of the top environment energy health care and tax policy aspirations that president joe biden and party leaders want to enact as voters start tuning in to this fall s congressional elections the gop would like to derail or weaken the measure or at least force democrats to take votes that would be painful to defend in reelection campaigns republicans are already aiming fire at sen joe manchin d w va who crafted the measure with senate majority leader chuck schumer d n y and unexpectedly pumped life into an effort most democrats considered moribund manchin is a conservative democrat from a deep red state who has scuttled his party s priorities before and republicans have savaged him in recent days an unsubtle signal that they ll be coming for him should he seek reelection in 2024 he made a terrible deal senate minority leader mitch mcconnell r ky told reporters this week how he can defend this from a west virginia point of view or think of it as a centrist type of agreement is astonishing this is an agreement only bernie sanders would love even sen shelley moore capito r w va who has a strong relationship with manchin and seldom clashes with him publicly lambasted the legislation for imposing a minimum tax on huge profitable corporations that she said would hinder investments like many west virginians i m concerned that this tax increase will delay closing the digital divide in rural communities she said republicans are taking a softer approach with sen kyrsten sinema d ariz who has been coy about the legislation and has shown concerns about tax increases she s her party s biggest question mark on this bill in the 50 50 chamber where all republicans seem certain to vote no and she s held several discussions with gop senators during votes this week sinema has opposed past proposals to raise taxes on wealthy equity firm executives which this time would raise around 14 billion of this legislation s 739 billion in revenue she met with arizona manufacturers who oppose boosting the corporate minimum tax and thanked her afterward in a tweet for her thoughtful approach willingness to listen to az job creators i don t know what she thinks idaho sen mike crapo top republican on the senate finance committee told reporters we are making our case is the best we can say the 10 year measure includes hundreds of billions in spending and tax breaks to encourage alternative energy production and to bolster fossil fuels with steps like tax breaks for technology that reduces carbon emissions there s also money to help people buy private health coverage and provisions giving medicare the power to negotiate prices on some drugs with pharmaceutical makers the bill will lower costs fight inflation and secure historic wins in the fight against climate change schumer said the gop seems certain to try stripping or toning down the corporate minimum tax and language raising taxes on wealthy equity firm executives as well and has hopes of winning over sinema as the decisive vote for that after she opposed democrats proposed tax rate increases last year on corporations and high earners they switched to a corporate minimum tax that she supported but it is uncertain if she will do so now republicans could fashion amendments aimed at particular democratic senators such as one exempting coal producers from certain taxes in a play for manchin to buttress its argument the gop released an analysis by the nonpartisan joint committee on taxation that republicans said showed tax boosts for people earning below 400 000 that would violate biden s pledge to not boost levies on that income group ordinary americans would bear a substantial part of the burden of this tax increase said no 2 senate gop leader john thune of south dakota democrats dismissed that attack noting that the study omitted the effect of the bill s health care and energy tax breaks for individuals it also counted lower salaries stock prices and dividends it believes will occur as part of the effect the bill would have on people overall the congressional budget office said wednesday the measure could trim federal deficits by around 305 billion but 204 billion of that would come from improving irs tax collections which will be real if it occurs but the nonpartisan agency does not count in its formal scoring of the bill s impact in a bow to dominant voter concerns about gasoline prices and overall consumer costs democrats call the bill the inflation reduction act yet its impact on the nation s worst bout with inflation in four decades seems likely to be limited the university of pennsylvania s penn wharton budget model estimated the measure would very slightly increase inflation until 2024 and decrease inflation thereafter though the changes would be statistically indistinguishable from zero mcconnell said that study showed the democrats bill would actually increase inflation in the short term and do nothing for inflation in the long term democrats have cited a moody s analytics report saying the bill would nudge the economy and inflation in the right direction and they distributed a letter by five former treasury secretaries including henry paulson jr who served under gop president george w bush saying the measure would strengthen the economy lower costs for families and fight inflation that battlefield suggests republican amendments are likely on the subject of prices one could imagine a proposal preventing the bill from taking effect unless inflation or gasoline prices fall to certain levels democratic leaders are trying this week to unify rank and file senators against such plans the gop could also try to renew immigration restrictions imposed by president donald trump that cited the pandemic as a reason to exclude migrants an issue that sharply divides democrats and they might seek to delete tax credits aimed at encouraging alternative energy and that favor companies that pay union scale wages ___ ap reporter seung min kim contributed to this report
with enough monkeypox vaccine to fully vaccinate only 743 people in wisconsin public health organizations are finding demand is quickly outpacing supply in cities across the state the city of milwaukee health department announced it was opening a vaccine clinic wednesday warning right out the gate that supply is limited all initial appointments were filled as of wednesday and it was unclear when more would be made available milwaukee health officials said they have received 200 doses of the jynneos monkeypox vaccine from the state the health department is working with clinical and community organizations including but not limited to sexual health clinics and hiv prep providers to reach out to eligible people and get the word out this is a significant step in combating monkeypox in milwaukee but unfortunately there is currently not enough vaccine for everyone eligible said milwaukee health commissioner kirsten johnson i understand the urgency to get vaccinated but we ask for you to please be patient while in this time of scarcity we need to focus on protecting those who are most vulnerable public health madison and dane county began offering the vaccine monday its first two weeks of available appointments are already booked according to a statement released wednesday morning the public health department emphasized it would not schedule appointments without sufficient vaccines in stock according to morgan finke a spokesperson for phmdc dane county is able to vaccinate a maximum of 75 people per week because vaccination for monkeypox is a two dose series the number in stock has been cut in half to accommodate the second doses due in four weeks time we re hoping to increase that as soon as we get more access finke said and i do know that there are plans to scale that up as we move along and even in a much smaller milwaukee county community slots to get vaccines are all filled the cudahy health department s started offering the vaccine wednesday and also has clinics planned for friday and tuesday the spots filled up very quickly public health manager teresa ortiz said health officials there have not scheduled additional clinics at this time but plan to schedule more when additional doses are made available as of noon on tuesday wisconsin has 22 presumed cases of monkeypox according to the wisconsin department of health services dhs identified three priority groups for vaccination those who have had sexual relations in the last two weeks with someone diagnosed with monkeypox people who have attended an event or venue with known monkeypox exposure and notably gay and bisexual men trans men and women gender non conforming people and any man who has had sex with men in the last 14 days finke with dane county said the department is underscoring that people who have had exposure must get vaccinated within a 14 day window she said it has a certain number of reserves for those individuals who fall into this critical category that supply issue is a problem for many in the lgbtq community especially gay and bisexual men and trans men and women who want to stay safe as states across the country declare monkeypox a medical emergency for marginalized and minoritized populations it often takes one person who gets the message that there s a barrier a hurdle something not available to them warren scherer director of the gender and sexuality campus center at university of wisconsin madison said that message ripples across the community in a variety of ways it ramps up the fear according to the cdc 99 of male patients diagnosed with monkeypox with information on sexual activity reported male to male sexual contact with the caveat that publicly reported data are still missing but the spread is not exclusively among men who have sex with men anyone can get monkeypox but because it is not easily spread from person to person public health experts maintain there is no immediate risk to the general public the virus spreads through close intimate physical contact i think one important piece of information to get out to the public is that the risk to the general public is low and therefore the vaccine is not recommended for everyone ortiz said for those who are eligible but waiting on more vaccines to become available ortiz recommended that people avoid having sex with their partners if they have monekypox ortiz also recommended people avoid handling or touching the bedding or clothing of an infected person people who are exposed to monkeypox should monitor for symptoms for 21 days and contact their doctor immediately if they develop any she said washing your hands with soap and water or using an alcohol based hand sanitizer is enough to kill the monkeypox virus condoms do not prevent the spread of the virus more monkeypox has spread to wisconsin here s what you need to know about the disease and how to avoid it at froedtert hospital in milwaukee medical director for infection prevention and control dr mary beth graham said wednesday the hospital has been allocated 150 first doses of the vaccine and expects to receive them later this week the state is also holding 150 second doses to deliver to froedtert at a later time graham said she s hopeful they ll be able to start vaccinating people at two health centers run by froedtert and the medical college of wisconsin next week mcw serves as one of five monkeypox vaccine hubs for dhs the others are ssm health mayo clinic health system in eau claire the state agency s headquarters in madison and prevea health with these hubs in place individual health care providers do not store monkeypox vaccines at this time said dr ashok rai ceo of prevea health in an email wednesday public health officials have stated that if you think you have monkeypox you should communicate closely with your doctor and keep them apprised of developing symptoms most people isolate until they recover in the meantime they should avoid

the stars finally seem to be aligning for pakistan s economy following three odd years of mismanagement by the previous pti government which in turn came in the wake of decades of neglect by all rulers the local currency jumped by a historic rs9 58 per dollar in the interbank market registering a 4 19 per cent appreciation against the greenback the rally was even more impressive in the open market with the greenback trading at rs230 losing rs15 from the open market high of rs245 the stocks chimed in with an equally impressive rally the benchmark index gained over 2 per cent the global bond market responded right on cue with yields on all pakistani bond issues down by 30 to 410 basis points on august 3 from yields reported a day earlier yields on pakistani bonds maturing this year fell by 340 bps to 43 7 per cent while bonds maturing in 2024 declined by 410 bps to 41 8 per cent this is a healthy trend the rupee s historic rebound began after finance minister dr miftah ismail flanked by the sbp acting head asserted the economy s strong fundamentals and signalled the authorities readiness to intervene in favour of the rupee if the need arose he also announced that pakistan had delivered on all the prior actions to qualify for the revival of a stalled bailout from the imf the fund s country representative dropped a terse note confirming the government s assertion giving the markets further reason to be optimistic this was also an endorsement of positive signals already emanating from washington dc demonstrating that perhaps coas gen qamar javed bajwa s telephone diplomacy was not in vain a third factor contributing to this buoyant mood were encouraging trade numbers indicating that the measures the government undertook to dampen imports are working latest data published by the pakistan bureau of statistics pbs showed the country s merchandise trade deficit for july 2022 tallied at 2 64 billion down by 46 77 per cent month on month this healthy tapering of the trade deficit was helped primarily by a 38 per cent fall in imports month on month taking some pressure off the rupee but the greatest boost of all seems to have come from the ecp s verdict in the prohibited funding case earlier in july we saw the markets react negatively after imran khan s political alliance took over punjab now that the ecp ruling has taken the sting out of that threat the markets promptly cut their perception of political risk rebounding on fundamentals these are all good omens but this is no time to be complacent for one thing there is the task of lining up financing commitments from other sources the authorities are already in touch with friendly countries like china saudi arabia and the uae all of whom are said to be amenable to helping pakistan out however a tentative understanding is not the same as a written commitment to chip in with hard currency injections which is what the imf appears to be insisting on there is nothing on the horizon to suggest pakistan cannot secure those commitments time however is of the essence the news of pakistan having these commitments secured should break any moment now enabling pakistan to send the letter of intent to the imf in time for its executive board meeting in late august equally important the political leadership of the country would do well to keep political risk in check by ensuring there are no street protests or shutdowns political risk can still throw a spanner in the works and the importance of mitigating it cannot be overemphasized the finance minister and his team must not take their eye off the ball once the imf s extended fund facility eff is back on track in fact that would mark the beginning of their real task pushing ahead with the much needed structural reform to remove the systemic distortions that have bedevilled our economy for decades now the temptation to declare victory at such a juncture and return to political expediencies will not be easy to resist especially for a political government moving into election year the pressure from within the pdm coalition to recoup some of the political capital burnt while averting default on the country s external obligations may also come into play prime minister shehbaz sharif and his cabinet colleagues just learnt the hard way the importance of building trust with our multilateral and bilateral lenders as well as with domestic markets that lesson must be internalized they must spare us the usual election year political shenanigans involving populist decisions and policy slippages and stick to the reform agenda pakistan has signed up to absent a realization of the importance of the economy s structural health on the part of our rulers that is our only hope of charting a sustainable path to low inflation respectable growth and hopefully at some point even prosperity

up to four times more americans are catching lyme disease than a decade and a half ago a study on insurance claims has suggested in another sign the illness is becoming more widespread analysis by fair health owner of one of america s largest claims databases revealed a 357 percent surge in applications linked to the tick borne illness from 2007 to 2021 across rural areas but there was also an uptick in towns and cities where it rose by 65 percent over the same period experts warned more people were catching lyme disease more than ever before across the united states but the uptick may also be driven by surging awareness of the invisible disease thanks to high profile cases in celebrities including singer shania twain and socialite yolanda hadid people who said they had recovered from the disease today called on americans to take this seriously adding that it could leave them suffering symptoms for years analysis by fair health looked through more than 36 billion private healthcare claims filed across most of america s 50 states yolanda hadid left and shania twain right are among celebrities who have had lyme disease experts say this may have raised awareness of the condition lyme disease is a bacterial infection that is spread through a tick bite it causes a round rash and can trigger flu like symptoms but usually gets better with antibiotics within weeks or months pictured stock of tick for the analysis experts at fair health combed through more than 36 billion private healthcare claims from america s 50 states for all those mentioning lyme disease they looked as those for antibiotics and those for long term symptoms including fatigue muscle pain and confusion doctors say patients can be left suffering after effects of the illness for months even when they receive treatment quickly what is lyme disease lyme disease is a bacterial infection that is spread to humans by infected ticks it causes symptoms including a circle or oval shaped rash around a tick bite which usually appears within four weeks of being bitten but may take up to three months to show some people also get flu like symptoms in the days after being bitten including a high temperature a headache muscle and joint pain and a loss of energy and a few of those treated for lyme disease continue to have symptoms such as tiredness aches and a loss of energy that can last for years it s not clear why some suffer from ongoing symptoms and there is no agreed treatment for the disease not all ticks carry the bacteria that causes lyme disease but infected ticks can be found across the uk high risk areas include grassy and wooded areas in northern and southern england as well as the scottish highlands people are advised to remove ticks safely and as soon as possible using tweezers advertisement breaking down the data by region showed new jersey mainly urban had the most lyme disease claims filed in 2021 but vermont and maine mostly rural had the second and third highest numbers of claims the analysts also pointed to data from 2017 however which showed north carolina had the third highest number of claims which they said suggested the disease was spreading in new areas fair health did not reveal the raw numbers behind its percentages because this was not informative when contacted by dailymail com a spokesman pointed to a page run by johns hopkins in baltimore maryland which gave the figures for u s states individually by month as claims per 100 000 people it did not give an overall figure for the country or for rural vs urban areas awareness of lyme disease has risen in recent years after celebrities became infected with the illness shania twain was diagnosed with the disease in the early 2000s saying it was quite scary as it left her feeling very dizzy on stage and suffering blackouts last year yolanda hadid revealed she had been diagnosed with the invisible disease which she said reduced her from a social butterfly to someone suffering anxiety brain fog and flu like symptoms but the centers for disease control and prevention cdc has also raised by a third its estimate of how many people are catching lyme disease in a sign it is becoming more widespread in 2014 they said 300 000 odd people were being infected every 12 months but last year they raised this to 476 000 fair health president robin gelburd said their data suggested the illness remains a growing public health concern she added fair health will continue to use its repository of claims data to provide actionable and relevant insights to healthcare stakeholders seeking to

the mainland according to the police ministry taiwan plays an outsized role in the chip industry for an island of 24 5 million people accounting for more than half the global supply its producers

developing its own industry which supplies low end chips for autos and appliances but cannot support the latest smartphones tablet computers medical devices and other products chips are china s

foreign market beijing has tried to use access to its markets to undermine tsai and other taiwanese leaders it accuses of pursuing independence the communist party also has used military action in the
