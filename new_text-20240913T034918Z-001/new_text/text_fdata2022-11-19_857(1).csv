after five days of testimony including three hours from elon musk a delaware judge will now decide whether musk s 56 billion pay package from tesla inc was justified by the company s explosive growth or undermined by a flawed process musk and the tesla directors named as defendants repeatedly testified that the package achieved what it set out to do deliver 10 fold growth in the company s stock price enriching investors and musk we thought if we could pull this off if this plan was executed tesla would be one of the most valuable technology companies antonio gracias a tesla board member from 2007 to 2021 told the delaware court of chancery on wednesday it was a great deal for the shareholders the trial seeks to resolve claims by shareholder richard tornetta that the 2018 pay package was dictated by musk the world s richest person to subservient directors and approved by a vote of shareholders who were misled by tesla the trial wrapped up on friday as musk struggles to oversee a chaotic overhaul of twitter inc which he was forced to buy for 44 billion in a separate legal battle before the same judge chancellor kathaleen mccormick my sense is that even though it went all the way to trial a ruling is going to favor mr musk said eric talley a professor at columbia law school who has followed the case it will be months before mccormick rules and her decision can be appealed to the delaware supreme court during the week long trial directors said the pay package was meant to ensure musk guided the electric vehicle maker through a critical phase when he could have focused on his rocket company spacex or tunneling venture the boring co musk told the board he wanted a huge package to finance his dream of travel to mars or as he testified to make life multi planetary in order to ensure the long term survival of consciousness musk described his efforts to push the company from the brink of failure in 2017 to exponential growth the amount of pain no words can express musk testified on wednesday gracias recalled that musk celebrated his birthday in a factory conference room with a grocery store cake this was all hands on deck 24 7 brutal he told the court the package allows musk to buy 1 of tesla s stock at a deep discount each time escalating performance and financial targets are met otherwise musk gets nothing tesla has hit 11 of the 12 targets as its value ballooned briefly to more than 1 trillion from 50 billion tornetta wants the plan rescinded and the stock granted under the plan returned to tesla much of the trial focused on the information provided to shareholders before they approved the plan tornetta s lawyers tried to show tesla concealed that three targets of the package were likely to be quickly met the plaintiff portrayed the directors as personal friends or business partners of musk who was the link to their wealth the directors tried to show they could hold the line against musk s demands but evidence of extracting concessions was limited to the best method for accounting for the stock grants and a requirement that musk had to hold his stock for five years it wasn t a knock down drag out affair todd maron testified about the pay talks in 2017 when he was general counsel talley said musk is a unique ceo and his pay reflects that he s like a labrador retriever he sees a ball and he runs after it you could almost make an argument they didn t pay him enough because he ran off after twitter

seattle ap washington banned fish farming with net pens in state waters on friday citing danger to struggling native salmon public lands commissioner hilary franz issued an executive order banning the aquaculture method which involves raising fish in large floating pens anchored in the water and has been practiced in puget sound for more than three decades california oregon and alaska have already outlawed net pen aquaculture and canada is working on a plan to phase it out of british columbia s coastal waters by 2025 supporters say fish farming is an environmentally safe way to feed the world s growing population critics argue that it can spread disease to native stocks and degrade the environment as we ve seen too clearly here in washington there is no way to safely farm fish in open sea net pens without jeopardizing our struggling native salmon franz said i m proud to stand with the rest of the west coast today by saying our waters are far too important to risk for fish farming profits salmon aquaculture is among the fastest growing food production systems in the world according to the world wildlife foundation it accounts for about 70 of the market in 2018 the world resources institute released a report that said the industry needs to more than double by 2050 to meet the seafood demands of 10 billion people since 2016 all of the net pens in washington s marine waters have been owned by the same company new brunswick canada based seafood giant cooke aquaculture in a statement earlier this week after the state said it would terminate the company s remaining leases in puget sound the company said it was disappointed environmental organizations and commissioner franz are choosing to ignore the fact that farm raised fish is one of the healthiest and most efficient ways to feed the global population with a minimal environmental impact and the lowest carbon footprint of any animal protein cooke said farmers work closely with world renowned scientists from academia government and the private sector to develop rigorous standards and implement best practices for fish health and environmental protection in 2017 a net pen operated by cooke off cypress island near the san juan archipelago collapsed and released 260 000 nonnative atlantic salmon in puget sound the escape prompted a frantic response by the lummi indian tribe which mobilized its fishing crews to capture tens of thousands of the atlantic salmon before they could intermingle or breed with native salmon the company argued that the fish were sterile and would simply die without threatening native salmon stocks but the legislature responded in 2018 and banned raising nonnative fish in the pens cooke transitioned to raising native steelhead but many native american tribes and environmental groups including wild fish conservancy still objected saying that the unnaturally large clusters of farmed fish spread disease to wild populations and that their bulk feeding and excretions degrade the marine environment several studies have found that young sockeye salmon from british columbia s fraser watershed were infected with higher levels of sea lice after swimming past fish pens the seattle times reported and in march an audit revealed sea lice counts at about five times the legal limit at a farm in clayoquot sound on the west coast of vancouver island the lice can affect salmon growth and in severe cases cause death it s about the disease vectors and how that can escape into wild populations said todd woodard natural resources director for the samish indian nation when you say we re raising native fish native fish are not raised and reared in those kinds of concentrated environments after the 2017 collapse washington s department of natural resources ramped up its inspections of net pens in port angeles on the olympic peninsula the department terminated a net pen lease for failing to maintain the facility in a safe condition and operating in an unauthorized area cooke challenged the decision unsuccessfully in court and earlier this week the state terminated cooke aquaculture s remaining net pen leases in rich passage near bainbridge island and near hope island in skagit bay the company has until dec 14 to finish steelhead farming and to start deconstructing its equipment the decision will force cooke to kill 332 000 juvenile steelhead that were planned to be stocked at its two remaining net pens next year the company said this is a big victory for everyone who values the puget sound ecosystem suquamish tribe chairman leonard forsman said according to the seattle times this action eliminates a harmful impact in our ancestral waters the rich passage net pens have blocked and polluted our fishing grounds for too long and we are relieved to know they will be removed restoring our waters back to a more natural state copyright the associated press all rights reserved this material may not be published broadcast rewritten or redistributed
online feature highlights of api 685 3rd edition sealless pumps part 1 authors f korkowski applied k3nowledge consulting brea california t hess e²g the equity engineering group inc philadelphia pennsylvania j cooper bechtel energy houston texas and m v d heuvel bp randstad the netherlands the american petroleum institute api 685 3rd ed standard sealless centrifugal pumps for petroleum petrochemical and gas industry process service has been updated to the third edition and published in july 2022 it addresses both magnetic drive pumps mdps and canned motor pumps cmps due to the nature of the extensive work done to compose the third edition there are three parts to this article part 1 addresses the significant changes to the standard part 2 includes other changes of interest to the reader and part 3 focuses exclusively on secondary containment secondary control along with associated instrumentation requirements the contents of this article were first published at the turbomachinery and pump symposium held in houston texas u s in september 2022 this article part 1 describes the process of updating the document and cites the participating companies contributing to this work along with addressing the significant changes that are of interest to the reader in understanding revisions from the previous api editions included are the influences and reasons behind each of these changes insight into subject matter for future updates to api 685 is addressed at the end three areas of particular interest addressed in the 685 3rd ed standard are an expanded introduction answering the questions raised by the oil and gas community where and when are api sealless pumps typically used expanding information required to properly complete the api 685 data sheets this insured all parameters for the proper selection and scope of supply for sealless pumps are accurately addressed by both purchaser and pump manufacturers the introduction of a new informative annex to address multistage overhung sealless pumps note the current api 685 3rd covers the requirements for single stage horizontal and vertical inline overhung pumps details on this annex will follow later in this article history api 385 3rd ed work started on the api 685 3rd ed back in june 2016 with the first committee draft issued to the api subcommittee on mechanical equipment some in june 2017 the first task force draft was issued in august 2017 and 152 comments were received from the api community those of a technical nature were reviewed and resolved during the november 2017 some meeting the first official ballot including all the annexes was issued in september 2018 resulting in nearly 300 additional comments of those 70 were technical in nature and were resolved during the november 2018 some meeting the second official ballot was issued in july 2019 this version received 70 comments of which 20 were technical the technical items were resolved during the november 2019 some meeting the final draft of api 685 3rd ed was released to api for producing galley proofs which are given one last review by the task force the publication of the document was in july 2022 the entire process took 6 yr a requirement of the revision process is to compare the previous api 685 2nd ed with the latest edition of the some standard paragraphs i e an api document which applies to all api standards then the 2nd ed document is further reviewed to address items which may need correction or improvement in wording to improve readability and prevent misinterpretations include technologies incurred since the 2011 issuing of the 2 nd including inputs from end users contractors and vendors on latest experiences for consideration for inclusion in the 3 rd ed including inputs from end users contractors and vendors on latest experiences for consideration for inclusion in the 3 ed incorporate the latest wording contained of api 610 12th where possible applicable to ensure consistency of technical requirements that are common to api 610 and api 685 pumps this process was accomplished by dividing the document into three sections paragraphs on design which state requirements applying to all sealless pumps both mdps and cmps fig 1 and 2 and the specific section for mdps outlining additional requirements over and above those contained in the design sections the specific section on cmps fig 1 example of sealless mdp photo courtesy of flowserve fig 2 example of a sealless cmp photo courtesy of teikoku usa three task force subgroups worked independently on one of the three sections afterwards the entire task force reviewed each item to determine the final proposed changes to incorporate in the 3rd ed each task force subgroup carefully reviewed all bulleted paragraphs for making possible changes a bullet at the beginning of a clause or paragraph in an api document indicates either a decision by or further information from the purchaser is required an example of this is a purchaser selecting witnessing a pump performance test non witness performance test is required for all api pumps however witnessing this test is an option that is beyond the default api requirements there are slightly more than 100 bullet items in api 685 specific bulleted items are addressed later in this article task force formation and objectives numerous companies provided experts in their fields to produce the api 685 3rd ed document engineering contractors end users and pump manufacturers comprised an international team to explore discuss and debate a variety of topics eight end users eight contractors consultants and 21 vendors contributed to api 685 3rd ed with additional members from the some aiding when needed the following companies and several private consultants contributed to this work bechtel kbr shell petrobras repsol total bp refining chevron phillips 66 flowserve hermetic itt goulds hmd kontro klaus union gmbh teikoku nikkiso japan sulzer sundyne chemours mechanical solutions inc power dyne consultants and the equity engineering group inc the api 685 task force was led by its chairman jim bryant kbr retired vice chair jeremy cooper bechtel and secretary ian james consultant the update process api standards are on a 5 yr review cycle therefore approximately 3 yr after a standard has been published a task force is reformed to review the current standard and determine if it requires updating to conform with current technology and market practices whether it can be reaffirmed presuming the decision is to revise the standard the task force determines how best to accomplish the updating work makes committee assignments and recommends proposed changes all changes must be approved by the task force before they are included in the first draft of the revised standard one important step in the review process is for the task force to consider how any standard paragraphs within the api standards document which applies to all equipment pertain to specific paragraphs in the api 685 document this provides a certain consistency among all rotating equipment decisions are made to either change the api 685 standard to agree with api some standard paragraphs modify the standard paragraph to better suit the standard being reviewed justify that the standard paragraph does not apply to the equipment for which the standard is intended and remove it the sequence process timeline was provided earlier in this article some additional interesting details of this process follow global participation by members on the task force as well as companies responding to the ballots helped to ensure the specification applies worldwide the main roles of the task force chairman vice chairman and secretary are to prepare proposed resolutions to each comment received the proposed resolutions are presented to the task force to discuss and determine the wording that will become the presentation draft the same process is used to produce the first ballot and any subsequent drafts the criteria defined by api for passing a ballot and proceed to publishing is response rate must be 50 approval rate must be 66 7 any negative ballot must be resolved the second and final ballot for api 685 3rd ed received a response rate of 76 based on 37 ballots an approval rate of 100 and no negative ballots all negative ballots must be resolved before the revised standard can be published the balloting process usually takes 1 mos 6 mos the entire process usually takes between 2yr 4 yr depending on the magnitude of the changes significant additions and changes the api 685 task force started the process of reviewing several items based on inputs from the some membership industry leaders updates from referenced specifications such as the hydraulic institute and task force members key additions or modifications recommended for api 685 3rd ed are as follows considerations for using api sealless pumps new informative annex addressing multi stage overhung sealless pumps inclusion of recommended practice api rp 691 risk based machinery management material columns reduction addition and improvements to material designations updated annexes for material class selection guidelines and material columns clearer definitions for secondary containment and secondary control as well as methods to achieve these items instrumentation and controls considerations data sheets constructed to address all operating conditions elimination of implied warranty clarifications on baseplate types for mdps and cmps pump selection criteria clarification of several definitions particularly discharge pressure considerations for using api sealless pumps one of the requests presented to the api 685 task force was to provide some inputs as to where and when sealless pumps are typically applied relative to specific applications and liquids often found in refineries and other hydrocarbon petrochemical and gas plants the decision was to include such information in the introduction section of the 3rd ed document the listing is extensive and addresses what is generally categorized as typically difficult services to seal i e with traditional api 610 pumps fitted with mechanical seals these include the very light end low specific gravity hydrocarbon liquids acids such as sulfuric and hydrofluoric and aromatics such as benzene with stringent environmental requirements to minimize volatile organic compounds voc emissions sealless pumps become a candidate for consideration each end user generally defines in their overlay specifications specific details as to when to use cmp and mdp products services with a high concentration of hydrogen sulfide h 2 s or those with amines or caustic solutions are candidates as well often solids size and concentration limits are also addressed with the sealless pump manufacturers based on their experiences and guidelines new annex multi stage overhung sealless pumps end users contractors and pump manufacturers all asked why is api 685 limited to only single stage overhung pumps horizontal and vertical inline since the 2nd ed of api 685 was issued back in 2011 the technology for sealless pumps has evolved to other configurations the next question was why not include multi stage overhung sealless pumps to include these pumps in the body of the api 685 document would require extensive restructuring of the document e g how api 610 addresses between bearing multi stage pumps and how two stage overhung pumps require purchaser approval basis manufacturer s proven experience the usage of multi stage overhung sealless pumps at this stage is somewhat limited to certain manufacturers as such the task force submitted to the some a proposal to construct an informative to inform not mandate annex that would highlight the various elements that an end user must consider when applying a multi stage overhung sealless pump and to include images of both multi stage cmp and mdp configurations fig 3 the some approved so this annex has been included it is considered the first step in a larger process as this will most definitely be a subject for further discussion for the future 4th ed of api 685 fig 3 example of an overhung multi stage mdp graphic courtesy of the hydraulic institute fig 4 example of an overhung multi stage cmp graphic courtesy of the hydraulic institute inclusion of api rp 691 risk based machinery management api 685 3rd ed includes reference to api rp 691 by means of bulleted paragraphs whereby the purchaser must advise the vendor when this recommended practice document is invoked api rp 691 addresses high risk machinery i e compressors pumps engines motors and gears among others suggested criteria as a function of fluid services limits and technical readiness levels trl ranging from conceptual prototype equipment to well established field proven machinery when api rp 691 is invoked the vendor is to advise whether equipment is not of the field qualified level which translates to trl 7 or 6 level 7 is field proven with equipment operating for more than 3 yr and that demonstrates low risk level 6 is system installed whereby equipment has been operating successfully for less than 3 yr the other trls describe the state of development or stages for a product level 1 is just a concept level 2 is proof of concept and levels 3 5 cover prototype stages any of these lower levels need careful review between the purchaser and vendor in evaluating the risk for the product and the end user s system note all future updates of any api standard will include api rp 691 materials changes were made to api 685 3rd ed annexes for materials class selection guidance annex g and materials and material specifications for pump parts annex h in part to be consistent with the changes implemented in api 610 12th ed consideration was given to what additional materials may be needed for sealless pumps due to their different configuration with containment shells secondary control and secondary containment relative to the types of service fluids they handle the key changes included the following the deletion of cast iron material columns i 1 and i 2 since api pump manufacturers generally no longer pour cast iron casings and api users generally want a repairable material starting with carbon steel for pressure boundary parts the deletion of columns s 1 and s 3 as there is little usage of cast iron and ni resist internals also like the reasoning to eliminate i 1 and i 2 material columns repair welding these materials is difficult the new starting point is s 4 annex g upgraded recommended materials for caustic sodium hydroxide with concentrations of 20 and temperatures 100 c 210 f have been upgraded from s 1 to s 4 or a 8 since s 1 materials have been removed from api 685 3 rd as addressed above as addressed above the addition of material codes for the following alloy 20 for the u s astm unified numbering system uns european en and japanese jis japanese codes for alloy b and alloy c and the new ni cu alloy 400 for s 6 materials changing 4140 shaft material to 12 chrome to ensure thermal growth compatibility between the impeller and the shaft and to be consistent with api 610 12 th the removal of ca15 for impellers ca6nm was already required for pump casings in api 610 11 th and is now consistent with the 12 th ed and is recommended for improved castability weldability and resistance to in service stress cracking and is now consistent with the 12 ed and is recommended for improved castability weldability and resistance to in service stress cracking for c 6 materials under auxiliary connections 316l piping and fittings are to be used up to 260 c 500 f and inconel 625 for temperatures above 260 c 500 f for consistency with api 610 12 th when reduced hardness materials are specified by the customer the requirement applies to both the primary and secondary casings and to nace mr0103 which applies to refineries lng and chemical plants unless the customer specifies mr0175 which applies to oil and gas production units and natural gas sweetening plants when reduced hardness materials are specified by the customer the requirement applies to both the primary and secondary casings and to nace mr0103 which applies to refineries lng and chemical plants unless the customer specifies mr0175 which applies to oil and gas production units and natural gas sweetening plants prohibition of cadmium plated piping bolting due to the carcinogenic nature of cadmium regarding magnetic coupling materials addressed in annex d for mdps increased values for remanence of maximum magnetic flux density coercivity demagnetizing force and maximum bh product overall magnetic strength sm1co5 and alnico 5 have been removed since they are superseded by sm2co17 and alnico8 materials secondary controls and containment and instrumentation and controls details of secondary controls and containment along with instrumentation and controls will be discussed in part 3 elimination of implied warranty as done with api 610 12th ed api 685 3rd ed was updated to remove wording about a 20 yr minimum service life excluding normal wear parts and a stipulation of an uninterrupted operation period of 3 yr without shutting down equipment for maintenance or inspection the wording regarding service life was replaced by wording that states that the purchaser should specify the period of uninterrupted continuous operation most manufacturers installation operation and maintenance iom manuals address items such as frequency for changing oil and identifying parts that are expected to be replaced due to normal wear over time the iom manuals also typically have recommendations as to which parts the end user should stock as spares table l1 in annex l of api 685 3rd ed provides guidance on which parts and what quantity are recommended to be provided as spares baseplates there are two interesting changes that were made to api 685 2nd ed to represent the current industry practices regarding cmp and mdp baseplates these are eliminating annex m and improving the descriptions of baseplate types used for mdp annex m in api 685 2nd ed standard baseplates has been eliminated in api 685 3rd ed annex m was normative and provided 21 pre engineered baseplate sizes along with their anchor bolt locations identical to api 610 11th ed the primary reasons behind removing annex m were there is no coupling between the canned motor and pump cmps do not require a typical api 610 style baseplate the unit footprint is significantly smaller than that used for conventional 610 and 685 mdp packages which require room to accommodate an external motor and coupling conversely cmp installations are configured such that the pumps are often free to move with the piping system especially for small sizes typically mdp packages utilize smaller ranges of driver power the packages use smaller baseplates because there are usually not auxiliary sealing systems e g plan 52 53 or gas panels which generally require the larger baseplates used for api 610 pumps engineering contractors are now satisfied with vendors issuing general arrangement drawings in a timely matter due to improved electronic systems to generate them descriptions of the three basic types of baseplates for mdp were improved to depict the baseplate types identical to api 610 12th ed more accurately drain rim and drain pan are removed and replaced with a baseplate with a flat deck type and a sloped gutter drain a baseplate with a sloped deck plate mounted between the side rails and extending beneath the pump and driver a baseplate with a sloped deck plate mounted between the side rails and extending only under the pump and coupling it remains the responsibility of the end user to select one of the three baseplate configurations pump selection criteria the one significant change impacting pump selections is for the head curve to be continuously rising to shutoff zero flow in 685 2nd ed it was preferred now however both api 685 3rd ed and api 610 12th ed require a rising head curve only when specified by the end user and always when pumps run in parallel to prevent one pump driving the other to shut off flow this was changed because it is characteristic of low specific speed pumps for their head curves to sometimes droop at shutoff it should be noted that irrespective of the change in both api standards many end user s overlay specifications still require a head curve that continuously rises to shutoff end of curve is now defined as 120 of best efficiency point bep however for low specific speed pumps the end of curve may be only 105 to 110 of bep because the head curve drops off quickly for these types of pumps also it is preferred that the pump bep flow rate is between the rated point and the normal flow point to maximize pump efficiency between the two main operating points on the pump performance curve api 685 2nd ed did not mention normal point but now it is addressed within the specification and on the data sheets these changes are consistent with api 610 12th ed wording for new positive suction head available npsh and npsh3 requirements have been modified to be consistent with api 610 12th ed most important is the reference point for defining npsha this can be either the pump centerline which is the typical reference for defining npsh3 or top of foundation in which case a minor adjustment in the values must be made for the slight difference in elevation the key is for the pump vendor and purchaser to agree to the npsh margin to prevent any flashing of the liquid the hydraulic institute s standard 9 6 is a good reference to use as a guideline to determine appropriate npsh margin for different types of pumps and services a new item pertaining to mdp states that foot mounted pumps with a nominal impeller diameter up to 200 mm 8 in may be used at temperatures greater than 175 c 350 f api 685 2nd ed had previously required centerline supported pump casings for all horizontal mdps whereas api 685 3rd ed recognizes that centerline supported casings may not be required for the smaller size mdps at higher temperatures definitions one key definition change which was done to align with api 610 12th ed is maximum discharge pressure api 685 3rd ed now states that the relative density specific gravity for the respective operating cases as indicated on the data sheets is to be used to determine the maximum discharge pressure of interest is that api 610 11th ed based this pressure on the normal specific gravity it was realized by the 12th ed task force that the change was required to address the most severe case when determining the maximum allowable working pressure mawp in addition to the conditions of service any operation with temporary liquid of higher density e g pumping cleaning liquids must be included in establishing the maximum discharge pressure new wording added to clearly define the pressure boundary components for both sealless pump designs the pressure boundary components are defined as casing casing plate and the containment shell for mdps casing casing plate and the stator liner for cmps takeaways part 1 of this article on api 685 has highlighted most of the significant changes reflected in the july 2022 published 3rd ed of the standard part 2 will provide insights into the various other points of discussion the api 685 task force addressed as well as the rationale used to evaluate the changes and additions that were incorporated part 3 addresses secondary control and secondary containment along with associated instrumentation requirements where do we go from here do we keep api 685 as a standalone document or perhaps make it part of api 610 do we expand api 685 to include overhung multi stage sealless pump designs within the main body of the future standard what new technology must be explored and applied to api 685 the authors welcome all comments and suggestions for topics within and beyond what has been addressed in this article for additional consideration note parts 2 and 3 of this article will be

when market investors suffer losses or get taken for a ride they re often eligible for a tax write off to soften the blow users of the bankrupt crypto exchange ftx won t be so lucky here s the difference let s say you re a crypto investor on an exchange that s still standing if you ve suffered investment losses amid the market decline you can simply sell to offset other gains and potentially take a deduction that s because the internal revenue service allows investors to sell poor performing crypto just as with stocks and use those losses to cancel out capital gains from selling better performing assets if losses exceed gains investors can deduct up to 3 000 against their taxable income losses beyond 3 000 can be carried forward every year until death to offset gains in future years but that s not the case for customers at ftx or any other crypto exchange that blows up the tax code specifies that if you want to take a capital loss you must sell or exchange that asset losing access to it because the exchange shuts down is different and would most likely be insufficient in court said matt metras an accountant in rochester new york who represents taxpayers before the irs another provision in the code allows for a deduction if a security is worthless no luck there though the irs has said digital currency is considered property not a security like a stock plus the asset has to be worthless as in zero not close to it then there s the theft loss route but it s complicated before the 2017 republican tax law investors who had losses because of theft could deduct them against their ordinary income provided certain criteria were met along with a bunch of other miscellaneous itemized deductions the theft loss deduction was largely eliminated except for losses tied to a federally declared disaster an ftx user s best bet when filing tax returns next april may be to try to take advantage of a special provision to the theft loss rule created after the bernie madoff scandal that still allows for a write off if the loss is due to a ponzi scheme but the loss has to meet some stringent requirements to qualify for example the investor has to show that she expected a profit and perpetrators must have had specific intent to cheat investors ftx s founder sam bankman fried hasn t been charged with a crime advisers who are overseeing what remains of ftx are struggling to find the company s cash and crypto according to a bankruptcy court filing keep in mind the theft loss deduction is moot if you plan on taking the standard deduction rather than itemizing the theft loss deduction is only for those who itemize because they receive a bigger write off for deducting items like mortgage interest and charitable gifts separately some crypto investors on bankrupt platform celsius network which offered high yields in exchange for crypto may consider another tax play but it seems like a long shot if they can show that they made a loan to these platforms and that their entire investment has become worthless and can t be recovered then they may be eligible for what s known as a nonbusiness bad debt deduction but that s a high bar just because accounts are frozen or withdrawals are limited aren t sufficient and bankruptcy doesn t automatically mean the total debt is worthless phil gaudiano a certified public accountant in great falls virginia warned in an op ed for coindesk which just goes to say that crypto investors who have been badly burned this year shouldn t expect any relief from the irs
by tom hals wilmington del reuters after five days of testimony including three hours from elon musk a delaware judge will now decide whether musk s 56 billion pay package from tesla inc was justified by the company s explosive growth or undermined by a flawed process musk and the tesla directors named as defendants repeatedly testified that the package achieved what it set out to do deliver 10 fold growth in the company s stock price enriching investors and musk we thought if we could pull this off if this plan was executed tesla would be one of the most valuable technology companies antonio gracias a tesla board member from 2007 to 2021 told the delaware court of chancery on wednesday it was a great deal for the shareholders the trial seeks to resolve claims by shareholder richard tornetta that the 2018 pay package was dictated by musk the world s richest person to subservient directors and approved by a vote of shareholders who were misled by tesla the trial wrapped up on friday as musk struggles to oversee a chaotic overhaul of twitter inc which he was forced to buy for 44 billion in a separate legal battle before the same judge chancellor kathaleen mccormick my sense is that even though it went all the way to trial a ruling is going to favor mr musk said eric talley a professor at columbia law school who has followed the case it will be months before mccormick rules and her decision can be appealed to the delaware supreme court during the week long trial directors said the pay package was meant to ensure musk guided the electric vehicle maker through a critical phase when he could have focused on his rocket company spacex or tunneling venture the boring co musk told the board he wanted a huge package to finance his dream of travel to mars or as he testified to make life multi planetary in order to ensure the long term survival of consciousness musk described his efforts to push the company from the brink of failure in 2017 to exponential growth the amount of pain no words can express musk testified on wednesday gracias recalled that musk celebrated his birthday in a factory conference room with a grocery store cake this was all hands on deck 24 7 brutal he told the court the package allows musk to buy 1 of tesla s stock at a deep discount each time escalating performance and financial targets are met otherwise musk gets nothing tesla has hit 11 of the 12 targets as its value ballooned briefly to more than 1 trillion from 50 billion tornetta wants the plan rescinded and the stock granted under the plan returned to tesla much of the trial focused on the information provided to shareholders before they approved the plan tornetta s lawyers tried to show tesla concealed that three targets of the package were likely to be quickly met the plaintiff portrayed the directors as personal friends or business partners of musk who was the link to their wealth the directors tried to show they could hold the line against musk s demands but evidence of extracting concessions was limited to the best method for accounting for the stock grants and a requirement that musk had to hold his stock for five years it wasn t a knock down drag out affair todd maron testified about the pay talks in 2017 when he was general counsel talley said musk is a unique ceo and his pay reflects that he s like a labrador retriever he sees a ball and he runs after it you could almost make an argument they didn t pay him enough because he ran off after twitter reporting by tom hals in wilmington delaware editing by daniel wallis
never in my career have i seen such a complete failure of corporate controls and such a complete absence of trustworthy financial information new ftx ceo john ray iii said in a legal filing on thursday from compromised systems integrity and faulty regulatory oversight abroad to the concentration of control in the hands of a very small group of inexperienced unsophisticated and potentially compromised individuals this situation is unprecedented ray who oversaw enron s bankruptcy in 2001 stepped in as ceo shortly after founder sam bankman fried resigned and reportedly tried to flee to argentina although he denies it he is absolutely right that ftx was brought down by a complete failure of corporate controls but in reality the situation is far from unprecedented and unless the whole industry gets a grip it will keep happening that s why the exchange s collapse might actually turn out to benefit crypto in the long term although right now it seems it s only contributing to tarnishing its reputation the ftx saga playing out before our sorry eyes is a chance to turn things around before it s too late which is to say before greed negligence and corporate malpractice bring the entire industry to its knees related will sbf face consequences for mismanaging ftx don t count on it essentially cases like ftx s are a time bomb waiting to explode and the longer they are left unchecked the bigger the damage they can cause becomes this is evident purely by looking at the scope of the deception at play and relating it to the company s valuation which just in february stood at 32 billion or more than the nasdaq credit suisse and robinhood of that bankman fried s personal fortune stood at 16 billion in his own words sometimes life creeps up on you well sometimes so do the consequences of your own actions now the united states department of justice and the securities and exchange commission are investigating the collapse california s department of financial protection and innovation dfpi is also opening an investigation and so are authorities in the bahamas legal experts suggest ftx s use of customer money could constitute fraud or embezzlement oh and a class action lawsuit alleges that ftx s fraudulent scheme was designed to take advantage of unsophisticated investors who collectively sustained over 11 billion dollars in damages this proves the importance of looking into a company s background and finances crypto or not before allowing it to become bigger than nasdaq not after due diligence can help differentiate sound investments from terrible ideas between good crypto projects and bad crypto projects and no he was on the cover of fortune magazine he was a big name is not due diligence it s falling for the oldest trick in the book just spoke with an lp in several crypto funds he said when he asked funds why they did lazy dd on ftx they responded basically he was on the cover of fortune magazine he was a big name there s going to be a lot of lawsuits and a lot of funds will shutter frank chaparro fintechfrank november 13 2022 because bankman fried might have graced the cover of fortune then again so did elizabeth holmes but he proved his worth as an incompetent incapable leader he was nothing but a fraud in a recent tell all with a vox reporter on twitter he admitted that the ethics stuff read his beloved philosophy based on philanthropic efforts and effective altruism was mostly a front as it s what reputations are made of i feel bad for those who get f ked by it he added a statement that s hard to believe so what comes next preventing this from happening again knowing what we know now it s paramount that the industry as a whole get in reputation management mode and conduct a review of any remaining bad apples for they cannot be allowed to cause the kind of damage that ftx did crypto just wouldn t survive it related binance s victory over ftx means more users moving away from central exchanges by giving innovative science backed and reliable projects more space and airtime and cutting off any emboldened fraudsters before they have the chance to make any more victims the industry can allow new names to flourish and help bring the project back to its original mission by ensuring that the names replacing ftx in the public s collective understanding of what crypto is and stands for are absolutely foolproof the industry can reinstate a golden standard of behavior and return to what it was intended to be the crypto ecosystem is at a crossroads it can either innovate regulate review and begin again or it will fail the ftx saga is a sign that it s time to make a choice it s true ftx s downfall was a shock to many enthusiasts investors legislators and casual crypto curious individuals alike

by steve holland and phil stewart washington reuters president joe biden has been adamant that the united states will back ukraine in its nine month fight to repel a russian invasion but he has insisted we will not fight the third world war in ukraine so when a missile struck a village in poland near the ukraine border on nov 15 and there were early claims it was launched by russia he and his top team of advisers were jolted into crisis mode the united states and other nato nations would be obliged to defend fellow nato member poland militarily if it were a russia attack a situation that could escalate into the global war most wanted to avoid biden in the waning days of a week long asia trip was woken up by aides in the middle of the night in bali indonesia to let him know that a missile had killed two people in poland a u s official said ukrainian officials publicly blamed russia as did a since corrected associated press report citing an unnamed senior u s intelligence official the reports sent stock markets diving and officials scrambling eastern european countries responded angrily and the temperature rose preliminary information from u s sources indicated that ukraine may have fired the missile in an attempt to repel a blizzard of incoming russian missiles and it had accidentally landed in poland as they sought confirmation the white house and other u s agencies publicly said little we cannot confirm the reports or any of the details at this time we will determine what happened and what the appropriate next steps would be said white house spokesperson adrienne watson behind the scenes deputy secretary of state wendy sherman was reaching out to some foreign diplomats asking them to adopt a cautious approach and to be measured while the united states worked out how it would respond western diplomats told reuters flanked by secretary of state antony blinken and national security adviser jake sullivan and wearing a t shirt and khakis biden made an early morning call to polish president andrzej duda offering his condolences and support for an investigation the white house said some moscow communications failed as tensions simmered and european allies fretted the u s military tried to reach out to moscow the pentagon has stressed the importance of military to military communication with moscow during the nine month long ukraine war for instance the white house has had talks with russia about its threats to use nuclear weapons against ukraine and top defense officials spoke with their russian counterparts in october after moscow accused ukraine of planning a dirty bomb attack but at the pentagon on tuesday efforts to contact russia s military failed general mark milley chairman of the joint chiefs of staff said his staff tried to arrange a call with his russian counterpart chief general staff general valery gerasimov some attempts were made no success milley told reporters my staff was unsuccessful in getting me linked up with general gerasimov he said sullivan who has been in touch with russian officials about the risks around the ukraine invasion did not make contact in relation to this incident a white house official said cia director bill burns who had met with his russian counterparts at the russian intelligence agency svr in ankara on monday was in kyiv on tuesday the day the missiles hit poland and traveled to warsaw the next day a u s official said that in ukraine burns discussed the u s warning he delivered to the head of russia s svr not to use nuclear weapons and reinforced the u s commitment to provide support to ukraine in its fight against russian aggression the u s official said burns met with officials in poland and discussed the current situation but would not comment when asked whether burns had reconnected with svr after the poland incident a kremlin spokesperson said he did not know if russian channels with the united states were activated to prevent any further escalation but noted that the american reaction was restrained investigation biden and his aides convened an emergency meeting of g7 leaders at 9am wednesday morning in bali to discuss the incident where he told them what the united states had learned that the blast was caused by a ukrainian air defense missile he was a little more vague answering reporters questions after the meeting saying it was unlikely that the missile was fired from russia based on its trajectory later nato s secretary general said the blast was likely caused by a ukrainian air defense missile that went astray but that russia was ultimately responsible because it started the war poland has been conducting its own investigation into what happened the u s military has sent american explosives experts to the site to help with the probe at poland s request a u s official said the official said the investigation is expected to conclude fairly quickly that ukraine fired the missile it s now just a matter of doing forensics work to determine what kind of missile it was the official said ukraine has insisted there was a russian trace in the blast and has sent its own experts to the site to investigate the incident highlights just how dangerous the russian invasion of ukraine is for europe and the rest of the world observers said poland and the baltics have been warning for some time that there is a real risk of something happening that draws the west into a wider conflict said one european diplomat what happened on tuesday makes it clear that this war is not managed it is not controlled

as the old saying goes a rising tide lifts all boats in the harbor but when it comes to retirement assets the u s economy hasn t been working that way in fact those at the bottom have sunk even further that s according to a new study by the economic innovation group eig a bipartisan public policy think tank in washington dc using data from the congressional budget office the group took a close look at how americans built wealth or didn t from 2010 to 2019 as the economy made its long recovery from the great recession what they found is concerning while americans at the top and middle of the economic ladder significantly expanded their retirement savings through the use of 401 k s pensions and other plans those in the bottom 25 did not in fact they saw the value of their savings decline by 16 we were surprised that a record long economic expansion which the one after the great recession was could be so unequal said connor o brien one of the study s co authors you d think the longer it goes on the more folks it will bring in but that did not appear to happen this is not how recoveries usually go from 1992 to 1998 as the u s economy bounced back from the recession of the early 90s the bottom 25 of americans saw their retirement assets increase by 84 faster than any other income group and from 2001 to 2007 during the recovery from the dot com crash the bottom quartile s savings grew by 44 more than any group except the top tenth of earners then in the 2010s the opposite happened why was that recovery different why did the retirement assets of america s poorest citizens not only fail to expand but shrink as the u s recovers from the covid 19 pandemic those questions still resonate experts say if the same problems that caused that gap still exist lower income americans could potentially see their savings decline again in the 2020s eig s study doesn t pinpoint a reason for this divergence but o brien said there are a few possible culprits one is that the recovery from the great recession was so sluggish it took roughly a decade to recoup the 8 6 million jobs lost in the 2007 2009 downturn that s a factor particularly for those at the bottom o brien said the jobs recovery was a lot slower this hasn t been true of the post pandemic recovery by the summer of 2022 the u s had quickly regained the 25 million jobs it lost in the spring of 2020 but o brien also pointed to another possible cause one which still hobbles america s lowest earners today a lack of access to retirement accounts according to one recent aarp study nearly half of all private sector workers aged 18 64 do not have an employer sponsored retirement plan available to them and this obstacle is closely tied to income of those 57 million workers 81 earn 50 000 per year or less without that stake in the market o brien said workers cannot benefit from its recovery if you don t have access to a plan then you re not cued in on whatever the stock market does he said but that s not the only thing lower income workers are locked out of they also lack access to the housing market another important tool for building retirement wealth according to the eig study only 12 7 of families in the bottom quarter of americans have any home equity at all and it hasn t always been that low in 2010 20 6 of that cohort owned a home now as housing prices soar poorer americans are left out of those profits as well homeownership has been an effective means of building wealth for those who can access it but families at the bottom are largely locked out the study said for u s policymakers these are serious concerns and congress is slowly moving to address them the various bills collectively known as secure 2 0 propose a number of measures to get more americans invested in retirement plans including by requiring auto enrollment in 401 k s experts are hopeful the final combined bill could pass before the end of the year but in american politics nothing is guaranteed in the meantime america s economic recovery may continue to leave many workers behind especially those with few footholds in the stock or housing markets a rising tide lifts all boats o brien said but only if all the boats have solid bottoms with no holes in them

conservative take haver tomi lahren said elon musk s management of twitter has been genius even though a maelstrom of his own making has thrown the company into total disarray let s briefly review the key lowlights a week after becoming twitter s new ceo in late october musk fired about half the platform s 7 500 strong workforce if that doesn t seem like a long enough time to review each person s role and whether they re vital to the business or musk s vision for it you would be right soon after the first round of layoffs the company went hat in hand to some of the terminated employees to ask them to come back musk also rolled out a new verification criteria which actually involves no verification whatsoever anyone with the twitter app who is willing to pay 8 a month gets a blue checkmark predictably to everyone but musk apparently a litany of parody accounts with blue checkmarks cropped up in one instance a verified account of drugmaker eli lilly tweeted insulin was now free the stock promptly cratered eli lilly and several other companies have pulled advertising by far twitter s main revenue source from the platform meanwhile the new twitter blue system is on pause until at least the end of november this week musk demanded remaining employees sign a pledge to work longer hardcore hours or leave the company several hundred opted to leave once again musk is now asking some of those employees to stay you do not need an mba to understand that from a business standpoint things are going poorly at twitter but if you re a conservative who s spent much of the year hailing musk as a supergenius who will fix the platform you have to pretend all this mayhem is just musk playing three dimensional chess which has essentially been the default position of his army of fanboys for more than a decade lahren therefore is not unique among conservatives in defending musk whom the right has ludicrously portrayed as the free speech hero we need on friday s fox friends she cast the chaos at twitter hq as an example of musk s brilliance while also trashing the company s employees as lazy for not wanting to be stuck at the office until all hours of the night working for elon musk of all people what s amazing here is that elon s saying you re gonna have to come to work and work hard and expect to work long hours and actually put clothes on when you come to the office said the 30 year old lahren who for most of her adult life has been paid for the arduous task of speaking into a microphone and saying whatever the fact that is triggering so many employees tells us the state of our world right now and especially the state of the american worker but i think that this is great later in the segment lahren said musk is simply purging twitter of swamp employees and said what he s doing is genius he s draining the swamp of twitter she prattled on and it needs to be drained but the way he is doing it to me is genius he s saying i want people that want to work here and have some integrity that want to work hard lahren also declared that life is about working hard and not about being an instagram influencer or having a work life balance that should be the standard for every job and every young person and young people need to understand it s not all about six months vacation being an influencer having a work life balance she went on referring to a company vacation package that doesn t exist it s about working hard watch the segment above in which someone who yaps for a living whines about others supposedly not working hard via fox news this is an opinion piece the views expressed in this article are those of just the author
you can protect the downside of your portfolio by planning ahead with low risk potentially dividend holdings any investor living through the financial market price action this year knows the importance of protecting the downside of one s investment portfolio rising interest rates have triggered a sell off in stocks and bonds and more rate hikes are likely ahead here are some ways that may help you better protect the downside of your portfolio xiu data by ycharts portfolio diversification portfolio diversification aiming to hold assets with little correlation amongst them can reduce downside risk for example you might have assets allocated to guaranteed investment certificates gics bonds stocks real estate such as your home and gold with different betas a relative measure of risk a low beta under 1 of say bonds or utility stocks would offset the high beta above 1 of say reits within your stock portfolio you could diversify across quality names in different sectors such as tech stocks real estate stocks like real estate investment trusts reits and utilities for gold exposure instead of holding the bullion investing in precious metals streamers or royalty companies could lead to better results for example franco nevada tsx fnv has partnered with operators like glencore teck resources and barrick gold helping them finance exploration projects and in return receive precious metal royalties or streams because franco nevada doesn t explore or operate any mines it has limited exposure to the cost of inflation fnv stock also provides a dividend it has increased its dividend for about 14 years with a 10 year dividend growth rate of 11 5 its business model dictates high margins and free cash flow generation for the trailing 12 months ttm fnv reported net income of us 756 5 million with a high net margin of 57 its free cash flow generation was us 963 5 million low beta stocks low beta or low volatility stocks can also help protect your downside focus on businesses that have durable and stable earnings for example as a regulated utility emera tsx ema stock provides reliable earnings it s a canadian dividend aristocrat with a 10 year dividend growth rate of 7 according to yahoo finance its recent beta is 0 26 which is way lower than the market s beta of 1 0 emera has total assets of approximately 34 billion through 2025 it has an 8 9 billion capital plan to grow its rate base by 7 8 management believes it can support dividend growth of 4 5 per year in the period according to the 12 month analyst consensus price target the stock is 12 undervalued at 51 25 per share its dividend yields 5 4 combining its yield and dividend growth prospects the stock can potentially deliver total returns of about 10 through 2025 without any valuation expansion valuation by aiming to buy stocks at discounts investors can further protect the downside of their investment portfolios the tricky part is that stock valuations change all the time for example when a business does well the valuation of the underlying stock can expand resulting in a higher stock price conversely rising interest rates compress stock valuations as we ve seen this year the foolish investor takeaway smart investors first plan out a solid portfolio that s diversified across quality businesses including a meaningful percentage in low beta dividend stocks that have stable and durable earnings growth more conservative investors would have a higher percentage then aim to buy the stocks on your watch list when they re trading at discounts doing the above should greatly protect the downside of your overall portfolio

miami beach fl accesswire november 18 2022 home bistro inc otc pink hbis home bistro or the company today released the following letter to shareholders and stakeholders to home bistro shareholders and stakeholders i want to share and clarify some details of recent events regarding our company its businesses share price and future direction starting in november 2021 the company had undertaken extensive efforts to up list its shares to nasdaq and complete a public equity offering to assist us in the process the company retained an established investment bank and up list consulting firm and to this end significant time and resources were expended unfortunately obtaining the necessary approvals from the requisite agencies and regulators took a protracted length of time during which the stock market and economic conditions had eroded considerably consequently the outlook for the company s share up listing and public offering were no longer feasible without significant changes to the company s business model and capitalization therefore the company is withdrawing its nasdaq up listing application regarding the recent reverse stock split of the company s shares of its common stock in order to qualify for a nasdaq listing companies must meet a minimum share price requirement the initial purpose of attaining approval for the reverse stock split was to satisfy this requirement a very common practice of companies during an up listing process given all of the aforementioned circumstances the company s board of directors still believed it to be in the best interests of shareholders to effect the reverse split of its shares the completion of the reverse stock split was publicly announced and a form 8 k was filed with the sec which can be viewed here the company s board of directors also decided to discontinue operations that could not become profitable without achieving significant economies of scale in this environment specifically the prepared meals home delivery business however the company continues to operate its colorado prime business and currently remains an sec reporting public company these actions have been documented in the company s recent

are under risks of large scale credit accidents cannot be ignored particularly in less well regulated arenas such as hedge funds and private equity some comfort is offered by generally well capitalised banks in advanced economies and low loan arrears though these are likely to rise as higher energy costs and interest rates bite the sharp rise in the us dollar partly reflecting the aggressive rise in us rates is increasingly burdensome in various areas developing economies are particularly troubled by more expensive food and energy costs often paid in us dollars while us dollar denominated debt becomes more costly to service price pressures remaining uncomfortably high inflation appears set to remain much higher for an extended period than individuals and central banks wish consumer demand remains too strong and the labour market may take an extended period to soften enough to ease price pressures sufficiently us inflation remains above 8 at the headline level and 6 core despite lower oil prices and some easing in shipping costs and supply chain bottlenecks in europe these numbers are 9 9 and 4 8 respectively wages and services inflation are likely to keep underlying price increases above target levels until 2024 us wages growth of 5 per annum needs to soften to allow inflation to ease however demand for workers has exceeded supply since before the pandemic and

chair jerome powell appears to be realising the necessity of higher rates than expected just a couple of months ago at the news conference following the november fed meeting he said what i am trying to do is make sure our message is clear which is that we think we have a ways to go we have some ground to cover with interest rates before we get to that level of interest rates that we think is sufficiently restrictive other central banks may be nearer peak cash rates given the sharper slowing in activity expected in europe and lesser upward pressure in wages households in the us may be less sensitive to interest rate increases give the higher proportion of fixed 30 year loans australia s relatively subdued wages gains and more leveraged households implies a more benign tightening cycle long term inflation expectations remain well anchored this indicates the us federal reserve maintains credibility with regard to fighting inflation over the long term despite being too slow to begin

seattle ap washington banned fish farming with net pens in state waters on friday citing danger to struggling native salmon public lands commissioner hilary franz issued an executive order banning the aquaculture method which involves raising fish in large floating pens anchored in the water and has been practiced in puget sound for more than three decades california oregon and alaska have already outlawed net pen aquaculture and canada is working on a plan to phase it out of british columbia s coastal waters by 2025 supporters say fish farming is an environmentally safe way to feed the world s growing population critics argue that it can spread disease to native stocks and degrade the environment as we ve seen too clearly here in washington there is no way to safely farm fish in open sea net pens without jeopardizing our struggling native salmon franz said i m proud to stand with the rest of the west coast today by saying our waters are far too important to risk for fish farming profits salmon aquaculture is among the fastest growing food production systems in the world according to the world wildlife foundation it accounts for about 70 of the market in 2018 the world resources institute released a report that said the industry needs to more than double by 2050 to meet the seafood demands of 10 billion people since 2016 all of the net pens in washington s marine waters have been owned by the same company new brunswick canada based seafood giant cooke aquaculture in a statement earlier this week after the state said it would terminate the company s remaining leases in puget sound the company said it was disappointed environmental organizations and commissioner franz are choosing to ignore the fact that farm raised fish is one of the healthiest and most efficient ways to feed the global population with a minimal environmental impact and the lowest carbon footprint of any animal protein cooke said farmers work closely with world renowned scientists from academia government and the private sector to develop rigorous standards and implement best practices for fish health and environmental protection in 2017 a net pen operated by cooke off cypress island near the san juan archipelago collapsed and released 260 000 nonnative atlantic salmon in puget sound the escape prompted a frantic response by the lummi indian tribe which mobilized its fishing crews to capture tens of thousands of the atlantic salmon before they could intermingle or breed with native salmon the company argued that the fish were sterile and would simply die without threatening native salmon stocks but the legislature responded in 2018 and banned raising nonnative fish in the pens cooke transitioned to raising native steelhead but many native american tribes and environmental groups including wild fish conservancy still objected saying that the unnaturally large clusters of farmed fish spread disease to wild populations and that their bulk feeding and excretions degrade the marine environment several studies have found that young sockeye salmon from british columbia s fraser watershed were infected with higher levels of sea lice after swimming past fish pens the seattle times reported and in march an audit revealed sea lice counts at about five times the legal limit at a farm in clayoquot sound on the west coast of vancouver island the lice can affect salmon growth and in severe cases cause death it s about the disease vectors and how that can escape into wild populations said todd woodard natural resources director for the samish indian nation when you say we re raising native fish native fish are not raised and reared in those kinds of concentrated environments after the 2017 collapse washington s department of natural resources ramped up its inspections of net pens in port angeles on the olympic peninsula the department terminated a net pen lease for failing to maintain the facility in a safe condition and operating in an unauthorized area cooke challenged the decision unsuccessfully in court and earlier this week the state terminated cooke aquaculture s remaining net pen leases in rich passage near bainbridge island and near hope island in skagit bay the company has until dec 14 to finish steelhead farming and to start deconstructing its equipment the decision will force cooke to kill 332 000 juvenile steelhead that were planned to be stocked at its two remaining net pens next year the company said this is a big victory for everyone who values the puget sound ecosystem suquamish tribe chairman leonard forsman said according to the seattle times this action eliminates a harmful impact in our ancestral waters the rich passage net pens have blocked and polluted our fishing grounds for too long and we are relieved to know they will be removed restoring our waters back to a more natural state

this week estée lauder announced its 2 8 billion acquisition of the tom ford brand whose lucrative beauty line had become so significant to the cosmetics and fragrance giant that it had no choice but to buy the business or risk losing its licensing deal when ford went to market earlier this year but the star designer s days at his namesake brand appear to be numbered according to a line in the statement announcing the deal ford will continue to serve as the brand s creative visionary after closing and through the end of calendar 2023 so what happens after that representatives for estée lauder and tom ford declined to comment further on the matter but it s entirely possible that ford will step away at the end of next year the designer who is currently based in los angeles has been open with friends and colleagues about wanting a change according to sources who have spoken to him directly whether that means he ll relocate direct another film or explore a different creative medium remains to be seen he wouldn t be the first designer to grow tired of fashion advertisement but one thing is certain much of the brand s success was grounded in the fact that ford retained the rights to his name which he licensed to zegna as well as estée lauder and exercised firm control over all elements of creative output from the glossy cream veneer of the brand s original lipstick receptacles to the ultra specificity of its scents to the guy bourdin inspired advertising consider the case of fucking fabulous a fragrance he launched along with a runway collection at an event supported by lauder in september 2017 at new york s park avenue armory where shirtless men passed out drinks bathed in purple light first of all didn t even want to launch it ford told bof a year later i kept calling it fucking fabulous and i d get it back with an asterisk i was like no no we re going to spell it out on the bottle they had such a hard time understanding that but ford persisted and a projected 400 000 in first year sales turned into 25 million making the fragrance a certified hit the good news for estée lauder is that the framework ford established is remarkably strong still tom ford is the sexiest brand in its portfolio and maintaining that perception without the designer won t be easy lauder has also lost john demsey the longtime beauty executive responsible for bringing ford and other fashion brands including balmain into the lauder fold who was terminated earlier this year after publishing racially offensive posts on his personal instagram in september the group promoted guillaume jesel a longtime demsey deputy to run both tom ford and balmain and further develop the luxury category for the ermenegildo zegna group which now owns the rights to produce and sell all tom ford fashion including womenswear a category currently designed out of a los angeles studio and produced by the brand it ll be a challenge to build out the category in such a competitive market but there are some quick wins to be had tom ford is still the first name in men s suiting for the red carpet with through the roof name recognition even as the suit continues its transition from everyday necessity to nice to have fashion zegna has an opportunity to lead in special occasion wear and dress shirts ford s longtime deputy peter hawkings who has led the menswear design team from london for many years is a clear successor hawkings has worked alongside ford for long enough to continue without him when it comes to tom ford womenswear a small business that never hit with the same impact as ford s work for gucci and saint laurent and has been squeezed in recent years zegna will need to wade slowly and carefully but the category clearly offers a lot of potential upside and yet however they proceed both estée lauder and zegna would benefit from keeping ford close perhaps as a creative consultant here the case of thierry mugler offers something of a template long after he stopped designing ready to wear the late french designer continued to animate the mugler brand whose angel fragrance remains a global powerhouse working on museum exhibitions and vip dressing projects in recent years mugler s fashion collections have also flourished thanks to designer casey cadwallader who has managed to create ultra modern attention grabbing clothes that pay just the right degree of homage to the founder so many younger designers from theophilio to bally creative director rhuigi villaseñor are inspired by mr ford s work that if zegna were to hire a new creative director to oversee the fashion offering it wouldn t be short of talent options advertisement ford saying goodbye for good however could complicate things for the companies that have invested in the future of his brand what made the tom ford label great was mr ford s unwavering commitment to doing things his way can they find leadership with a similar sensibility and the will to see their vision through the news in brief fashion business and the economy burberry s new chief executive jonathan akeroyd laid out his plan for the brand shutterstock new burberry ceo jonathan

as warning signs for the economy mount investors are cheering for more bad news that s because they expect economic weakness will force the federal reserve to stop raising interest rates and eventually re embrace loose monetary policy one reliable indicator over the years of an upcoming recession is an inverted yield curve an inversion occurs when short term interest rates rise above long term rates typically a 3 month treasury bill or 2 year note will yield less than a 10 year note or 30 year bond shorter duration debt instruments entail less risk and therefore deliver less reward under normal circumstances but over the past four months short term ious have begun to yield more than longer term paper this week the yield on the 10 year treasury fell to 3 7 while the 2 year rose to 4 4 that represents the biggest yield curve inversion in decades and as institutional futures trader and broker jim iuorio notes the current inversion implies strongly that a recession is coming jim iuorio a normal sloped yield curve has longer term bonds paying higher interest rate than shorter term the higher rate is a reward for being willing to lock up your money for longer periods of time economists believe that an inversion of yields is a warning sign for coming recession as investment money seeks the safety of longer term bonds helping to keep those yields from rising while at the same time in this instance that the federal reserve is forcing up short end rates through hikes the yield curve has inverted before each recession dating back to 1955 with the recession starting between six and 24 months after the inversion ultimately the curve s current lesson could be that the market believes that the fed s aggressive hikes to fight inflation could lead to both recession and the need to quickly lower rates at some time in the future the u s economy technically dipped into a recession in the second quarter when gdp came in negative for a second consecutive quarter at that time however the jobs market remained strong and the housing sector had only just begun to show signs of softening the double dip downturn that many economists see coming in 2023 could result in millions of job losses and a major retrenchment in home prices the stock market will obviously be vulnerable as well as for precious metals markets they have often shown relative strength during previous recessions they have also tended to get a boost when an inverted yield curve starts to normalize that would be expected to occur when the fed begins to cut its benchmark short term rate for now though central bankers are vowing to keep hiking on thursday james bullard president of the federal reserve bank of st louis said the fed funds rate will likely rise higher than previously expected he said the current rate isn t sufficiently restrictive in light of inflation that remains stubbornly high according to bullard rates may have to move up to as high as 7 most investors don t seem to be buying bullard s hawkish posturing financial markets are pricing in a 50 basis point hike at the fed s next meeting but not much more hiking after that the sharp drop in the u s dollar index last week means currency traders are looking for the fed to become more dovish the dollar managed to rebound only slightly versus foreign currencies on bullard s remarks precious metals markets meanwhile are giving back some of their recent gains however bullion buying among retail investors continue to be robust amid tight supplies of available products from major mints it doesn t appear that the election results will have a significant impact on investor sentiment toward metals as not much is going to change in washington president joe biden will still be able to ram through appointments requiring senate confirmation the upper chamber will continue to be controlled by chuck schumer and the democrats the house of representatives will be narrowly controlled by republicans they announced their intention this week to launch investigations into some questionable financial dealings of joe and hunter biden that may score house republicans some political points but they won t be able to produce any major legislative accomplishments without support from democrats and ultimately a signature of approval by joe biden the influence of elected officials on the economy and markets will continue to be overshadowed by central bankers who seem intent on inducing a recession in order try to tame the inflation monster they unleashed other central banks around the world meanwhile are growing wary of holding federal reserve notes and other forms of fiat as reserves many central banks are aggressively stockpiling hard money reserves in the form of gold global central bank purchases surged to nearly 400 tonnes in the third quarter that represents the largest single quarter of monetary demand for gold on record it also marks the eighth consecutive quarter of net purchases by central banks the year to date total is already higher than any other year total since 1967 these are estimates by the world gold council which notes that some countries underreport their actual holdings some may be secretly accumulating more than the council estimates while other could be exaggerating their reserves but the trend of rising monetary demand for gold is indisputable with inflation now hitting double digits in europe and the federal reserve still unable to get u s price levels anywhere near back down to target it s no wonder gold is in high demand

日本語 コーポレートppa 第3弾 バーチャルppaへの商品先物取引法の適否 today s topic corporate ppas no 3 application of commodity derivatives transaction act to virtual ppas on november 11 2022 it was announced on the website of japan s cabinet office that the commodity market development office commerce and information policy bureau commerce services group commodity market development office of the ministry of economy trade and industry meti has expressed their stance that the commodity derivatives transaction act the cdta does not apply to the settlement of differences in virtual ppas as long as certain conditions are satisfied see here specifically no 7 only in japanese the announcement of the stance was made in response to our request we submitted via the cabinet office to the commodity market development office which oversees electricity futures trading now that an official position of the commodity market development office has been published with respect to a major obstacle to a virtual ppa scheme there is the possibility to further accelerate the realization of virtual ppa transactions in japan 1 cfd settlement in virtual ppas a virtual ppa generally refers to a transaction between a renewable energy power producer and a corporate customer in which renewable energy certificates are traded without any actual power transactions in japan s context it usually refers to a transaction in which a consumer purchases non fit non fossil certificate nfcs from a renewable energy power producer with renewable designation equivalent to the amount of electricity generated at a specific renewable energy power plant in japan since only registered electricity retailers or permitted and registered specific transmission and distribution companies are allowed in principle to sell electricity to consumers through the grid renewable energy power producers without such registration cannot trade electricity itself without going through an electricity retailer on the other hand direct transactions of non fit nfcs with renewable designation from renewable power producers to corporate customers have become possible since april 2022 for non fit renewable power sources that meet certain requirements reforms to allow such direct transactions were made to address the high level of consumer interest in virtual ppas which allow for the exclusive procurement of renewable energy certificates from specific renewable energy power plants without having to change existing electricity retailors tracking procedures have been expanded to cover such direct transactions as announced in october 2022 see here and here for related materials on the website of biprogy inc which was commissioned by meti and jepx for the nfc verification and the tracking services in virtual ppas conducted in the united states and other countries it is common to use contract for difference cfd based on electricity market prices specifically the difference between the electricity market price in japan the price per kwh in the day ahead jepx price for the area where the power plant is located and the pre agreed contract price per kwh is multiplied by the amount of electricity generated during the relevant time period 30 minute timeframe then aggregated for a month for example to calculate the value for settlement during the timeframe when the market price is lower than the contract price the consumer pays the power producer for the difference and during the hours when the market price is higher than the contract price the power producer pays the consumer 2 previous interpretations and orrick s inquiry with regard to cfd settlements based on electricity market prices it had been suggested that in principle permission from the minister of economy trade and industry could be required pursuant to the cdta electricity constitutes a commodity under the commodity derivatives transaction act cdta art 2 para 1 item 5 and it is considered that cfd settlements referring to electricity market prices could constitute an otc commodity derivatives transaction under the cdta art 2 para 14 item 2 conducting otc commodity derivatives transactions as business in principle constitutes a commodity futures transaction cdta art 2 para 22 item 5 and thus requires permission from the minister of economy trade and industry article 190 paragraph 1 we mentioned such potential risks to certain developers in discussing the possibility of virtual ppas in japan in 2019 and made inquiries to the commodity market development office around november and december of 2020 and thereafter until early this year but the continual response was that cfd settlements would constitute an otc commodity derivatives transaction permits for commodity futures business are generally obtained by banks and securities firms specializing in financial services see here for a list of permitted commodity futures business operators and renewable energy power producers and operators wishing to conduct virtual ppas have had to face considerable hurdles in obtaining them likewise otc commodity derivatives transactions that meet certain requirements are not considered to be commodity futures transactions even when conducted as a business such as the counterparty being a stock company kk with the capital of at least 1 billion yen are very steep and present a major hurdle to structuring virtual ppa transactions in practice cdta art 2 paras 22 and 15 enforcement rule for cdta art 1 note that conducting such exceptional otc commodity derivatives transactions as a business requires filing of a notice as a specified otc commodity derivatives transaction business under the cdta art 349 para 1 we therefore compiled and submitted a request to the cabinet office to be reviewed by its task force for review of regulations concerning renewable energy 再生可能エネルギー等に関する規制等の総点検タスクフォース which is charged with work on regulatory reform in areas related to renewable energy with our request being forwarded to the commodity market development office through the cabinet office after meeting with us the commodity market development office submitted to the cabinet office a written statement of its stance on applicability of the cdta to cfd settlements under a virtual ppa scheme which was published on the cabinet office s web site on november 11 2022 see item no 7 in the link above 3 interpretation of the commodity market development office the commodity market development office announced that generally speaking the cdta does not apply to cfd settlements if at least the following items can be confirmed in the relevant contract and such contract as a whole can be deemed to be a purchase and sale of renewable certificates etc where the following items are 1 that the traded environmental attributes are actual not self called eco points etc and 2 that the transfer of rights to the environmental attributes from power producer to consumer can be confirmed actual in item 1 refers to environmental attributes that are widely recognized for trading and in response to our inquiry the commodity market development office stated that non fit nfcs under the current system satisfy such requirement transactions involving self called eco points that are not widely recognized are excluded because they leave room for interpretation of such transactions being electricity derivatives transactions under the guise of sale and purchase of environmental attributes transfer of rights under item 2 refers to making clear that the contemplated transaction be a sale and purchase through the delivery of renewable energy certificates representing environmental attributes from seller to buyer it is possible for example that a transfer of rights would not be recognized if renewable energy certificates are treated as having been transferred to the consumer but are in fact kept with the power producer because the reason for the above interpretation is that the transaction as a whole can be understood as a sale and purchase of environmental attributes and not an electricity derivatives transaction the transaction could again be seen as an electricity derivatives transaction under the guise of sale and purchase of environmental attributes if the contract price per kwh is set at 1 000 yen or some other price level that deviates significantly from market trends 4 future outlook non fit corporate ppas are expected to become one of major schemes of renewable transaction in japan as we have been involved in multiple corporate ppas in japan so far

washington bans fish farming net pens citing salmon threat file in this photo provided by the washington state department of natural resources a crane and boats are anchored next to a collapsed net pen used by cooke aquaculture pacific to farm atlantic salmon near cypress island in washington state on aug 28 2017 washington has banned net pen fish farming in state waters citing danger to struggling native salmon public lands commissioner hilary franz issued an executive order friday banning such aquaculture david bergvall washington state department of natural resources via ap file seattle ap washington banned fish farming with net pens in state waters on friday citing danger to struggling native salmon public lands commissioner hilary franz issued an executive order banning the aquaculture method which involves raising fish in large floating pens anchored in the water and has been practiced in puget sound for more than three decades california oregon and alaska have already outlawed net pen aquaculture and canada is working on a plan to phase it out of british columbia s coastal waters by 2025 supporters say fish farming is an environmentally safe way to feed the world s growing population critics argue that it can spread disease to native stocks and degrade the environment as we ve seen too clearly here in washington there is no way to safely farm fish in open sea net pens without jeopardizing our struggling native salmon franz said i m proud to stand with the rest of the west coast today by saying our waters are far too important to risk for fish farming profits salmon aquaculture is among the fastest growing food production systems in the world according to the world wildlife foundation it accounts for about 70 of the market in 2018 the world resources institute released a report that said the industry needs to more than double by 2050 to meet the seafood demands of 10 billion people since 2016 all of the net pens in washington s marine waters have been owned by the same company new brunswick canada based seafood giant cooke aquaculture in a statement earlier this week after the state said it would terminate the company s remaining leases in puget sound the company said it was disappointed environmental organizations and commissioner franz are choosing to ignore the fact that farm raised fish is one of the healthiest and most efficient ways to feed the global population with a minimal environmental impact and the lowest carbon footprint of any animal protein cooke said farmers work closely with world renowned scientists from academia government and the private sector to develop rigorous standards and implement best practices for fish health and environmental protection in 2017 a net pen operated by cooke off cypress island near the san juan archipelago collapsed and released 260 000 nonnative atlantic salmon in puget sound the escape prompted a frantic response by the lummi indian tribe which mobilized its fishing crews to capture tens of thousands of the atlantic salmon before they could intermingle or breed with native salmon the company argued that the fish were sterile and would simply die without threatening native salmon stocks but the legislature responded in 2018 and banned raising nonnative fish in the pens cooke transitioned to raising native steelhead but many native american tribes and environmental groups including wild fish conservancy still objected saying that the unnaturally large clusters of farmed fish spread disease to wild populations and that their bulk feeding and excretions degrade the marine environment several studies have found that young sockeye salmon from british columbia s fraser watershed were infected with higher levels of sea lice after swimming past fish pens the seattle times reported and in march an audit revealed sea lice counts at about five times the legal limit at a farm in clayoquot sound on the west coast of vancouver island the lice can affect salmon growth and in severe cases cause death it s about the disease vectors and how that can escape into wild populations said todd woodard natural resources director for the samish indian nation when you say we re raising native fish native fish are not raised and reared in those kinds of concentrated environments after the 2017 collapse washington s department of natural resources ramped up its inspections of net pens in port angeles on the olympic peninsula the department terminated a net pen lease for failing to maintain the facility in a safe condition and operating in an unauthorized area cooke challenged the decision unsuccessfully in court and earlier this week the state terminated cooke aquaculture s remaining net pen leases in rich passage near bainbridge island and near hope island in skagit bay the company has until dec 14 to finish steelhead farming and to start deconstructing its equipment the decision will force cooke to kill 332 000 juvenile steelhead that were planned to be stocked at its two remaining net pens next year the company said this is a big victory for everyone who values the puget sound ecosystem suquamish tribe chairman leonard forsman said according to the seattle times this action eliminates a harmful impact in our ancestral waters the rich passage net pens have blocked and polluted our fishing grounds for too long and we are relieved to know they will be removed restoring our waters back to a more natural state

official the reports sent stock markets diving and officials scrambling eastern european countries responded angrily and the temperature rose preliminary information from u s sources indicated that ukraine may have fired the missile in an attempt to repel a blizzard of incoming russian missiles and it had accidentally landed in poland as they sought confirmation the white house and other u s agencies publicly said little we cannot confirm the reports or any of the details at this time we will determine what happened and what the appropriate next steps would be said white house

and traveled to warsaw the next day a u s official said that in ukraine burns discussed the u s warning he delivered to the head of russia s svr not to use nuclear weapons and reinforced the u s

was unlikely that the missile was fired from russia based on its trajectory later nato s secretary general said the blast was likely caused by a ukrainian air defense missile that went astray but that russia was ultimately responsible because it started the war poland has been conducting its own investigation into what happened the u s military has sent american explosives experts to the site to help with the probe at poland s request a u s official said the official said the investigation is expected to conclude fairly quickly that ukraine fired the missile it s now just a matter of doing forensics work to determine what kind of missile it was the official said ukraine has insisted there was a russian trace in the blast and has sent its own experts to the site to investigate the

business tech ca forecasts 25b budget deficit next year amid threat of recession a recession is looming over the nation and the golden state will likely scramble to make significant budget cuts to prepare going into the midterm election last week californians said the economy jobs and inflation were the top issues plaguing the state according to a september survey from public policy institute of california damian dovarganes ap photo california california is likely to face a 25 billion budget deficit next year which could coincide with a potential recession state officials announced this week wednesday s forecast from the legislative analyst s office marks an end a two year string of historic budget surpluses and serves as a warning to other states of a looming recession the democratic controlled golden state is typically among the first states to suffer budget issues when the economy starts to falter that s because the state taxes rich people more than other states and the wealthy don t make as much when the markets falter nearly two years ago newsom noted how well the folks at the top were doing despite a year of pandemic closures when the state reported a staggering 75 7 billion the s p 500 a key indicator of the health of the stock market that drives the income of the superrich has fallen more than 17 percent since its peak in january the state s coffers have been bulging in recent years in part thanks to silicon valley home to a sector that is seeing mass layoffs across facebook amazon lyft robinhood netflix twitter and more although employment in california remains strong the 3 9 percent unemployment rate for september is tied for the lowest since 1976 the high wage tech industry has been roiled by a series of recent job cuts facebook parent meta announced last week that it would layoff 11 000 people or 13 percent of its workforce the chances that the federal reserve can tame inflation without inducing a recession are narrow according to the report from the nonpartisan legislative analysts office reflecting the threat of a recession our revenue estimates represent the weakest performance the state has experienced since the great recession state revenues are now 41 billion below expectations according to the outlook published wednesday by the legislative analyst s office the estimated deficit is lower because some of those revenue losses were offset by lower spending in other parts of the budget in next year s shortfall some of california s major expansions could remain safe including free kindergarten for 4 year olds and free health care for low income immigrants living in the country without legal permission but some cuts are sure to be made to balance the budget democratic gov gavin newsom s administration said while we re in fact better prepared that doesn t mean that the decisions to close the coming budget gap won t be difficult particularly if the economic conditions that have slowed the economy continue or get worse california department of finance spokesman h d palmer said the deficit could mean cuts in funding for transportation education and housing according to the outlook despite the gloomy outlook california is in a better position to weather an economic downturn than it has been in the past the state has 37 2 billion stored in its various savings accounts and it has plenty of cash available to meet its obligations this year it s not insignificant but it s also manageable legislative analyst gabriel petek said of the deficit we don t think of this as a budget crisis it s important to note that california s budget projections have been infamously volatile two years ago the state forecast a 54 billion deficit during the height of the pandemic that shortfall never happened since the wealthy continued to carry the economy however the latest projections are likely to stick soaring inflation has made everything more expensive the federal reserve has tried to rein in inflation by raising a key interest rate a higher interest rate makes it more expensive to borrow money which eventually causes people to spend less although that would control price increases it also cuts demand for goods and services that leads to layoffs meaning people pay less in taxes the report did not surprise republicans who said they have been warning against california s massive increase in public spending for years with republican assembly member vince fong calling it unsustainable today s report is another wake up call to those warnings we must refocus on fiscal responsibility said fong who is vice chair of the assembly budget committee newsom s administration wasn t surprised either calling the 25 billion deficit estimate realistic and reasonable the good news is that as we prepare to close a budget shortfall the state is in its best ever position to manage a downturn by having built strong reserves and focusing on one time commitments said palmer the department of finance spokesman california lawmakers could conceivably cover all of the deficit with the money it has in its savings accounts but the legislative analyst s office warned not to do that the outlook predicts deficits not just for this year but the next three years although the size of the deficit decreases each year instead the legislative analyst s office says lawmakers should delay some of the 75 billion in one time spending they approved over the past two years as an example they pointed to a 500 million program to clean up homeless encampments across the state that s a very good example of the type of pause we had in mind petek said palmer said the newsom administration will begin making budget decisions next month a change in statewide homelessness funding appears to be unlikely given newsom s commitment to addressing the issue newsom did pause 1 billion in homelessness spending earlier this month but that decision wasn t related to sinking revenues toni atkins the democratic president pro tempore of the california senate said she is confident the state can pass a budget this year without ongoing cuts to schools and other core programs or taxing middle class families democratic assembly speaker anthony rendon said lawmakers can and will protect the progress of recent years budgets in particular the assembly will protect california s historic school funding gains as districts must continue to invest in retaining and recruiting staff to help kids advance and recover from the pandemic rendon said going into the midterm election last week californians said the economy jobs and inflation were the top issues plaguing the state according to a september survey from the public policy institute of california although gas prices continued to fall after the state authorized an early transition to winter blend gasoline a cheaper yet more polluting alternative inflation remained relatively high californians reported that they were continuing to experience financial hardship amid skyrocketing prices ppic reported and as golden staters continue to weather a lingering pandemic and inflation interest rate hikes and a volatile stock market are now raising concerns of an upcoming recession the associated press contributed to this report

by tom hals wilmington del reuters after five days of testimony including three hours from elon musk a delaware judge will now decide whether musk s 56 billion pay package from tesla inc was justified by the company s explosive growth or undermined by a flawed process musk and the tesla directors named as defendants repeatedly testified that the package achieved what it set out to do deliver 10 fold growth in the company s stock price enriching investors and musk we thought if we could pull this off if this plan was executed tesla would be one of the most valuable technology companies antonio gracias a tesla board member from 2007 to 2021 told the delaware court of chancery on wednesday it was a great deal for the shareholders the trial seeks to resolve claims by shareholder richard tornetta that the 2018 pay package was dictated by musk the world s richest person to subservient directors and approved by a vote of shareholders who were misled by tesla the trial wrapped up on friday as musk struggles to oversee a chaotic overhaul of twitter inc which he was forced to buy for 44 billion in a separate legal battle before the same judge chancellor kathaleen mccormick my sense is that even though it went all the way to trial a ruling is going to favor mr musk said eric talley a professor at columbia law school who has followed the case it will be months before mccormick rules and her decision can be appealed to the delaware supreme court during the week long trial directors said the pay package was meant to ensure musk guided the electric vehicle maker through a critical phase when he could have focused on his rocket company spacex or tunneling venture the boring co musk told the board he wanted a huge package to finance his dream of travel to mars or as he testified to make life multi planetary in order to ensure the long term survival of consciousness musk described his efforts to push the company from the brink of failure in 2017 to exponential growth the amount of pain no words can express musk testified on wednesday gracias recalled that musk celebrated his birthday in a factory conference room with a grocery store cake this was all hands on deck 24 7 brutal he told the court the package allows musk to buy 1 of tesla s stock at a deep discount each time escalating performance and financial targets are met otherwise musk gets nothing tesla has hit 11 of the 12 targets as its value ballooned briefly to more than 1 trillion from 50 billion tornetta wants the plan rescinded and the stock granted under the plan returned to tesla much of the trial focused on the information provided to shareholders before they approved the plan tornetta s lawyers tried to show tesla concealed that three targets of the package were likely to be quickly met the plaintiff portrayed the directors as personal friends or business partners of musk who was the link to their wealth the directors tried to show they could hold the line against musk s demands but evidence of extracting concessions was limited to the best method for accounting for the stock grants and a requirement that musk had to hold his stock for five years it wasn t a knock down drag out affair todd maron testified about the pay talks in 2017 when he was general counsel talley said musk is a unique ceo and his pay reflects that he s like a labrador retriever he sees a ball and he runs after it you could almost make an argument they didn t pay him enough because he ran off after twitter reporting by tom hals in wilmington delaware editing by daniel wallis

winter is quickly approaching for people who live in the midwest it may even feel like winter is already here this time of year consists of colder weather traveling holiday gatherings family get togethers and more time spent cooped up indoors all of which can become the perfect storm for seasonal illnesses to brew this year health experts are advising individuals to be extra diligent flu season historically peaks between december and february each year however according to a recent report from the centers for disease control and prevention cdc an early increase in seasonal flu activity is happening nationwide and it is estimated that just in the united states there already have been at least 2 8 million cases 23 000 hospitalizations and 1 300 deaths this early and drastic spike in flu cases combined with the current spread of other illnesses like rsv respiratory syncytial virus covid 19 and the common cold has people wondering what they can do to keep seasonal illnesses at bay this winter lauren petoskey an osf healthcare family medicine physician assistant says maintaining a well balanced diet is important to help keep you healthy especially during fall and winter months but advises against making a trip to your local pharmacy to stock up on over the counter vitamins like zinc and vitamin c as long as you have a generally healthy well balanced diet you are going to be getting the majority of all those nutrients you need and all the vitamins and minerals so overloading your body with them isn t going to make your illness go away any quicker or make you not have that exposure to the infection there has been no research to prove that those are going to reduce any of the symptoms or reduce the risk of spreading germs or getting infected explains petoskey whenever seasonal illnesses are on the rise and people start to worry about getting sick orange juice tends to become the beverage of choice for many not only is orange juice unable to prevent seasonal illness it is also typically loaded with added sugars that can do more harm than good but staying hydrated is important so what is the best route i encourage people to drink a lot of water just for their general health and for keeping the kidney functioning appropriately and to keep their blood pressure down by eating healthy foods and avoiding high sodium intake all those things are going to be good for general health petoskey advises catching a seasonal illness is not inevitable what is inevitable is that at some point especially during the winter months you will come in contact with someone who has one even if you are a person who eats healthy whole foods every day drinks plenty of water gets a full eight hours of rest each night and even exercises daily these illnesses can unfortunately still be unavoidable luckily there are still some things you can do to help protect yourself and your loved ones the covid 19 pandemic introduced the world to the importance of masking to the world although they can sometimes feel like a nuisance masks are beneficial because they help contain any droplets and particles you breathe cough or sneeze out while the mask mandate for prevention of covid 19 spread has been lifted in most parts of the country don t ditch them just yet petoskey says masks can come in handy this fall and winter as reports of seasonal illnesses continue to rise i think mask wearing is definitely going to help reduce exposures and spread of all sorts of different infections most viral infections are going to be spread through secretions whether it be sneezing or coughing or wiping your nose so if you have a mask on it s going to provide that barrier says petoskey in addition to wearing a mask petoskey recommends getting both the latest flu and covid vaccines if you haven t already done so along with being cautious about when and where you gather sometimes it s just inevitable that you re going to have the exposure like when you are at the grocery store or going to work just those things that you normally do but if you know there is somebody who is sick that will be at a party or an event that you re going to try to avoid those situations and of course getting vaccinated against the infections that we know are severe will help we encourage everyone to get their flu vaccine and keep up to date on their covid boosters that way your body already has that mounted immune response to be able to fight off the infection if you do get exposed to it petoskey advises if you are not yet up to date with your seasonal flu shot and a covid booster it s not too late talk to your health care provider about scheduling them you can also get vaccinated at your local health department state vaccine clinics and retail pharmacies if you do come down with a seasonal illness this winter stay home to reduce the spread of the illness if symptoms worsen or do not go away make an appointment with your primary care provider or a local urgent care if symptoms become severe or life threatening go to the nearest emergency department or call 911

100 radiographic partial response rate achieved in patients on nox a12 radiotherapy bevacizumab 83 with durable mrano responses two of 6 patients with tumor size reduction of 99 12 month survival data expected in q2 2023 key opinion leader webinar november 22 2022 at 12 00pm et 06 00pm cet berlin business wire regulatory news tme pharma n v euronext growth paris altme paris altme a biotechnology company focused on developing novel therapies for treatment of cancer by targeting the tumor microenvironment tme announced today the presentation of updated interim results from the gloria phase 1 2 clinical trial expansion arm with nox a12 combined with radiotherapy and bevacizumab biosimilar avastin in chemotherapy refractory mgmt unmethylated brain cancer glioblastoma in a poster presentation at the society for neuro oncology sno annual meeting held in tampa florida us from november 16 20 2022 the company additionally disclosed newer data from the expansion arm that became available after the presentation submission cut off date as well as results from the completed dose escalation part of the same clinical trial the poster presentation entitled dual inhibition of post radiogenic angio vasculogenesis by olaptesed pegol nox a12 and bevacizumab in glioblastoma interim data from the first expansion arm of the german phase 1 2 gloria trial was presented by dr frank a giordano the poster as well as the most recent data highlight the following key points 100 of target lesions treated with the triple combination of nox a12 radiotherapy and bevacizumab were reduced by more than 50 5 of 6 patients 83 achieved durable partial responses pr by mrano criteria1 which takes into account radiographic response as well as other factors such as clinical condition of the patient one patient experienced progressive disease pd due to distant failure while target lesion control was maintained 2 of 6 patients achieved almost complete tumor size reduction 99 where contrast enhancing lesions were detectable but too small to be measured the data for the second patient achieving 99 decrease in tumor size was obtained shortly after the data cut off for the poster and will be presented in the webinar on november 22 2022 the mean best sum of perpendicular diameters spd of the tumor response was 74 9 53 8 to 99 9 for target lesion sums the triple combination was well tolerated and safe no dose limiting toxicities were observed although data from the expansion arm with bevacizumab suggest that adding a vegf inhibitor to nox a12 and radiotherapy provide greater clinical benefit over nox a12 with radiotherapy alone the latter already showed signs of clinical efficacy as presented at asco in june 2022 nox a12 rt resulted in tumor size reductions in 9 of 10 patients 90 of which 4 patients 40 achieved partial response with the safety and tolerability of this expansion arm now established and with indications that the addition of bevacizumab could meaningfully improve the efficacy of nox a12 and radiotherapy in glioblastoma we are now looking ahead to the survival data said aram mangasarian ceo of tme pharma we expect to report on survival data including overall survival os in the 2nd quarter of 2023 which will allow us to initiate discussions with regulators about the optimal regulatory path for nox a12 we are very encouraged and pleased to see the positive outcomes of this combination and remain convinced of the survival benefit this treatment can bring to brain cancer patients assessing the neurological functioning of the six patients using the clinician reported neurologic assessment in neuro oncology nano scale and patient reported outcomes offer a way to assess the patients quality of life which is increasingly considered important as an additional read out for patients benefit from treatment said dr frank a giordano professor and chair of the dept of radiation oncology at the university medical center mannheim and the lead investigator of the gloria trial the nano score remained stable and there were improvements in quality of life measures in the majority of patients leading us to expect a positive impact on survival with the median follow up to date of 7 9 months neither median pfs nor median os have yet been reached in this cohort with known unfavorable outcome thus we expect this population to outperform the nox a12 radiotherapy dose escalation cohorts where the median os was 12 7 months this makes us confident that the combination of nox a12 radiotherapy and bevacizumab will allow deeper and more durable responses further increasing os and providing the first significant treatment improvement in decades for these difficult to treat patients a copy of the poster presentation is available on the tme

cooke aquaculture pacific was very disappointed to receive the washington department of natural resources dnr notices not to renew our two steelhead fish farming leases in rich passage off bainbridge island and off hope island in skagit bay regulators and policymakers must responsibly follow the science and judicial precedents in making key decisions regarding marine aquaculture which we do not believe was the case in this instance we were surprised by commissioner of public lands hilary franz s decision over the past five years cooke has worked to foster productive working relationships with tribes dnr staff and other state agencies a recent federal biological opinion and a recent washington supreme court decision both reaffirm the state of the science that fish farming does not have an adverse impact on the environment all of these factors are contrary to dnr s decision to not renew our leases in 2018 the washington state legislature explicitly allowed the continued farming of fish in washington banning non native fish such as atlantic salmon but allowing farming of native fish such as steelhead to continue dnr is now acting contrary to that legislative directive in a landmark opinion filed in january 2022 the washington state supreme court unanimously rejected the arguments of a group of environmental organizations and upheld a permit granted to cooke aquaculture pacific by washington department of fish and wildlife wdfw for the farming of pacific steelhead trout further the washington state supreme court ruling found that farming of steelhead would not have probable significant adverse impacts on the environment the court upheld wdfw s years of careful analysis and permit conditions that it found would be protective of the environment this finding is in stark contrast to the purported concerns of dnr as the rationale for its two decisions in march 2022 the national oceanic and atmospheric administration s noaa national marine fisheries service released a 210 page biological opinion regarding marine finfish aquaculture in puget sound finding little to no negative impact on native species such as endangered salmon orcas or their habitat in its analysis noaa found that epa s approval is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of puget sound ps and or georgia basin gb species including chinook salmon ps steelhead hood canal summer run chum ps gb yelloweye rockfish or ps gb bocaccio is not likely to result in the destruction or adverse modification of the designated critical habitats for any of the listed species washington state has been a leader in developing and implementing permit requirements for fish farms over the past five years cooke has worked cooperatively with regulators including dnr to implement independent engineering review of its facilities enhanced monitoring of water and sediment quality and increased transparency regarding its operations all these requirements that have been implemented at cooke s farms in washington show the lack of impact to the environment of its operations cooke has continued to listen and do tribal outreach including hosting tribal tours on our washington farms to understand their concerns through listening we understand better than ever the importance of salmon to tribes in western washington and believe fish farming can be compatible with and supportive of the tribal goal of having wild fish for harvest for generations to come cooke was engaged in dialogue with tribes in washington regarding integrating wild salmon enhancement into its farm operations wild salmon survive to adulthood at extremely low rates delayed release holding wild fish in pens so they are released as older and larger fish is a proven method to increase that survival rate those efforts if they had been allowed by dnr would have had immediate and meaningful positive impacts on wild fish survival for tribal fishers to harvest as farmers and wild fishers we understand that the natural environment and ensuring its health is fundamental in sustainably producing quality healthy food we have a vested interest in the waters we farm in and as shown by our close work with agencies in washington and elsewhere welcome a well regulated environment to operate in environmental organizations and commissioner franz are choosing to ignore the fact that farm raised fish is one of the healthiest and most efficient ways to feed the global population with a minimal environmental impact and the lowest carbon footprint of any animal protein farmers work closely with world renowned scientists from academia government and the private sector to develop rigorous standards and implement best practices for fish health and environmental protection the science does not support the statements made by commissioner franz that the removal of these fish farms will save wild fish and natural habitat there are many known factors contributing to wild salmon population decline including hydropower dams growing seal populations as predators habitat loss due to development continued commercial fishing in migratory routes municipal waste treatment plants releasing untreated pollutants and contaminants which affect juvenile salmon and more fish farming can mitigate these harms by reducing pressures on wild stocks and also by directly applying the expertise of companies like cooke to better hatchery and wild salmon recovery efforts from an animal welfare perspective with this decision commissioner franz is forcing cooke aquaculture pacific to kill 332 000 juvenile steelhead that were planned to be stocked at rich passage and hope island in 2023 this is a tragic outcome for fish that should have been healthy sustainable food for our communities cooke aquaculture pacific acquired the cypress island fish farm in 2016 from a previous owner on the brink of bankruptcy regrettably a year later the steel cage system collapsed prior to the collapse cooke had applied to replace the cage system that was in operation by the previous owner almost 20 years the compliance issues relied upon by dnr as the reason not to renew our two steelhead fish farming leases in rich passage and hope island stem from our assuming ownership of farms that fell into disrepair by the previous owner after the collapse of that farm cooke focussed on improving the operations in washington working with regulators to increase transparency of its operations implementing third party engineering review of its facilities implementing enhanced environmental monitoring and transitioning the farms early to all female sterile trout dnr s action ignores all of this effort and improvements dnr s own staff has repeatedly commended cooke in both internal and external correspondence for the strides it had taken in working with dnr the washington department of ecology and wdfw the actions by dnr s leadership are perplexing at best and punitive at worst as a canadian family company investing significantly in washington state and creating local jobs this is very disheartening as a steward of washington s lands dnr is sending a very clear message to others do not come to washington do not invest here we have been and continue to be focused on improvement including responding through technological and science advancements where nature presents us with events beyond our control we are committed to listen learn and adapt to ensure we are always focused on sustainable outcomes at this time we are focused on our employees in washington state who are best in class multi generational fish farmers whose livelihood has been put in jeopardy by commissioner franz we intend to explore available options for our operations and investments in washington with the best interest of our employees and their families at top of mind

after a wave of panic gripped french financial markets late last week president nicolas sarkozy interrupted his summer vacation to call an emergency cabinet meeting and reassure the world that french banks were not on the brink of disaster although it looks as if france s major banks are not in imminent danger of collapse the undercapitalization of major european banks dramatically worsened following the global financial meltdown beginning in 2007 and it is now both a contributor to and casualty of the eurozone s growing sovereign debt crisis many of europe s largest banks were prompted by their national regulators to buy the sovereign debt of fellow eu member states only to see sovereign default become a real possibility the european union s long running series of stress tests for europe s banks lacks any real credibility and has substantively failed to increase market confidence the direct impact that the failure of a major european bank or group of such banks would have on the u s economy is dependent on the level of exposure and interconnectedness between said banks and the u s financial system the consequences of the failure of any one bank are unlikely to be large however there is no doubt there would be harmful consequences as such a failure reverberated across the atlantic weakening u s financial institutions and the economy more generally danger for french banks societe generale bnp paribas and credit agricole three of france s largest financial institutions experienced a significant drop in share prices on friday plunging 15 percent 9 5 percent and 12 percent respectively despite a knee jerk 15 day ban on short selling financial stocks implemented by sarkozy these banks remain hugely exposed to the sovereign debt of the so called piigs countries portugal ireland italy greece and spain as of march the bank for international settlements stated that french banks own a total of 672 billion 966 billion of piigs debt french banks like many other major european banks were pressured to buy this debt and given dubious assurances by national regulators and governments that other nations sovereign debt was virtually without risk but the prospects for losses now seem substantial greece ireland and portugal s credit ratings have all been slashed to junk status and french banks are massively leveraged on the back of this potentially worthless debt portugal ireland and greece all received substantial international bailouts and in athens s case a second bailout in an attempt to buy time for the beleaguered euro and to stave off a major banking crisis in europe however the markets are sending the message that they doubt these countries will make good on their debts in the long term which will leave french and german banks with substantial losses furthermore the european central bank ecb can provide only so much liquidity to banks as a stop gap measure as it did when it provided 500 million to an unidentified european bank last week a contagion of panic selling could result in a major european banking crisis yet the eurozone its real problems national regulators and governments pushed banks to acquire european sovereign debt on the foolhardy notion that the eu will not allow the euro to fail however the future of the eurozone is dependent on resolution of at least two fundamental problems first the eurozone is not growing growth for the entire 17 nation block was just 0 2 percent through the second quarter of 2011 second the richer northern countries especially germany are not yet ready to form a full fiscal transfer union germans understandably remain hostile to the idea of working longer and harder to subsidize other more profligate and less efficient members of the eurozone the summit held between chancellor angela merkel and president sarkozy last week sent the message that germany is not yet ready to pay the tab that the euro is running up the only substantial outcome of the merkel sarkozy summit to implement an eu wide financial transaction tax ftt received a giant thumbs down from the markets furthermore since the ftt is subject to a vote by all eu member states it is unlikely that britain s prime minister david cameron will allow such a tax to be introduced in light of its disproportionately negative effect on the city of london thus the only substantial outcome of the latest german french summit was a dead end as they knew it would be why should the u s care bailout money given to greece ireland and portugal from the eu eu member states and the international monetary fund imf has been used to sustain flagging countries while recapitalizing europe s banks however the u s has more than an indirect stake in this issue via its dominant membership of the imf american banks have 678 billion in gross direct exposure to european banks in addition to derivatives loan guarantees and other financial connections though no one knows the net exposure it is hard to see how the failure of one bank even a major one such as societe generale would have much impact on the u s economy yet in 2008 we saw how the near failure of one u s bank bear stearns badly shook global financial markets and the complete failure of a second the relatively small lehman brothers shook the markets to their very foundations thus though the u s exposure appears modest the risk of contagion is palpable and the loss of confidence in the global banking system would be dramatic time to be realistic about european debt the european central bank has spent hundreds of billions of euros buying time for financial markets by bailing out bad banks in europe however providing liquidity to essentially insolvent banks is not a sustainable solution a mechanism for winding down insolvent banks is badly needed in europe determining which banks are insolvent could be done by meaningful stress testing however the markets have already rendered their judgment on the eu s extant stress tests which were seen as entirely rigged to reveal unrealistically positive results effective stress testing that counts the true level of sovereign debt should be formulated u s regulators seeking to increase the capital ratios of financial institutions should note that debt from certain eu countries seemed to be a risk free investment not too long ago they should recognize that changed circumstances could have the same effect on other asset classes today s seemingly safe asset may be a highly risky investment tomorrow u s must put its own house in order proposals to introduce new eu taxes or ban short selling will not solve the problems of the euro which are many the euro was specifically created without a fiscal transfer mechanism so that prudent countries would not be forced to subsume the debts of imprudent ones and at this time eu elites lack the democratic mandate to introduce supranational economic governance the bloated greek social welfare system and the excessive sovereign debt of the other piigs have driven a stake through the heart of the euro the object lesson for the u s is also clear if the next u s president wants to save the american dream then he or she will need to reduce the national debt substantially and keep federal spending and taxes low sally mcnamara is senior policy analyst in european affairs in the margaret thatcher center for freedom

the sentiments of her other regional counterparts in a speech this morning restoring price stability remains the current imperative and it is clear that there is more work to do collins said i expect this will require additional increases in the federal funds rate followed by a period of holding rates at a sufficiently restrictive level for some time for the moment though that hasn t dampened the markets any further there s absolutely been a thirst for relief and a tug of war said shelby mcfaddin an investment analyst at motley fool asset management according to cnbc but at the end of the day it really just depends on this inflationary period becoming deflationary slower than it ramped up and on what the fed decides to do next 6 30am some gains us stocks are expected to open higher on

also said that he wants to see inflation stop climbing and that we are not there yet she added later today boston fed president susan collins has a speaking engagement and her words will be in focus through last week and into the past few days investors had been hoping that data showing that slowing inflationary pressures would eventually force the us federal reserve to scale back on rate hikes so far this year the federal reserve has delivered four consecutive 75 basis point interest rate hikes as it attempts to cool inflation so the ambiance in the stock markets is not as cheery as it was at the end of last week the s p500 started the day yesterday in a bad mood but recovered relatively well to close the session only 0 30 lower a couple of encouraging earnings from retailers may have helped lift sentiment said ozkardeskaya investors also remain wary about predictions that the world s biggest economy is heading for a recession jp morgan economists have said they expect the us to enter a mild recession next year because of rising interest rates and the tightening monetary conditions no surprise then that ozkardeskaya predicts share price falls ahead moving forward we could expect the downside correction at index level to deepen the first bearish target for the s p500 stands at the 3 855 level which is the major 38 2 retracement on the latest rebound she said contact the

by tom hals wilmington del reuters after five days of testimony including three hours from elon musk a delaware judge will now decide whether musk s 56 billion pay package from tesla nasdaq inc was justified by the company s explosive growth or undermined by a flawed process musk and the tesla directors named as defendants repeatedly testified that the package achieved what it set out to do deliver 10 fold growth in the company s stock price enriching investors and musk we thought if we could pull this off if this plan was executed tesla would be one of the most valuable technology companies antonio gracias a tesla board member from 2007 to 2021 told the delaware court of chancery on wednesday it was a great deal for the shareholders the trial seeks to resolve claims by shareholder richard tornetta that the 2018 pay package was dictated by musk the world s richest person to subservient directors and approved by a vote of shareholders who were misled by tesla the trial wrapped up on friday as musk struggles to oversee a chaotic overhaul of twitter inc nyse which he was forced to buy for 44 billion in a separate legal battle before the same judge chancellor kathaleen mccormick nyse my sense is that even though it went all the way to trial a ruling is going to favor mr musk said eric talley a professor at columbia law school who has followed the case it will be months before mccormick rules and her decision can be appealed to the delaware supreme court during the week long trial directors said the pay package was meant to ensure musk guided the electric vehicle maker through a critical phase when he could have focused on his rocket company spacex or tunneling venture the boring co musk told the board he wanted a huge package to finance his dream of travel to mars or as he testified to make life multi planetary in order to ensure the long term survival of consciousness musk described his efforts to push the company from the brink of failure in 2017 to exponential growth the amount of pain no words can express musk testified on wednesday gracias recalled that musk celebrated his birthday in a factory conference room with a grocery store cake this was all hands on deck 24 7 brutal he told the court the package allows musk to buy 1 of tesla s stock at a deep discount each time escalating performance and financial targets are met otherwise musk gets nothing tesla has hit 11 of the 12 targets as its value ballooned briefly to more than 1 trillion from 50 billion tornetta wants the plan rescinded and the stock granted under the plan returned to tesla much of the trial focused on the information provided to shareholders before they approved the plan tornetta s lawyers tried to show tesla concealed that three targets of the package were likely to be quickly met the plaintiff portrayed the directors as personal friends or business partners of musk who was the link to their wealth the directors tried to show they could hold the line against musk s demands but evidence of extracting concessions was limited to the best method for accounting for the stock grants and a requirement that musk had to hold his stock for five years it wasn t a knock down drag out affair todd maron testified about the pay talks in 2017 when he was general counsel talley said musk is a unique ceo and his pay reflects that he s like a labrador retriever he sees a ball and he runs after it you could almost make an argument they didn t pay him enough because he ran off after twitter

ukrainian officials publicly blamed russia for poland missile blast killed 2 on tuesday president joe biden has been adamant that the united states will back ukraine in its nine month fight to repel a russian invasion but he has insisted we will not fight the third world war in ukraine so when a missile struck a village in poland near the ukraine border on nov 15 and there were early claims it was launched by russia he and his top team of advisers were jolted into crisis mode the united states and other nato nations would be obliged to defend fellow nato member poland militarily if it were a russia attack a situation that could escalate into the global war most wanted to avoid biden in the waning days of a week long asia trip was woken up by aides in the middle of the night in bali indonesia to let him know that a missile had killed two people in poland a u s official said ukrainian officials publicly blamed russia as did a since corrected associated press report citing an unnamed senior u s intelligence official the reports sent stock markets diving and officials scrambling eastern european countries responded angrily and the temperature rose preliminary information from u s sources indicated that ukraine may have fired the missile in an attempt to repel a blizzard of incoming russian missiles and it had accidentally landed in poland as they sought confirmation the white house and other u s agencies publicly said little we cannot confirm the reports or any of the details at this time we will determine what happened and what the appropriate next steps would be said white house spokesperson adrienne watson behind the scenes deputy secretary of state wendy sherman was reaching out to some foreign diplomats asking them to adopt a cautious approach and to be measured while the united states worked out how it would respond western diplomats told reuters flanked by secretary of state antony blinken and national security adviser jake sullivan and wearing a t shirt and khakis biden made an early morning call to polish president andrzej duda offering his condolences and support for an investigation the white house said some moscow communication failed as tensions simmered and european allies fretted the u s military tried to reach out to moscow the pentagon has stressed the importance of military to military communication with moscow during the nine month long ukraine war for instance the white house has had talks with russia about its threats to use nuclear weapons against ukraine and top defense officials spoke with their russian counterparts in october after moscow accused ukraine of planning a dirty bomb attack but at the pentagon on tuesday efforts to contact russia s military failed general mark milley chairman of the joint chiefs of staff said his staff tried to arrange a call with his russian counterpart chief general staff general valery gerasimov some attempts were made no success milley told reporters my staff was unsuccessful in getting me linked up with general gerasimov he said sullivan who has been in touch with russian officials about the risks around the ukraine invasion did not make contact in relation to this incident a white house official said cia director bill burns who had met with his russian counterparts at the russian intelligence agency svr in ankara on monday was in kyiv on tuesday the day the missiles hit poland and traveled to warsaw the next day a u s official said that in ukraine burns discussed the u s warning he delivered to the head of russia s svr not to use nuclear weapons and reinforced the u s commitment to provide support to ukraine in its fight against russian aggression the u s official said burns met with officials in poland and discussed the current situation but would not comment when asked whether burns had reconnected with svr after the poland incident a kremlin spokesperson said he did not know if russian channels with the united states were activated to prevent any further escalation but noted that the american reaction was restrained investigation biden and his aides convened an emergency meeting of g7 leaders at 9am wednesday morning in bali to discuss the incident where he told them what the united states had learned that the blast was caused by a ukrainian air defense missile he was a little more vague answering reporters questions after the meeting saying it was unlikely that the missile was fired from russia based on its trajectory later nato s secretary general said the blast was likely caused by a ukrainian air defense missile that went astray but that russia was ultimately responsible because it started the war poland has been conducting its own investigation into what happened the u s military has sent american explosives experts to the site to help with the probe at poland s request a u s official said the official said the investigation is expected to conclude fairly quickly that ukraine fired the missile it s now just a matter of doing forensics work to determine what kind of missile it was the official said ukraine has insisted there was a russian trace in the blast and has sent its own experts to the site to investigate the incident highlights just how dangerous the russian invasion of ukraine is for europe and the rest of the world observers said poland and the baltics have been warning for some time that there is a real risk of something happening that draws the west into a wider conflict said one european diplomat what happened on tuesday makes it clear that this war is not managed it is not controlled except for the headline this story has not been edited by ndtv staff and is published from a syndicated feed
