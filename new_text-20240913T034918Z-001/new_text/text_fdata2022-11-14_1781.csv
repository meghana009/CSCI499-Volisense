food import costs globally are projected to reach nearly 2 trillion this year or higher than previously expected the un food and agriculture organization fao said in a report published this week the new forecast of 1 94 trillion would represent an all time high and a 10 per cent increase over the record level of 2021 however the pace of increase is expected to slow down in response to higher food prices and the depreciation of currencies against the united states dollar according to the latest food outlook report alarming signs food prices rose worldwide following russia s invasion of ukraine but have somewhat decreased together these countries produce around 30 per cent of all wheat exports in addition to other grains and related foodstuffs although the bulk of the increase in the global food import bill will be accounted for by richer countries rising food costs have disproportionately affected poorer nations the aggregate costs for food imports for low income countries is expected to remain almost unchanged even though it is predicted to shrink by 10 percent in volume terms pointing to growing accessibility issues for these countries these are alarming signs from a food security perspective indicating importers are finding it difficult to finance rising international costs potentially heralding an end of their resilience to higher international prices fao said deepening differences the food outlook report warns that existing differences are likely to become more pronounced high income countries will continue to import from the entire spectrum of food products while their developing world counterparts will increasingly focus on staple items last month the international monetary fund imf approved a new food shock window to provide emergency financing to lower income countries fao has welcomed the move calling it an important step to ease the burden of soaring food import costs agriculture related imports the report also assesses expenditures on imported agricultural inputs this year the global bill is expected to jump by nearly 50 per cent to 424 billion or some 112 per cent over 2020 driven largely by higher costs for imported energy and fertilizers negative repercussions for global agricultural output and food security are likely to extend into 2023 said fao commodities conundrum the food outlook report is published twice a year by the agency s markets and trade division it also contains market supply and utilization trends for commodities such as cereals oils sugar meat dairy and fish currently supplies are at close to record levels though multiple factors indicate tighter markets ahead for example world wheat production is forecast to reach a record 784 million tonnes over the coming year boosted by significant harvest recoveries in canada and russia although this should push global wheat inventories to record levels the report said that accumulations are expected mostly in china and russia while stock levels are predicted to decline by eight per cent in the rest of the world source un

this american purebred jewel of a vehicle is a 1968 eagle offenhauser indy car that carries with it more than a worthy legacy one of the racing legends that once stood behind its wheel is dan gurney who actually created this thing in the first place thanks to its caretakers the wilke family renowned for owning such wonderful vehicles it has been kept in extremely good condition for the past 50 years now the car came out of its hiding place to get some fresh air and to look for a new owner they might not win second place in the indianapolis 500 along with coming first in countless other races like dan gurney did back in the day but just having this inside a garage is enough to get any conversation going there s just something about a car with a heritage and a remarkable story behind it that mesmerizes people even though they might not be into racing this being said when gurney was trying to conquer every racing track he set his mind to this eagle offenhauser with chassis number 404 came with a 305 ci weslake ford v8 stock block engine however the specs on it have changed a lot since it hit the tarmac for the first time in 1972 it went through some big modifications like having a wing installed new wide slick tires instead of its stock grooved ones and the engine was changed of course sadly during a race it suffered a hub failure and mike mosley who was behind the wheel at the time crashed the car was rebuilt in 1973 and it still saw plenty of action since then as to what shape the car is in today you might wonder it s at the height it was in 1972 when it was as fast as ever it has a 159 cubic inch 2 6 liter offenhauser turbocharged inline 4 cylinder engine and a manual transmission but most importantly it still runs great according to the auction website some might even say its chief mechanic a j watson would approve of it
washington reuters the u s federal reserve may consider slowing the pace of rate increases at its next meeting but that should not be seen as a softening in its commitment to lower inflation federal reserve gov christopher waller said on sunday markets should now pay attention to the endpoint of rate increases not the pace of each move and that endpoint is likely still a ways off waller said in response to a series of questions on monetary policy at an economic conference organized by ubs in australia it depends on inflation we re at a point we can start thinking maybe of going to a slower pace waller said but we re not softening quit paying attention to the pace and start paying attention to where the endpoint is going to be until we get inflation down that endpoint is still a ways out there a report released last week showing slower than expected inflation in october was good news but was just one data point that would have to be followed with other similar readings to show convincingly that inflation is slowing he said the 7 7 annualized increase in inflation recorded in october is still enormous waller said noting that even if the fed scaled back from three quarter point increases to a half point increase at its next meeting you re still going up we re going to need to see a continued run of this kind of behavior and inflation slowly starting to come down before we really start thinking about taking our foot off the brakes waller said adding that he has been further convinced the fed is on the right path because its rates increases so far have not broken anything advertisement advertisement the fed has raised rates a total of 3 75 percentage points this year beginning in march including four three quarter point increases a rapid shift in monetary policy aimed to cool the worst surge of inflation since the 1980s for all the talk of crashing the economy and breaking the financial markets it hasn t done that waller said analysts and economists have warned that the monetary tightening will further the risk of recession impacting employment u s senate banking committee chair sherrod brown last month urged the federal reserve to be careful about tightening monetary policy so much that millions of americans already suffering from high inflation also lose their jobs reporting by howard schneider editing by aurora ellis
news analysis in 2022 in the midst of a recession record inflation and a tumbling stock market a corporate ideology known by the acronym esg emerged from obscurity to become a headline topic it has been called everything from a risk management tool and a movement for a cleaner more just world to a con a fraud and even in an elon musk tweet the devil incarnate the term itself is opaque esg brings environmental social and governance causes together under one umbrella the environmental component includes things such as transitioning to wind and solar energy from fossil fuels and to electric vehicles from gasoline powered cars the origins of esg ideology the esg movement is a derivative of the the social component includes racial and gender equity diversity training for employees economic equity and gun control the governance component focus on how companies are run and includes racial and gender quotas for corporate boards management and staff and in the case of exxon putting green energy advocates on the board the esg movement is a derivative of the united nations sustainable development goals sdgs there are 17 sdgs in all ranging from no poverty zero hunger and good health to responsible consumption and production and peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development in 2019 the world economic forum wef an annual gathering of the world s most powerful political and corporate leaders in davos switzerland signed a strategic partnership with the u n to advance the sdgs throughout the corporate sector led by founder and chairman klaus schwab the wef issued the davos manifesto 2020 the universal purpose of a company in the fourth industrial revolution klaus schwab founder and executive chairman of the world economic forum delivers remarks at the congress centre during the world economic forum wef annual meeting in davos switzerland on may 23 2022 fabrice coffrini afp via getty images the manifesto declared that a company is more than an economic unit generating wealth it fulfills human and societal aspirations as part of the broader social system during the annual meeting schwab told the gathered corporate executives and world leaders let s be clear the future is not just happening the future is built by us by a powerful community here in this room we have the means to improve the status of the world in a cnbc interview in 2020 bank of america ceo and wef international business council chairman brian moynihan said to solve these huge problems that the world faces this is u n week and the sdgs are the statement to the world of what we d like to make progress on you have to bring capitalism to the task on nov 4 100 executives from the alliance of ceo climate leaders issued a joint letter to attendees of the u n climate change conference cop27 stating we are ready to work side by side with governments to deliver bold climate action accelerating the transition to net zero requires significant collaboration and shared responsibility between the private and public sectors signatories of the letter included coca cola dell hewlett packard microsoft nestle pepsico siemens sysco and unilever speaking at the cop27 conference former vice president al gore concurred saying we need 4 5 trillion per year to make this transition and that can only come by unlocking access to private capital author and political analyst michael rectenwald told the epoch times this is a massive campaign that has already metastasized to almost all of the corporate world the tentacles of the wef extend to almost every sector of society more than 500 of the world s largest corporations have signed pledges to support esg goals across industries including banking insurance asset management tech media energy manufacturing and transportation these pledges are signed as part of membership in international clubs like climate action 100 the glasgow financial alliance for net zero the net zero banking alliance and the net zero asset managers alliance there s no segment of the u s economy that s outside the reach of this movement from its origins in u n think tanks and wef conference rooms esg is then passed down to the corporate world via wall street marketed as an investment strategy for companies to follow voluntarily or involuntarily carole crozat blackrock s head of sustainable investing research explained to investors that while measuring the alignment of investments to the u n sdgs is a complex and evolving task we believe that their integration in investment decisions can help secure long term financial performance redirecting capital toward u n sdgs could offer 12 trillion of market opportunities linked to our long term social and environmental well being crozat said esg in practice in principle esg means that companies look beyond making profits and consider higher political and moral issues such as the welfare of the planet in practice it means that corporations become political agents for left wing causes this concept is also called stakeholder capitalism which has been endorsed by ceos across the corporate world speaking for bank of america moynihan said our research shows that companies that do well on esg end up doing better it defines capitalism the way that people want to define it which is stakeholder capitalism and solving the big problems of the world stakeholder capitalism means that instead of answering exclusively to shareholders ceos will focus on employees the environment and society at large as head of the business roundtable a club of america s largest corporations jpmorgan chase ceo jamie dimon applauded the organization s announcement in 2019 that corporate executives would henceforth follow stakeholder ideology stating that the american dream was fraying and that these modernized principles reflect the business community s unwavering commitment to continue to push for an economy that serves all americans in accordance with esg principles stakeholder oriented banks such as jpmorgan chase refused to lend to oil drilling companies in alaska delta air lines coca cola and major league baseball fought against voter id laws in georgia that they claimed were racist the world s largest food companies such as nestle danone kellogg s general mills and unilever encourage and sometimes pressure the hundreds of thousands of farmers who supply them to take up a u n approved method of farming called regenerative agriculture as part of the u n and esg goals to reduce shootings banks including citibank restricted lending to the firearms industry credit card companies visa mastercard and american express began tracking purchases from gun shops amalgamated bank president priscilla sims brown stated in an interview with cbs that where there may be gun sales that are intended for black markets or we see patterns of gun purchases made in multiple gun shops we can provide that information to authorities to investigate paypal went a step further and refused to allow its payment services to be used to buy guns or ammunition protesters rally in opposition to the walt disney co s stance against a recently passed florida law outside of the company s headquarters in burbank calif on april 6 2022 jill mclaughlin the epoch times following esg social criteria disney fought to repeal a florida law that bans the teaching of sexual topics to schoolchildren in kindergarten through third grade which disney said was a human rights violation disney executives also announced during a staff meeting they were adding queerness and advancing a not so secret gay agenda in the children s shows they produce the wef bank of america disney coca cola and paypal didn t respond to requests for comment a money machine that spans the globe esg isn t just an ideology it s also an industry esg investment funds and other assets have rapidly grown over the past decade to reach a current 55 trillion worldwide esg assets are projected to grow to 100 trillion by 2025 to put this in perspective the gross domestic product gdp of the entire united states is currently about 21 trillion the esg industry is enormous and pervasive it s lucrative and it has created a broad network of vested interests consultants rating agencies accountants investment managers and proxy agents to bring agnostics into the fold often the companies that impose esg ratings on companies countries and even u s states also provide paid consulting services to help them improve their ratings the main drivers of the esg movement are wall street banks and investment funds which control the capital for the world economy the three largest asset managers blackrock vanguard and state street together control more than 20 trillion in assets under management because they manage index funds they own shares in most corporations that are included in market indexes like the s p 500 if you just look at blackrock by itself it s the first second or third largest shareholder in 80 percent of the companies in the s p 500 andrew puzder the former ceo of cke restaurants told the epoch times they use that tremendous voting power not only to advance this economic leftist agenda but to put it above their obligation to generate returns for their investors blackrock state street and vanguard didn t respond to requests for comment will hild executive director of consumers research told the epoch times that the way that these fund managers use esg to push progressive politics is multifaceted the first and probably the most public way is they get to vote the shares that they re managing the more quiet sort of less public way is that they have what they call engagement meetings with corporate leadership on these issues hild said and when they show up they don t say hey we re just representing ourselves they say we represent ownership of 7 5 20 percent of your publicly traded shares blackrock state street and vanguard together would be the largest shareholder in 90 percent of the s p 500 speaking at a new york times conference in 2017 blackrock ceo larry fink appeared to underscore this point stating behaviors are going to have to change and this is one thing we re asking companies you have to force behaviors and here at blackrock we are forcing behaviors fink writes an annual letter to ceos setting priorities for the coming year blackrock ceo larry fink speaks at a forum during the opening of the clinton global initiative cgi a meeting of international leaders in new york city on sept 19 2022 spencer platt getty images if you read his annual letter to ceos larry fink actually thinks he needs to tell the world s ceos every year what blackrock thinks puzder said he doesn t have to go to every shareholder meeting he just tells them what to do in a letter and the letter the year before last said we need to get to net zero carbon emissions by 2050 which will require a transformation of the entire economy despite its rhetoric to the contrary and its membership in various global esg organizations blackrock has vehemently denied that it uses its influence to push a political agenda responding to a letter pdf from 19 state attorneys general who asserted that blackrock used citizens assets to pressure companies to comply with international agreements such as the paris agreement that force the phase out of fossil fuels blackrock countered pdf that its funds were highly rated from a performance perspective and that our participation in these initiatives is entirely consistent with our fiduciary obligations other financial institutions that have pledged support for the esg movement include bank of america citibank goldman sachs jpmorgan chase morgan stanley wells fargo hsbc deutsche bank and ubs and in pledging fealty to esg goals corporations are not only aligned with each other but with governments as well it s now becoming increasingly difficult to tell where the private sector ends and the government begins alex newman ceo of liberty sentinel media told the epoch times we re seeing a merger of the two jpmorgan chase citibank goldman sachs and morgan stanley also didn t respond to requests for comment in my experience large wall street banks are not charitable institutions vivek ramaswamy entrepreneur and founder of strive asset management told the epoch times you look at which firms are rewarded with government packages like who gets the covid 19 stimulus packages a lot of that flowed through blackrock tom jones president of the american accountability foundation told the epoch times what we re seeing is a new revolving door in washington we re seeing liberal activists whether they re in the administration or on capitol hill instead of leaving those positions and going to k street to become lobbyists in washington what we re seeing now is they re going to wall street and they re using the enormous influence that these wall street firms have to really drive policy at the state and local level in a way they haven t done before director of the national economic council brian deese speaks during a briefing in the james s brady press briefing room of the white house in washington on march 31 2022 nicholas kamm afp via getty images brian deese for example who s the current national economic council director was global head of sustainable investing at blackrock hild noted and you have tom donilon who s now been put in charge of a significant portion of our foreign policy vis à vis china and again he comes right out of blackrock and it s going down the line the biden administration has been heavily staffed by blackrock alums and in some cases it s even scary some of the issues that they handled when they were at blackrock tom donilon for example recommended to clients while he was there that they tripled their exposure to china and now he s in charge of a portion of the biden administration s foreign policy vis a vis china a democratic deficit what s most striking about esg is how in joining corporations with government under a common cause it has created a new power structure that often supersedes national laws and overrides the constitution working in collaboration with government agencies corporations have engaged in enforcement censorship and warrantless surveillance often doing what the government is legally prohibited from doing some believe that this public private alliance which overrides democratic institutions is necessary because the crises that humanity are facing including climate change and racism are so dire the climate crisis is about human security economic security environmental security national security and the very life of the planet president joe biden said in his speech at the u n cop27 summit on nov 11 calling for a sustainability revolution at the cop27 conference former vice president al gore condemned the culture of death that surrounds our addiction to fossil fuels by digging up dead life forms and burning them recklessly in ways that create more death but others are wary about this concentration of power and authority in so few hands and the public s loss of a voice or vote in such major decisions about the future how you address racial inequity or global climate change these are important enough questions that we should resolve them through free speech and debate in the public square by putting people into public office who are accountable to the american electorate companies are not accountable blackrock is not accountable larry fink is not accountable ramaswamy said this is the heart of the question that was an issue in 1776 where we said for better or worse citizens decide how to settle these common political questions through the political process where everyone s voice and vote counts equally new york university finance professor aswath damodaran told the prague finance institute in november 2021 do you really want larry fink and jamie dimon deciding what s good or bad for the world you ve outsourced what should be your responsibility as a voter as a citizen to ceos of companies nothing good has ever come of doing that

retail division and human resources according to the report the reported layoffs would represent less than 1 of amazon s global workforce and 3 of its corporate employees ashley capoot tanaya macheel morgan stanley says the earnings boost banks get from higher interest rates is fading big u s banks will benefit as the federal reserve continues to raise interest rates to fight inflation but that boost is fading according to morgan stanley analysts led by betsy graseck lenders typically enjoy fatter margins in a rising rate environment as they charge borrowers higher rates for loans while raising the rates they pay to depositors more slowly but increasing funding costs and moves by corporate officers to purchase longer duration securities in the third quarter has made the industry less sensitive to higher rates graseck said monday in a research note that means the incremental benefit to 2023 earnings from a 50 basis point rate increase has fallen in the third quarter from the previous period for nearly all the banks in her coverage universe graseck wrote while the median bank would ve seen a 2 5 pop to 2023 eps from a half point rate increase previously it would now post a 1 5 increase morgan stanley said citing the companies third quarter regulatory filings investors expect the fed to hike interest rates at the central bank s december meeting still the biggest beneficiaries to higher rates include bank of america and silvergate capital graseck wrote bank of america in particular has been named by many analysts as a pick for its ability to grow earnings as rates rise hugh son s p 500 has lost its valuation appeal again rbc s calvasina says last week s better than expected cpi print emboldened the bulls said rbc capital markets head of u s equity strategy lori calvasina said in a monday note while that s generally constructive for equities as it signals the fed may stop hiking interest rates sooner rather than later there are a few caveats one thing we don t like is that the s p 500 has lost its valuation appeal again said calvasina following last week s bounce s p 500 p es are near average on consensus eps and a bit above average on rbc s eps forecasts not frothy but lacking the appeal we had started to see around the october lows she also doesn t like the potential for the fed to turn hawkish again and say they plan to keep financial conditions tight that rhetoric even in the context of a debate between hawks and doves likely adds to stock market volatility in the months ahead she said while cooling inflation is a good thing what it means for u s equities broadly is a bit more complicated the main thing we ve been communicating to investors on this point lately is that moderating inflation is a headwind for s p 500 eps due to its correlation with revenues but should still allow for some modest p e expansion in the year ahead based on our analysis of the relationship between interest rates inflation and s p 500 p es dating back to the 1970s she said moderating inflation seems likely to be accompanied by lower us equity exposure but higher levels of inflation relative to recent history may serve to prop that positioning up if that is what ends up occurring she added carmen reinicke megacap tech lost their mojo goldman s kostin says megacap technology stocks which had led the last decade long bull market might have

rally we have all the short term gauges are pointing higher and long term gauges still point lower she told cnbc s squawk box monday there s not a lot of breakouts with this move what we ve had here is a macro shift that s driven this relief rally she added it was really similar to what happened over the summertime where we saw the s p 500 peak in mid august the 10 year treasury yields had been correcting ahead of that peak for several weeks we re probably in store for something similar this time around where the s p 500 will peak on the back of a short term low in treasury yields and i don t think we ve had that low yet as stocks posted a winning week cryptocurrencies crashed stockton said there s a major breakdown that would be confirmed if bitcoin closes below 18 300 this week with the next support level after that being below 13 900 she added that while it s easy to make a case for that breakdown now there are signs of downside exhaustion we haven t seen in some time those signs would support a rebound of nine weeks or so for cryptocurrencies she said whether that allows bitcoin to avoid its confirmed breakdown we re not sure but it would be a welcome relief rally and selling opportunity tanaya macheel bank of america cuts tesla price objectives saying ev recovery won t happen in 2023 bank of america has trimmed its tesla price objectives citing ongoing issues for the electric automaker industry including supply chain woes that will hinder any recovery once again the can has been kicked down the road supply chains are still constrained and it is not just semis and broad based commentary indicates recovery is increasingly a 2023 event wrote john murphy in a monday note while companies have started seeing some benefits from easing material prices and supplier recoveries volumes are still under pressure meaning that a real recovery might not even happen in 2024 piling on to the semis issue is a patchwork of other supplier disruptions labor shortages key sticking point which may exacerbate the already tight supply he wrote as a result the strength of new vehicle pricing may prove more resilient even though used vehicle pricing has come under pressure in 22 the firm trimmed its price target for tesla to 275 from 325 implying a roughly 41 upside on the neutral rated stock carmen reinicke citi downgrades bank of america after seeing little upside due to already high valuation citi is warning bank of america has little room to grow even though it s a defensive pick amid economic volatility analyst keith horowitz downgraded the bank stock citing its premium valuation that will make seeing a notable upside difficult bac is a high quality franchise that is executing well and may be a good defensive holding in light of upcoming economic and market uncertainty given bac s good deposit franchise and lower credit risk he said while we believe the stock can do well on a relative basis in the event of a pullback we don t see much upside on an absolute basis as the stock is currently trading below the average on our implied cost of equity metric reflecting a premium valuation and leaving little room for multiple expansion cnbc pro

tension but washington can change that according to jeffrey sachs professor at columbia university i think the u s should start by saying we want to have normal relations we re not trying to stop the chinese economy he said his comments come hours before a face to face meeting between u s president joe biden and chinese leader xi jinping in bali indonesia where the g 20 summit is set to take place it s been too much sound bites in each direction and a lot of tension and to my mind too much u s unilateralism rather than bilateral negotiation and diplomacy he added the u s and china should ease

all eyes on westminster as we wait to see if hunt will quell market concerns on the uk s fiscal outlook as fx trading gets underway in asia late on sunday the dollar has slipped yet again which is a continuation of the move from last week when the dollar fell 3 5 on a broad basis and us stocks surged 6 the market mood appears upbeat as we start another week as expectations of a fed pivot china dropping its zero covid policy and the russian withdrawal from the strategically important ukranian city of kherson all helping to boost sentiment the key driver for risk sentiment remains weaker us inflation data which focussed minds on the longed for pivot from the fed to smaller rate increases this narrative was given a boost on friday when the university of michigan consumer confidence indicator for the us came in lower than expected across all measures for november right now weaker data is good news for the market as a slowing economy also builds the case for a fed pivot as we start a new week the uk chancellor s autumn statement and uk budget version 2 is scheduled for thursday uk inflation is released along with a raft of chinese data us retail sales and us producer prices to add a political twist to the mix the democrats have won the senate race in the midterms after they won senate seats in arizona and nevada and a republican victory in house of representatives has not yet been called democrats hold onto power the market impact looking ahead the market had been expecting a republican win in the midterms yet that has failed to materialise for outsiders this highlights how the trump brand is now toxic for the republican party and with heavy losses dealt to his favoured candidates this has reduced the likelihood that he will run in the 2024 presidential race while a divided washington is usually good news for financial markets right now the democrats continue to hold the sway of power controlling both the white house and the senate on the surface this could be bad news for stocks however there are three reasons why this is not such a bad result for us asset prices 1 if this causes trump to step aside from the 2024 presidential race then it could signal a return to a more convential and centrist political style in the us this is good news for financial markets as it makes the future of us politics and policy making more certain and less wayward which is surely a good development after the turmoil thrown at financial markets in 2022 2 nancy pelosi the democratic speaker of the house of representatives is calling for a vote this year on the us debt ceiling before the new congress is sworn in us treasury secretary janet yellen has also said that it would be great to get this done this year no wonder these two key democratic figures are calling for the vote on the debt ceiling to take place asap the midterm results mean that the republicans are not as emboldened as some expect thus raising the debt ceiling without a standoff or potential tough spending cuts is possible this eradicates the prospect of a debt ceiling wrangle and a potential us default which is a good thing for global financial markets 3 the prospect of a fed pivot is still the key driver of markets right now and that supersedes politics at this stage of the financial cycle could weak us retail sales also push the fed to slow down plans to shrink its balance sheet we think yes thus the bad data is good for financial markets theme may have some way to go this month overall political developments in the us also support a continuation of the stock market rally that we saw last week although we may not get such large moves to the upside as issues remain weak q3 earnings and a weak q4 outlook a dreadful outlook for key lead economic indicators such as the semi conductor industry and the prospect of a weak economic outlook in 2023 which could temper market exuberance in the coming days and weeks the autumn statement what to expect the uk is also in focus this week with the chancellor s autumn statement due on thursday as we mention above this is the uk s second attempt at a budget in just shy of two months after the disastrous mini budget back in september the mood music is very different this time around with the chancellor expected to cut spending and raise taxes for nearly every tax paying cohort accompanying this statement will be the office for budget responsibility s forecasts for the uk economy with all eyes on the obr s projections for uk debt to gdp levels and whether the chancellor s medicine will fix the uk s over borrowing problem watch the obr forecasts chancellor jeremy hunt is expected to announce spending cuts and tax rises totalling 55bn which should cover the uk s fiscal hole however it could wreak severe economic damage in the process on sunday hunt said that everyone will pay more tax however he is saving the specific detail for thursday there is a potential that he will reduce the threshold for the top level of tax to 125 000 and he is also expected to impose road tax on electric vehicles they are currently exempt however these measures are unlikely to be enough to plug the uk s fiscal gap instead jeremy hunt has mentioned how expensive the uk s support for household energy bills is and he will announce the revamped plan this thursday this will obviously be less generous however hunt was clear in interviews this weekend sound money comes before fiscal help to protect the economy from recession with news that the uk s economy has already contracted by 0 2 between july and september and the boe is predicting an historical recession for the uk economy of 5 quarters of negative growth will the market like the uk government s tighter fiscal policy will the chancellor over correct the market impact from this budget is unclear but one thing that we will put our neck out for is that the market reaction won t be as violent as the september budget and no pension fund should go under because of jeremy hunt s fiscal changes one the one hand with uk inflation expected to top 10 7 in october when it is released later this week tight fiscal policy could help to bring down inflation which is good news for the economy and a sensible economic path to take however there is a risk that the chancellor will over correct the mistakes made by kwasi kwarteng if this narrative takes over then we could see a mild decline in uk stocks and the pound in the days after the autumn statement overall watch the obr forecasts and bond yields we expect them to fall because of this budget the boe could also get a boost as this budget could finally trigger a downward shift in market based interest rate expectations for the uk something that the boe has been calling for in recent weeks

tanaya macheel morgan stanley says the earnings boost banks get from higher interest rates is fading big u s banks will benefit as the federal reserve continues to raise interest rates to fight inflation but that boost is fading according to morgan stanley analysts led by betsy graseck lenders typically enjoy fatter margins in a rising rate environment as they charge borrowers higher rates for loans while raising the rates they pay to depositors more slowly but increasing funding costs and moves by corporate officers to purchase longer duration securities in the third quarter has made the industry less sensitive to higher rates graseck said monday in a research note that means the incremental benefit to 2023 earnings from a 50 basis point rate increase has fallen in the third quarter from the previous period for nearly all the banks in her coverage universe graseck wrote while the median bank would ve seen a 2 5 pop to 2023 eps from a half point rate increase previously it would now post a 1 5 increase morgan stanley said citing the companies third quarter regulatory filings investors expect the fed to hike interest rates at the central bank s december meeting still the biggest beneficiaries to higher rates include bank of america and silvergate capital graseck wrote bank of america in particular has been named by many analysts as a pick for its ability to grow earnings as rates rise hugh son s p 500 has lost its valuation appeal again rbc s calvasina says last week s better than expected cpi print emboldened the bulls said rbc capital markets head of u s equity strategy lori calvasina said in a monday note while that s generally constructive for equities as it signals the fed may stop hiking interest rates sooner rather than later there are a few caveats one thing we don t like is that the s p 500 has lost its valuation appeal again said calvasina following last week s bounce s p 500 p es are near average on consensus eps and a bit above average on rbc s eps forecasts not frothy but lacking the appeal we had started to see around the october lows she also doesn t like the potential for the fed to turn hawkish again and say they plan to keep financial conditions tight that rhetoric even in the context of a debate between hawks and doves likely adds to stock market volatility in the months ahead she said while cooling inflation is a good thing what it means for u s equities broadly is a bit more complicated the main thing we ve been communicating to investors on this point lately is that moderating inflation is a headwind for s p 500 eps due to its correlation with revenues but should still allow for some modest p e expansion in the year ahead based on our analysis of the relationship between interest rates inflation and s p 500 p es dating back to the 1970s she said moderating inflation seems likely to be accompanied by lower us equity exposure but higher levels of inflation relative to recent history may serve to prop that positioning up if that is what ends up occurring she added carmen reinicke megacap tech lost their mojo goldman s kostin says megacap technology stocks which had led the last decade long bull

market rally we have all the short term gauges are pointing higher and long term gauges still point lower she told cnbc s squawk box monday there s not a lot of breakouts with this move what we ve had here is a macro shift that s driven this relief rally she added it was really similar to what happened over the summertime where we saw the s p 500 peak in mid august the 10 year treasury yields had been correcting ahead of that peak for several weeks we re probably in store for something similar this time around where the s p 500 will peak on the back of a short term low in treasury yields and i don t think we ve had that low yet as stocks posted a winning week cryptocurrencies crashed stockton said there s a major breakdown that would be confirmed if bitcoin closes below 18 300 this week with the next support level after that being below 13 900 she added that while it s easy to make a case for that breakdown now there are signs of downside exhaustion we haven t seen in some time those signs would support a rebound of nine weeks or so for cryptocurrencies she said whether that allows bitcoin to avoid its confirmed breakdown we re not sure but it would be a welcome relief rally and

washington reuters the u s federal reserve may consider slowing the pace of rate increases at its next meeting but that should not be seen as a softening in its commitment to lower inflation federal reserve gov christopher waller said on sunday markets should now pay attention to the endpoint of rate increases not the pace of each move and that endpoint is likely still a ways off waller said in response to a series of questions on monetary policy at an economic conference organized by ubs in australia it depends on inflation we re at a point we can start thinking maybe of going to a slower pace waller said but we re not softening quit paying attention to the pace and start paying attention to where the endpoint is going to be until we get inflation down that endpoint is still a ways out there a report released last week showing slower than expected inflation in october was good news but was just one data point that would have to be followed with other similar readings to show convincingly that inflation is slowing he said the 7 7 annualized increase in inflation recorded in october is still enormous waller said noting that even if the fed scaled back from three quarter point increases to a half point increase at its next meeting you re still going up we re going to need to see a continued run of this kind of behavior and inflation slowly starting to come down before we really start thinking about taking our foot off the brakes waller said adding that he has been further convinced the fed is on the right path because its rates increases so far have not broken anything advertisement advertisement the fed has raised rates a total of 3 75 percentage points this year beginning in march including four three quarter point increases a rapid shift in monetary policy aimed to cool the worst surge of inflation since the 1980s for all the talk of crashing the economy and breaking the financial markets it hasn t done that waller said analysts and economists have warned that the monetary tightening will further the risk of recession impacting employment u s senate banking committee chair sherrod brown last month urged the federal reserve to be careful about tightening monetary policy so much that millions of americans already suffering from high inflation also lose their jobs reporting by howard schneider editing by aurora ellis

washington reuters the u s federal reserve may consider slowing the pace of rate increases at its next meeting but that should not be seen as a softening in its commitment to lower inflation federal reserve gov christopher waller said on sunday markets should now pay attention to the endpoint of rate increases not the pace of each move and that endpoint is likely still a ways off waller said in response to a series of questions on monetary policy at an economic conference organized by ubs in australia it depends on inflation we re at a point we can start thinking maybe of going to a slower pace waller said but we re not softening quit paying attention to the pace and start paying attention to where the endpoint is going to be until we get inflation down that endpoint is still a ways out there a report released last week showing slower than expected inflation in october was good news but was just one data point that would have to be followed with other similar readings to show convincingly that inflation is slowing he said the 7 7 annualized increase in inflation recorded in october is still enormous waller said noting that even if the fed scaled back from three quarter point increases to a half point increase at its next meeting you re still going up we re going to need to see a continued run of this kind of behavior and inflation slowly starting to come down before we really start thinking about taking our foot off the brakes waller said adding that he has been further convinced the fed is on the right path because its rates increases so far have not broken anything the fed has raised rates a total of 3 75 percentage points this year beginning in march including four three quarter point increases a rapid shift in monetary policy aimed to cool the worst surge of inflation since the 1980s for all the talk of crashing the economy and breaking the financial markets it hasn t done that waller said analysts and economists have warned that the monetary tightening will further the risk of recession impacting employment u s senate banking committee chair sherrod brown last month urged the federal reserve to be careful about tightening monetary policy so much that millions of americans already suffering from high inflation also lose their jobs

tanaya macheel morgan stanley says the earnings boost banks get from higher interest rates is fading big u s banks will benefit as the federal reserve continues to raise interest rates to fight inflation but that boost is fading according to morgan stanley analysts led by betsy graseck lenders typically enjoy fatter margins in a rising rate environment as they charge borrowers higher rates for loans while raising the rates they pay to depositors more slowly but increasing funding costs and moves by corporate officers to purchase longer duration securities in the third quarter has made the industry less sensitive to higher rates graseck said monday in a research note that means the incremental benefit to 2023 earnings from a 50 basis point rate increase has fallen in the third quarter from the previous period for nearly all the banks in her coverage universe graseck wrote while the median bank would ve seen a 2 5 pop to 2023 eps from a half point rate increase previously it would now post a 1 5 increase morgan stanley said citing the companies third quarter regulatory filings investors expect the fed to hike interest rates at the central bank s december meeting still the biggest beneficiaries to higher rates include bank of america and silvergate capital graseck wrote bank of america in particular has been named by many analysts as a pick for its ability to grow earnings as rates rise hugh son s p 500 has lost its valuation appeal again rbc s calvasina says last week s better than expected cpi print emboldened the bulls said rbc capital markets head of u s equity strategy lori calvasina said in a monday note while that s generally constructive for equities as it signals the fed may stop hiking interest rates sooner rather than later there are a few caveats one thing we don t like is that the s p 500 has lost its valuation appeal again said calvasina following last week s bounce s p 500 p es are near average on consensus eps and a bit above average on rbc s eps forecasts not frothy but lacking the appeal we had started to see around the october lows she also doesn t like the potential for the fed to turn hawkish again and say they plan to keep financial conditions tight that rhetoric even in the context of a debate between hawks and doves likely adds to stock market volatility in the months ahead she said while cooling inflation is a good thing what it means for u s equities broadly is a bit more complicated the main thing we ve been communicating to investors on this point lately is that moderating inflation is a headwind for s p 500 eps due to its correlation with revenues but should still allow for some modest p e expansion in the year ahead based on our analysis of the relationship between interest rates inflation and s p 500 p es dating back to the 1970s she said moderating inflation seems likely to be accompanied by lower us equity exposure but higher levels of inflation relative to recent history may serve to prop that positioning up if that is what ends up occurring she added carmen reinicke megacap tech lost their mojo goldman s kostin says megacap technology stocks which had led the last decade long bull

ready for a new trading week after last week the s p 500 notched its best week since june katie stockton a technical analyst and founder of fairlead strategies reminds investors that it s still a bear market rally we have all the short term gauges are pointing higher and long term gauges still point lower she told cnbc s squawk box monday there s not a lot of breakouts with this move what we ve had here is a macro shift that s driven this relief rally she added it was really similar to what happened over the summertime where we saw the s p 500 peak in mid august the 10 year treasury yields had been correcting ahead of that peak for several weeks we re probably in store for something similar this time around where the s p 500 will peak on the back of a short term low in treasury yields and i don t think we ve had that low yet as stocks posted a winning week cryptocurrencies crashed stockton said there s a major breakdown that would be confirmed if bitcoin closes below 18 300 this week with the next support level after that being below 13 900 she added that while it s easy to make a case for that breakdown now there are signs of downside exhaustion we haven t seen in some time those signs would support a rebound of nine weeks or so for cryptocurrencies she said whether that allows bitcoin to avoid its confirmed breakdown we re not sure but it would be a welcome relief rally and selling opportunity tanaya macheel bank of america cuts tesla price objectives saying ev recovery won t happen in 2023 bank of america has trimmed its tesla price objectives citing ongoing issues for the electric automaker industry including supply chain woes that will hinder any recovery once again the can has been kicked down the road supply chains are still constrained and it is not just semis and broad based commentary indicates recovery is increasingly a 2023 event wrote john murphy in a monday note while companies have started seeing some benefits from easing material prices and supplier recoveries volumes are still under pressure meaning that a real recovery might not even happen in 2024 piling on to the semis issue is a patchwork of other supplier disruptions labor shortages key sticking point which may exacerbate the already tight supply he wrote as a result the strength of new vehicle pricing may prove more resilient even though used vehicle pricing has come under pressure

to already high valuation citi is warning bank of america has little room to grow even though it s a defensive pick amid economic volatility analyst keith horowitz downgraded the bank stock citing its premium valuation that will make seeing a notable upside difficult bac is a high quality franchise that is executing well and may be a good defensive holding in light of upcoming economic and market uncertainty given bac s good deposit franchise and lower credit risk he said while we believe the stock can do well on a relative basis in the event of a pullback we don t see much upside on an absolute basis as the stock is currently trading below the average on our implied cost of equity metric reflecting a premium valuation and leaving little room for multiple expansion cnbc pro

call over to jennifer simpson ceo of panbela jennifer please proceed jennifer simpson thank you and thank you everyone for joining i will begin the call with a review of our clinical development program recent accomplishments and upcoming milestones we will then follow with a review of the financial results and then we will open it up for q a starting with our phase iii program in august we announced the international expansion of our aspire trial evaluating gemcitabine and nab paclitaxel with or without ivospemin which is our new generic name for sbp 101 for untreated metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma into australia as well as the first patient enrolled we also announced regulatory approval for the opening of trial sites in spain france and italy with approximately 95 sites planned throughout the united states europe australia and south korea we are continuing to focus on site initiation and enrollment in order to ultimately deliver a more effective treatment for pancreatic cancer a deadly disease with few treatment options we expect that a significant number of global sites will be opened by year end with the full complement of sites opened by early to mid 2023 the trial sample size is 600 patients and the primary endpoint will be overall survival we will use overall survival for the interim analysis as well it is anticipated to take approximately 36 months for complete enrollment with the interim analysis still available in early 2024 the interim analysis allows us to assess the merits of continuing the study as well as to ensure optimal resource utilization we are excited to have these recent approvals as we move forward towards the interim analysis expected in a little over 1 year from now turning to familial adenomatous polyposis or fap the registration trial with flynpovi is anticipated to begin mid 2023 and is funded by our licensing partner one two therapeutics we are working closely with one two to ensure alignment with the fda on all key aspects of the trial before the trial commences as the trial will utilize european clinical sites and we retain the rights outside of the u s and canada we will seek advice from the european authorities regarding the utilization of the registration trial for approval in europe as a reminder a prior phase iii study evaluating eflornithine and sulindac or flynpovi versus either agent alone showed a 100 risk reduction and a need for surgery in the lower gastrointestinal or gi group as there are currently no approved drug therapies for the treatment of fap this data is exciting and the lower gi group is intended to be the focus of the new registration trial lastly we in partnership with one two also have an ongoing phase iii double blind placebo controlled trial of flynpovi the combination of eflornithine and sulindac prevent recurrence of high risk adenomas and second primary colorectal cancers in patients with stage 0 to 3 colon or rectal cancer this trial is known as the paces trial and is funded by the national cancer institute or nci in collaboration with the southwest oncology group also known as swog and we look forward to a futility analysis in the first half of 2023 moving to phase ii studies first there is an ongoing trial in relapsed refractory neuroblastoma utilizing eflornithine sachets this trial is funded through the children s oncology group or cog and the nci we will also be starting in early 2023 a phase ii trial in early onset type 1 diabetes utilizing eflornithine tablets this study is supported by indiana university and the juvenile diabetes research foundation or jdrf in phase i development we have 3 programs that we will be starting first opening by year end we will be evaluating eflornithine sachets in combination with keytruda in the stk11 mutation population of non small cell lung cancer stk11 mutant non small cell lung cancer respond poorly to checkpoint inhibitors and bioinformatic analyses suggest that alterations in polyamine metabolic pathways may play a role in the resistance to immunotherapy in preclinical tumor models eflornithine treatment improves anti pd 1 efficacy by increasing tumor specific cytotoxic t cell populations as well as increased expression of pd 1 on tumor associated cd8 positive t cells the phase i portion is fully funded and we look forward to this trial starting as it will be the first clinical proof of concept trial focused on the relationship between polyamines and the immune system if this trial is positive it opens the possibility for combining with a checkpoint inhibitor in other tumors as well as the possibility of combining with other immunotherapies such as car t therapy to improve response rates our second phase i program which is scheduled to begin in the first half of 2023 will focus on the evaluation of ivospemin in the platinum resistant ovarian cancer population as a reminder we ve collaborated with john hopkins university school of medicine to identify this indication additionally a poster on the treatment of immune competent mice injected with vdid8 positive ovarian cancer with ivospemin was presented and showed a significantly prolonged survival and decrease in overall tumor burden the mature data was later published in the international journal of molecular sciences titled expanded potential of the polyamine analogue sbp 101 as a modulator of polyamine metabolism and cancer therapeutic the publication highlighted that in vitro studies determined that sbp 101 reduced cellular viability across a broad range of cancer cell types with an exceptionally strong reduction in ovarian adenocarcinoma viability resulting in a 42 increase in median survival in the vdid8 positive ovarian cancer mouse model the data supports efforts to initiate an ovarian cancer clinical program lastly we have completed preclinical work necessary to begin a pancreatic cancer neoadjuvant investigator initiated trial we are working with the key opinion leaders to finalize the protocol and obtain the necessary institutional approvals to open this trial by early 2023 turning to milestones in addition to continued execution of the various trials in our development program we anticipate announcing final data from our phase i trial in untreated metastic pancreatic cancer patients and early onset type 1 onset diabetes by year end or early 2023 there will be final data from previously completed gastric cancer prevention trial by year end or early 2023 as well as the futility analysis for the paces trial in the first half of 2023 we also anticipate the phase i data from the eflornithine keytruda combination in the stk11 non small cell lung cancer trial by mid 2023 and the interim analysis from the aspire trial in early 2024 in summary we have made tremendous progress in q3 and year to date we are excited to enhance stockholder value as we move ahead into q4 and onwards by executing against our milestones i will stop here and turn it over to sue to review the financials susan horvath thank you jennifer general and administrative expenses were 1 3 million in the third quarter of 2022 compared to 0 9 million in the third quarter of 2021 the change is due primarily to services and personnel costs associated with the acquisition and integration of cancer prevention pharmaceuticals or cpp research and development expenses were 2 3 million in the third quarter of 2022 compared to 1 3 million in the third quarter of 2021 the increase is due to spending on our clinical studies as we ramped up efforts to activate up to 95 clinical sites around the world in the aspire clinical trial as a reminder the results for the 9 months ended september 30 2022 included approximately 17 7 million of in process research and development ipr d represents the primary asset acquired as a result of the acquisition of cpp and gaap accounting required writing off this asset to research and development expenses immediately after the acquisition in june net loss in the third quarter of 2022 was 4 4 million or 0 21 per diluted share compared to a net loss of 2 1 million or 0 16 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2021 total cash was approximately 0 9 million as of september 30 2022 that does not include gross proceeds of approximately 6 million from our public offering which priced on september 30 and closed early in october total current assets were 1 8 million and current liabilities were 8 million as of the end of the quarter also at september 30 2022 total noncurrent assets consisting of cash deposits held by our contract research organization was 3 1 million as a result of the cpp acquisition we now have debt and accrued interest on our balance sheet totaling approximately 8 million as of september 30 2022 this includes 2 notes with principal balances of 6 2 million and 650 000 respectively along with accrued interest both notes accrue simple interest at a rate of 5 per annum looking to the cap table as of september 30 2022 we had 20 8 million of common shares outstanding and including shares reserved for options and warrants we were at 30 3 million shares the shares reserved number includes all outstanding equity awards including stock options which were held primarily by insiders and all warrants to purchase common stock after the public offering which closed on october 4 2022 we had approximately 27 9 million common shares outstanding and including all shares reserved for options warrants including prefunded warrants we were at 80 5 million shares our cash used in operations for the 9 months just ended totaled approximately 10 3 million during the first 9 months the company paid 2 6 million in cash deposits to our global contract research organization which will be held to pay clinical expenses at the end of the aspire trial this cash outlay for cro deposits is not expected to be repeated ramped up activity in the randomized trial and costs associated with our acquisition drove the remaining increase in cash used in operations we project the cash with the early q4 capital raise will take us into q1 of 2023 we will continue to focus our cash on those items in our plan which will drive value for our stockholders such as the aspire trial that concludes my financial remarks operator can you please open the phone lines for q a and poll for questions

tanaya macheel morgan stanley says the earnings boost banks get from higher interest rates is fading big u s banks will benefit as the federal reserve continues to raise interest rates to fight inflation but that boost is fading according to morgan stanley analysts led by betsy graseck lenders typically enjoy fatter margins in a rising rate environment as they charge borrowers higher rates for loans while raising the rates they pay to depositors more slowly but increasing funding costs and moves by corporate officers to purchase longer duration securities in the third quarter has made the industry less sensitive to higher rates graseck said monday in a research note that means the incremental benefit to 2023 earnings from a 50 basis point rate increase has fallen in the third quarter from the previous period for nearly all the banks in her coverage universe graseck wrote while the median bank would ve seen a 2 5 pop to 2023 eps from a half point rate increase previously it would now post a 1 5 increase morgan stanley said citing the companies third quarter regulatory filings investors expect the fed to hike interest rates at the central bank s december meeting still the biggest beneficiaries to higher rates include bank of america and silvergate capital graseck wrote bank of america in particular has been named by many analysts as a pick for its ability to grow earnings as rates rise hugh son s p 500 has lost its valuation appeal again rbc s calvasina says last week s better than expected cpi print emboldened the bulls said rbc capital markets head of u s equity strategy lori calvasina said in a monday note while that s generally constructive for equities as it signals the fed may stop hiking interest rates sooner rather than later there are a few caveats one thing we don t like is that the s p 500 has lost its valuation appeal again said calvasina following last week s bounce s p 500 p es are near average on consensus eps and a bit above average on rbc s eps forecasts not frothy but lacking the appeal we had started to see around the october lows she also doesn t like the potential for the fed to turn hawkish again and say they plan to keep financial conditions tight that rhetoric even in the context of a debate between hawks and doves likely adds to stock market volatility in the months ahead she said while cooling inflation is a good thing what it means for u s equities broadly is a bit more complicated the main thing we ve been communicating to investors on this point lately is that moderating inflation is a headwind for s p 500 eps due to its correlation with revenues but should still allow for some modest p e expansion in the year ahead based on our analysis of the relationship between interest rates inflation and s p 500 p es dating back to the 1970s she said moderating inflation seems likely to be accompanied by lower us equity exposure but higher levels of inflation relative to recent history may serve to prop that positioning up if that is what ends up occurring she added carmen reinicke megacap tech lost their mojo goldman s kostin says megacap technology stocks which had led the last decade long bull

market rally we have all the short term gauges are pointing higher and long term gauges still point lower she told cnbc s squawk box monday there s not a lot of breakouts with this move what we ve had here is a macro shift that s driven this relief rally she added it was really similar to what happened over the summertime where we saw the s p 500 peak in mid august the 10 year treasury yields had been correcting ahead of that peak for several weeks we re probably in store for something similar this time around where the s p 500 will peak on the back of a short term low in treasury yields and i don t think we ve had that low yet as stocks posted a winning week cryptocurrencies crashed stockton said there s a major breakdown that would be confirmed if bitcoin closes below 18 300 this week with the next support level after that being below 13 900 she added that while it s easy to make a case for that breakdown now there are signs of downside exhaustion we haven t seen in some time those signs would support a rebound of nine weeks or so for cryptocurrencies she said whether that allows bitcoin to avoid its confirmed breakdown we re not sure but it would be a welcome relief rally and

first announced by the massachusetts institute of technology which the new york times noted in its epic obituary samuelson helped build into one of the world s great centers of graduate education in economics in its farewell mit accomplished the seemingly impossible by summing up samuelson s life s work with relatively few words the nobel laureate whose mathematical analysis provided the foundation on which modern economics is built and whose textbook influenced generations of students samuelson might well have appreciated the institution s economy of words a native of gary ind with a master s degree from harvard samuelson made contributions too myriad to contain within the bounds of a media release the same goes for the awards he received during a career that reshaped and revolutionized economics as a high school freshman in chicago he studied the stock market at 16 he left high school for the university of chicago samuelson was born on may 15 1915 i was born as an economist on jan 2 1932 he later said when discussing his first college lecture on the relation between poverty and population growth he once wrote i sometimes think of myself as the last generalist in economics with interests that range from mathematical economics down to current financial journalism he loved teaching researching writing and proving himself time and again as one of the field s

coveted by collectors one sold in may at heritage from the mark collection for nearly 600 000 but this event features the first one kennedy ever used the very oak rocker in which he discovered a way to relieve the unrelenting agony that had necessitated four grueling operations an oak p p chair company rocker with its high back and seat made of fine interwoven steam bent cane belonged to dr janet p travell whom kennedy first visited in 1955 to treat his back as the washington post wrote upon her death at 95 in 1997 travell prescribed numerous treatments for the young sen kennedy including swimming but as the paper reported she also believed that a rocking chair relieved tension in the lower back by keeping the muscles moving contracting and relaxing kennedy s oak rocker with hand woven cane seat and back sparked a national revival of the old fashioned rocking chair in her oral history at the john f kennedy presidential library and museum travell spoke at length about this chair she recalled how kennedy asked to be measured for a comfortable chair also on artdaily torkwase dyson a liquid belonging on view at pace gallery people have often asked me about the rocking chair she recounted i had one in my office at 9 west 16th street he sat in it and he said this is so comfortable why can t i have one of these i said he could this chair a sort of national symbol during the kennedy administration came from travell s estate mark collected items from throughout kennedy s life and times and counted among his prized celebrated assemblage was the very smith corona electra 12 series 5l electric typewriter he used to type campaign and presidential speeches from 1959 through 1961 this typewriter which kennedy took to paris during his historic meetings with french president

wine at his carousel club on commerce street in downtown dallas where the likes of candy barr and jada entertained crowds and cops ruby kept a carousel card in his wallet which likely provided more identification than his driver s license it promised that the proprietor s floor show joint would offer sophisticated risqué provocative delightful entertainment he kept in his billfold carousel

housemaid patricia o brien borrow s mother asked her employer for the chair which eventually made its way to england and now to auction at heritage during this auction it s joined by a chamber pot from the titanic identified in this rare instance as the ss titanic which means it was made before the ship was designated as a royal mail ship this is likely the sole survivor of its kind and it was not rescued from the ocean s floor rather it was brought aboard one of the lifeboats by a passenger who feared she might become seasick in time this chamber pot made its way into the collection of

as a profound reminder that history lives on through these tangible reminders still with us and still with stories to tell paul samuelson s death in december 2009 was first announced by the massachusetts institute of technology which the new york times noted in its epic obituary samuelson helped build into one of the world s great centers of graduate education in economics in its farewell mit accomplished the seemingly impossible by summing up samuelson s life s work with relatively few words the nobel laureate whose mathematical analysis provided the foundation on which modern economics is built and whose textbook influenced generations of students samuelson might well have appreciated the institution s economy of words a native of gary ind with a master s degree from harvard samuelson made contributions too myriad to contain within the bounds of a media release the same goes for the awards he received during a career that reshaped and revolutionized economics as a high school freshman in chicago he studied the stock market at 16 he left high school for the university of chicago samuelson was born on may 15 1915 i was born as an economist on jan 2 1932 he later said when discussing his first college lecture on the relation between poverty and population growth he once wrote i sometimes think of myself as the last generalist in economics with interests that range from mathematical economics down to current financial journalism he loved teaching researching writing and proving himself time and again as one of the field s greatest combatants and cheerleaders of samuelson s numerous books one economics an introductory analysis first published in 1948 and on and on ever since became the world s best selling and most influential economics text its popularity forced its translation into myriad tongues discussions about its contents roared for decades only 14 years after its publication businessweek noted the book has gone a long way toward giving the world a common economic language in 1970 after tenures serving as an economic advisor to presidents kennedy and lyndon johnson samuelson became the first american to be awarded the sveriges riksbank prize in economic sciences in memory of alfred nobel for the scientific work through which he has developed static and dynamic economic theory and actively contributed to raising the level of analysis in economic science samuelson s family offers the medal at auction for the first time along with the very first award presented to samuelson who was in 1947 the inaugural recipient of this john bates clark medal so named for one of the founders and former presidents of the american economic association the award is given annually formerly biennially to those under 40 who have provided the most significant contributions to the field of economic perception and understanding several recipients samuelson among them became nobel laureates also included too is one of his final and most prestigious honors the national medal of science presented to samuelson by president bill clinton in 1996 in may heritage offered numerous treasures from the vaunted assemblage of beloved philanthropist and american history collector melvin pete mark jr the late portland oregon real estate developer december s event presents even more extraordinary pieces among them a grail of sorts among collectors of john f kennedy history rocking chairs commissioned by kennedy to soothe his chronic back pain are highly coveted by collectors one sold in may at heritage from the mark collection for nearly 600 000 but this event features the first one kennedy ever used the very oak rocker in which he discovered a way to relieve the unrelenting agony that had necessitated four grueling operations an oak p p chair company rocker with its high back and seat made of fine interwoven steam bent cane belonged to dr janet p travell whom kennedy first visited in 1955 to treat his back as the washington post wrote upon her death at 95 in 1997 travell prescribed numerous treatments for the young sen kennedy including swimming but as the paper reported she also believed that a rocking chair relieved tension in the lower back by keeping the muscles moving contracting and relaxing kennedy s oak rocker with hand woven cane seat and back sparked a national revival of the old fashioned rocking chair in her oral history at the john f kennedy presidential library and museum travell spoke at length about this chair she recalled how kennedy asked to be measured for a comfortable chair people have often asked me about the rocking chair she recounted i had one in my office at 9 west 16th street he sat in it and he said this is so comfortable why can t i have one of these i said he could this chair a sort of national symbol during the kennedy administration came from travell s estate mark collected items from throughout kennedy s life and times and counted among his prized celebrated assemblage was the very smith corona electra 12 series 5l electric typewriter he used to type campaign and presidential speeches from 1959 through 1961 this typewriter which kennedy took to paris during his historic meetings with french president charles de gaulle in may 1961 was designed for typing in extra large characters making it easier to read speeches from the podium also included is his white house hotline travel telephone a relic of telecommunications in red white and blue mark had once loaned his collection to the oregon history museum where two of his most talked about items were displayed the wallet on jack ruby the day he killed lee harvey oswald and the tv camera that captured oswald s first interview and likely his final moments the wallet is precisely as described in the dallas police department property clerk s receipt 1 tan billfold with tex oper s license in name of jack leon ruby 3929 rawlins 1 passenger car lic receipt same misc papers cards which doesn t even begin to describe the voluminous amount of history and ephemera stuffed into ruby s wallet just as the warren commission noted in its inventory ruby kept on him the very certificate of zoning and location that allowed him to serve beer and wine at his carousel club on commerce street in downtown dallas where the likes of candy barr and jada entertained crowds and cops ruby kept a carousel card in his wallet which likely provided more identification than his driver s license it promised that the proprietor s floor show joint would offer sophisticated risqué provocative delightful entertainment he kept in his billfold carousel clippings business cards traffic tickets blank checks cards for attorneys and insurance men receipts and notes these fragments of interactions and transactions with a strip club owner constitute the banal details that for a time served as the paper trail for investigators wanting to know why ruby gunned down the president s assassin in the dallas pd basement on nov 24 1963 from the same place at the exact moment and those consequential two days earlier comes this remarkable survivor the krld news camera used by dallas cbs station to chronicle kennedy s murder on nov 22 1963 indeed it s the same general electric image orthicon television camera with the no 3 sticker seen on the cover of when the news went live dallas 1963 the history of those days as told by the journalists who covered the assassinations this was the camera operated by gene pasczalek used to capture oswald s midnight press conference hours after his capture at oak cliff s texas theatre this camera caught the moment oswald insisted i didn t kill anybody two days later ruby killed oswald live on national television this camera was among those at dallas pd headquarters that day an unblinking witness to grim history this is not a punchline in search of a joke the dec 1 historical platinum event does indeed feature a deck chair from the doomed british passenger liner that sank in the north atlantic ocean on april 15 1912 after striking an iceberg during its maiden voyage per the letter of provenance accompanying this fascinating wood and cane keepsake from the rms titanic it was gifted to photographer thomas barker who was invited aboard during the ship s stop in queenstown now cobh ireland on april 11 1912 barker who worked for the cork examiner photographed what might have otherwise been the mundane day to day activities aboard a luxury liner in fact his are the sole photos depicting passengers embarking on the ship according to the handwritten 1959 letter of provenance addressed to a mrs walker and signed by judith borrow née o brien of merseyside england barker was gifted one of the deck chairs after commenting that he d love to use one in his garden during the summer but only days later like the rest of the world barker learned of the tragedy that had befallen the titanic his souvenir had become a grim haunting keepsake he no longer wanted barker s housemaid patricia o brien borrow s mother asked her employer for the chair which eventually made its way to england and now to auction at heritage during this auction it s joined by a chamber pot from the titanic identified in this rare instance as the ss titanic which means it was made before the ship was designated as a royal mail ship this is likely the sole survivor of its kind and it was not rescued from the ocean s floor rather it was brought aboard one of the lifeboats by a passenger who feared she might become seasick in time this chamber pot made its way into the collection of michael borrow who founded a firm underwater marine equipment specializing in subsea exploration equipment borrow is perhaps best known for having created the atmospheric diving suit featured in for your eyes only before his death mr borrow passed the chamber pot to one of his closest friends and its current consignor the 1957 launch by the soviet union of sputnik 1 the first artificial earth satellite represented far more than simply elevating a high tech gadget into the heavens it effectively marked the start of the space race between the ussr and the united states superpowers already locked in a cold war the russians celebrated the event while many americans feared falling behind in space might signal a similar lag on earth a full scale sputnik 1 emc emi lab model with vintage tesla maj 620a broadcast receiver launches at auction one of likely four known models produced by the okb 1 now energia lab in 1957 to test ground electromagnetic compatibility emc and electromagnetic interference emi it comes from the collection of dr frank j malina the texan nasa says is considered by some to be the father of modern rocketry two other models reside in museums one at the energia corporate museum outside moscow and another at the museum of flight in seattle the lot is accompanied by a certificate of export issued by the national technical museum in brno czech republic which notes that the purpose of the models was to be technological demonstrators before the satellite production as such the letter also notes that this model bears the

christine condon baltimore sun tns baltimore for the fourth straight year juvenile rockfish numbers in maryland waters were well below the historical average according to a survey conducted by the state department of natural resources researchers who visited 22 different spawning areas in the chesapeake bay and its tributaries this year caught an average of 3 6 recently hatched rockfish per sample slightly more than last year s 3 2 but the longtime average for the survey called the young of the year index is 11 3 michael luisi assistant director with the maryland department of natural resources fishing and boating services called the results disappointing but said there is no need to panic we have seen this type of variable inclines and declines over a short period of time for the juvenile population so this is not so uncommon that it s causing us to panic he said but another year of lackluster results is raising alarm among advocates for maryland s state fish prized for their sweet and nutty but mild flavor rockfish are the bay s most popular commercial and sport fish the chesapeake bay foundation estimates its economic impact at about 500 million a year the species is also known for its fight which adds to the sport and charter fishery s allure the rockfish board of the atlantic states marine fisheries commission which oversees a variety of east coast fisheries convened nov 7 to analyze the results of a full stock assessment for the species which is also known as striped bass earlier this year the fisheries commission adopted a new amendment to the striped bass management plan with more conservative triggers for new regulations it came after the last striped bass stock assessment found the population was overfished the amendment requires overfishing to end within one year and for the stock to be rebuilt by 2029 it s possible that the results of this year s stock assessment which will tee off the regulations for next year s fishing season could paint a different picture than maryland s juvenile striped bass survey showing stronger numbers for adult fish but even if they do environmental advocates likely will continue pushing for greater restrictions on the fishery particularly in the summertime when warmer water temperatures stress the species said allison colden maryland fisheries scientist for the chesapeake bay foundation i think it s good if we see some positive rebuilding colden said but folks like cbf and others are still going to be encouraging the board to keep in mind that we ve got four years of low recruitment coming behind the fish that we re seeing now this year just as in 2021 maryland s department of natural resources postponed the spring trophy season until may 1 banning anglers from targeting striped bass in the bay in april that s generally when an increase in air and water temperatures triggers rockfish spawning which occurs in april may and june it was pushed back by two weeks with the presumption that a majority of fish had spawned by may 1 but i think that is another thing that we should be continuing to look at colden said if we re going to be catching pre spawn fish no i don t think that s a good thing for us to be continuing to do as the conditions in the bay evolve including due to climate change colden said it s important to study when the rockfish are spawning with the goal of reducing the number of fish that are caught before they can reproduce fishing for stripers also was prohibited during the last two weeks of july this year though it was allowed to pick back up again in august it was the same in 2021 but environmental groups like the bay foundation have pushed for deeper cuts to the summer fishery and will continue to do so ignoring the chances of climate catastrophe won t make them go away york city bans using soap to wash cars in driveways or on streets york county welcomes new state park susquehanna riverlands landfill discharge into kreutz creek violates dep standards remedy expected in 2023 it s not just those two weeks that are challenging for striped bass colden said and i know that the department is making an attempt to balance an economic impact with an ecological one for striped bass but i think at this point those things should always be reconsidered dnr s luisi said there s not going to be any liberalization of the regulations for the coming year if anything we re going to be cutting back or conserving the population more than what we have now he said there have been some discussions about protecting larger female striped bass in the population perhaps by instituting a maximum size limit rather than the minimums that currently exist luisi said the department also may consider a longer summer closure though he noted it would have an outsize impact on charter captains and summer tourists we don t want to put people out of business but we also have a responsibility to protect the striped bass population luisi said jason seman a full time charter boat captain operating out of stevensville said he fears a summer closure any longer than two weeks would hurt his business on top of the regulations weather can limit fishing days too and the summertime is the most popular for his charter called the marylander he said he would prefer a summer closure in august rather than july partly because there are greater numbers of other fish to go after like bluefish and spanish mackerel and august seems just as stressful for the rockfish if i was in a bathtub in hot water you re still in hot water in august said seman whose company is called maryland fishing and hunting robert t brown president of the maryland watermen s association said he s hoping the fishing regulations stick with the status quo particularly if the fisheries commission s stock assessment shows the striped bass population isn t being overfished it s possible brown said that maryland s juvenile survey which covers the same ground every year just didn t capture where the chesapeake s young rockfish currently reside the numbers out of virginia s water this year could be a source of hope luisi said a similar study conducted by the virginia institute of marine science calculated the state s young of the year index at 7 95 fish per sample above that state s historic average of 7 77 it was the 10th straight year of average or above average figures luisi said the number of adult female rockfish currently in the chesapeake have produced large classes of juveniles in the past but failed to this year a number of environmental factors could be the reason he said the conditions in the bay predators water quality not just in the chesapeake bay but along the entire atlantic coast plays a huge role in whether or not the success of the spawning of the fish that came into maryland last year happens he said and those types of things are a lot of times out of our control still the last time maryland s juvenile rockfish index even climbed above 4 was in 2018 when the index reached 14 8 since the state survey began in 1954 the numbers have at times varied significantly from year to year but after consistently below average figures in the 1970s and 80s maryland instituted a moratorium on fishing for the species after the ban was lifted the 1990s saw the strongest tallies yet the recovery of the rockfish has been lauded as a bay success story but experts say new factors could complicate efforts to strengthen the population in 2022 there are some things that they don t have going for them that they did when they recovered so many years ago said dave secor a professor who studies fisheries at the university of maryland center for environmental science that includes the burgeoning population of invasive blue catfish which have effectively replaced striped bass as the dominant predator in the chesapeake bay secor said the catfish also are preying on juvenile striped bass he said but officials would benefit from more studies on just how big a toll their appetite is taking we just don t know how many and what fraction of those fish they are taking secor said changes in mortality rates also have impacted the species secor said including catch and release mortality particularly in the warmest months of the year when striped bass are hooked removed from the water and released many become stressed by the temperature and die it s really the air temperature and bringing them up out of the water that apparently causes the damage he said in 2019 the state launched an awareness campaign for anglers encouraging them to avoid fishing for rockfish when temperatures are forecast to reach 95 degrees and to avoid lifting fish from the water when temperatures are between 90 and 94 degrees an increased frequency of warmer days due to climate change could further imperil the summer fishery secor said unfortunately it means that the summertime striped bass fishery is going to be ever diminishing if you follow those kinds of regulations he said

atlantic since it was unveiled in a 1978 speech by sir geoffrey howe mp now the chancellor of the exchequer in mrs thatcher s conservative government a means of stimulating economic development in depressed urban areas by encouraging local entrepreneurs through tax and regulatory relief the approach marks a radical departure from the government expenditure programs of the 1960s and 1970s in britain levislation to create eleven experimental zones was enacted by parliament in november 1980 and a number of these sites will be operating by the end of this summer the british zones are however a specialized version of the basic concept designed primarily to reactivate deserted industrial areas and they are not likely to be an accurate guide to the way in which american zones would affect neighborhoods in the united states the enterprise zone has become a central issue if not the central issue in the national urban policy debate and egislation is being considered at both the state and federal levels to create versions of the concept in the district of columbia and several states such as illinois bills have been passed or are pending which would reduce state and local taxes and regulatory burdens in distressed neighbor hoods although these measures are designed to establish state enterprise zones they are generally constructed in a manner that for an analysis of the british enterprise zones see stuart butler enterprise zones in britain the experiment begins international briefing 8 the heritage foundation 1981 2 would allow the zones to fit within the criteria being discussed at the federal level in some other cases the measure establishes a commission or similar body to investigate possible sites and to examine state burdens which could be relieved in federally designated zones 2 president reagan gave strong support to the enterprise zone idea during his campaign in particularl in his speech to the national urban league in august 1980 he argued that taxes and regulation should be relaxed in such inner city zones he explained that the purpose of the enterprise zone in his view should be to encourage entrepreneurs to start new businesses and to put local people to work those who view poverty and unemployment as permanent afflictions of our cities he concluded fail to understand how rapidly the poor can move up the ladder of success in our economy but to move up the ladder they must first get on it and this is the concept behind the enterprise zones after the reagan administration took office the white house began a detailed examination of the idea and a cabinet council was set up under commerce secretary malcolm baldrige to seek ways of turning the concept into reality although as yet no firm proposal has emerged from the administration secretary baldrige issued a statement in june stating that the administration supports the establishment of enter prise zones to help create new jobs and enterprise in our nation s poorest communities it is a top priority of the reagan administration that enterprise zone legislation be enacted in this congress congressional action the urban jobs and enterprise zone act mark i in june 1980 a bill to create enterprise zones was introduced in the house h r 7563 by representatives jack kemp r ny and bob garcia d ny and in the senate s 2823 by senators john chafee r ri and rudy boschwitz r minn 3

to agree to a reduc ion in property taxes in the zone amounting to at least 20 percent within four years if these requirements were met the secretary of commerce would accept the application from a local government and declare the area an enterprise zone once the designation had been made the bill authorized the following incentives in addition to the property tax reduction they would apply for a minimum of ten years 1 for individuals owning property in the zone an increase in the capital gain deduction from 60 percent to 80 percent on property used predominantly for business purpo ses within the zone 2 for employees who complete most of their work in the zone a 90 percent reduction in the employee s and employer s social security tax for employees under 21 years of age and a 50 percent reduction for other workers 3 for businesses who recruit 50 percent of their workforce from among the zone s residents qualified businesses a 15 percent reduction in corporate income tax three year straight line depreciation for all property other than land used for business purposes in the zone up to 500 000 in property per year loss carryforward for up to ten years cash method of computing taxable income available for businesses with gross annual income below 1 5 million 4 for corporations in general a reduction in capital gains tax from 28 percent to 15 percent on property other than land used for trading purposes in the zone reactions to the 1980 act when the urban jobs and enterprise zone act of 1980 was presented to the congress it was intended by its sponsors to be a discussion document rather than a bill intended for passage the sponsors urged both supporters and critics of the enterprise zone idea to make their views known so that a remodeled bill could be offered at a later date the kemp garcia bill did indeed provoke considerable national discussion in the year following the introduction of the bill there have been many conferences and meetings and much media coverage devoted to discussions of the concept and the legislation while the enterprise zone gained wide support as an approach however certain specific features of the 1980 bill did attract criticism the principal objections may be summarized as follows 1 targeting the criteria for selection of areas were said to be imprecise and too coldly statistical some areas which might seem to be perfect candidates for a zone could not meet the requirements while less deserving locations managed to fit the demands some critics also questioned the wisdom of what was in effect the automatic designation of eligible areas they argued that there should be some discretion and a limit on the number of zones at least until the performance of the initial zones could be analyzed and necessary modifications made 2 regulation the absence of any provisions serving to streamline federal or local regulation came under attack many small businessmen and some neighborhood groups argued that red tape particularly at the local level is a greater obstacle to enterprise and innovation than taxes and other tangible costs 3 small business small business spokesmen maintained that although the enter prise zone was supposed to stimulate the creation of new firms and in particular small local enterprises the tax incentive package was heavily geared towards larger established companies while the loss carryforward social security tax cuts and proper ty tax reduction might offer some help to struggling new businesses they conceded most new firms show little or no taxable profit in their early years and so depreciation and other tax allowances would have very limited impact 4 social security the reduction in social security taxes proposed by the bill was to be reimbursed to the fund out of general revenues this was viewed by some as a dangerous precedent in light of the controversy over the future of social securi y also it was pointed out the incentive might well be designed to help low income employees but it would also benefit highly paid executives in enterprise zone firms 5 depreciation a major criticism of the bill was that the rapid depreciation allowance appeared to be the most significant incentive in the package this miqht lead to companies deciding to install a great deal of equipment while employing very few local people 6 residency requirement the requirement that at least 50 percent of a company s workforce be zone residents for it to enjoy the principal incen tives was seen by the sponsors of the bill as a mechanism to ensure that local residents would be the chief beneficiaries of the enterprise zone however objections to this provision did emerge the reguirment did not specify any category of resident such as ceta eligibles and so skilled workers or highly paid executives would fulfill the criterion if they moved to the zone or established convenience addresses in addition critics charged the requirement was precisely the kind of red tape that the zones were supposed to reduce if it remained as a feature of the zones it was said it would only have the effect of dissuading new entrepreneurs from setting up in the enterprise zone some even predicted dawn raids on zone businesses by government agents checking for illegal non zoners much as agents now search for illegal aliens 7 property tax perhaps the most vociferous criticism voiced against the bill centered on the requirement that property taxes had to be reduced by at least 20 percent in certain states it was p9inted out differing property tax rates are unconstitutional meaning that no site could comply with the requirement even in states where there was no constitutional problem mayors arvued that it would be impossible to adopt further reductions in city revenues already cut by tax referendums 8 thrust of the bill there was general concern that the goals of the enterprise zone would not be achieved by the package of incentives in the bill certain minority and neighborhood organizations in parti cular feared that although the zones probably would lead to increased economic activity local people would be passed over in the process there was also some concern that residents and even existing small businesses would be displaced by newcomers if the purpose of enterprise zones is to stimulate the creation of local entrepreneurs and to help poor inner city residents it was argued then the incentives must be aimed at small businesses similarly the emphasis should be on reducing the disincentives that persuade unskilled inner city people to stay on the welfare rolls rather than taking entry level jobs the ente7rise zone in other words should provide a trickle up mechanism in depressed neighborhoods a second reservation often expressed about the broad thrust of the bill concerned the question of relocation while some advocates of the enterprise zone seemed unconcerned where new jobs might come from providing they came to the inner cities others maintained that the approach could only be justified if it led to new economic activity it should not be a mechanism to realloc a fe economic activity it was argued but to expand it in the cities like those emphasizing the importance of local activi y people who took this position stressed the need to have incentives which would lead to new entrepreneurs entering into the market rather than incentite s which would cause businesses to move to the inner cities me urban jobs and enterprise zone act of 1981 many of the criticisms of the 1980 bill were accepted by its sponsors and led them to refashion the measure the modified bill was introduced in the house h r 3824 and senate s 1310 on june 3 1981 the house bill was referred to the committee on ways and means although elements touching on other federal programs were also referred to the committee on banking finance and urban affairs the senate bill was referred to the committee on finance the principle co sponsors were once again kemp and garcia in the house and boschwitz and chafee in the senate the bill has impressive support national urban league president vernon jordan joined the co sponsors at their june press conference introducing the new legislation in addition the naacp the national urban coalition the national league of cities and many other organizations ha e endorsed the enterprise zone concept congressional support for the new bill has been growing the measure picked up sixty one house co sponsors within one month the forty five republican co sponsors include house leaders bob michel r ill and trent lott r miss the demo cratic support is particularly impressive garcia is joined by fellow bronx member mario biaggi black caucus members gus hawkins d cal and bill gray d pa are also co sponsoring the measure the senate bill collected fifteen republican co sponsors in the first month but only one democrat quentin burdick d nd provisions of the bill 1 designation a method of designation the initiating body must be a state government or possession or a local government if the state applies on behalf of a local government the latter must consent to the application the governor of a state may block a local application within twenty one days the secretary of hud after consultation with the secretaries of commerce labor and the treasury and the administrator of the small business administration may approve applications for zones in eligible areas the designation would last until the year 2001 designations may be made by the hud secretary until 1996 but in the first three years of the program no more than twenty five zones and no fewer than ten may be made in any one year the bill requires the secretary o give priority to areas with the highest levels of economic distress areas in which state and local government is making the greatest effort to remove impediments to job creation see local commitment and areas which have the widest support from the government seeking designation the community residents local businesses and private organizations especially in meeting local commitment b eligibili to be eligible for designation as an enterprise zone an area must be characterized by pervasive poverty unemployment and general distress sites must meet the eligibility require ments of the urban development action grant program including pockets of poverty designed for poor neighborhoods within generally prosperous neigh orhoods the areas must also meet at least one of the following criteria of distress unemployment for the most recent eighteen month period is at least one and a half times the national average at least 20 percent of the population is living in poverty as defined by the bureau of census at least 70 percent of area residents have incomes below 80 percent of the median income for the area as a whole all census tracts within the area suffered at least a 10 percent decrease in population between 1970 and 1980 and are characterized by chronic abandonment or substantial property tax arrearages to be eligible the area must contain at least 4 000 people at the time of the most recent census if it is within a metropol itan area of 50 000 or more or 2 500 in any other case or be an indian reservation 2 local commitment the government seeking the enterprise zone designation must also agree in writing to follow a course of action designed to reduce the various burdens borne by employers and employees in the area this local commitment may involve the participation of private and or public entities and may include the use of federal programs the bill suggests the following reductions in tax rates or fees improvements in local services streamlining of business and employment regulations commitments from private entities to provide training and other assistance for zone residents the hud secretary may revoke the enterprise zone designation if he determines that the applicant government has not substantial ly complied with the local commitment this is the only circum stances in which the designation may be terminated prior to the date specified in the bill 3 federal commitment the hud secretary is directed to expedite and coordinate all federal housing deyelopmentl financial assistance and employee training programs within the zone the federal government must also disregard any reduction in taxes resulting from the local commitment in determining the eligibility of the state or local government for federal assistance programs 4 sense of congress provisions the bill states that it is the sense of congress that local governments should attempt to facilitate to the greatest extent possible the employment of poor and unemployed zone residents but in choosing the sites for consideration the impact of an enterprise zone on neighboring areas should be examined the irs is urged to simplify the administration and enforce ment of the tax incentives contained in the bill the foreign trade zone board is also urged to expedite applications for foreign trade zones within enterprise zones and to take into account future development likely to result from enterprise zone incentives in determining the economic viability of the site under consideration for foreign trade zone status 5 tax incentives a refundable credits for employers and em2loyees an employer may take a tax credit equal to 5 percent of the wages paid to a qualified employee a qualified employee is defined as a ceta eligible person who performs at least 50 percent of his service within an enterprise zone the credit is refundable if the total credit exceeds the employer s tax liability any employee of a qualified business may also take a credit against his or her personal federal income tax equal to 5 percent of the income received from services performed for the business within an enterprise zone the credit is limited to 1 500 in any taxable year and only covers the first 36 months of employment like the employer s credit it is refundable b capital gains corporations and non corporate taxpayers taxpayers are not required to pay any capital gains tax on tangible property installed after an enterprise zone is designated providing the property has been used for business purposes such property would include an interest in a qualified business and both new and substantially rehabilitated low income rental housing the exemption from capital gains tax extends to the first sale or exchange made after the zone designation ends capital gains on such p not be taken into account as a preference for assessing minimum tax c taxation of business income a 50 percent tax allowance is available to any qualified business for income received within a zone the same allowance is available for any income rece3 ved by any taxp yer from loans mortgag s and other financing provided to a qualified business for business purposes within the zone the full 50 percent allowance will operate only until the year 1997 after which date it is to be reduced in increments of 10 percent until it is phased out by 2001 6 other financial incentives a q ialified business may use the cash method of computing taxable income providing its total receipts do not exceed 2 million in the tax year the bill also specifies that new and rehabilitated low income rental housing in an enterprise zone is eligible for investment credits 7 regulatory flexibility a qualified business is to be considered as a small entity for the purposes of the regulatory flexibility act a not for profit enterprise operating within an enterprise zone would be treated in the same manner rules affecting the administration 4 a qualified business is defined as a business in which at least 50 percent of gross receipts come from trade within an enterprise zone and at least 40 percent of new hirings are qualified employees in the case of a firm already in existence the business will be considered as a qualified business only if the average number of full time employees for the taxable year is at least 10 percent greater than for the year immediately before the area s designation as an enterprise zone 10 of an enterprise zone will also be subject to the regulatory flexibility act comment general the 1981 urban jobs and enterprise zone act is a substantial modification and improvement of the 1980 bill it does much to meet the criticisms raised against the earlier measure the new bill lays much greater stress on smal 1 business development within the enterprise zones and breaks entirely new ground in providing a means for streamlining both federal and local regulation a much greater emphasis on the provision of low income housing can also be seen in the new bill designation the 1981 bill differs in important ways from its predecessor concerning the selection of sites the designating authority has been moved from commerce to hud and the secretary of hud has been given the task of coordinating other federal programs within the zones these changes reflect the fear expressed by some that the enterprise zone might become a replacement for other programs rather than a supplement to them the 1981 bill also seeks to extend the enterprise zone mechanism to small towns rather than restricting it in practice to large urban areas states and local governments are also brought more into the picture than was true in the 1980 version this indicates a greater emphasis on the idua of ente prise zones as a local program and conforms with the administration s strategy of devolving development planning as far as possible to the states through such means as the block grant system the limit on the number of zones which can be designated in any one year is an extremely important change even some of the most enthusiastic supporters of the enterprise zone concept have become concerned that what is still a very experimental approach to inner city revitalization has gradually acquired the status of the urban policy of the 1980s and the panacea for all urban ills th might be added that the reason for this situation stems largely from the lack of alternative urban initiatives a limit on the number of designations has the advantage that the incentives may be examined very closely in the first set of cities before they are applied more extensively this limit and priority s stem should also ensure that the cities acquiring the zones will be those prepared to do most at the local level to help the enterprise zone idea to succeed there is a negative aspect to the limitation on numbers however when compared with the automatic designation process in the earlier version critics will no doubt charge that hud discretion only opens the door to political pressures and favori tism while this problem cannot be eliminated it obviously must be addressed the local commitment the property tax reduction required by the 1980 bill has given way to a new provision requiring state and local governments to put together a package of changes within the zone designed to encourage enterprise and development this is another very important feature of the 1981 measure and removes a major criti cism of the previous bill it allows local flexibility and should stimulate innovative mechanisms by local g9vernments it also further emphasizes that the enterprise zone is very much a local device for revitalization not a blueprint from washington the bill awards priority in selection to areas where the local government can demonstrate strong neighborhood support for a zone community support is crucial to the success of an enter prise zone one cannot achieve development based on grassroots organizations and entrepreneurs if there is no enthusiam for the approach in the neighborhood the bill correctly stresses this only by motivating and mobilizing a community will the trickle up process embodied in the concept be achieved an enterprise zone contract although the local commitment must be in writing there is no provision in the bill for it to be modified in the light of experience an improvement might be to require the federal government and the state and local governments involved in any 2one to draw up a formal e terprise zone contract specifying the agreed local commitment and the federal programs and projects which would be provided in the zone the contract could be modified during the lifetime of the zone but only by the agreement of all parties such a contract could lead to additional incen tives being offered by both sides the federal government for example might offer to test a new housing or development program in the zone if the local government agreed to a greater relaxation in its housing regulations or if it would contract out city services to neighborhood groups in short the enterprise zone contract could become a vehicle for innovative ideas to be tried out with the agreement of all concerned the business tax incentives the tax incentives in the bill represent a significant shift from devices that would encourage branching by larger firms to incentives which are more likely to meet the needs of new indepen dent businesses small firms of this kind generally pay very little tax and find access to capital a bigger obstacle than their tax burden the bill seeks to improve the flow of finance to these new companies by the elimination of capital gains on 12 investments made in such firms and by the 50 percent allowance on income from loans made to the businesses it remains to be seen whether this will be sufficient to overcome the risk and other disincentives accompanying investment in small inner city firms but the provision is based upon the valid assumption that the best method of encouraging he growth of new firms in depressed areas as elsewhere is to provide incentives for investors rather than tax breaks for the firms themselves no limit is placed on the tax saving that can be obtained under the capital gains tax or the 50 percent allowance this is a shortcoming enormous tax savings would be possible under the provision if it remains in the final legislation it is likely that paper companies will form sharing large profits channeled from corporations outside the zone without some limit on the total investment that would be eligible for these generous conces sions the enterprise zones could offer considerable opportunities for corporate accountants and yet have little impact on the poor the tax incentives in the bill might be improved considerably by incorporating a measure suggested by senators heinz r pa and riegle d mich in their urban and rural revitalization act of 1981 s 1240 introduced in may the heinz riegle bill would change the rules covering subchapter s corporations by expanding the number of persons who could be shareholders of such corporations in depressed areas from 15 to 100 subchapter s corporations can pass through tax benefits and operating losses to their investors who may then utilize them for tax saving purposes the investors are treated as shareholders yet retain the advantages of limited personal liability given the low tax burden common in new firms subchapter s treatment would make these firms moke attractive to investors who were seeking ways of reducing their tax burden rather than obtaini g immediate income the greater number of investors permissible unaer heinz riegle mig t also stimulate more investment in local firms by zone residents with modest savings and could encourage employee stock ownership plans esops the new enterprise zone bill drops the three year straight line depreciation allowance for capital equipment that was a feature of the 1980 bill although some critics argued that the allowance was too strong others now contend that removing it completely may go too far in the other direction there are many such as ed logue director of new york s south bronx develop ment office who fear that if the 10 5 3 depreciation system passes congress something will be necessary o offset the even greater encouragement there will then be for inner city businesses to leave for new suburban sites while there is merit to this argument the emphasis on small new firms in the enterprise zone concept does mean that the other tax mechanisms in the 1981 bill are likely to be more important than a depreciation allowance in considering deprecia tion as an element in an amended bill it would be sensible to 13 examine the idea of congressman henry nowak d ny contained in his jobs expansion and urban development act h r 390 nowak s bill would increase the amount of used machinery and rehabilitated buildings eligible for an investment eax credit not only would this be particularly useful for small businesses with limited apital but it would also provide a greater inducement for new inner city entrepreneurs to acquire facilities abandoned or being sold by companies moving out of the city refundable employer and employee tax credits a refundable tax credit for employing ceta eligible workers is an improvement on the social security tax reduction in the earlier bill although it is not without its shortcomings the credit would offset at least part of the disincentive of the payroll tax and would target the kind of person the enterprise zone seeks to assist the refundable nature of the credit would extend its effect to new companies with small tax burdens since the credit is merely a reduction in payroll tax payable it does not constitute a new outlay by the government even when a firm receives a refund it is only the reimbursement of tax already taken the social security tax reduction in the 1980 bill was however simpler and easier to administer than the new provision furthermore experience with the targeted jobs tax credit suggests that small companies are reluctant to deal with all the red tape needed to obtain employment tax credits the credit available for employees is an important step towards reducing the effect of the poverty trap because certain welfare benefits are withdrawn when a recipient obtains paid employment the worker faces in effect a much higher rate of tax than the normal income tax in some cases the worker actually faces a net reduction in after tax income by taking a low p id job the credit will not eliminate this effect but it will improve the situation and so make paid employment a little more attractive for those on welfare qualified businesses in order to obtain the most important tax incentives a business must show that at least 40 percent of its new employees are ceta eligible workers this is certainly an improvement on the 1980 bill in that it targets the requirement more effective ly and will allow low skilled people to benefit from the zone even if they do not live there the problem with the new requirement is that although the paperwork necessary may impose only a small burden for major corporations it may be just the kind of restriction which would stifle a new firm in its early days if a printer decided to start a business in an enterprise zone and hire three people for 14 instance he would need to ensure that two of them were ceta eligibles to be treated as a qualified business irrespective of skills he needed to get the printing firm established when a business is very small a precise range of skills is often neces sary when it begins to grow it can build on this nucleus and hire less skilled employees in order to combine the goal of creating jobs for low skilled people with that of reducing the obstacles to small business start ups so that they can employ such people it would be sensible to place a minimum workforce size for the ceta requirement if a business had fewer than five employees for example it should be considered as a qualified business without a certain proportion having to be ceta eligibles the 40 percent req irement should only come into play for workers hired beyond the minimum foreign trade zones the foreign trade zone provision in the 1980 bill has been retained it would encourage the foreign trade zone board to consider future development likely to result from an enterprise zone as well as the current situation when evaluating an applica tion for a trade zone the sponsors see foreigi trade zones as potential cores of economic activity in appropriate enterprise zones around which a local economy could develop foreign trade zones around the world have been remarkably successful in stimulating growth in this way hong kong and taiwan are examples of what can be achieved within a foreign trade zone imported goods are not liable for customs duties until they leave the zone for the domestic market and they are totally exempt if they are re exported in addition goods which are assembled or finished within the zone are relieved of duty on the added value this makes the foreign trade zone very attractive to foreign suppliers of goods who have an incentive to establish assembly plants hiring local workers in order to escape part of the customs duties since assembly plants tend to offer a high proportion of jobs for low skilled workers they are particularly suitable for depressed urban neighborhoods regulation a major criticism levelled against the 1980 bill was that it failed to include any mechanism to reduce the burden of regulation on businesses and organizations in an enterprise zone yet many people feared that the relaxation of regulation would mean an unacceptable reduction in safety and other protections for those working and living in the zones defining enterprise zones as small entities under the terms of the 1980 regulatory flexibility act p l 96 354 would 15 seem to be an effective method of relieving unreasonable regulation without in any way removing protections desired by congress the act which was passed with strong bi partisan support recognizes in its preamble that laws and regulation designed for application to large scale entities have been applied uniformly to small businesses small organizations and small governmental jurisdictions even though the problems that gave rise to goverment action may not have been caused by those small entities the failure to recognize differences in scale and resources of regulated entities has in numerous instances adversely affected competition in the market place discouraged innovation and restricted improvement in productivity the law goes on to argue that in the case of such small entities alternative regulatory approaches which do not conflict with the state objectives of applicable statutes may be available which minimize the significant economic impact of rules on small business small organizations and small governmental jurisdictions if a proposed regulation is considered to have a significant economic impact on a number of small entities the agency is required to seek an alternative regulation or grant an exemption for the small entities p oviding oe objective of the relevant statute is observed agencies are given ten years to carry out the same procedure for existing regulations treating enterprise zones and the qualified businesses and non profit organizations within them as small entities means that if the economic development of an enterprise zone is adverse ly affected by an existing or proposed regulation the agency will have to make every effort to find some alternative rule which would accomplish the intent of congress the regulatory flexibility act has not been on the statute book long enough for any judgment to be made regarding its effec tiveness but it appears to be the best mechanism available for relieving businesses and organizations in an enterprise zone from many of the regulatory burdens which stifle rather than protect in conjunction with the required local commitment it should help to remove the rules which are irrelevant to conditions in the blighted inner city conclusion the 1981 urban jobs and enterprise zone act is a significant improvement on the 1980 version of the enterprise zone and would 16 seem to be an effective piece of legislation to establish enter prise zones in the united states the bill deals with most of the objections raised against its predecessor and has helped to widen the coalition supporting the concept the emphasis on small business and regulation should win support for the bill among the inner city entrepreneurs and neighborhood organizations whose talents the enterprise zone seek to encourage the important role of state and local governments is appreci ated in the bill and the measure is compatible with the admini stration s view of federalism with only minor amendments the bill should dispel many of the fears of liberal and minority organizations that the enterprise zones may become a tax shelter for big business where the benefits to the community would be confined to a trickle down effect while the 1981 enterprise zone bill may have its defects it is nevertheless a bold attempt to set in motion a genuine trickle up process in the depressed inner cities stuart m butler ph d policy analyst

tanaya macheel morgan stanley says the earnings boost banks get from higher interest rates is fading big u s banks will benefit as the federal reserve continues to raise interest rates to fight inflation but that boost is fading according to morgan stanley analysts led by betsy graseck lenders typically enjoy fatter margins in a rising rate environment as they charge borrowers higher rates for loans while raising the rates they pay to depositors more slowly but increasing funding costs and moves by corporate officers to purchase longer duration securities in the third quarter has made the industry less sensitive to higher rates graseck said monday in a research note that means the incremental benefit to 2023 earnings from a 50 basis point rate increase has fallen in the third quarter from the previous period for nearly all the banks in her coverage universe graseck wrote while the median bank would ve seen a 2 5 pop to 2023 eps from a half point rate increase previously it would now post a 1 5 increase morgan stanley said citing the companies third quarter regulatory filings investors expect the fed to hike interest rates at the central bank s december meeting still the biggest beneficiaries to higher rates include bank of america and silvergate capital graseck wrote bank of america in particular has been named by many analysts as a pick for its ability to grow earnings as rates rise hugh son s p 500 has lost its valuation appeal again rbc s calvasina says last week s better than expected cpi print emboldened the bulls said rbc capital markets head of u s equity strategy lori calvasina said in a monday note while that s generally constructive for equities as it signals the fed may stop hiking interest rates sooner rather than later there are a few caveats one thing we don t like is that the s p 500 has lost its valuation appeal again said calvasina following last week s bounce s p 500 p es are near average on consensus eps and a bit above average on rbc s eps forecasts not frothy but lacking the appeal we had started to see around the october lows she also doesn t like the potential for the fed to turn hawkish again and say they plan to keep financial conditions tight that rhetoric even in the context of a debate between hawks and doves likely adds to stock market volatility in the months ahead she said while cooling inflation is a good thing what it means for u s equities broadly is a bit more complicated the main thing we ve been communicating to investors on this point lately is that moderating inflation is a headwind for s p 500 eps due to its correlation with revenues but should still allow for some modest p e expansion in the year ahead based on our analysis of the relationship between interest rates inflation and s p 500 p es dating back to the 1970s she said moderating inflation seems likely to be accompanied by lower us equity exposure but higher levels of inflation relative to recent history may serve to prop that positioning up if that is what ends up occurring she added carmen reinicke megacap tech lost their mojo goldman s kostin says megacap technology stocks which had led the last decade long bull market might have lost their mojo according to david kostin goldman sachs head of u s equity strategy the characteristic most associated with big tech stocks superior sales growth has vanished at

market rally we have all the short term gauges are pointing higher and long term gauges still point lower she told cnbc s squawk box monday there s not a lot of breakouts with this move what we ve had here is a macro shift that s driven this relief rally she added it was really similar to what happened over the summertime where we saw the s p 500 peak in mid august the 10 year treasury yields had been correcting ahead of that peak for several weeks we re probably in store for something similar this time around where the s p 500 will peak on the back of a short term low in treasury yields and i don t think we ve had that low yet as stocks posted a winning week cryptocurrencies crashed stockton said there s a major breakdown that would be confirmed if bitcoin closes below 18 300 this week with the next support level after that being below 13 900 she added that while it s easy to make a case for that breakdown now there are signs of downside exhaustion we haven t seen in some time those signs would support a rebound of nine weeks or so for cryptocurrencies she said whether that allows bitcoin to avoid its confirmed breakdown we re not sure but it would be a welcome relief rally and

to already high valuation citi is warning bank of america has little room to grow even though it s a defensive pick amid economic volatility analyst keith horowitz downgraded the bank stock citing its premium valuation that will make seeing a notable upside difficult bac is a high quality franchise that is executing well and may be a good defensive holding in light of upcoming economic and market

need to obtain terminals from spacex to access it spacex developed starlink with the goal of providing high speed internet connectivity to people in locations poorly served or not served at all by

musk s rocky takeover companies including general motors audi volkswagen general mills pfizer united airlines and others have paused their ad spending on twitter for the time being responding in part to an onslaught of hate speech and misinformation on the platform advertising giant interpublic group recommended that clients of its agencies do the same twitter previously derived around 90 of its

twitter s digital ad business was slowly recovering from the pandemic but the company posted a us221 million loss last year a period when other digital ad behemoths google and facebook had record earnings the company has not been profitable in eight out of the last 10 years why did musk get involved with twitter musk s interest in twitter originates from the fact he is clearly addicted to the website like trump before he was banned musk tweets a lot their shared love of tweeting is perhaps because both men get a notable thrill out of trolling opponents with putdowns and generating headlines with provocations musk is also close with dorsey who has become critical of what the company has become since departing late last year musk says he got involved to help humanity improve free speech free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy and twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated he said this year musk may have honourable motives but the world s richest man also clearly sensed a target in april he had built a 9 2 per cent stake in the company in secret becoming the largest shareholder the majority of musk s wealth comes from owning a 14 per cent share in tesla and a large stake in space and satellite company spacex which remains private according to estimates musk is the wealthiest person in the world ahead of amazon s jeff bezos when musk s large position in twitter was disclosed the company s new ceo parag agrawal invited musk to join the board advertisement over the following days musk began discussing changes to the company with agrawal and twitter s executives those talks broke down over key issues particularly the company s content moderation policies which musk believed were too heavy handed he also believed the company did not have a hold on the spam and fake account problem seemingly frustrated and buoyed by the share price of tesla musk lobbed a hostile bid to buy all of twitter for us43 billion which was a 38 per cent premium at 54 20 per share the entrepreneur had lined up us13 billion in debt financing with banks secured against twitter committed himself to selling tesla shares and also found large financial commitments from wealthy friends and associates who would take equity stakes in the proposed private twitter agrawal and the twitter board accepted the offer with musk signing a binding merger agreement in april why did musk sue twitter then global markets tanked surging inflation caused central banks to lift interest rates large tech stocks particularly those in the same business as twitter such as the photo and messaging company snapchat fell sharply sensing he would now be drastically overpaying for the company musk tried to get out of the deal declaring the agreement worthless in june twitter took the unusual step of suing musk to complete the deal at the agreed price tag of us44 billion that set the stage for a bewildering legal fight between musk and twitter which was suing someone to force them into buying the company they no longer wanted any part of advertisement musk s lawyers tried to argue he was deceived by the company s executives particularly when it came to the number of bots on the website but legal circles noted musk had signed the agreement without doing any due diligence and faced an uphill battle at a subsequent trial in a delaware court before being deposed by twitter s lawyers musk relented he agreed to buy the company and walked into twitter s san francisco hq holding a sink let that sink in he later joked referring to a popular meme on twitter what changes has musk already made musk s most immediate changes to twitter involve making deep cuts to the company s workforce only days after entering the building with several of his associates musk began sacking employees and there are fears up to half of twitter s 7500 global staff could lose their jobs he dismissed the company s board and fired agrawal and other top leaders in a move intended to wipe out pending compensation for those executives deep cuts were also made to teams working on content moderation legal and communications elon musk arrives at twitter s san francisco headquarters carrying a sink twitter one source said the job cuts appeared to be focused on areas which were bugbears for the new owner suggesting the layoffs were pretty vindictive many of the most significant changes that musk intends to make to the twitter product remain in the works central to musk s twitter is charging us8 per month to be verified and get an infamous blue tick which looks set to be rolled out in the coming months he claims the verification changes will be key to fighting the problem of bots and fake accounts that pollute twitter he also tweeted that giving anyone the chance to get a blue tick would give power to the people and better prominence on the website but critics fear the strategy will fracture the website among those who can and cannot pay for verification advertisement how will twitter make money twitter s main source of revenue continues to be selling digital advertising before musk bought the company twitter made us5 billion in revenue selling promoted space to companies looking to advertise according to a pitch document musk intends to cut the company s reliance on advertising with the aforementioned subscription revenue and bold proposals around increasing users and charging for video uploads musk also plans to allow users to make payments through the website he has already alienated some of the company s advertisers with his actions since taking over two weeks ago he has lashed out at companies which have pulled back on spending tweeting that he would name and shame those who he believed were bowing to pressure from activists but musk will need to boost revenue his interest payments alone on the debt loaded onto the company are about us 1 billion a year can musk turn twitter into a super app ever wanted to post a picture about your meal snapchat text your friends whatsapp hail a ride uber or make a purchase paypal all without leaving the one app well broadly speaking that could be part of musk s ultimate goal to turn twitter into what s known as a super app the term refers to a category of app that can undertake many tasks usually completed by many super apps are already popular in parts of asia particularly in some countries where government and regulation are strict and access to a swathe of apps is non existent or restricted in china for example google play store is banned so wechat which has more than 1 2 billion users has integrated third party services into its app that don t need to be downloaded that allow people to post messages text friends make purchases and send money musk has said the acquisition of twitter was part of his grander vision of creating a super app in western markets advertisement it s a pretty grand vision and of course that could be started from scratch but i think twitter would accelerate that by three to five years he said in august musk already owns the naming rights for x com the name for his payments company which later merged with another firm and became paypal verifying user s identities might be the first step for musk to turn twitter into x the super app but the polarising new owner will need to convince existing users not to give up on the website or seek out alternatives musk s grand plans to turn twitter into a super app by integrating speech communication and money into one app will also likely face resistance from politicians and antitrust regulators in the us where there are growing concerns about needing to rein in tech giants that already dominate the market in any case with advertisers fleeing the platform and bank loans needing to be repaid musk s first steps will probably focus on keeping the lights on

introduction buying a smartphone is simple you weigh the features against the price and try to find the best value at least that s how reasonable buyers do it looking at the phone s specs goes a long way but it s far from the full story there s more to consider like hmd s 3 3 3 promise for the nokia smartphone lineup that s three years of os updates 3 years of security patches and 3 years of warranty that certainly enhances a phone s value if you plan on sticking with it for a few years some buyers would even rate it higher than a 108mp camera or 5 000mah battery nokia s name still carries a certain weight with buyers especially those in europe some people open amazon type in nokia and get busy ordering those people would be happy with the nokia g60 because it s a solid phone with an okay price and the aforementioned stellar software support but we re different here at gsmarena we re the types to do thorough analysis and compose buyer s guides to help those reasonable people get the best deal and we ll have our say before this hands on is done let s first look at the nokia g60 key specs nokia g60 specs at a glance body 166 0x75 9x8 6mm 190g glass front gorilla

increasingly busy segment around the 300 price point most of its competitors pack larger batteries chargers in the box not to mention fast ones amoled displays better secondary cameras and sometimes more capable chipsets nokia tries to counter the specs inferiority with stock android software the promise of better support and a focus on reducing the carbon footprint the g60 comes in a box made of recycled paper while the phone uses recycled plastic the back panel is 100 recycled while the frame is 60 this will matter to some buyers and surely to the planet but they only matter if the final product is any good so let s have a look design and handling nokia is very serious about its environmental footprint so it ships the g60 in a fully recycled box with a usb cable and no charger the box itself features placeholders for other accessories and nokia ships the g60 with a 20w charger in certain markets the nokia g60 is a conventional looking device that s big but not huge it has a 6 58 inch 1080p ips display complete with an adaptive 120hz refresh rate which means it will toggle the maximum 120hz when you interact with the display and go back down to 60hz when it s idle videos are automatically capped at 60hz while webpages are refreshed at 120hz while you re touching the screen the panel is nicely sharp at 401ppi and retains most of its legibility when looked at from an angle colors are vivid and there is a great amount of contrast for an lcd the panel has a blueish tint out of the box but there s a white balance slider that ll make things right when pushed to the warm side the appropriate amount at 390 nits the display is sufficiently bright if far from blinding there s an additional boost in auto mode that pushes the panel to 440 nits in direct sunlight the glass atop the display is gorilla glass 5 while the 8mp selfie camera sits on a waterdrop notch the casing of the nokia g60 is plastic the frame which is made out of 60 recycled plastic is flat and grippy there s a two stage volume button on the right with a power button with a built in fingerprint scanner underneath the capacitive reader is snappy and without issues the only thing worth mentioning is the tedious setup process there are only so many ways i can twist my thumb for you g60 the phone is ip52 rated which means it s nearly dust tight and can deal with rain moving on to the left side of the phone there s a hybrid dual sim and microsd card slot which means you can have two cards at a time the left side and the sim slot there s a secondary microphone on the top while on the bottom of the g60 there s a usb c port flanked by the 3 5mm headphone jack and the only speaker the rear panel is made of fully recycled plastic nokia has added a tactile blotchy texture to the rear panel to perhaps solidify the feeling that you re being good to nature but it makes the phone feel better and different the back is also where you ll find the main cameras the main wide camera has a 50mp sensor and an f 1 8 lens while the 5mp ultrawide unit has an f 2 2 lens and fixed focus there s a 2mp f 2 4 depth sensor and an led flash the nokia g60 feels balanced in the hand it s not too heavy at 190g and the flat frame doesn t dig into the hand near stock android 12 the nokia g60 runs a relatively unmodified version of android 12 with a now old august security patch not exactly impressive given the 3 years of security updates promise the nokia g60 packs a snapdragon 695 chipset with 6gb of ram the device runs well with little to no hiccups and slowdown in fact we feel that the nokia g60 runs considerably smoother than other snapdragon 695 powered handsets with custom android skins the ui and overall appearance are close to stock android that includes the new pill shaped quick toggles in the notification shade and once again it does not include the toggle for automatic brightness and you have to dig deep into the settings menu to enable or disable the feature no change in the recent apps menu that displays apps in a carousel formation and no change in the app drawer as well the iconography in the general settings menu has been revamped though so it might take some time to get used to performance compared to the snapdragon 690 the 695 has newer more powerful cpu cores and gpu the chip boasts 5g and is based on a reasonably modern 6nm manufacturing process by tsmc the main two kryo 560 gold cortex a77 cores are replaced with kryo 660 gold cortex a78 cores clocked at 2 2 ghz while the six energy efficient kryo 560 silver cortex a55 clocked at 1 7 ghz remain the same there s only a change in the name now called kryo 660 silver the adreno 619l gpu has been replaced with a regular adreno 619 the sd695 now supports faster lpddr4x memory at 2133 mhz as well we ve pitted the nokia g60 against a bevy of similarly priced opponents with chipsets ranging from the snapdragon 778g the mediatek dimensity 920 900 and the exynos 1280 in the g60 the snapdragon 695 posted

respectable 4 500mah battery some of its rivals have 5 000mah batteries but the endurance we got from the g60 doesn t really warrant worry we have just the onscreen tests in our hands on review the nokia g60 scored 12 50 hours of constant video playback and exactly 18 00 hours of web browsing one solid and one excellent result respectively the phone locks its refresh rate at 60hz when you watch a video or browse the web so the 120hz maximum refresh rate didn t really make an impact on endurance camera the nokia g60 packs three cameras on the back a 50mp main camera with 1 4µm pixels after 4 to 1 binning and an f 1 8 lens a 5mp f 2 2 ultrawide without autofocus one of those depth sensors of 2mp resolution and an 8mp fixed focus selfie camera with 1 12µm individual pixels and an f 2 0 lens software wise the nokia g60 brings smarts such as capture fusion for more detailed ultrawide shots dark vision aka night mode and ai portraits aka portrait mode there s tripod mode which will detect if the phone s on a stable surface and let the night mode run a bit longer for a brighter exposure looking at the samples the g60 does a good job of retaining detail boosting contrast and rendering color output is punchy there s a wide dynamic range even if textures are overly sharpened for you get a pleasing modern smartphone look to the shots you could scuff at that oversharpening but you d be wrong if you re a photo purist you d need to reach much deeper in your pockets and get a far more capable hardware perhaps even a dedicated camera main wide camera the hdr is particularly impressive the nokia g60 captured a very wide range of tones and colors even when pointed directly at the sun the main camera does well in contre jour the ultrawide snaps very wide images the good dynamic range carries over but the detail rendition is poor due to the step down in sensor and lens quality ultrawide selfies from the 8mp front camera are excellent for the class if you don t go digging for per pixel detail and just enjoy the photos at fit screen size you ll love the output skin tones are excellent and the focal length is just right for one to two person shots the second image is a portrait mode sample it deepens the contrast in the shadows and has an excellent dynamic range in the background edge detection isn t perfect but it s not the end of the world selfies at night with night mode off the wide camera has a dark and blotchy output the sensor struggles to retain detail and will sometimes lose highlight information while at the same time will crush shadow data as well you should shoot in night mode when the camera suggests it sadly there s no automatic night mode the camera will show an onscreen prompt to suggest night mode which is weird given that there is a setting for an automatic night mode main camera without night mode dedicated night mode shots improve images dramatically there s much more information in the shadows while the highlights get boosted the camera brings back a little information in the extreme highlights point lights and such but still can t quite keep those in check detail is much more refined though there is still some noise in the images a little noise for a lot more resolution and detail is fine by us main camera with night mode the videos on the other hand are terrible they max out at 1080p and the level of detail isn t worthy of that resolution either on a positive note the software does a fine job of stabilizing shaky footage wrap up putting it all together we can say that the nokia g60 is a good phone and it won t cause eventual owners much frustration should you buy it at its original 350 price though we d argue no as at that price the hmd phone just can t match the performance of the rivals from samsung redmi oneplus oppo and motorola good thing then that it s already down to around 310 at which point its competiveness is greatly improved a few alternatives to consider are the samsung galaxy a52s for 325 6 128gb the galaxy a53 for 345 6 128gb the galaxy a33 for 276 6 128gb the galaxy m52 for 296 the redmi note 11 pro 5g for 252 6 128gb the oneplus nord ce 2 for 289 8 128gb the realme 9 pro for 262 6 128gb the realme 9 pro for 306 6 128gb and the moto g82 for 305 6 128gb for context most of those phones come better equipped with at least a charger and in many cases well a case the nokia g60 is a good phone and at its new price it s starting to improve in the value for money department if you value longevity and performance over the best possible camera or screen you should definitely consider it but if you don t plan on sticking with it for the long run you ll certainly find smarter ways to spend your money

so everybody should just take a deep breath and calm down waller said we ve got a ways to go the market will no doubt file all this under he would say that and go about its business indeed the asx 200 rose 0 4 per cent in early trade pushing it well above 7000 points this followed friday s strong lead from wall street where a second day of gains took the s p 500 s two day rally to 6 5 per cent unspoken warning but while fed officials are loath to comment too much on market movements investors would be wise to take note of waller s pointed reference to the market rally that occurred in july which was sparked by comments from fed chairman jerome powell that interest rates were approaching neutral that rally waller said led to a loosening of financial conditions that we were trying not to do and ultimately forced powell to deliver his ultra hawkish speech in jackson hole in august and the fed to continue to ram through four straight 0 75 percentage point rate increases including one earlier this month the unspoken warning to investors was clear if you get too excited now then you ll only make our jobs harder advertisement waller who was nominated by former us president donald trump is also a member of the fed s open market committee that sets the fed s official rate that he was prepared to acknowledge that the fed was too far behind the curve when it started to raise rates in march he also seemed pleased with the way its tightening cycle has gone what s impressed me to no end is that it hasn t broken anything for all the talk of crashing the economy and breaking the financial markets it hasn t done that he said most economists and strategists have decided the peak of us inflation is behind us we ve got to kind of a good level and we got it there fast and we didn t break anything and if we can start seeing some inflation coming down then that ll help guide us on how much faster and how high we have to go on rates of course the fed s efforts haven t broken inflation in any major way either waller said thursday s night 7 7 per cent reading for the us cpi was enormous and reiterated powell s point that the pace of rate increases was now far less important than the ultimate peak of this tightening cycle and how long rates need to stay elevated that s a fascinating question clearly most economists and strategists have decided the peak of us inflation is behind us including bank of america s uber bear michael hartnett but he is less confident of the bull market narrative for 2023 that the fed can be done with rate rises by the middle of next year and start cutting before next christmas advertisement inflation is coming down hartnett says but it will remain above the range we ve seen for the past two decades giving the fed little room to move waller wouldn t give that sort of forward guidance but his message was clear everything still depends on the path of us inflation and it s still far too high

neediest residents at a huge disadvantage in the scramble to find homes standing near an aging unwinterized camper their home at least until spring arthur worster and his partner bryttani ball said they never expected to find themselves without a place to live worster has lived in his grandparents east machias home on and off for 20 years the last few with ball and her two teenage boys after worster s grandfather died the property passed down for generations transferred to another relative who decided to sell while the real estate market was hot although only assessed at 75 044 the home is surrounded by houses selling for as much as 430 000 worster and ball had 45 days to find a new home we re losing everything ball said while watching worster and her sons gather salvaged wood from a demolished garage to begin building a house on worster s empty adjacent lot and it s not just us we found out there are like 20 other people right here in east machias who are dealing with the same thing advertisement officials throughout the county report their housing inventory is almost nil properties at every price range were swept up in the buying frenzy either by new wealthier year round residents escaping congested cities to enjoy the bucolic down east landscape or by locals eager to cash in while prices soared according to realtors affordable houses within reach of middle and lower income buyers are especially hard to find debbie holmes a realtor based in lubec said her sale prices are crazy high one home she sold in 2016 for 285 000 went back on the market this year and sold for 650 000 the lack of affordable homes has stymied an innovative program to provide housing for migrants mano en mano based in milbridge is a not for profit agency providing services to seasonal migrants from as far as haiti and central and south america who harvest wild blueberries in the summer and make wreaths in the winter the program called welcome home down east would allow migrants who have been offered year round work a means of purchasing a home through a five year rent to own agreement underwritten by mano en mano launched as the pandemic struck the plan to buy seven decent starter homes was crippled according to the group s housing director elan gabel richards before you could buy a reasonable home for under 120 000 that was you know not perfect but something you could move into and fairly easily get a loan to purchase said gabel richards now a 90 000 house that s for sale is something that needs to be fully gutted and renovated compounding the problem for buyers and renters alike many of the better homes that were bought during the pandemic sometimes at double the assessed value were converted into vacation and short term rentals a search on apartments com turned up only five rentals in the entire county three of them were tiny efficiency or one bedroom apartments ranging from 800 to 1 600 per month advertised as short term rentals for traveling nurses and professionals machias town manager bill kitchen isn t surprised across the board there s no low cost housing there s no high cost housing there s no middle of the road housing right now kitchen said we have doctors from the hospital who are looking one commutes by airplane the new dean of the university of maine at machias is desperately trying to find a house advertisement after a fruitless search to purchase a house when he was hired last year machias new police chief keith mercier lived for two months in one of the umm student dorm rooms he s since rented a house in cutler another temporary solution until he and his wife can find a house to buy closer to machias in the meantime they ve kept their home in orrington and mercier bounces back and forth on some weekends washington county as a whole really needs to take a hard look and put our heads together to find some sort of solution mercier said it s great if you can attract people here but it s not going to work out so well if they don t have a place to live eastport city manager kate devonshire a massachusetts native who moved down east two years ago wasn t immune either with no rentals in the popular artist enclave and tourist destination a temporary stay at her parents retirement home in downtown eastport has lasted two years and counting i had no intention of staying with my parents devonshire said it s almost like a joke because i m the city manager i m supposed to be out saving the city you know for those who are low income at risk or living on the margins the housing crisis is no joke and much more than an inconvenience in many cases living with relatives isn t an option for a variety of reasons no local family ties not enough room or unhealthy home situations to name a few with few resources many are forced to go it alone if they meet eligibility requirements low income residents can apply for a maine housing authority section 8 housing choice voucher which can pay as much as 70 percent of the monthly rent if that sounds too good to be true unfortunately it is in part due to the housing boom but also because development of low income housing in the county is stagnant advertisement according to the most recent maine housing authority report there are only 42 affordable housing complexes countywide with a total of 56 available units but most units are only open to people who are disabled or over age 62 there were merely seven units open to the general population so far not much has been done to ease the shortage over the last 16 years although mainehousing has backed 326 developments statewide only four new developments were added in washington county and are restricted three are supportive housing facilities earmarked for municipal nonprofit group or tribal use only one is a rental complex and it s on the passamaquoddy reservation available exclusively to tribal citizens in addition to the section 8 program s long waiting list houses must meet federal housing quality standards and rent limits roughly 640 for a one bedroom apartment since participation in the program is voluntary for landlords and demand is so high typical washington county rents have ballooned far above the limits according to charley martin berry executive director for the community caring collaborative a social services support network it s kind of like willy wonka s golden ticket martin berry said even when you move up that list and you have a voucher in hand it s hard to find a place landlords are running businesses and making profitable choices but the consequences for some of the most vulnerable populations can be catastrophic homelessness or worse because washington county doesn t have tent cities or homeless shelters for general use martin berry said the county s homeless are invisible but they are out there couch surfing or in the most dire circumstances living in abandoned buildings and sheds those rent to own sheds are quickly becoming dwellings for people martin berry said and it says right on them this is not a house these are not for habitation but people are absolutely sheltering in them advertisement a row of sheds washington county does have one shelter for domestic violence victims the agency provides victims with temporary shelter historically for three to four months working with them to secure housing vouchers and find permanent housing marcie dean housing director for next step domestic violence project of hancock and washington counties said victims are in the shelter much longer now often twice as long looking for permanent housing landlords just aren t really open to the vouchers from domestic violence victims and they do have that monopoly right now where they can pick and choose kind of who they have as tenants dean said for washington county residents whose livelihoods can t be relocated like those making their living on the down east waters the struggle to find housing is compounded even before an estimated 80 new residents moved in some fishermen in the small coastal town of jonesport had struck out looking for housing in washington county forcing them to commute long distances to work every day that s an extra hardship for lobstermen who begin their days long before sunrise it s also a hardship for the town according to jonesport mayor william milliken because the fishermen take their families when they move away it would be great to be able to house them here milliken said we want their kids we want them raising their families here advertisement faced with few if any viable housing alternatives people throughout the county sometimes throw up their hands and relocate completely experts say the exodus of residents coupled with the arrival of newcomers is one of the best indicators of gentrification a process that can strain resources and alter the character of communities tracking in and out migration since covid has become a priority for county officials who worry about down east s future the sunrise economic council based in machias works across many sectors to create jobs and promote economic growth throughout the county although it can be hard to quantify according to its executive director charles rudelitch it does have some metrics to track out migration rudelitch said that paying attention to those numbers along with other economic indicators will help community leaders fend off the potential pitfalls of gentrification this is my hometown i have a sense of just how much hardship the economic challenges in washington county have created said rudelitch more prosperity i think would be a wonderful thing for the region but a gentrification that s based entirely on investment income from away that doesn t create those same sorts of opportunities here i think that could be highly problematic it could raise the cost of living without providing the means to actually earn more money for the people who live here this story was

the need to start reimagining our systems to face the reality of adaptation in a century of entropy and epochs is greater than ever post growth late stage capitalism demands new ways of being whether we like it or not here are some thoughts case for more artists we need more artists in a post growth late stage capitalism planet rapidly burning let s start investing large sums of money into an artists benefit where artists musicians writers poets dancers sculptors carvers actors are all paid a weekly benefit to produce and make art an explosion of art and people paid to produce it would do more for the depression rates poverty rates inequality rates and pull us away from the never ending economic growth model fantasy than anything else the crisis and emotional damage catastrophic climate change will cause needs art to facilitate and process that socially artists have the capacity to creatively transform and that mental skill set needs urgent capacity upgrade to deal with what is coming an artists benefit would be paid out weekly to enrolled artists who would have to provide proof of their work with minimums in place that would judge the art produced artists are as important as bureaucrats and academics and they should be paid for that cultural and social importance by the state tdb recommends newzengine com kiwi subsidy on kiwi food the lie of neoliberalism is that unregulated markets lead to competitive utopia they don t they lead to an elite corporate oligarchy who ensure their dominance via duopoly or monopoly a plutocratic cartel who amputate monopoly rentals from the economy and call it business the brutal strength of the state is required to step in and break up such cartels when they bubble to the top and that s exactly what the commerce commission must demand in its reports on the supermarket duopoly in nz countdown and foodstuffs about to find out what s in the regulator s trolley countdown and foodstuffs will find out next week whether they may have to sell off some of their stores or change their businesses to help make way for a new supermarket company price controls on some essential items such as fruit and vegetables and cheese might even be on the table consumer nz chief executive jon duffy said the commerce commission is due to publish its draft market study into the 22 billion groceries industry on thursday duffy said it was a no brainer that the regulator would recommend new mandatory rules that will give more rights to food suppliers in their dealings with supermarkets just like we created kiwi bank and should expand it to break up an aussie banking cartel we should force countdown and foodstuffs to sell stores to the government so the government can inject actual competition into the super market industry with a strict policy on local producers getting better prices with staff paid the living wage and customers getting cheaper prices so what if the supermarket duopoly have to share their 22billion annual market with us new zealanders shouldn t we be feeding us let s be clear this isn t socialism this is the state forced to repair capitalism once again by intervening in a broken market farmers get ripped off customers get screwed and staff are run ragged all so australian corporations get to clip the ticket fuck that government should enter into a deal with iwi to stock a new chain of government iwi supermarkets that champion local produce at better prices for the consumer and we need a kiwi subsidy on all local produce to recognize that producers have already used water and created local climate changing gases to create their product and as such consumers have already paid a price just to get the product to their table we should feed the 5million here first before boasting about feeding 40million world wide calls to feed the 5 million first before exporting nz food people are going hungry even though new zealand produces enough food to feed 40 million and it s spurring calls for the country to feed the five million first almost 40 percent of new zealand households experience food insecurity while 19 percent of children live in households that experience food insecurity poverty researcher dr rebekah graham said while working on her thesis on food insecurity she interviewed a woman who walked for 90 minutes each day to get a free community meal a state owned 3rd supermarket chain would do more for providing a cheaper means of living to all kiwis who have food security issues it would do more for welfare than any single pm since savage a state owned supermarket chain that radically forced competition on base level cost of living for a vast swathe of new zealanders would be a legacy worthy of labour we need to be kinder to individuals and crueler to corporations more military if we are serious about an independent foreign policy we have to accept it is going to cost us a lot more i believe that the climate crisis means we need a vastly larger military to cope with civil disasters and if we are attempting to distance ourselves from china and america we need to make a decision to dramatically lift what we spend on the military for purely defensive capacity how would we go about defending the realm of nz and all our economic exclusive zone currently we spend 1 5 of gdp on our entire military to defend the full realm of nz and pursue an independent foreign policy i argue we need to push that up to 3 note nz should only build up its military to defend our full territory nz islands eez ross dependency tokelau cook islands and niue any upgrade of our military is for purely defensive purposes not for military adventure or invasions we can t pull away from america and china and pretend there is no cost to being independent with the climate crisis looming we need that debate now we also have the geopolitics of it with china s attempt at building a forward military base that could cut america off china solomon islands deal china could cut new zealand australia off from us military support professor anne marie brady a chinese politics specialist has called the deal between the solomon islands and china a game changer saying new zealand could be cut off us military support the real danger here is the chinese fishing militia that will use it as a base to raid deep into fisheries we need to protect our fisheries i maintain we must have an independent foreign policy and that our stance must be friend to all enemy to none but we will urgently need to protect what is ours and acknowledge how the climate crisis will demand more civil emergency infrastructure and assets we need a complete review of our defence force and massive increase in spending reimagining a new public service socialism short term the government has to be focused on deflationary spending mid term economically we need radical climate change adaptation long term they need to start navigating a post growth economy the best way to push those values is via the public service culture and processes for essential state service workers like teachers like police like drs like nurses like ambulance and firefighter services we can match the rising inflation in wages but the focus needs to be on expanding capacity expanding state responsibility and expanding quality of work experience it is insane that our ambulance service is privatised and the state should nationalise it immediately as first responders their obligations and responsibilities will only climb as society continues to rock from the shockwaves of covid professional firefighters must be expanded to acknowledge the danger we are under from climate change and fire seasons rather than compete with inflationary wage rises focus on better conditions 11 weeks paid holiday each year 4 day weeks plus housing projects where subsidised rentals are available for houses we also need to start bonding teachers drs and nurses with free education in exchange for bonded work around nz we shouldn t be looking to slash public servants we need more act want to amputate 5 ministry s while luxon is promising to slash 14 000 jobs that is ideological vandalism that s not an actual plan covid showed us the need for a strong state with capacity to step in and with the climate crisis here we will continue to need a strong state with capacity the right s never ending march to amputate and slice down the state is so that the people don t get used to a well functioning public service and so will politically agree to starve it of funds via tax cuts global free market capitalism is dead hyper regionalism is here we need a bigger state with actual capacity rather than the threadbare barely regulated joke that it currently is we shouldn t agree to cutting public services we should fund their capacity and infrastructure rebuild while making the working conditions for those there a better quality where should we get that money windfall taxes on the corporations and banks we need better conditions for those workers and the values of working 4 day weeks extra holidays and housing solutions are aimed at making better working conditions as opposed to never ending inflationary wage pressures we need a sustainable bureaucracy rather than 7 figure technocrats who see their own fiefdoms and glass palaces as the measure of public policy achievements the creation of a ministry of green works is essential for this post growth global warming fortress aotearoa while muldoon s repugnant use of identity politics to divide a nation over rugby will always mark him as an authoritarian thug willing to plunge the nation into the social trauma of mass civil disobedience he was ahead of the curve with think big his economic nationalism was ahead of its time triggered by stagflation and geopolitical shockwaves it parallels the same threats we face now why shouldn t we have our own basic pharmaceutical industry engineering industry industrial industry the supply side shocks caused by covid and war are not going away and they are being compounded by catastrophic climate change the arguments pushed forward by muldoon for think big infrastructure resonate more importantly now than ever before radical adaptation and communal community resourcing alongside a big state approach to lynchpin infrastructure for basic self reliance as an island country facing enormous economic shockwaves is the only means to build the muscle mass to respond to the ever intensifying external disruption of late stage capitalism the need to increase military spending to 3 alongside the new costs for this infrastructure must be funded via new taxes aimed at corporations and banks a financial transaction tax and windfall profit tax would take the yoke of taxation off working people and place it upon the shoulders of the wealthy national and act see mass immigration as a means to create fake growth at a time when we should be focused on de growth climate crisis is here and adaptation is now we need to start rethinking isolationism as a strength and think big as economic sovereignty the geopolitical shock waves are only getting more intense increasingly having independent opinion in a mainstream media environment which mostly echo one another has become more important than ever so if you value having an independent voice going into this pandemic and 2020

about this release this quarterly release covers the supply of renewable fuel for transport in the uk for the 2022 calendar year so far it is based on data available on 10 october 2022 which has been reported under the renewable transport fuel obligation rtfo the data for a given year is not finalised until september the following year suppliers of fuel in 2022 can submit applications up to 14 may 2023 and as such this is a provisional report the final report for 2022 is scheduled for release in november 2023 the rtfo scheme reduces greenhouse gas emissions from transport fuels by setting annual obligations on fuel suppliers to supply sustainable renewable fuels renewable fuels are often blended with conventional fuels such as petrol or diesel but as they come from renewable feedstocks including waste products and residues their overall greenhouse gas emissions are lower when we consider the entire life cycle of the fuel until 2021 to calculate average greenhouse gas ghg savings from renewable fuels we have used the value of 83 8 grams of co2 equivalent per mega joule of energy contained in the fuel gco2eq mj to represent the average figure of fossil fuel starting from 2022 the rtfo ghg methodology has been updated to use 94 gco2eq mj to calculate ghg savings in accordance with the latest evidence the method for calculating the average ghg saving has also been updated from an average across fuel consignments to a weighted average taking account of the volume and energy content of the fuel impact of the coronavirus covid 19 the timeline of this publication series includes periods of coronavirus covid 19 related restrictions as such figures in this release may be affected and should be interpreted with caution main points 2 112 million litres equivalent eq of renewable fuel have been supplied which constitutes 7 of total road and non road mobile machinery fuel for 2022 in the uk certificates have been issued to 881 million litres eq 42 of all renewable fuel so far under the renewable transport fuel obligation see background information of these 881 million litres eq an average greenhouse gas ghg saving of 81 was achieved when compared to fossil fuel use this drops to 77 when indirect land use change iluc is accounted for 12 of all verified renewable fuel supplied to the uk in this period was produced from uk origin feedstocks verified renewable fuel verified renewable fuel refers to fuel that has received rtfcs for having met the sustainability criteria for more see the notes and definitions figure 1 volume of renewable fuel to which certificates have been issued by fuel type table rf_0105a since the 2021 reports the biodiesel category includes biodiesel methyl ester me and off road biodiesel these fuels were reported separately in previous years of the 881 million litres eq of renewable fuel verified so far in 2022 biodiesel comprised 44 of supply and bioethanol 42 there were also small amounts of other renewable fuels for a full list see table rf_0105 published with this report figure 2 what is a renewable fuel figure 3 highlights 2022 below is a summary of the highlights from 2022 so far figure 3 shows renewable fuel made up 7 of total road and non road mobile machinery so far in 2022 of the 2 112 million litres eq of renewable fuels 881 million litres have been verified of renewable fuels 881 million litres have been verified verified renewable fuels achieved an average greenhouse gas saving of 81 biodiesel made up 44 of verified renewable fuel bioethanol made up 42 of verified renewable fuel waste feedstocks made up 63 of verified renewable fuel 87 of biodiesel was produced from used cooking oil uco 64 of bioethanol was produced from corn united kingdom feedstocks made up 12 of verified renewable fuel greenhouse gas ghg savings greenhouse gas ghg savings ghg savings represent the difference in ghg emissions between using renewable fuel as opposed to the conventional fuel they replace indirect land use change iluc relates to the unintended consequences of changing land use for renewable fuel production for example the expansion of crop land for feedstocks driving deforestation elsewhere this reduces the ghg savings from the renewable fuel produced renewable fuels in the uk fuel supply achieved an aggregated greenhouse gas ghg saving of 81 compared to fossil fuels accounting for emissions from indirect land use change iluc reduces this ghg saving to 77 development fuel development fuel specific fuels made from sustainable wastes or residues excluding segregated oils and fats such as used cooking oils and tallow or renewable fuels of non biological origin rfnbos these fuels are awarded two development fuel certificates per litre eq of eligible fuel supplied a specific target for development fuels was introduced from 1 january 2019 this target takes into account the fuel types and the feedstock these fuels include aviation fuel drop in fuels substitute natural gas and hydrogen see notes and definitions the rtfo administrator has verified 718 000 litres eq of development diesel and 633 000 litres eq of development petrol so far in 2022 which are renewable fuels and also

equivalent per mj of energy contained in the fuel gco2eq mj to represent the average figure of fossil fuel starting from 2022 the rtfo ghg methodology has been updated to use 94 gco2eq mj to calculate ghg savings in accordance with the latest evidence the method for calculating the average ghg saving has also been updated from an average across fuel consignments to a weighted average taking account of the volume and energy content of the fuel renewable fuel mix reporting the data reported by fuel suppliers under the rtfo is in line with mass balance rules a mass balance system requires suppliers throughout the supply chain to account for their product on a units in units out basis but does not require physical separation of certified feedstock or fuel from uncertified material it ensures that for every unit of sustainable renewable fuel sold the corresponding amount of sustainable feedstock has been produced this can mean the actual feedstock mix might differ from that reported nonetheless the feedstocks and renewable fuels reported in this document represent those that are incentivised and rewarded under the rtfo obligations under the rtfo sustainability criteria to receive renewable fuel certificates fuels supplied must meet the sustainability criteria set out in the amended renewable transport fuel obligations order 2007 and the rtfo compliance guidance renewable fuel must deliver minimum ghg savings and must not originate from land with high biodiversity value or carbon stock unless stringent criteria are met suppliers of fuel for road and non road mobile machinery for example tractors that supply 450 000 litres equivalent or more per year have an obligation under the rtfo order obligated suppliers may meet their obligation by redeeming renewable transport fuel certificates rtfcs or by paying a fixed sum for each litre of fuel for which they wish to buy out of their obligation rtfcs are gained by supplying sustainable renewable fuels in 2022 such suppliers must redeem rtfcs and development fuel rtfcs drftcs equivalent to 12 6 and 0 9 respectively of the volume of fossil and unsustainable renewable fuel supplied one certificate may be claimed for every

yemi osinbajo s debt for climate swap is a compelling proposition for consideration argues simbo olorunfemi in the last few years the world has begun a more definitive transition from the place of cynicism and misunderstanding about the issue of climate change to that of warmer realisation if not wholesome acceptance of the reality of the phenomenon as a significant threat but then even in the face of a whittling down of opposition against the science of climate change with the pushback against efforts to mitigate it not as fierce as it once was agreeing on a framework with universal acceptance embedded with individual contours has been rather difficult that is not a surprise given the different and often competing realities among countries indeed there is no way the issue of climate change can be addressed on a sustainable basis without putting into the mix the conjoined issues of energy inequity energy poverty and energy access for africa the problem of energy poverty is as important as our climate ambitions energy use is crucial for almost every conceivable aspect of development wealth health nutrition water infrastructure education and life expectancy are significantly related to the consumption of energy per capita prof yemi osinbajo nigeria s vice president argues in august this year the nigerian government launched the energy transition plan to address the issues of climate change and energy poverty having accepted that climate change is a reality and threat to crop productivity with the potential of further worsening unemployment the government commits itself to an urgent plan of action which requires putting an end to energy poverty by 2030 and achieving net zero by 2060 in fact president buhari had committed to this in a statement at cop 26 in glasgow however on the back of that commitment is the realisation that the average 3 billion per year investments in renewable energy recorded for the whole of africa between 2000 and 2020 will certainly not suffice as this is a plan that requires huge resources and funding that cannot come through the regular window the energy transition plan will require an estimated 1 9 trillion in finance which includes 410 billion above business as usual spending to the tune of 10 billion annually till 2060 according to the african development bank afdb africa is not only losing 5 15 capital economic growth but also facing a shortfall in climate finance as africa benefits less than 5 5 of global climate finance between 2016 and 2019 african nations only received around 18 3 billion in climate finance while the industrialised world had promised in 2009 to deliver 100 billion in climate financing to the developing world that pledge has only been redeemed in part yet another gap of about 1 3 trillion has been identified for 2020 2030 it is against the backdrop of the challenges posed by climate change and the obvious finance gap that confronts africa that makes the idea by vice president yemi osinbajo for debt for climate swap a compelling proposition for consideration in a lecture on a just and equitable energy transition for africa he delivered at the center for global development in washington d c usa he made the argument that the issue was not only one of just transition but of two existential crises climate crisis and extreme poverty for that reason whatever plans and commitments made towards carbon neutrality must include clear plans on energy access he argues further to that in order to confront poverty there must be access to energy for consumptive and productive use he says osinbajo spoke to the disparity of energy access between the developed and developing world in graphic terms africa with about 17 of the world s population only generates 4 of the world s electricity whereas the one billion people in sub saharan africa excluding south africa are serviced by an installed capacity of 81 gigawatts the united states has an installed capacity of 1 200 gigawatts to power a population of 331 million people while the united kingdom has 76 gigawatts of installed capacity for its 67 million people the per capita energy capacity in the united kingdom is almost 15 times that in sub saharan africa while developing countries are faced with the constraint of energy poverty striving to increase capacity and improve on energy access to drive industrialization and development they are compelled to take into consideration the demands or expectations that come with mitigating climate change as osinbajo notes in the wider responses to the climate crisis we are not seeing careful consideration and acknowledgement of africa s aspirations for instance despite africa s tremendous energy gap global policies are increasingly constraining africa s energy technology choices in fact there has been advocacy or implementation of policies on limiting public funding for fossil fuel projects in developing countries making no distinction between upstream oil and coal exploration and gas power plants for grid balancing yet in the face of global energy crisis some of the countries in europe have made a move to increase or extend their use of coal fired power generation through 2023 and potentially beyond in disregard or violation of their climate commitments which analysts suggest will raise power sector emissions of the eu by 4 a significant amount given the high base denominator of eu emissions while there is no doubt that every country by virtue of policies and activities has its impact on cumulative global carbon footprints the level of impact is remarkably different from one country to the other it is estimated that about 80 of all emissions in the world come from only 20 countries with africa contributing only 2 3 per cent of the world s carbon dioxide emissions from energy and industrial sources despite the disproportionate nature of carbonization with only minimal carbon footprints generated by less industrialised countries like nigeria the government has launched an ambitious energy transition plan that commits her to the decarbonization of nigeria s energy sources and future with objectives that include lifting 100 million people out of poverty in a decade driving economic growth bringing modern energy services to the full population and managing the expected long term job loss in the oil sector due to global decarbonization whereas there is greater interest on the part of the developing world to contributing their quota in the drive for a carbon free globe there is also the desire to be more involved in the formulation of strategies and transition pathways in line with the objectives of the countries themselves and sustainable development goal 7 which pushes for universal access to clean and affordable energy targets set out in nigeria s intended nationally determined contributions indcs include 20 conditional and 45 unconditional emissions reductions establishment of 13 gw of off grid solar pv an increase in energy efficiency by 30 by 2030 and an end to gas flaring by 2030 there are also measures and strategies to promote reforestation climate smart agriculture to make agriculture a more sustainable and productive venture and the sustainable use of resources through programmes that promote alternative means of livelihood the project also has incorporated within climate adaptation policies and biodiversity conservation however beyond the intentions and commitment on the part of developing countries noble as they might be the question of financing energy transition away from carbon is a sticky one especially within the larger context of the economic condition of the countries made worse by the overwhelming realities of covid 19 as singh and widge note since a greater proportion of these governments now reduced revenues are now dedicated to servicing debt spending towards reviving growth or achieving climate goals will likely take a backseat they propose fiscal headroom for countries caught in such a situation through the mechanism of either debt suspension debt forgiveness or reorientation of debt so that service payments are utilized for a green recovery debt for climate dfc swaps which began to gain currency in the last two years are a type of debt swap in which the debtor nation instead of continuing to make external debt payments in a foreign currency makes payments in local currency to finance climate projects domestically on agreed upon terms dfc swaps can reduce the level of indebtedness as well as free up fiscal resources to be spent on green investments alternatively new debt can be issued by a debtor nation to replace existing debt with a commitment to use proceeds to address climate change through mutually agreed performance linked incentives such as lower interest rates grants carbon offsets to service interest etc the essence of the debt for climate swap is to engender an increase the fiscal space for climate related investments and reduce the debt burden for participating developing countries indeed the idea of debt as a climate change related financing instrument is not new but the argument as presented by vice president osinbajo has enlivened and elevated it his presentation at cgd and subsequent engagement with vice president kamala harris of the united states of america as well as other government officials have pushed up and energised the conversation he has succeeded in placing side by side the twin issues of energy poverty and climate change arguing not only for them to be considered together but for african nations to be more critically engaged in conversations on the global climate future and take ownership of their transition pathways osinbajo specifically argues for africa to fully participate in the global carbon finance market in addition to conventional capital flows both from public and private sources currently direct carbon pricing systems through carbon taxes have largely been concentrated in high and middle income countries however carbon markets can play a significant role in catalyzing sustainable energy deployment by directing private capital into climate action and improve global energy security provide diversified incentive structures especially in developing countries and provide an impetus for clean energy markets when the price economics looks less compelling as is the case today so supporting africa to develop into a global supplier of carbon credits ranging from biodiversity to energy based credits would be a leap forward in aligning carbon pricing and related policy around achieving a just transition there is no doubt about the increasing coincidence of realization on the part of both the developed and developing world that climate change is indeed an existential challenge also there is no doubt about the urgency of the situation and the necessary actions that need to be taken all african countries have signed onto the paris agreement with nigeria and a few other countries in africa having also announced a net zero target in firm commitment to a decarbonized energy future the challenge is with financing climate and clean energy plans for developing countries like nigeria in the face of a climate finance shortfall and the problem of energy poverty that is what makes the osinbajo argument of swapping debt for climate financing a compelling proposition if every country is to be carried along in putting the right foot forward on the decarbonization drive however questions have been raised about the idea is the debt for climate swap deal really a good idea what are the possible challenges how can all concerned be brought together to be on the same page with intended outcomes what about the question of size and structure which countries constitute the target who are the likely creditors to chamon et al because some of the benefits of debt climate swaps accrue to non participating creditors they are generally less efficient forms of support than conditional grants and or broad debt restructuring which could be linked to climate adaptation when the latter significantly reduces credit risk vikram widge believes that a debt swap for climate financing will be more meaningful where there is direct negotiation between borrower and lender taking into consideration that china is a major bilateral official creditor there is not much that can be done with respect to swap arrangements without engaging with china and securing its support to widge to be successful at scale and mobilize significant capital debt for climate swaps should probably focus on countries that are able to service their debt and who in exchange for some reduction forgiveness of the debt as an incentive would be willing to redirect the debt service cash flows into mutually agreed use of proceeds from the swap in this arrangement target countries are likely to be the larger emerging market borrowers that are working toward ambitious climate action plans but need extra help here chamon et al argue that debt climate swaps could be superior to conditional grants when they can be structured in a way that makes the climate commitment de facto senior to debt service and they could be superior to comprehensive debt restructuring in narrow settings when the latter is expected to produce large economic dislocations and the debt climate swap is expected to materially reduce debt risks and achieve debt sustainability furthermore debt climate swaps could be useful to expand fiscal space for climate investment when grants or more comprehensive debt relief are just not on the table it is instructive that more voices are being heard in support of the debt for climate swaps the u n deputy secretary general amina mohammed ahead of the ongoing u n climate change conference in egypt made the point that countries need options to refinance crippling existing debt including debt for climate adaptation swaps where vulnerable countries can reduce their debt stock and free up resources for adaptation the united nations economic and social commission for western asia escwa one of five regional commissions under the jurisdiction of the united nations economic and social council piloting with jordan and other countries has come up with an initiative tying climate with sdgs and debt swap the essence of the initiative is to address the challenge of reducing debt burden improving climate finance and accelerating implementation of the paris agreement and the 2030 agenda also there has emerged a group known as v20 made up of 58 countries nigeria excluded deemed to be the most vulnerable to climate change with only 5 share of global emissions a population of 1 5 billion people and gdp valued at usd 2 4 trillion ahead of cop27 they were considering a plan to stop payment on a combined 685 billion in debt until the international monetary fund imf and the world bank address climate change the way their nations see fit there is no doubt that the idea of a debt for climate swap is no longer one that can be easily waved away indeed there is no denying the grave impact of climate change which sees 15 million people dying annually on account of the poor quality of air from pollution and another five million dying as a result of extreme heat there is the question of future demand for energy compounding the current energy poverty which is a threat to the lives and livelihoods of millions of africans there is also the question of nigeria s methane pledge to end gas flaring and yearning to take more advantage of its gas reserves to meet domestic energy need among other options yet there is the commitment to decarbonization that she has made even in the face of a yawning financing gap the most feasible route to the resolution of these questions some of them contending is to design a template for climate financing via debt swap which will be adopted and adapted to suit the different circumstances across bilateral and multilateral platforms that will serve nigeria and the world well olorunfemi works for hoofbeatdotcom a nigerian

the u s will buy 100 000 rounds of howitzer artillery from south korean manufacturers to provide to ukraine a u s official said thursday in a deal the two governments have been working on for some time the agreement comes as ukrainian leaders press for more weapons and aid to take advantage of a counteroffensive that is pushing russian forces out of some areas they had taken over earlier in the war and it relieves concerns within the u s military particularly the army and the marine corps who are worried that persistent transfers of the pentagon s howitzer ammunition to ukraine are eating into their stockpiles other defense officials confirmed the broad outlines of the contract and said it would help with stockpile pressures specifically involving the howitzer ammunition which ukrainian forces have been using at a high rate last week a defense official briefing reporters said ukraine was burning through as many as 7 000 rounds of ammunition a day while russia was firing as much as 20 000 rounds daily the officials spoke on condition of anonymity because details of the deal had not been made public south korea s defense ministry in a statement acknowledged ongoing talks over exporting an unspecified number of 155 millimeter artillery shells to shore up diminishing u s inventories however the ministry said the negotiations were proceeding under the presumption that the u s would be the end user of those rounds and that seoul maintains its principle of providing only non lethal support to ukraine the south korea agreement provides a sharp counterpoint to u s accusations earlier this month that north korea was covertly shipping artillery to russia it s not immediately clear whether the deal opens the possibility of south and north korean artillery being fired against each other in ukraine north korea has aligned with russia over the war in ukraine while also blaming the united states for the crisis insisting that the west s hegemonic policy has forced russia to take military action to protect its security interests however pyongyang has repeatedly denied u s claims that it has been sending large supplies of artillery shells and other ammunition to russia accusing the biden administration of a smear campaign experts say north korea has the potential to become a major source of munitions for russia considering the interoperability of their weapons systems based on soviet roots they say that the north which has used the distraction created by the war to ramp up missile tests to a record pace could seek to receive in return russian fuel and technology transfers to further advance its military capabilities as it pursues more powerful missiles and nuclear warheads until now south korea had previously limited its support for ukraine to non lethal equipment and supplies in april ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy pressed south korea to provide lethal arms after russia s attack on mariupol seoul s defense ministry confirmed at the time that it had rejected the ukrainian request for anti aircraft weapons citing the south korean government s principle of sending only non lethal aid international security experts have said both north korea and south korea maintain vast stockpiles of ammunition due to the decades long tensions along their heavily fortified and militarized shared border in a statement army lt col marty meiners a pentagon spokesman said the u s government has been in discussions to buy ammunition from south korea s non government defense industrial base the ammunition would not come from south korean military stocks he declined to provide details meiners said any potential sales always take into account the south korean military s readiness and requirements and will not detract from our defensive posture or readiness to respond against regional threats he added that south korea s defense industry regularly sells military equipment and weapons systems to allies and partners including the u s south korea has also inked several recent arms deals with european countries eager to bolster their defenses in the wake of russia s invasion of ukraine including almost 9 billion in multiple contracts with poland to provide f 16 fighter jets training aircraft tanks and howitzers the ammunition deal was first reported by the wall street journal meiners said he could not provide information on how quickly the ammunition could get to ukraine he said the pentagon has regular conversations with south korea and other allies around the world about how best to support ukraine in the war the revelation of the agreement came as russia said it was beginning to withdraw its forces from the key city of kherson ukrainian officials acknowledged moscow s troops had no choice but to flee kherson yet they remained cautious fearing an ambush kherson was the only provincial capital moscow captured after invading ukraine in february a russian withdrawal would mark a serious setback for moscow while giving ukraine a critical launching pad for supplies and troops to aid its effort to win back other lost territory in the south including crimea which moscow seized in 2014 credit

bloomberg rising global borrowing costs are denting the finances of some of the most climate vulnerable countries right when they most need money to fight the devastating impacts of global warming it s a convergence of events that risks pushing developing nations into a debt trap according to prime minister shehbaz sharif of pakistan who addressed world leaders at the cop27 climate talks in egypt last week countries that borrowed heavily when interest rates were low are now struggling to fund projects that would make them more resilient to extreme weather leaving them vulnerable to even higher borrowing costs in the future pakistan which was pushed to the brink of default by flooding on nearly a third of its territory this summer is a case in point the country received a 1 billion loan from the international monetary fund to help tide it over but the flood damage is estimated at around 32 billion and the country has 3 billion of debt to service through june 2023 according to bloomberg economics leaders of nations most vulnerable to climate change have long argued that the countries that contribute the bulk of emissions should foot the bill for mitigation and adaptation but rich nations have consistently fallen short on their promise to provide 100 billion in annual climate finance to the developing world while loans from individual countries and development finance organizations have helped plug some of the gap emerging markets have also had to rely heavily on bond markets if we have to fight and rebuild and repair our infrastructure which has to be resilient and adaptive then of course we can only do so through additional funding not through additional loans and debts sharif said in his speech at the summit in sharm el sheikh developing nation governments need to pay back or roll over about 350 billion in dollar and euro denominated bonds by the end of 2024 according to data compiled by bloomberg meanwhile sovereign dollar bonds from a quarter of the countries in bloomberg s em sovereign dollar debt index are trading with a spread of 1 000 basis points or more over us treasuries a generally accepted metric of distress climate risks aren t yet widely being reflected in the price of new debt although investors are starting to ask more questions about how extreme weather events will impact a country s ability to service its bonds according to two bankers involved in selling sovereign debt the market as a whole is still a couple of steps behind said christine phillpotts portfolio manager at alliancebernstein lp in new york if we continue down the road that we re heading on there s going to be discussion forced upon investors and governments as to not only what is the correct price to be paid for assets in the country but how do you actually reduce that risk premium part of the answer may be more low cost lending by the world s development banks something that egyptian finance minister mohamed maait demanded at the climate talks last week another potential tool which was on the official agenda at cop for the first time this year is a loss and damage facility which would channel funds from rich countries that have contributed more to emissions historically to those that are on the front lines of climate change so far only a few wealthy countries have committed contributions from the perspective of the african group of negotiators we do need to see immediate support for loss and damage on the continent said barbara creecy south africa s environment minister on the sidelines of the conference on sunday of course we want money right now she added anything that allows a poor country to recover will always help reduce the risk premium baked into their debt according to jens nystedt a senior portfolio manager at emso asset management in new york it makes sense for richer countries that are in a lot of ways responsible to fund the facility he added the nature conservancy a us nonprofit has been pushing for debt for nature swaps as a potential solution such deals typically allow countries to restructure debt at lower interest rates or longer maturities with the proceeds being allocated to conservation or green projects since 2016 the nature conservancy has organized debt for nature swaps for the seychelles belize and barbados which overall helped to convert more than 500 million of debt into 230 million of money for conservation the instruments could offer developing countries with little fiscal space the opportunity to undertake urgently needed climate investments kristina kostial deputy director of the strategy policy and review department at the international monetary fund said during a panel session at cop last week the so called debt trap was a key topic at the talks this year partly because it was hosted by egypt a developing nation that is already seeing the effects of climate change and partly because global interest rates are rising senegal president macky sall said in a speech at the conference that developing nations aren t ready to put up with the current set up where developing nations take on debt to fund climate mitigation we are funding our own adaptation

from bad to worse next year s economic risks are already here bloomberg it s been a miserable year for the global economy but things can always get worse history says the federal reserve s high speed interest rate hikes may well tip the us into recession in 2023 few will be surprised if spiraling natural gas prices do the same for europe the double whammy of covid zero and a property slump threatens to bring china s economy to a near standstill and in an extreme downside scenario all those things happen at once that could wipe out some 5 trillion in global output compared with more upbeat forecasts at the start of this year according to bloomberg economics the fact that such a gloomy outlook is far from implausible suggests that big things have gone wrong with the world economy there s been plenty of evidence of that in 2022 cheap money supercharged demand from china and low friction geopolitics ingredients of the secret sauce that delivered decades of mostly steady growth and stable prices have all gone leaving inflation at multi decade highs and financial market losses that run into the trillions there are positive surprises that could stop the rot next year the fed might pull off the fabled soft landing with the labor market proving resilient warm weather could spare europe a recession china may opt for an early exit from lockdowns some of those possibilities came into view last week when markets rallied on lower than expected us inflation and indications of a chinese pivot away from covid zero and even if those prove to be false dawns investors who see a top for interest rates and a bottom for growth might start betting on the recovery to come still after years marked by plague war and scarcity it s tough to be optimistic here s a guide to the biggest economic risks for the year ahead the great rate squeeze is on the fed s benchmark interest rate is poised to hit 5 in early 2023 up from zero at the start of this year the most aggressive monetary tightening in decades is already hurting america s economy and the world s there s more pain to come with higher borrowing costs hammering rate sensitive industries from real estate to autos bloomberg economics is forecasting a us recession in the second half of 2023 more than 2 million americans will likely lose their jobs things could turn out better than that if inflation disappears as quickly and mysteriously as it arrived but it s more likely they ll turn out worse the pandemic has thrown labor markets out of whack pushing what economists call the natural rate of unemployment the level of joblessness required to keep inflation under control above where it s been in recent years if that s happened in the us and chair jerome powell says it s a possibility the fed might have to raise rates as high as 6 tipping the world s biggest economy into a longer and deeper recession terminal clients can use bloomberg s shok function to see how the us recession could be earlier and deeper the risk is replicated worldwide since most countries share america s inflation problem and their central banks are taking the same path to fixing it and economies trying to buck the trend don t have a get out of jail free card japan has stuck with negative rates but it s paid a heavy price on currency markets with the yen losing more than 15 of its dollar value debt risks are back so long as growth rates were higher than borrowing costs public debt came cheap governments piled it on the total owed by the group of seven developed economies rose to 128 of gdp this year from 81 in 2007 now with economies slowing and interest rates rising the calculus is shifting and the bill is coming due several major economies could find themselves on an unsustainable debt trajectory unless they make painful fiscal adjustments investors are watching italy where debt service costs are set to rise to 7 of gdp by 2030 from 3 in 2019 italy probably won t default but avoiding that outcome could require a european level fix typically a fraught process uk bond markets pulled back from the brink after ex prime minister liz truss s failed attempt at a fiscal splurge but closing the gap in public finances and preserving credibility with investors will require a period of painful budget austerity the us isn t quite in the same category even so a looming debt ceiling debate amplified by the republicans midterm gains will keep markets focused the architect of japan s low rates strategy central bank governor haruhiko kuroda reaches the end of his term in april his successor faces a tough choice stick with cheap money risking further currency collapse or follow the fed and destabilize one of the world s biggest debt piles terminal clients can use shok to see how uk austerity could impact bank of england policy in some emerging markets the dilemma is more acute sri lanka has followed lebanon and zambia with an historic failure to pay for now at least the problem appears contained bloomberg economics model suggests that imminent default risks are concentrated in small economies accounting for just 3 of global gdp with the bigger developing countries likely to be spared a debt crisis turkey might be an exception an election in june will likely tempt president recep tayyip erdogan to pursue even more unorthodox policies to stoke growth with the lira and maybe debt sustainability paying the price housing looks vulnerable tight money means it s crunch time for housing markets across the world countries like canada and new zealand which rank among the frothiest housing markets based on metrics like the price to income ratio may find themselves on the front line the us isn t at the top of the risk rankings but it s not far off it will take a 15 drop in nationwide prices to bring mortgage payments into line with household incomes bloomberg economics estimates china s problems are everyone s problems for china the base case is that reopening the economy after covid zero a process that s already begun and will likely gain momentum after the national people s congress in march will offset the continued drag from real estate with the net effect slightly stronger growth bloomberg economics forecasts 5 7 for 2023 risks are tilted firmly to the downside when and how the government will bring covid zero to an end remains unclear bloomberg economics calculations suggest property construction has to drop 25 to realign with shrinking supply what s more the looming retirement of top economic officials could leave president xi jinping with a team that s short of crisis fighting experience failure on both these fronts could take chinese growth all the way down to 2 2 if property crash segues into financial crisis even that number will be out of reach a slowdown that sharp would send shockwaves around the world the biggest blow would fall on china s asian neighbors from korea to vietnam and major commodity producers like australia and brazil europe s energy tightrope the final piece of the global risk puzzle is the world s polarization into rival camps which is already imposing steep costs on europe support for ukraine after the russian invasion has left the continent with natural gas shortages and soaring power prices bloomberg economics base case is that high energy costs and rate hikes by the european central bank will tip the bloc into recession with gdp shrinking 0 1 in 2023 with some luck good weather and skill policies that channel scarce gas to the right places europe might dodge a downturn without either the economy could tip into a contraction comparable to that seen in the global financial crisis crude has dropped from a war driven peak of close to 130 a barrel in the first half of this year some combination of new sanctions on russia reviving demand in china and supply cuts from opec could push it back up next year opening another front in the energy crisis in europe and beyond and adding fuel to the inflation fire global ties are fraying the standoff with russia that s left europe short of energy is just one example of geopolitical fracture relations between the us and china also continue to deteriorate president joe biden has kept the tariffs imposed by his predecessor donald trump and gone a step further with an embargo on sales of cutting edge semiconductors a move that threatens to turn china into a kind of amish community its technological development frozen in place fracturing trade ties are a slow burn drag on growth in both countries with china paying the biggest price taiwan is the flashpoint where slow burn could turn into sudden blaze the delicate balance that s preserved peace across the strait now appears to be breaking down along with trust between washington and beijing largely because of china s growing political and economic heft the consequences of a misstep could be extreme say the us overplays its hand with a step toward recognition of taiwanese independence china responds with a blockade of the island the us and allies impose a blitz of sanctions even if conflict is avoided taiwan s central role in the production of semiconductors and china s central role in the production of everything could mean a supply chain snarl to rival the worst of the covid era fortunately military conflict remains a low probability and for some countries the growing rift between china and the us represents an opportunity apple s decision to start production of the iphone 14 in india is one sign that business giants are hedging their exposure to geopolitical risk countries like vietnam and mexico stand to benefit other things could go wrong too or right of course there are risks that don t fit neatly into any of these buckets a new deadlier variant of covid 19 would be a devastating blow the recent floods in pakistan affecting 33 million people and tipping the economy into a steep contraction show the impact of extreme weather events that are expected to become more frequent as global temperatures rise one potential upside for financial assets at least is that investors look forward if they can discern a peak for
