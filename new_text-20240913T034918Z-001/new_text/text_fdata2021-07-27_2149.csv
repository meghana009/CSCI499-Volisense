healthy earnings grew tangible book value per share and maintained resilient credit quality metrics as we enter the second half of 2021 and look ahead we will continue to leverage our position of strength in disciplined pursuit of growth opportunities across our great markets second quarter 2021 operating results net interest income net interest income was 129 3 million for second quarter 2021 compared to 128 4 million for second quarter 2020 and 129 7 million for first quarter 2021 the slight increase in net interest income from the prior year was driven by decreased funding costs offset by decreased earnings on assets due to lower yields and accretion the slight decrease from the linked quarter was due primarily to lower accretion income offset by a decrease in interest expense due to lower rates paid primarily on money market accounts and certificates of deposit the quarter ended june 30 2021 includes 5 2 million of acquired loan accretion compared to 6 2 million in first quarter 2021 and 7 2 million in second quarter 2020 the average balance of total interest earning assets grew by 1 8 billion and totaled 16 5 billion for the quarter ended june 30 2021 compared to 14 7 billion for the quarter ended june 30 2020 and increased 500 5 million from 16 0 billion for the quarter ended march 31 2021 the increase for both periods is primarily due to the continued growth of average interest bearing cash balances over the past year increasing 1 3 billion from prior year and 781 5 million from the linked quarter offsetting the linked quarter change is a net decrease in average loan balances due to both forgiveness of paycheck protection program ppp loans as well as a decrease in our average mortgage warehouse loans during the quarter the yield on interest earning assets was 3 54 for second quarter 2021 compared to 4 14 for second quarter 2020 and 3 75 for first quarter 2021 the overall asset yield is down for both periods due to the continued increase in lower yielding interest bearing cash balances mentioned above as well as lower yielding ppp loans and securities for the year over year period the average loan yield net of all accretion increased three 3 basis points from the linked quarter compared to a 21 basis point decrease from the prior year the cost of interest bearing liabilities including borrowings was 0 60 for second quarter 2021 compared to 0 90 for second quarter 2020 and 0 67 for first quarter 2021 the decrease from the prior year and linked quarter is primarily due to lower rates offered on our deposit products while the prior year change is also due to rate decreases on other borrowings the net interest margin was 3 14 for second quarter 2021 compared to 3 51 for second quarter 2020 and 3 29 for first quarter 2021 the net interest margin excluding all loan accretion was 3 02 for second quarter 2021 compared to 3 32 in second quarter 2020 and 3 13 for first quarter 2021 the decrease in net interest margin from the prior year was primarily due to the lower asset yields increased liquidity and a decrease of 1 9 million in loan accretion income offset by the lower cost of funds on interest bearing liabilities the 11 basis point decrease in the net interest margin excluding all loan accretion from the linked quarter is primarily a result of excess liquidity which negatively impacted the margin by 15 basis points offset by slightly lower cost of funds of interest bearing liabilities for the quarter noninterest income total noninterest income decreased 9 5 million compared to second quarter 2020 and decreased 2 7 million compared to first quarter 2021 the decrease from the prior year primarily reflects decreases of 5 2 million in mortgage banking revenue and 3 9 million in other noninterest income the decrease in other noninterest income is due to 1 4 million less interchange income due to the durbin amendment which was effective july 2020 as well as a 3 5 million acquired loan contingency reserve that was recovered in second quarter 2020 offset by increases of 538 thousand in mortgage warehouse fee income and 559 thousand in miscellaneous income including a 472 thousand gain on a branch building insurance claim the decrease from the linked quarter primarily reflects a decrease of 2 3 million in mortgage banking revenue mortgage banking revenue was lower in second quarter 2021 compared to prior year and the linked quarter due to decreased volumes and margins resulting from rate increases in 2021 it was also impacted by continued volatility in the market during the quarter which resulted in fair value losses on our derivative hedging instruments of 700 thousand compared to second quarter 2020 gain of 3 3 million and 333 thousand loss for first quarter 2021 noninterest expense total noninterest expense decreased 5 1 million compared to second quarter 2020 and increased 2 9 million compared to first quarter 2021 the net decrease in noninterest expense compared to second quarter 2020 is due primarily to a decrease of 15 6 million in acquisition expenses related to the merger termination in second quarter 2020 and other insignificant decreases in the following 344 thousand in technology and communication expense 522 thousand in fdic assessment 486 thousand in advertising and public relations and 738 thousand in other real estate impairment the changes above were offset by increases of 9 4 million in salaries and benefits expense 1 6 million in professional fees and 1 5 million in occupancy expense the increase from the linked quarter is primarily due to increases of 1 2 million in occupancy expense and 1 4 million in other noninterest expense the increase in salaries and benefits from the prior year is due primarily to 8 8 million lower deferred salary expense which was elevated in prior year as a result of ppp loans and other covid related modifications that occurred during second quarter 2020 and reduced overall salary expense for that period in addition there was a decrease of 2 0 million in severance and retention expenses which were higher in second quarter 2020 due to departmental and business line restructurings offsetting those changes were increases of 2 1 million in salaries and insurance expense in the current quarter due to additional headcount as well as an increase of 712 thousand in contract labor costs due to various departmental and bankwide projects in addition the increase in professional fees for the year over year period was due to 982 thousand higher consulting expenses related primarily to the forgiveness of the first round of ppp loans and 739 thousand in legal expenses related to an ongoing acquired litigation the increase in occupancy expense from the prior year and linked quarter is primarily due to increases in various non capitalizable small furniture and equipment and building repairs and maintenance expenses the increase in other noninterest expense from the linked quarter is due to increases of 365 thousand in loan related expenses 422 thousand in business meals entertainment and travel expenses primarily due to returning to work in second quarter 2021 and other small increases in other miscellaneous accounts provision for credit losses the company recorded a negative provision for credit losses of 6 5 million for second quarter 2021 a decrease of 29 6 million compared to 23 1 million provision expense for second quarter 2020 and a decrease of 4 0 million compared to negative provision for credit losses of 2 5 million for first quarter 2021 the credit provision in second quarter 2021 and first quarter 2021 was primarily related to improvements to the economic forecast during 2021 as well as charge offs or specific reserves taken during the respective period provision expense was elevated in the second quarter 2020 primarily due to general provision expense for economic factors related to covid 19 the allowance for credit losses on loans was 154 8 million or 1 34 of total loans held for investment net of mortgage warehouse purchase loans at june 30 2021 compared to 80 1 million or 0 68 at june 30 2020 and compared to 165 8 million or 1 42 at march 31 2021 the dollar and percentage increase from the prior year is primarily due to adjustments to economic factors relating to the covid 19 pandemic in 2020 as well the current expected credit losses cecl transition adjustment while the increased credit provision from the linked quarter is due primarily to improvements in the economic forecast as mentioned above income taxes federal income tax expense of 15 5 million was recorded for the second quarter 2021 an effective rate of 21 0 compared to tax expense of 8 9 million and an effective rate of 18 7 for the prior year quarter and tax expense of 15 7 million and an effective rate of 20 8 for the linked quarter the lower effective tax rate for the second quarter 2020 was primarily a result of adjustments made related to state income taxes second quarter 2021 balance sheet highlights loans total loans held for investment net of mortgage warehouse purchase loans were 11 6 billion at june 30 2021 compared to 11 7 billion at march 31 2021 and june 30 2020 ppp loans totaled 490 5 million 912 2 million and 823 3 million as of june 30 2021 march 31 2021 and june 30 2020 respectively loans excluding ppp loans and

2021 from 1 2 billion at march 31 2021 and increased from 665 8 million for the quarter ended june 30 2020 an increase of 184 7 million or 27 7 year over year the change from the prior year is reflective of the company s focused attention to grow the warehouse line of business while the decrease for the current quarter is due to lower volumes related to mortgage rate increases and shorter hold times during the period asset quality total nonperforming assets decreased to 53 1 million or 0 29 of total assets at june 30 2021 compared to 61 0 million or 0 34 of total assets at march 31 2021 and increased from 28 4 million or 0 17 of total assets at june 30 2020 the decrease in nonperforming loans and nonperforming assets from the linked quarter is primarily due to payoffs and principal reductions totaling 5 4 million as well as 2 4 million in charge offs during the period which includes a 1 2 million commercial loan charge off and various other smaller charge offs the increase in nonperforming loans and nonperforming assets from the prior year is primarily due to net additions of 7 5 million in pcd loans added related to our january 1 2021 cecl adoption as well as nonaccrual loan additions including a 12 2 million energy loan and a 15 1 million commercial real estate credit offset by a 3 5 million charge off on an energy credit and the 1 2 million commercial loan charge off mentioned above as well as the high volume of payoffs and principal reductions occurring in second quarter 2021 charge offs were 0 13 annualized in the second quarter 2021 compared to 0 01 annualized in the linked quarter and 0 05 annualized in the prior year quarter charge offs were elevated in second quarter 2021 due to the 1 2 million commercial loan charge off discussed above

june 30 2021 compared to 14 8 billion at march 31 2021 and compared to 13 3 billion at june 30 2020 the increase in deposits from the linked quarter is related to 350 0 million in reciprocal deposits

linked quarter change reflects a 2 5 million payoff in borrowings against the company s unsecured revolving line of credit with an unrelated commercial bank the change from prior year reflects a 550 0 million reduction of short term fhlb advances as well as the payoff of 13 5 million in total borrowings for both the company s unsecured line of credit and the fed s ppp liquidity facility offset by

of these items significantly impact our financial statements additionally the items that we exclude in our adjustments are not necessarily consistent with the items that our peers may exclude from their results of operations and key financial measures and therefore may limit the comparability of similarly named financial measures and ratios we compensate for these limitations by providing the equivalent gaap measures whenever we present the non gaap financial measures and by including a reconciliation of the impact of the components adjusted for in the non gaap financial measure so that both measures and the individual components may be considered when analyzing our performance a reconciliation of our non gaap financial measures to the comparable gaap financial measures is included

a series of warnings about the looming stock market crash made the headlines again this week as the market moves closer and closer to the epic burst of the greatest bubble of all time notably the billionaire investor and duquesne family office chief stanley druckenmiller shared a gloomy forecast if the u s government keeps spending trillions upon trillions we may witness not only a devastating crash but a financial crisis that will deeply hurt millions of americans in may the veteran investor said that the current bull market was looking like something he had seen in the past and back then things did not end well i have no doubt that we are in a raging mania in all assets he said i also have no doubt that i don t have a clue when that s going to end i knew we were in a raging mania in 99 but it kept going on and if you had shorted the tech stocks in mid 99 you were out of business by the end of the year druckenmiller added comparing today s market to the dot com boom that wasn t the first time the billionaire investor cautioned wall street investors that u s markets were caught up in a speculative frenzy fostered by the trillions of dollars in government spending most recently the market expert made a brief appearance on msnbc s morning show with stephanie ruhle who seemed a little unprepared to respond to his arguments about why the new government multi trillion infrastructure plan will end up financially hurting america s working poor druckenmiller argued that the u s economy is experiencing some sort of v shaped recovery right now and it has been the sharpest rebound in history however he noted that it took more than a decade for the american economy to attain the same gains after the start of the great depression the main problem of this rapid upturn is that the almost 6 trillion allocated by congress to combat the economic impact of the health crisis has been spent after the economy concluded its rebound the alarming growth of inflation and small and medium sized businesses inability to hike wages to hire new workers are definitely consequences of this imbalanced recovery the financial expert explained that the biggest economic crises that occurred over the past 100 years have been mainly caused by asset bubbles and inflation inflation is a tax the poor can t afford or avoid druck stressed adding that any further stimulus spending will be directed to fix a problem that in druck s words doesn t exist anymore meaning that there s no need for the economy to be artificially stimulated anymore if i was darth vader and i wanted to destroy the us economy i would do aggressive spending in the middle of an already hot economy you usually get a bubble out of that and you get inflation out of that frankly we now have both this is the biggest bubble i ve seen in my career he said druckenmiller also reminded investors that the bubble doesn t just include stocks but cryptocurrencies and housing markets too what are we going to get out of this you re going to get a sugar high the higher inflation then an economic bust the billionaire warned during the interview when druck said the government should postpone the issuance of the new infrastructure spending plan ruhle interjected arguing that poor people do not care whether or not bitcoin will crash since they don t own that much crypto or stocks anyway she maintained that the infrastructure plan would help all americans particularly those with the fewest resources the investor then replied saying i don t think we need to do anything we need to take a step back take a breath and see where we are i think any net spending is a problem he said that there are many exciting things inside the plan such as investments in the digital infrastructure however it isn t something our economy could afford to bear at this moment druck pointed out that the growing retail exposure to equities means that a stock market crash will impact main street even more quickly and even harder this time around it doesn t matter whether they do or don t hold financial securities or crypto assets they will still be impacted by the economic downturn as druck laid out it s going to cause a financial crisis it s going to cause inflation and nothing is going to hurt the poor more than that back in may the expert predicted that we would see a crash before year s end i will be surprised if we re not out of the stock market by the end of the year just because the bubbles can t last that long he said we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us

washington with inflation uncomfortably high and the covid 19 delta variant raising economic concerns a divided federal reserve will meet this week to discuss when and how it should dial back its ultra low interest rate policies for now the u s economy is growing briskly in the wake of the pandemic recession and the pace of hiring is healthy which is why the fed s policymakers will likely move closer toward acting soon in particular the officials are expected to discuss the timing and mechanics of slowing their 120 billion a month in bond purchases a pandemic era policy that is intended to keep long term loan rates low to spur borrowing and spending this week s meeting occurs against the backdrop of a risky policy bet by fed chair jerome powell powell is gambling that the central bank can engineer an exceedingly delicate task to keep the fed s short term benchmark rate pegged near zero where it has been since march 2020 until the job market has fully healed without fueling a sustained bout of high inflation yet the stakes around that bet are rising with consumer prices having jumped 5 4 percent in june from a year ago the biggest increase in 13 years last month s surge marked a fourth straight month of unexpectedly large price increases heightening fears that persistently higher inflation will erode the value of recent pay raises and undermine the economic recovery the main concern is that the fed will end up responding too late and too aggressively to high inflation by quickly jacking up interest rates and perhaps causing another recession last week republicans in congress peppered powell with questions about inflation for which they largely blamed president biden s 1 9 trillion stimulus package which was enacted in march in his testimony powell largely stood by his view that higher inflation will prove temporary his reasoning is that recent high price increases for things like used and new cars hotel rooms and airline tickets have been driven mainly by supply shortages related to the swift reopening of the economy but he also stated more explicitly than before that the fed won t hesitate to raise rates should it decide that inflation is getting out of control advertisement after a period of broad agreement during the pandemic crisis the fed s policymakers appear divided over how soon to start reducing or tapering in fed parlance its monthly bond purchases several regional fed bank presidents support tapering soon including james bullard of the st louis fed patrick harker of the philadelphia fed and robert kaplan of the dallas fed powell has said that the central bank wants to see substantial further progress toward its goals of maximum employment and price stability before it would consider reducing the bond purchases to make up for years of inflation remaining below 2 percent powell said the fed wants inflation to moderately exceed its 2 percent average inflation target and to show signs of remaining above it for an unspecified time in recent months as consumer demand has exceeded the supply of goods and services in some industries inflation has topped 2 percent powell suggested during his congressional testimony last week that the economy was still a ways off from achieving that progress on wednesday when the fed issues a policy statement and powell holds a news conference any signal that such progress is near could mean that the fed is getting closer to reducing its bond purchases nathan sheets chief economist at pgim fixed income and a former director of international finance at the fed said the divide on the fed reflects two sharply different ways of viewing the economy those officials who support an earlier taper are likely focused on current levels of high inflation and the fact that the economy has nearly returned to its pre pandemic size hiring is robust and is being held back mostly by a shortage of workers rather than a lack of demand for them sheets said under this view the fed can t do much about labor supply the economy is bottom line much better than it was a year ago sheets said it is getting harder and harder for the fed to explain why it needs to keep buying 120 billion of assets a month advertisement yet powell and the rest of the fed s leadership notably richard clarida vice chair of the fed s board and john williams president of the federal reserve bank of new york will likely stick to a go slow approach toward withdrawing economic support sheets said it s not yet clear how the highly contagious and fast spreading delta variant of the coronavirus might affect the u s or global economies sheets said or how the job market will fare in coming months hiring could accelerate in september as schools reopen more parents are able to take jobs and expanded unemployment aid programs expire there is no reason whatsoever for us to be in a hurry here sheets said summarizing the leadership s likely view the bond market is signaling much less concern about future inflation with the yield on the 10 year treasury note having fallen by nearly a half percentage point since the spring to about 1 28 percent this also gives the fed more time to consider its options sheets said powell has said the fed will communicate its intention to taper well in advance of doing so david mericle an economist at goldman sachs said that based on historical practice that would mean that the central bank will likely signal its intentions about two meetings before announcing a move accordingly mericle predicts that the fed will provide its first clear hint about tapering at its september meeting followed by another signal in november before announcing the actual taper in december send questions comments to the editors previous next filed under

by john mauldin i have mixed feelings about china on the plus side i think the country s massive economic transformation may be one of the most impressive events in human history bringing hundreds of millions from primitive rural lives into relatively prosperous cities within a few years was awe inspiring i greatly admire the millions of chinese entrepreneurs worldwide who create jobs and technology they ve helped the entire world in countless ways and yet i can t forget that china s leaders are devoted ideologically centralist communists americans sometimes apply that term casually to our political opponents xi jinping is an actual communist his regime permits some limited market like activity but only to help achieve the government s goals which remain communist when the west first began engaging with china in the 1980s and then allowed it into the world trade organization in 2001 many hoped exposure to our ways would tug china toward capitalism it seemed to be happening for the first few decades too but the hope is fading in a 2015 letter when china stopped acting chinese i said this beijing s stimulus efforts created the stock market bubble now their unsuccessful efforts to keep it from bursting are shaking my confidence in their desire to allow market forces to play a greater role in the transition from a top down society to a consumer driven bottom up society still i ve learned not to underestimate the chinese leadership they make mistakes but usually recognize them and change course quickly we ll see what they learn from their current misadventures in stimulus and their attempts at top down control of an essentially uncontrollable market if they don t learn the right lessons china will face an even harder lesson in the future six years later it looks like chinese leaders didn t learn the right lessons xi has been trying to balance economic freedom and authoritarian control and it s not working like it used to today we ll review some recent events that illustrate where xi went wrong then we ll think about whether the xi government can change course whether it wants to and whether it will survive selling the rope chinese ride hailing company didi chuxing had its us initial public offering i ll explain those quote marks in a minute last month raising 4 4 billion the shares plunged a few days later why widely called the uber of china didi seems to have good prospects the problems came from outside for one the chinese government decided to investigate whether didi presented a cybersecurity threat the company was ordered not to accept new users and its mobile apps were taken down from online app stores but audits or lack thereof may be a bigger problem and not just for didi my friend mark grant explains in one of his letters this week the core of the issue is that the chinese government will no longer give us market regulators any of the regulating bodies the power to inspect the audits of chinese companies listed on us exchanges there are at least 248 chinese companies listed on three major us exchanges with a total market capitalization of 2 1 trillion according to the us china economic and security review commission earlier this year the securities and exchange commission began rolling out rules threatening to delist foreign companies from american exchanges if they do not meet us auditing standards for three years the chinese response was that chinese regulators will conduct the audit inspections and deliver their conclusions to the us public company accounting oversight board this was soundly rejected as it should have been by the sec emphasis mine in the press recently there has been all kinds of talk about the didi ipo fiasco and the effect on chinese tech companies and on new chinese listings this is all fine but it does not go nearly far enough the issues are much much bigger on the equity side how can you invest in a chinese company any chinese company regardless of size or theoretical revenues or profits without audited financials there will be no way to know if any of it is accurate and foreign assertations will have all of the reliability of a drop of water purportedly not dripping down the great wall because of the chinese sunlight no one will have any reliable knowledge of what is actually going on no one in his right mind would invest in any company domiciled anywhere on this basis mark is right investors shouldn t throw money at companies based on financial statements that don t have some kind of trusted third party verification but there s a bigger problem here the didi ipo was not a normal ipo at least as we think of them in the west us investors who bought these shares don t actually own equity they own pieces of a caymans variable interest entity vie which has a contract with the parent company this structure is necessary because under chinese law foreigners can t own chinese shares directly didi duly warned investors in its us offering see risk factors in their registration statement that they had no shareholder rights and the chinese government had final control this isn t new us listed chinese companies since at least alibaba in 2014 have used the vie structure it s one of those things that works great until it doesn t this arrangement did have a key advantage though at least for the chinese it let chinese enterprises rake in foreign capital while giving up no ownership and reserving the right to leave their own investors high and dry this method may now be approaching its expiration date but it worked well for a long time that s how xi and the chinese communist party operate they do things that look capitalist but really aren t lacing them with unnoticed poison pills for later use it s similar to their appropriation of us technology trademarks and other intellectual property we are literally selling them the rope prepare for war we should distinguish between chinese business leaders and the chinese government i think the former are mostly just trying to run their companies the right way they are like entrepreneurs everywhere trying to grow their businesses to the best of their ability the latter group makes it difficult and sometimes impossible this can be hard to grasp xi and the other communists really believe they can have it both ways conducting business while also maintaining iron like control over everything they may not exercise their control but they want to have it those vie companies are a good example some experts say the whole structure is illegal under chinese law yet it is widely used the government looks the other way but by doing so the authorities give themselves a giant weapon they can use any time the business executives are aware of this and modify their behavior accordingly note that verb modify in theory this could still end well having successfully allowed people a taste of capitalism and its benefits the government might think it can continue meanwhile those capitalist benefits might gradually usurp the communist ideology recent events say that s unlikely though beijing appears to be concluding it has squeezed all the advantage it can from capitalism is didi any more a technological risk than scores of other companies not really sometimes you have to create object lessons to keep everyone in line in hindsight things seem to have gone wrong after the 2008 financial crisis facing potential social unrest china responded with massive debt financed investment in infrastructure housing and other projects some were needed others were make work distractions but all the debt was real and over time it has become a heavier burden xi jinping inherited this situation when he took power in 2013 what is his plan according to cai xia a chinese professor and high level ccp member and now expatriate dissident living in the us chinese communism hasn t changed she wrote a lengthy paper under the auspices of the hoover institution she maintains xi is merely dropping the pretense here s ambrose evans prichard in a recent telegraph column writing a useful summary like many amateur observers of china i had assumed that xi jinping s iron fist policies at home and abroad were a break with the more emollient approach from deng to hu jintao if you can call the tiananmen square massacre emollient when china seemed to be softening from a totalitarian to an authoritarian regime cai xia makes clear that the fundamental character of the ccp has been unchanging the party has merely dropped the facade and dispensed with deng xiaoping s tactical dictum bide your time and hide your strength 韬光养晦 it has also acquired the means of totalitarian control that hitler and stalin could only dream of whether face recognition technology or digital tracking through the social credit system the long list of xi s affronts from the nine dash line to the south china sea to the pitiless asphyxiation of hong kong to the intimidation of australia to the uighur camps are by now well known culminating in wolf warrior diplomacy and state sponsored disinformation on covid 19 we are so inured to it that president xi s wall of steel speech at the 100th birthday party almost seems banal we know what the party thinks the fifth plenum text setting out china s strategy until 2035 revives the term prepare for war 备战 not used for over half a century prepare for war is an exaggeration at least i hope but it is growing less unthinkable when you have two great powers whose systems are irreconcilable and neither is willing to change the options list shrinks sleepwalking to confrontation not everyone thinks disengagement and confrontation is inevitable ian bremmer outlined the issues in his last letter reaching a different conclusion ian pointed out that unlike the us ussr cold war the us and china are highly interdependent he broke it down into three components hostility where both countries want the other to fail this includes mostly the national security issues like taiwan and the south china sea plus issues both countries see as core principles like china s treatment of hong kong the uighurs and tibet competition each wants to outperform but not destroy the other these are the economic issues like international trade and investment technology and domestic political stability both countries are the other s supplier as well as customer each wants to win but also needs the other cooperation both want to work together for mutual gain this includes the global challenges like climate change terrorism etc they agree on the goals but lack of trust makes cooperation difficult we naturally focus on the areas of conflict but ian thinks the full us china relationship is actually working pretty well it changes with time of course ian rates the relationship as currently 20 hostility 70 competition and 10 cooperation but he also says much of the competition is becoming hostility we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us ian takes as given that neither country will do anything that would be perceived as weakness but if no one will blink how do you avoid coming to blows ian thinks it is possible more likely a change in policy comes from internal failures of the present trajectory how would that happen in china xi leans into more state control of strategic sectors high performing talent starts to leave productivity dives and growth stalls and debt spirals giving technocratic chinese political leaders more space to nudge beijing policymaking back towards more interdependence in the united states domestic divisions make industrial policy half hearted the private sector retains capture of the regulatory environment the post biden administration renders strategic reorientation of the us economy incoherent and affords allies more space to direct their own course historians tell us the dangers of sleepwalking into confrontation but in the us china relationship domestic incoherence and lack of ability to effectively implement long term strategy makes cold war less likely precisely because it allows existing forces of interdependence to persist unmolested i hope ian is right from my perch i m not sure much of this is feasible i think xi has made a giant mistake with recent business crackdowns he may have calculated he can do without western companies but without them what will happen to the chinese businesses that still turn to the us and europe for capital customers expertise and technology moreover can the chinese miracle continue if millions of small entrepreneurs stop believing the government will let them succeed i don t mean big companies i m talking about restaurant owners drivers shopkeepers all those who keep the economy moving cai xia who was in a position to know has an even more chilling outlook cai xia s contention is that the communist regime is more brittle than it looks like the soviet regime before the end i recommend that the us be fully prepared for the possible sudden disintegration of the she said imagining what such a sudden disintegration would look like i suspect it wouldn t be pretty even if good in the long run economically it could make 2008 or even the covid pandemic look mild china problems and big brother china is facing large problems some obvious and others more subtle but i think problem number one is xi has made a giant mistake with recent business crackdowns china is the ultimate orwellian big brother state especially within the cities the government can literally watch everything you do and track everything you buy from your noodles to your clothes who you talk to what websites you visit all of the data chinese corporations gather is available to the ccp who use it to create china s social credit system if you google that the first thing that pops up says this the china social credit system is a broad regulatory framework intended to report on the trustworthiness of individuals corporations and governmental entities across china the consequences of a poor social credit score can be serious it affects travel prospects employment banking access and ability to enter contracts on the other hand a positive credit score can make a range of business transactions easier for both individuals and corporations foreign businesses have to work with consultants to make sure they have good social credit scores and the ccp dictates what that means it is the ultimate top down centralist panopticon as mentioned at the beginning many chinese are quite entrepreneurial given the opportunity that being said entrepreneurialism is not a racial characteristic there is something in an entrepreneur that makes them want to start their own business or enterprise a willingness to take risk is obviously part of that dna the united states is extraordinarily lucky in that we attracted people who were willing to take risks simply to come here i may not understand the chinese mindset but i think i have a pretty good grasp of the entrepreneurial mindset successful entrepreneurs don t fit into a mold you can see why some entrepreneurs thrive and you have to scratch your head to figure out how others did it some work well within their system others simply create new territory and methods xi is going to deprive china of that second set of entrepreneurs those willing to create something entirely new that might not fit well within the current social credit system i think the growing big brother state will stifle innovation who wants to risk their social credit score it is one thing to risk your reputation and capital and another to risk your ability to live and work china s panopticon blocks that risk taking impulse the consequences will accumulate and reduce growth and with over half the country still living in extreme poverty that doesn t bode well for the future further china has a serious demographic problem the one child policy instituted in 1980 really kicked in around 1990 as you can see in the population pyramid below source index mundi normally population pyramids are actual pyramids let s look at india as an example this is a population pyramid source index mundi while we are on this let s look at japan source index mundi japan has similar demographic characteristics to china but with one huge difference japan grew rich while it grew older china has grown older before growing rich all countries have problems but even with all its impressive growth and infrastructure china has more which to me makes it more dangerous the sec is correctly insisting on audits for chinese companies listed on us exchanges i personally think we should ban new chinese listings unless they agree to us audit standards kicking out currently listed chinese companies will be trickier as us investors don t actually own the shares many think they do we don t want to blow a 2 trillion hole into us investor assets us corporations need to rethink how they approach china for some there will be few issues for others real problems this week the biden administration warned us companies about doing business in hong kong china has essentially removed the rule of law that enabled hong kong s financial activity the us advisory reportedly cites the risks of electronic surveillance and having to surrender corporate and customer data to the government xi apparently thinks that it is time to forgo access to the us markets maybe he thinks chinese companies can list in hong kong and westerners will still invest maybe then again maybe not rule of law should be critical to any right thinking investor when the ccp can nudge an auditor to give a thumbs up or thumbs down based on some concept of social credit how can you trust their assurances will that happen often we don t know but we know it s possible i m not saying avoid china entirely as there are still opportunities but you should have your eyes wide open and understand the risks i would prefer china exposed us or other western companies that give you real audits and normal shareholder rights china is going to be a massive headache for the world over the next few decades washington dc maine and colorado i plan to go to washington dc for a few days before heading out to bangor maine and then grand lake stream for camp kotok the annual fishing and economic fest this year my youngest son trey who is now 26 will once again accompany me which he has done for most years since he was 12 then i will go to steamboat colorado for a speaking engagement before heading home the problems in cuba are a topic of interest here in puerto rico interesting conversations people ask why the us turns away cubans fleeing political unrest and persecution but accepts those fleeing central america for similar reasons i don t have a good answer at least one that is politically correct we also talked about entrepreneurs the cuban community in florida is nothing if not entrepreneurial they have been a huge plus to the local and national culture growing up with immigrants legal and illegal from mostly mexico i would argue that they have also contributed to a vibrant culture within texas and the border states i have consistently been pro immigration for 40 years i want risk takers and freedom lovers from all over the world especially those with education and talent to share in the american experiment and with that i will hit the send button have a great week and remember where your ancestors came from most of us came from risk taking immigrants your needing more space to talk about china analyst john mauldin

bloomberg china s overhaul of hong kong s political institutions has crushed the pro democracy movement and fueled warnings of an end to the city s status as an international financial hub yet more than a year after the crackdown began signs of an investor exodus are hard to find shares of hong kong s exchange operator have doubled since the start of 2020 reflecting confidence in the city s ability to lure chinese listings the local currency is near the strong end of its trading band against the dollar suggesting capital outflows aren t a worry major global banks and financial institutions including blackrock inc and citigroup inc have maintained or grown their presence in the city employment in the finance and insurance sectors rose in 2020 from a year earlier that comes even as surveys suggest growing concern among some expatriate executives about the crackdown s impact on civil liberties and rule of law following the mass arrest of pro democracy advocates and threats to the free flow of information under the sweeping national security law imposed by china in july 2020 for now even as authorities enforce broad new powers to stifle dissent they appear to have not yet crossed the financial industry s red lines those include internet restrictions currency controls curbs on doing deals and changes to hong kong s prized legal system that would impact global business said fraser howie an author of books on the chinese markets and former managing director at brokerage clsa ltd i see no evidence that the financial industry is actually going to be changing their actions because ultimately what they do is deals and if you can still do a deal they will do it howie said whether hong kong upholds its legal and regulatory standards will be critical said douglas arner a law professor at the university of hong kong and an expert on the city s financial system if we were to start seeing a regulatory environment that no longer matched international standards and approaches that s the sort of thing that would indeed cause shifts arner said hong kong optimists are betting the communist party simply has too much riding on the financial hub to allow its appeal to fade the city s role as a key fundraising center for chinese firms is only growing as beijing seeks to dissuade the nation s firms from listing in the u s the central government has opened channels via hong kong to enable foreign capital to flow into the country s financial markets as well as let some money out hong kong s dollar is freely convertible unlike china s yuan inflows suggest global investor confidence in the city remains high a point that hong kong chief executive carrie lam regularly emphasizes when responding to critics so much money poured into hong kong last year that the city s monetary authority stepped in 85 times to prevent the local currency from strengthening past its permitted trading range aggregate inflows of 50 billion the most since 2010 pushed a measure of liquidity in the financial system to a record in october it hasn t dropped since and the hong kong dollar remains firmly in the strong half of its trading band mainland capital has also come in at a record pace via stock exchange links in shanghai and shenzhen including an unprecedented around 40 billion net inflow in january companies have raised about 33 billion through hong kong listings in 2021 nearly double last year s pace data compiled by bloomberg show more chinese firms are likely to shift listings to the city from the u s on expectations the approval process by beijing will be less onerous that s helped make shares of hong kong exchanges clearing ltd the world s top performing major bourse this month u s capital markets are now less hospitable to chinese firms due to geopolitical tensions and china s domestic markets are not yet mature or open enough to fill the gap said michael hirson head of china and northeast asia at eurasia group that leaves hong kong in a unique role at least for the time being there is still plenty to worry about for the city s 200 000 strong financial industry this month the biden administration warned investors about the risks of doing business in hong kong citing concerns about the security law data privacy and access to critical business information a bill to toughen legislation banning the publication of personal information to harass people or doxxing has raised concern about internet censorship businesses in the city may also get affected by escalating tensions between washington and beijing that include tit for tat sanctions in may 40 of those who responded to a survey by the american chamber of commerce in hong kong said they might leave the city highlighting the business community s concerns over the national security law and the local government s handling of covid 19 outbreaks beijing s crackdown on free speech and the imposition of its version of the rule of law which could together block the free flow of information and denude investor protection increases the flight risk of foreign businesses and investors said eswar prasad who once led the international monetary fund s china team and is now at cornell university banks so far appear to be digging in for example citigroup inc said this year it will hire as many as 1 700 people for its operations in hong kong as part of a plan to capture more business in china s greater bay area in april the firm excluded its hong kong consumer operations from a decision to exit retail banking in 13 markets across asia and europe the lender will instead focus on four regional wealth hubs including one in hong kong blackrock inc s larry fink and bank of america corp s brian moynihan are among executives who ve said as recently as this month that rising tensions between the u s and china had left them unfazed and won t affect their operations in hong kong beijing is pushing boundaries not trying to kill the goose said pauline loong

all time quarterly revenue record of 1 41 billion above the high end of guidance and an increase of 20 year on year and 6 sequentially following a strong first quarter continued momentum resulted in better than expected performance in all end markets most notably communications and consumer where we saw a sequential increase of 6 and 9 respectively high factory utilization for our advanced technology portfolio and continued improvement in our mainstream business resulted in a record second quarter eps of 0 51 the 6 sequential growth in communications exceeded our expectations after a strong first quarter in the segment year on year our communications business grew 28 representing 40 of total quarterly revenue for the full year of 2021 we expect continued growth in this business driven by the strength in the smartphone market particularly in 5g with current industry forecast of over 500 million 5g enabled smartphones to be built this year amkor has a leading position in the 5g rf domain and over recent years we have established a proven technology portfolio to address the advanced requirements needed to enable 5g with our vs and bga advanced sip platform we have established a preferred advanced packaging solution for this demanding application amkor s industry leading design rules dual sided molding technology conformal shielding together with in line rf testing deliver best in class integration levels in the high volume high yield manufacturing process we continue to develop technology and manufacturing scale to support our customers in this growing market segments in the automotive and industrial market we achieved another quarterly revenue records year on year growth of 33 underlines the recovery in this end markets some supply chain constraints especially in the wafer and substrate supply dampened the even further growth we continue to see strength in the mainstream part of our automotive portfolio and have received several customer endorsements especially for the quality and delivery performance in our philippines factories in the advanced product part of our portfolio we ran several new products in the automotive sensor domain for radar sensors we utilized wafer level fan out technology in our portugal factory customers are rapidly adopting this technology due to the strict requirements of radar sensors in addition to the growing sensor market we also ran several new products targeting the automotive high power domain accelerated by the growth of the ev market for the second half of the year we anticipate the automotive supply chain will gradually improve resulting in further growth beyond the second half we believe the growth drivers in this market remain in place and we expect that semiconductor content per car will further increase due to accelerated proliferation of driver assistance electronics and the electrification of more car models strength in the consumer market resulted in a better than expected sequential increase of 9 we continue to diversify our product and customer portfolio in iot wearables and ran several new products in the quarter we expect this markets will be an important driver of growth and our overall product and customer pipeline for advanced sip solutions in this domain remains strong in addition to the wearable market we also experienced strength in traditional consumer products like gaming display and video devices and we expect continued growth going forward revenue in the computing market set another quarterly record with sequential growth of 6 and year on year growth of 21 we experienced solid performance in all computing applications and a further strengthening of our project pipeline we are investing in technology and manufacturing scale to capitalize on opportunities across the computing domain from personal computing to infrastructure and data centers we see more opportunities in this market in the emerging segments like ai and high performance computing and then the changes brought by the ongoing de verticalization in this market finally our test business grew 12 year on year in the second quarter as we broaden the scope of our test services for 5g communications and the system level testing and expand our test attach rates to prepare for the volume ramp in the second half of 2021 our manufacturing organization has expanded clean room space and capacity most notably for advanced packaging in our factories in korea also we are encouraged by progress in the u s on investment policies to incentivize domestic semiconductor manufacturing the amkor team is exploring a possible factory location to align with the investments in the u s supply chain of other major semiconductor companies during the quarter we increased our capex target for the year to around 775 million partially an anticipation of some initial investments in a new factory location other major investments in 2021 are planned for wafer level and flip chip technology sip and test capacity as well as facility expansions and specific investments to support our industry 4 0 program now let me turn to our third quarter outlook we expect significant growth with revenue of 1 7 billion at the midpoint of guidance this would represent a sequential increase of 21 and the year on year increase of 26 the ongoing short term constraints in the supply chain of materials and equipment are expected to continue into the second half of 2021 and we are working closely with our suppliers and customers to help mitigate these risks for full year 2021 we expect growth in all end markets particularly communications and we are well positioned to support the continued recovery in automotive we remain confident in our strong market position and the overall demand environment and expect to outgrow the semiconductor market in 2021 megan will now provide more detailed financial information megan faust executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you giel and good afternoon everyone today i will review our second quarter results and then provide some comments about our third quarter outlook second quarter sales were better than expected up 6 from the first quarter to an all time quarterly record of 1 41 billion all of our end markets experienced growth this quarter and as giel noted revenue in both automotive and industrial as well as computing were new quarterly records advanced products revenue grew 17 in the first half of 2021 over the same period last year and represent approximately 70 of our business our mainstream products revenue also improved driven by the recovery in automotive and increased 20 in the first half of 2021 over the same period last year advanced sip products grew double digit sequentially in q2 primarily in support of the communications and consumer end markets with strong growth in both advanced and mainstream products gross margin grew 300 basis points over prior year q2 to 19 4 and gross profit dollars of 273 million is a second quarter record material content increased 150 basis points sequentially and cost in support of second half growth moderately constrained gross margin operating expenses for the quarter came in slightly lower than expected at 118 million and operating income margin growth outpaced gross margin expansion increasing 365 basis points year on year to 11 net income for the quarter was 126 million resulting in record q2 eps of 0 51 q2 ebitda increased over 40 year on year to 295 million and ebitda margin was 21 we ended the quarter with 885 million of cash and short term investments and total liquidity of 1 3 billion our solid financial position provides flexibility to continue to invest in growth opportunity moving on to our third quarter outlook we expect revenue to be between 1 65 billion and 1 75 billion gross margin is expected to be between 18 5 and 20 5 consistent with historical seasonality q3 expectations include a significant increase in communications driven by advanced sip products we expect q3 operating expenses of around 115 million our plans for controlling opex in a significant growth environment are expected to contribute to operating income margin expansion of around 150 basis points we expect full year effective tax rate to be reduced to around 15 due to discrete tax benefits recognized in the first half of 2021 and favorable foreign currency movements q3 net income is expected to be between 150 million and 200 million resulting in eps of 0 60 to 0 80 this would represent over 80 growth in eps at the midpoint compared to the prior year quarter we are increasing our planned capital expenditures to 775 million for the year to meet strong second half demand and for our initial investments in a new factory location our target capital intensity remains in the low teens and we expect free cash flow for 2021 to exceed prior year free cash flow with that we will now open the call up for your questions operator questions and answers operator thank you and our first question comes from haas liu with credit suisse please state your question angela dai credit suisse analyst hi this is angela on behalf of randy and congratulations on the great quarter so if you can give a little more color on what has drove the strength of your third quarter what would be driving the strength of your third quarter sales and relative strength and weakness by application and your initial views for 4q megan faust executive vice president and chief financial officer hi angela let s just clarify the question there was a little bit of audio on our side so i think your question is to add some color with respect to any supply constraints that we might be experiencing heading into the third quarter two perhaps expand by application on those supply constraints and then whether or not we have any comments as it relates to impact in the fourth quarter did i capture your question appropriately angela dai credit suisse analyst actually my question is more so around this larger drivers of your performance megan faust executive vice president and chief financial officer okay so end market drivers okay angela giel would you like to address the end market drivers giel rutten president and chief executive officer yes angela let s try to summarize that the main catalyst for growth is certainly in the third quarter is 5g communication then iot specifically iot wearables generally automotive and in automotive we see strength in the driver assistance features and also in the automotive power domain and then of course high performance computing in general but if you look specifically into q3 we see that the communication market is strong we expect growth both in the volume of smartphones to be sold in the third quarter as well as an increase in the number of 5g handsets to be sold comparing to last year it is expected that this year 500 million smartphone 5g enabled handsets will be deployed into the market which is a doubling compared to last year and that drives a significant semiconductor content where amkor has a good position in the rf domain but also in multiple other components in the 5g smartphones megan faust executive vice president and chief financial officer so angela just to add to giel s comments to give you some color our 21 increase for q3 at the midpoint are the last five years we ve had about 15 increase so that significant increase in q3 we re expecting as giel mentioned is led by communications typically if you look back at our q3 performance you d see around a 30 increase for communications and we re expecting something around 40 for the communications market any follow up questions angela angela dai credit suisse analyst yeah sure about your third q gross margin guide it s you briefly mentioned about some cost factoring in can you elaborate up on that the mid 20 margin megan faust executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah angela are you speaking specifically to the q3 guide for gross margin or specific to the q2 actuals i just wanted to make sure i addressed the right question angela dai credit suisse analyst yeah the 3q guide megan faust executive vice president and chief financial officer okay yeah so our mid point for the gross margin guide is flat sequentially acknowledging revenue is expected to increase 21 so as you know gross margin can fluctuate based on utilization or product mix so advanced sip revenue is increasing significantly in q3 as i mentioned that is supporting the communications market and advanced sip does have a higher material content and so that s what impacts product mix however our gross profit dollars are projected to be up over 50 million or 20 and operating income margin is expected to expand around 150 basis points sequentially eps is also expected to be up around 0 20 or 40 to a record 0 70 so overall while the product mix can have an impact on gross margin percentage advanced sip is profitable generating good results and cash flow any angela dai credit suisse analyst and a follow up around yeah around your sip pipeline can you give an update of your sip pipeline the revenue expectation for the full year and do you see growing factoring multi sourcing on some of the consumer audio products giel rutten president and chief executive officer thanks angela let me try to answer that question i think with respect to our sip pipeline as we already mentioned earlier we have a strong pipeline both in the communications segment as well as in the consumer segment for communication we see healthy growth in the third quarter and of course we don t guide for the full year but we expect that to extent in the fourth quarter also for the consumer end market we are ramping up several new products in the second quarter as well as in the third quarter and we see continued strength there proliferating in multiple products as well as in multiple customers there so going forward we expect sip to be an important product part of our product portfolio in amkor where it goes from starting with communication it extends into the consumer market as well as in the automotive and to computing market any further questions there angela dai credit suisse analyst yeah thank you on lead times are your lead time running normal for assembly and test and how are your lead times now are you getting additional equipment giel rutten president and chief executive officer okay angela in the supply chain we share we are experiencing several challenges one is in the lead time of equipment in our new equipment we saw over the last six to eight months lead times actually doubling but overall we were able to install the capacity that we require for our ramp in the third quarter so although that lead times are extending we don t see that as a bottleneck for the second half of this year and we share already an anticipation of these lead times we in selective areas ordering equipment for the following year now if you look to the lead time for our manufacturing process these lead times are not changed we don t see an extension there we start our manufacturing process when we have all the materials available and then our manufacturing lead time is unchanged and that was both for assembly as well as test of course besides equipment we see more challenges in the supply chain for material specifically where we see significant challenges for substrates and lead frames in different parts of the market for the second and third quarter we are able to work with our suppliers and customers to deliver on our forecast however we see a challenge to support further upsides angela dai credit suisse analyst okay great and next regarding the industry poll showing data so the billings are at a record high and do worry some investors so how do you see the industry respond and do you have any concern on the reversal to over supply and do you negotiate with your customers on any agreements to guarantee volume and mitigate risks giel rutten president and chief executive officer okay thanks angela let me start with the second part of your question is the agreements that we have with our customers in the current market conditions we see several agreements with our customers that go beyond our regular agreements that we have and they range from prepayments to minimum loading agreements in critical areas where we see significant increases and customers are willing to support these changing commercial terms and work with us then go back to your first part of the question that was very much related to billings in the equipment industry and this is indeed a very strong year for the equipment industry we see significant installation of new capacity in the course of this year the way that we look at this is very much that in 2020 we saw a significant moderation in the installed capacity due to the covid situation so i see 2021 a bit of a catch up year where there is higher investments that will continue of course the industry is expected to grow but i see this year very much as a catch up year versus a moderate 2020 investment year when it comes to the lead times for critical equipment we are working with our suppliers there to assure that we have a forecast for 2022 in such a way that our suppliers can pre empt the volumes that they need to build for us next year and we have confident that we are able to also support our customers in the coming year does it answer your question there angela angela dai credit suisse analyst yeah thank you so much operator thank you and our next question comes from art winston with pilot advisors please state your question arthur winston pilot advisors analyst thank you and congratulations on such a great quarter for shareholders my first question is would you anticipate if you forget seasonality that the 5g business will continue to grow from this level or would you anticipate it should flatten out going forward giel rutten president and chief executive officer yeah that s a good question i mean we see the transition from 4g to 5g continue for the next two to three years this year s expected 500 million handsets being built with 5g capability which is about 40 of the total handset market we expect that to grow in 2022 to something like 65 to 70 and then the year after it will gradually move to a higher percentage the overall smartphone market if you take the overall volume it grows mid single digits percentage this year and we expect let s say a moderate growth going forward we saw some of the critical markets like for example the india market holding back a bit in the second quarter but we expect that to recover going forward so that s what we see over the next two years continued growth in 5g we have a strong footprint there and that is a strong growth driver for amkor going forward arthur winston pilot advisors analyst good in terms of capacity utilization are we bumping up against utilization any place like korea or someplace where we re fully utilized giel rutten president and chief executive officer well we installed significant incremental capacity actually in the second quarter to prepare for the third quarter ramp currently our lines are highly utilized we see still some utilization improvement possibilities in our japan factory for example but generally in the third and fourth quarter we are close to fully utilized and we also expect this year to be close to fully yield utilized in the third and fourth quarter arthur winston pilot advisors analyst well ok have you picked a location in the united states and if so what do you think the whole project will cost when you finished up with it giel rutten president and chief executive officer well we re watching closely the activities in the u s with establishing semiconductor manufacturing supply chain of course we are encouraged to see the passage share of the chips for american founding amkor is uniquely positioned to be an osat in the u s we re a u s based company we are headquartered in tempe arizona of course with respect to the u s cost structure as compared to the asian cost structure we are really currently working with federal state and local jurisdictions to really understand the incentives that could become available to build a competitive supply chain in the u s i mean currently we are actively exploring and evaluating potential sites for u s facility and to bring that up in line with other investments in the supply chain to be able to support our customers in the u s arthur winston pilot advisors analyst but nothing has been signed so far if you have yeah giel rutten president and chief executive officer no but we re zooming in to a few possible locations and we expect to finalize this in the next phase arthur winston pilot advisors analyst okay my last question is on a couple of older conference calls you alluded to going into sort of where high technology testing and emphasizing testing going forward but you really not talking about very much so is that is testing growth in the course for the future giel rutten president and chief executive officer test let me step back here to create a perspective i think turnkey services for amkor is important and turnkey basically includes bumping probing assembly and final test so testing is an integral part of our offering and we re investing significantly to expand our test capability and capacity very specifically in the 5g domain where 5g testing is a new technology area where we started to invest in about two years ago and we now have significant volume capability in place in our korea facility arthur winston pilot advisors analyst okay well thanks and thanks for the results as well giel rutten president and chief executive officer okay i appreciate that operator thank you and at this time i m showing no further questions i would like to turn the call back over to giel for closing remarks thank you giel rutten president and chief executive officer okay thank you before closing the call i would like to recap our key messages for the second quarter of 2021 we delivered all time record revenue of 1 41 billion and record second quarter eps of 0 51 for the third quarter we expect robust year over year growth of 26 with revenue of 1 7 billion supply chain constraints are expected to continue in the second half of this year with gradual recovery occurring through the first part of next year we are working closely with our customers and suppliers to help mitigate risks from these ongoing constraints the main catalyst for growth are 5g iot automotive and high performance computing and with amkor s position in these key markets we expect to outgrow the semiconductor market in 2021 and last but not least i would like to thank the global amkor team for delivering another great quarter

san juan puerto rico accesswire july 26 2021 latino wall street the difficulty in accessing formal financial education programs is one of the main challenges that the latino community has faced in

we are all aware of the significant failure of educational systems by leaving out the basic lessons on economics finance and investment during school training however accessing quality financial education programs during adulthood remains a tremendous challenge for latinos of all ages either due to lack of money to pay for the programs lack of time or adequate guidance in the industry which often seems difficult to access in this context randy garcía official instructor of latino wall street has created new possibilities of access to the benefits of the financial sector for latinos with an innovative training program the randy wall street bootcamp recognized as the financial training program in spanish the most important of the year 2020 by specialized media of the financial industry

a financial education program that breaks through traditional blueprints and goes far beyond simple investment lessons diving into the roots of the scarcity mindset from a human perspective and taking participants through a path of revealing learning ending in highly efficient investment strategies used by the most successful figures in the financial industry worldwide what makes this bootcamp unique is that it not only teaches you how to generate income with the stock market it starts from the mindset breaking down false paradigms and dismantling limiting beliefs that stand in the way of true prosperity for participants i know most people are directly focused on poverty money shortages and lack of success in the stock market and that is fine but what they are leaving out of this equation is very important all these problems can be symptoms of a disease but not its origin what disease that is precisely the topic that we address in our bootcamp we go from the depths working on your relationship with yourself and with money to solve why you are not achieving the results you want in your operation even if you are doing the same as other people who are achieving it said randy garcía on the relaunch of your program bootcamp with randy garcia a verified record of success the high expectations within the latino community for the relaunch of the intensive latino wall street

discussion of the factors that may pose a risk to the achievement of our business goals and our operational and financial objectives is contained in our annual report on form 10 k for the year ended december 31 2020 and other reports filed with the securities and exchange commission we strongly recommend readers review those disclosures in conjunction with the discussions herein non gaap financial measures to supplement our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with gaap we use certain non gaap measures of financial performance these supplemental performance measures may vary from and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures provided by other companies in our industry non gaap financial measures are not in accordance with or an alternative for gaap generally a non gaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a company s performance that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap a non gaap financial measure may also be a financial metric that is not required by gaap or other applicable requirement we believe that these non gaap financial measures when taken together with the corresponding gaap financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance by providing additional information used by management that is not otherwise required by gaap or other applicable requirements our management uses and believes that investors benefit from referring to these non gaap financial measures in assessing our operating results and when planning forecasting and analyzing future periods these non gaap financial measures also facilitate a comparison of our performance to prior periods we believe these measures are frequently used by securities analysts investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry however these non gaap financial measures should be considered in addition to not as a substitute for or superior to financial measures prepared in accordance with gaap in the information below we have provided a reconciliation of where applicable the most comparable gaap financial measures to the non gaap measures used in this press release or a reconciliation of the non gaap calculation of the financial measure in this press release we use the following non gaap measures i tangible common equity and tangible assets as we believe this information is consistent with the treatment by bank regulatory agencies which excluded intangible assets from the calculation of capital ratios ii core earnings which exclude certain nonrecurring charges primarily related to our discontinued operations and restructuring activities as we believe this measure is a better comparison to be used for projecting future results and iii an efficiency ratio which is the ratio of noninterest expenses to the sum of net interest income and noninterest income excluding certain items of income or expense and excluding taxes incurred and payable to the state of washington as such taxes are not classified as income taxes and we believe including them in noninterest expenses impacts the comparability of our results to those companies whose operations are in states where assessed taxes on business are classified as income taxes

2021 both beating expectations check out this article for more details listen to the tesla tsla q2 2021 earnings results conference call on shacknews twitch channel here s a breakdown of the q2 2021 earnings report tesla s q2 2021 earnings release highlights cash operating cash flow less capex free cash flow of 619m in q2 net debt and finance lease repayments of 1 6b in q2 in total 912m decrease in our cash and cash equivalents in q2 to 16 2b profitability 1 3b gaap operating income 11 0 operating margin in q2 1 1b gaap net income 1 6b non gaap net income ex sbc1 in q2 28 4 gaap automotive gross margin 25 8 ex credits in q2 operations record vehicle production and deliveries in q2 successful launch of fsd subscription in july started delivering the new model s to customers summary in the second quarter of 2021 we broke new and notable records we produced and delivered over 200 000 vehicles achieved an operating margin of 11 0 and exceeded 1b of gaap net income for the first time in our history supply chain challenges in particular global semiconductor shortages and port congestion continued to be present in q2 the tesla team including supply chain software development and our factories worked extremely hard to keep production running as close to full capacity as possible with global vehicle demand at record levels component supply will have a strong influence on the rate of our delivery growth for the rest of this year we successfully launched tesla vision in q2 which was mainly possible due to our ability to use data from over a million tesla vehicles to source a large diverse and accurate dataset solving full autonomy is a difficult engineering challenge in which we continue to believe can only be solved through the collection of large real world datasets and cuttingedge ai public sentiment and support for electric vehicles seems to be at a never before seen inflection point we continue to work hard to drive down costs and increase our rate of production to make electric vehicles accessible to as many people as possible revenue total revenue grew 98 yoy in q2 this was primarily achieved through substantial growth in vehicle deliveries as well as growth in other parts of the business at the same time vehicle asp1 declined by 2 yoy as model s and model x deliveries were reduced in q2 due to the product updates and as lower asp china made vehicles became a larger percentage of our mix profitability our operating income improved in q2 compared to the same period last year to 1 3b resulting in an 11 0 operating margin this profit level was reached while incurring sbc expense attributable to the 2018 ceo award of 176m in q2 driven by a new operational milestone becoming probable operating income increased yoy mainly due to volume growth and cost reduction positive impacts were partially offset by growth in operating expenses including increased sbc model s x ramp negative margin in q2 additional supply chain costs lower regulatory credit revenue bitcoin related impairment of 23m and other items cash quarter end cash and cash equivalents decreased to 16 2b in q2 driven mainly by net debt and finance lease repayments of 1 6b partially offset by free cash flow of 619m check out the full press release on the official tesla investor relations website check back for some highlights from the tesla q2 2021 earnings results conference call which starts at 5 30 pm et 5 30 pm et call supposed to start now 5 38 pm et call actually starts elon and zack are back elon opening remarks q2 2021 record quarter on many levels passed 1 billion in gaap net income for first time in company history public sentiment towards evs is at an inflection point global chip shortage is very real wide range of chips are the slowest part of the supply chain chip supply is the governing factor on tesla output out of our control substituting chipsets and rewriting firmware intense effort to find new chips thanks suppliers fsd subscription launched last month expect it to build slowly and grow momentum over time fsb subscription will be a significant factor next year doing conference call live from giga texas great work going on in germany and texas expect to be producing latest design of model y at both new factories later this year hard to explain to people how manufacturing ramps work 10 000 unique processes that have to work it s insanely difficult prototypes are easy and production is hard remarkable thing that tesla has done is that we didn t go bankrupt once they hit volume production model y will have substantial manufacturing improvements cast front and rear body in the giga texas and giga berlin model y at scale production they want to use 4680 cells for battery pack buildouts hard to predict when they will hit scale for those improvements progress being made in 4680 battery cells huge efforts being made to get factories up to speed we re making great progess on full self driving right two steps forward one step back situation highly confident that the cars will be capable of full self driving thanks to all of tesla employees cfo zack on the mic q2 was a great quarter auto gross profit and margin excluding credits improved some benefit from price increases average cost per vehicle dropping faster than asp reduction opex as a percent of revenue has declined gaap operating margins have risen from negative to double digits due to cost improvements we are recognizing the benefits of scale and fixed costs 2021 volumes will skew towards the back half of the year volume growth will be determined by part availability zack thanks team retail investor questions begin cybertruck production status update cybertruck is currently in alpha stages model y giga texas and berlin ramp takes priority over cybertruck right now we have gotta solve the chip shortage to ramp semi and cybertruck production we may be scaling large manufactured objects faster than anyone in history looking at a massive increase in battery cell availability next year target to grow cell supply ahead of the target of 50 year over year growth in vehicle deliveries contracts with cell suppliers calls for near doubling of supply next year plan to overshoot on cell supply for vehicles and then rerouting excess supply to megapacks and powerwall production apple uses 100 cobalt tesla uses no cobalt in our iron phosphate packs and barely any in the nickel targetting zero cobalt use in the future long term shift toward iron based li ion cells over time iron phosphate likely the future of battery cells 2 3 iron 1 3 nickel there s plenty of iron in the world much less nickel way less cobalt good for long term scaling to move towards iron based cells all stationary storage will move to iron in the long term most likely next question tesla opening supercharger network to other evs this year how will this work elon looking at simple solution that uses the tesla app indicate which stall you are in access the app turn on the stall set charge limit should work with any manufacturers cars smarter with how we charge for electricity rush hour charging will be more expensive vs off hours sign based discrimination can help with utilization of charger locations tesla will offer adapters at the supercharger locations and sell them to rival evs our goal is to support the advent of sustainable energy focus on minimal wait time for all customers need to grow charger locations faster than vehicle output only useful to the public if they can achieve that growth goal retail question elon said 4680 cells aren t reliable enough for vehicles what needs to be done to get them there we ll definitely make them reliable enough but the challenges will be in high volume production engineering problems making 4680 scaling difficult massive amount of equipment arriving to help with the scaling of 4680 cell production most likely hit an annualized rate of 100 gigawatt hours per year some time next year we ll have all the equipment installed by the end of the year 2021 zack last retail question can elon do an interview with fan youtube channels once a year elon uh i guess if i am doing interviews i can t do actual other work i won t do it annually i won t be default doing these earnings calls stock dropped 5 share on this going forward will not be on earnings calls unless he has something he really wants to say elon laments the difficulty of scaling production again analyst q a begins can you speak to attach rates for fsd and targets for subscription levels elon not worth commenting on now in the us we don t see regulation as a fundamental limiter we need to make it work and make fsd more reliable than human drivers we have a massive fleet autonomy needs to become so safe that it will be comparatively unsafe to operate vehicles manually next question cogs question for vehicles if you are successful with these improvements what would a successful outcome look like elon really difficult to make specific predictions clarity on the battery production improvements zack limited by the full scale cathode calendar mixing no specific challenges next question how you are looking at the 4680 sourcing what about asking other battery manufacturers for some help will the first 4680 cell we see on the road be a tesla produced cell elon we have the baskin robbins of battery situation here engineering drag coefficient with so many options inhibits our forward progress hopefully two to three form factors once they consolidate their processes working with suppliers on simplifying the processes of 4680 scaling powerwall production has been reduced due to chip shortage too follow up about stats on pricing changes and reception of fsb subscription elon not sure what they asked zack we are still early in understanding we ll just adjust pricing over time elon oof we need to make fsd more for it to be a better value proposition does it make sense to do it now it is debatable once fsd is widely deployed it will be rare to see users who don t use it conference call ends tsla stock at 665 share for more news on tesla be sure to visit our tesla topic tag on

silicon valley still the world headquarters for tech startups has never seen so much loot more valley companies went public in 2020 than in 2019 and they raised twice as much money when they did forbes calculates there are now 365 billionaires whose fortunes derive from tech up from 241 before the virus loading silicon valley made the tools that allowed americans and the us economy to survive the pandemic people got their jigsaw puzzles air purifiers and digital thermometers delivered by amazon instead of picking them up two blocks or 2 miles away the consumer economy swerved from local to national tech is triumphant in a way that even its most evangelical leaders could not have predicted no single industry has ever had such power over american life dominating how we communicate shop learn about the world and seek distraction and joy what will silicon valley do with this power who if anyone might restrain tech and how much support will they have wealth and the ability to command and control tend to produce hubris more than modesty as algorithms and artificial intelligence rearrange people into marketing groups it is uncertain to put it politely how aware the tech industry is of the potential for abuse especially when it generates profits with the house judiciary committee s recent vote to advance a series of bills that aim to reduce the power of the most dominant tech companies and with president joe biden appointing regulators who have sharp views of big tech these issues are finally set for a wider debate it has been a tumultuous 18 months and even the tech companies are having trouble absorbing what happened paypal the digital payments company had 325 million active accounts before the pandemic it reported 392 million in the first quarter the winds were blowing in our direction but we had to set the sails said dan schulman the chief executive the wind was so strong it blew tech into another universe of wealth and influence the pandemic as a whole it became clear was a tailwind for tech in very basic ways when tens of millions of people were urged and sometimes ordered to stay put in their homes naturally companies whose very existence involves facilitating virtual lives benefited the rise of the teleconferencing company zoom as both a verb and stock market winner was perhaps the easiest call of the year zoom meetings become a new normal during the coronavirus pandemic credit istock call it half luck being in the right place at the right time and half strategic tactics by companies recognising this was going to be a once in a lifetime opportunity said dan ives a managing director at wedbush securities what for most industries were hurricanelike headwinds was a pot of gold for tech pushing back the biggest and perhaps the only threat to tech now is from government tech antitrust reformers say the government response to the pandemic including the national eviction moratorium repudiated decades of entrenched belief in a hands off economic approach now the activists say they will have their moment when the government moved in a robust way to keep everybody afloat free market ideologies died said stacy mitchell co director of the institute for local self reliance a research and advocacy organisation that fights corporate control people now appreciate that the government can either make choices that centralise power and wealth or it can structure markets and industries in ways that deliver benefits more broadly there are signs of pushback against tech that would have been unimaginable a few years ago beyond the house bills ohio sued google saying it should be regulated like a public utility the teamsters one of the biggest labor unions passed a resolution to supply all resources necessary to help organise workers at amazon lina khan who made her reputation as a critic of amazon was appointed federal trade commission chair on tuesday the white house said it would nominate jonathan kanter a tech critic to be the justice department s top antitrust official but there are signs of movement in the other direction too the ftc and a coalition of state attorneys general saw their antitrust lawsuits against facebook dismissed by a washington judge last month the ftc can refile an improved suit by the end of this month any measures restricting tech will ultimately need public sentiment behind them to succeed even some of tech s biggest supporters see the potential for worry here we went from being pirates to being the navy marc andreessen a central figure in silicon valley for a quarter century told substack writer noah smith in a recent interview people may love pirates when they re young and small and scrappy but nobody likes a navy that acts like a pirate and today s technology industry can come across a lot like a navy that acts like a pirate loading beyond the threat of misuse of tech lurks an even darker possibility a misplaced confidence in the ability of one loosely regulated sector to run so much of the world weeks before the pandemic the rand corp published a study on systemic risk and how a problem with one company can imperil others in its network systemic risk was a big issue in the 2008 financial collapse when the government propped up some companies because their downfall might imperil the whole system they were too big to fail the research group investigated whether tech companies had supplanted financial firms as a key node in the economy and if the economy was growing too dependent on them amazon whose aws cloud division has millions of customers was highlighted in december rand s point was made when solarwinds which makes software that allows other companies to manage their networks was revealed to have been infiltrated by russian hackers since solarwinds had so many clients including fortune 500 companies and federal agencies the breach became one of the worst on record pushing forward the pandemic gave tech companies the power and the cash to make aggressive bets on their individual destinies buying another company was one way to do this global deal values in tech soared 47 3 per cent in 2020 from a year ago zillow a digital real estate company in seattle spent us500 million in february to buy showingtime a scheduling platform for home showings a few weeks later zillow said it would hire 2000 people increasing its workforce by 40 per cent but its biggest bet will take longer to play out before the pandemic zillow discouraged working from home like most companies then last summer it said 90 per cent of its employees could work remotely forever if they chose at the time zillow was in the vanguard of a movement now the idea of the nonvirtual office is re exerting its pull with managers richard rich barton co founder and chairman of zillow the company has changed its mind on staff working from home credit bloomberg amazon says its plan is to return to an office centric culture as our baseline google asserted the same thing although it backed off after workers rebelled ibm says 80 per cent of its employees will be in the office at least three days a week when people are remote i worry about what their career trajectory is going to be ibm chief executive arvind krishna told the bbc zillow is something of an outlier even after a year of working from home 59 per cent of its employees told the company they planned to go

fresh coronavirus outbreaks are forcing factory shutdowns in countries such as vietnam and bangladesh aggravating supply chain disruptions that could leave some u s retailers with empty shelves as consumers begin their back to school shopping the overseas work stoppages are just the latest twist in almost 18 months of pandemic related manufacturing and transportation woes the new infections come as two of the largest u s railroads last week restricted shipments from west coast seaports to chicago where a surge of shipping containers has clogged rail yards supply headaches stretching from asian factory towns to the american midwest are intensifying as the economic recovery tries to outrun the highly infectious delta variant aftershocks from earlier limits on a major chinese port following a rash of covid 19 cases are expected later this month to worsen backlogs at u s west coast facilities advertisement chronic shipping delays also are feeding inflation just as consumers prepare to stock up for the coming school year spot shortages of clothing and footwear could appear within weeks and popular toys may be scarce during the holiday season even as the u s economy is slated to enjoy its fastest growth since 1984 supply lines now are expected to remain snarled through the first half of next year or longer according to corporate executives whatever the new normal is it will happen a lot later than people assume marc bitzer chief executive of whirlpool told analysts thursday everybody hopes for new normal to be next quarter it s not going to be the pandemic has exposed fragile global supply chains across multiple continents no sooner did the recent reopening of southern china s yantian port solve one problem than the closure of bangladeshi factories until aug 5 created another advertisement white house economists say interruptions in the supply of semiconductors and home building materials are contributing to the highest inflation in 13 years the president earlier this month signed an executive order designed to increase competition and lower prices in the shipping and freight rail markets but any impact will be felt only in the long run corporations such as levi strauss harley davidson and unilever are among those rewiring their supply lines or raising prices to offset higher input costs but the biden administration has parried industry calls to help companies financially by eliminating import tariffs on chinese products or to use the national guard to physically clear the cargo jam there are things that could be done if they took it seriously as a crisis said rick woldenberg chief executive of learning resources a maker of educational toys advertisement the interruption of chinese manufacturing at the pandemic s outset toppled the first of several dominoes leading to today s global supply chain pileup while chinese factories quickly returned to normal operations an unexpected increase in american demand for goods during the work from home era discombobulated traditional trade patterns as a result ocean spanning supply chains the distinguishing characteristic of the age of globalization are failing at multiple points the massive cargo carriers that arrive off the coast of southern california some bearing more than 15 000 metal shipping containers often must wait at anchor for days before disgorging their cargo once on land containers frequently idle in temporary storage while awaiting space on an outbound truck or train incurring additional costs advertisement inland rail yards have emerged as the latest pain point for companies trying to move goods internationally trains full of clothing computers furniture and appliances have been streaming for months into midwestern hubs when the system works as designed containers are lifted from arriving trains and placed directly onto a wheeled chassis which is then hauled away by a local driver the chassis is quickly unloaded by the final customer and returned to the rail yard but this year s flood of cargo has overwhelmed the system leaving the yards without enough chassis so containers have piled up by the thousands rather than a single movement from train to truck containers now are lifted off placed in storage and then moved a second or even third time before eventually exiting the yard according to lawrence gross a transportation consultant in durango colo advertisement once you fall behind it s really hard to dig your way out gross said the system has gotten out of whack share this article share union pacific the nation s largest publicly traded railroad halted all eastbound traffic from the ports of los angeles long beach oakland and tacoma starting july 19 for at least one week bnsf railway which boasts one of north america s largest freight rail network said it was reducing the flow of containers from los angeles and long beach for two weeks in what it called a somewhat unprecedented move both railroads have made more room for containers that are awaiting pickup union pacific reopened a terminal in rochelle ill that it closed two years ago bnsf paved over two tracks to create space at a 638 acre facility in chicago it calls the nation s largest inland port advertisement rail executives acted after seaport congestion and equipment shortages reached alarming levels at the port of long beach in california cargo was sitting on the docks for up to 12 days waiting for a rail car to arrive according to mario cordero the port s executive director that compared with a pre pandemic norm of 3 5 days the idea behind the union pacific and bnsf actions is that a temporary pause will clear their backlogs just in time for the annual shipping season peak but in the short term the actions effectively shoved the problem back onto the western ports about 40 of the three mile long trains that would typically travel from long beach to chicago were canceled last week meaning that perhaps 25 000 containers that should have already left for the windy city are still stuck in california cordero said advertisement it s likely these issues will persist through the end of the year as the capacity to move boxes from our ramp to the final destination fall short of demand lance fritz union pacific ceo told an earnings call last week progress can t come soon enough for frustrated customers like learning resources woldenberg a union pacific representative called him thursday with the good news that four of his containers were ready to be collected we got four of 70 so we re

for brands such as puma champion and skechers is among those seeking relief christopher volpe the company s chief operating and financial officer said he is paying 24 000 to ship containers from asia that cost roughly 2 000 before the pandemic volpe wants the u s government to target what he calls price gouging in the logistics market and to eliminate the china tariffs which the administration is reviewing as part of a broader rethink of policy toward beijing there s really no relief volpe said i see it getting worse with the new strain of covid in the developing nations we produce in it s

there is something churchlike about the j crew store that opened in may in dallas northpark center something solemn and reverent as if the store had been designed by a shaker splinter group shoppers accustomed to the aristocratic fun of the ubiquitous j crew catalog photo after photo of those handsome impeccably proportioned couples wearing windbreakers and chinos at the shore will find a different aura here studied simplicity is the rule from the burnished wood ﬂoors and the darker burnished wood shelves to the clothes themselves folded with decorous precision or hung precisely in the clutterless windows it s a stark contrast to the razzmatazz of barneys right across the mall but in the ongoing fashion wars for the hearts and pocketbooks of the nation s consumers j crew displays the understated cool of a winner the store resembles nothing less than a chapel of worship for the fashions of the nineties such an atmosphere is fitting because j crew s customers are nothing less than true believers simplicity sells bringing revenues of around 200 million last year to the ten year old mostly mail order business which in the last few years opened a retail division seemingly lots and lots of people want to live the j crew life which means that they want to buy classic american casual wear broken in chinos vintage workshirts or the j crew barn jacket in company parlance at reasonable prices they also want to buy the j crew fantasy as portrayed in catalogs dispatched to frequent buyers almost every month within those pages are pictures of alluring people doing all sorts of outdoorsy but tasteful things from kayaking to sipping café au lait j crew people it barely needs to be said do not get stuck in overheated cars on the freeway nor do they drag screaming children through target their lives are relaxed cozy and very pretty they look like people that yuppies would kill to hang out with popular videos previous next more j crew is not the only purveyor of this vision of the world of course walk through any upper end suburban mall and you see essentially the same clothes marketed the same way at places like the gap banana republic and the sportswear sections of all the major department stores the fantasies employed to sell these garments may differ slightly the gap urges buyers to be as hip and as individualistic as teen idol luke perry customize your own denim shirt by cutting off the sleeves while banana republic whose stores look a little like lost sets from the african queen suggests that customers find themselves by traveling back to a more gracious and adventurous era still the style they all promote is basically brooks brothers meets l l bean the weekend wear of the american upper class goosed up and then manufactured and marketed for the middle and upper middle class every establishment presents a semi androgynous stock of denim and cotton shirts cotton sweaters jeans and slacks the least appealing of them is the overdone a x line from giorgio armani it s as if the italian master of precision couldn t really grasp americans unwavering devotion to sloppiness most items cost less than 100 and many are around 35 natural fibers predominate as does a worn shapeless look that used to take years to achieve that sentimental patina of faded colors and soft fabrics if the eighties were dominated by french designers who made horrifically expensive ball gowns for the wives of corporate raiders the nineties feature survivor wear for diminished expectations and a tightened economy today s clothes must be affordable because fewer people can throw money away on clothes and enduring because fewer people can throw money away on clothes even so these ensembles must have some cachet which is why the weekend clothing of the american gentry fits the bill so nicely the stuff looks good year after year doesn t cost a fortune and evokes good breeding and good taste in other words you can still fake it no business embodies promotes and profits from such new age striving better than j crew social pretensions haven t exactly gone underground it s younger hipper richer better schooled one fan said in distinguishing j crew from the gap lands end l l bean et al you can look at a person and say j crew or not j crew even better for the upwardly mobile the stock really is slightly more expensive and slightly more sophisticated than the competition s but more important these clothes are hip and stuffy at the same time the company s president and chief designer emily cinader woods has made no secret of her devotion to calvin klein the designer who elevated american sportswear to its current exalted position his inﬂuence can be seen in everything from the interior of the dallas store to the catalog photography and the elegant sweetness of the sweater sets it has been noted before that the catalogs and now the stores not only teach people how to dress but also how to live the casually sexy klein seems a much more appropriate high priest for this generation of shoppers than say the earnestly nostalgic ralph lauren even so confronting the differences between shopping the j crew catalog and shopping the j crew store is much like confronting the differences between well fantasy and reality the dallas store is one of only ten in the country so it provides a gloss of exclusivity that the catalogs lack 60 percent of the items are unique to the stores at the same time though those beautiful people who lead such leisurely lives in the catalogs are not in evidence in the store when you see the salespeople decked out in head to toe j crew they don t look like they ve been in the hamptons they look like they go to smu then too the privacy of the catalog makes it easy for a shopper to pretend that she is one of those tall thin sun kissed people who look equally great in a blazer baggy shorts or a bikini under the harsh lights of the store s small dressing rooms however such illusions are much harder to conjure up and maintain on the other hand to see the clothes naked without assistance from the catalog s photographers and stylists is enlightening some items hold up brilliantly the sensible women s bathing suits whose tops and bottoms can be purchased separately the delicate cardigans and the tough but tender polo shirts the deceptively simple palettes that in texas could work almost year round this season s choices include some particularly pretty shades of brown there are pleasant surprises a lovely silk shirtdress that appears to have a ﬂowing skirt in the catalog is actually without the aid of an electric fan stylishly severe almost half of what you see in the catalog is here the jaunty boxer shorts the sunglasses the belts the conservative and conservatively priced around 36 silk ties that would probably satisfy any dallas banker it is fun after years of catalog shopping to be able to try on items with abandon but the store also exposes j crew s weaknesses a genuine if accidental service to the consumer yes these clothes don t really have to fit very well to succeed but sometimes the cotton sweater that looks so comfortable in the catalog looks merely shapeless on the body sometimes the clothes are cheaper because they aren t well made yet spotting the puckered seam or the mangled elastic waistband in the store is so much better than spying it in the box which necessitates a return trip to the post office the larger truth is that the higher up the fashion food chain these clothes go as they attempt to encroach on designer territory the less successful they are the same yuppies who willingly shell out 36 for an oatmeal heather sweatshirt balk at paying more than 250 for a gabardine suit with a too short jacket unﬂattering and a too short skirt impractical at that price customers have many more options including the sale racks across the mall at barneys and neiman s not to mention other chains like the limited ann taylor or even brooks brothers that long standing j crew loyalty could get lost in the company s own quest for upward mobility probably not anytime soon though competitors may carp about j crew s single minded devotion to american classics wake us when it s over gripe the ads for one ﬂashy fanatically trendy new york store but shoppers who can t afford to replace their wardrobes seasonally might just find that j crew is the answer to their prayers

quarterly earnings due monday spark a turnaround that depends on the answers to these questions my cnn business colleague chris isidore reports how are things going in china unlike other automakers tesla typically doesn t break out sales by country or market but if it wants to reassure investors it may need to give details on its sales in china the largest market for auto sales tesla has been hit by widespread reports of safety problems in china including the recall of almost all cars made at its shanghai factory and a protest by tesla owners at the shanghai auto show in april that s a problem given the importance of china to the company s overall growth are sales of regulatory credits still big business analysts surveyed by refinitiv expect tesla to report net income of about 650 million which would mark its eighth straight quarterly profit after years of losses but critics point out that net income has never exceeded the money tesla gets from selling regulatory credits to other automakers who use them to meet environmental standards and avoid large fines should that change this quarter that would be a positive development especially since this source of revenue is due

missing in a container you re not losing your mind my cnn business colleague nathaniel meyersohn reports you are actually paying the same price or more these days for everyday items in your fridge and pantry while running through them more quickly the reason a tactic known as shrinkflation deployed by consumer product brands and grocery stores the phenomenon getting less for your money because a manufacturer has reduced the size of the product has been going on for decades but it typically becomes more common when companies costs go up as with the inflation surge we re seeing today how it works when costs rise manufacturers of consumer goods look for ways to offset the increases they re paying for expenses like commodities transportation and labor consumers are sensitive to price hikes but they pay less attention to how much a product weighs that means it s easier for a brand to sneak a slightly smaller box on the shelf or take a few sheets out of a toilet paper roll without stoking a consumer rebellion consumers are price conscious they will notice if an orange juice manufacturer for example raises the shelf price from 2 99 to 3 19 said edgar dworsky a longtime consumer advocate

tokyo july 27 2021 jcn newswire biogen nasdaq biib and eisai co ltd tokyo japan today announced that biogen as part of its alzheimer s disease ad research portfolio will contribute four virtual posters that showcase data from its clinical trials with aduhelm aducanumab avwa injection 100 mg ml solution at the alzheimer s association international conference aaic being held in denver colo and virtually from july 26 30 2021 aduhelm was recently granted accelerated approval by the u s food and drug administration fda as a treatment for alzheimer s disease treatment with aduhelm should be initiated in patients with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia stage of disease the population in which treatment was initiated in clinical trials there are no safety or effectiveness data on initiating treatment at earlier or later stages of the disease than were studied this indication is approved under accelerated approval based on reduction in amyloid beta plaques observed in patients treated with aduhelm continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification of clinical benefit in confirmatory trial s the accelerated approval of aduhelm has been granted based on data from clinical trials showing the effect of aduhelm on reducing amyloid beta plaques a surrogate biomarker that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit in this case a reduction in clinical decline our presentations to the dementia research community at aaic of this robust set of clinical trial data will allow us to engage directly with scientists and neurologists on in depth analyses of our findings said alfred sandrock jr m d ph d head of research and development at biogen we are looking forward to sharing our analyses on biomarkers aria and safety management the prespecified clinical endpoints in the phase 3 aduhelm trials and more the clinical trial results biogen shared about our joint asset aduhelm at aaic are important as we believe the data will help inform the scientific community as we continue to explore the strong scientific rationale behind the amyloid beta pathway as one of the earliest changes that occur in alzheimer s disease said lynn kramer m d chief clinical officer neurology business group eisai aduhelm poster presentationsitem level analysis of clinical measures in patients with early symptomatic alzheimer s disease following treatment with high dose aducanumab in the phase 3 study emergea poster presentation about item level data from the emerge trial examines results on the individual items or domains that comprised the study s pre specified endpoints measuring cognition function and behavior this analysis shows consistency of high dose aducanumab treatment effect across these individual items and domains of the primary secondary and tertiary clinical endpoints in the phase 3 trial in this data set from emerge treatment effects were observed across all six domains three cognitive and three functional measured by clinical dementia rating sum of boxes cdr sb the primary endpoint of the trial secondary endpoints of the trial included change from baseline in the alzheimer s disease assessment scale cognitive subscale 13 items adas cog13 and the alzheimer s disease cooperative study activities of daily living inventory mild cognitive impairment version adcs adl mci treatment effects were observed across adas cog13 items sensitive to cognitive change in early symptomatic alzheimer s disease and across a broad range of items measuring ability to conduct activities of daily living as measured by adcs adl mci treatment was also associated with a reduction in the behavioral and psychiatric symptoms of alzheimer s disease as measured by the neuropsychiatric inventory 10 npi 10 the tertiary efficacy endpoint of emerge these results are consistent with the results from the primary analysis of these pre specified endpoints in emerge endpoints that were selected to measure the broad array of cognitive functional and behavioral symptoms experienced by individuals with alzheimer s disease the analysis concludes that in emerge treatment with high dose aducanumab demonstrated reduced clinical decline evidenced by a statistically significant treatment effect on pre specified primary and secondary clinical efficacy endpoints compared to placebo reductions in biomarkers of alzheimer s disease pathophysiology following treatment with aducanumab were associated with slowing in clinical declinea separate poster presentation examines whether an aducanumab induced reduction in brain amyloid beta aß plaques and downstream biomarkers of alzheimer s disease pathophysiology are associated with a slowing of clinical decline the authors assessed this through three analyses the first a group level analysis examined the association between treatment effect of aducanumab relative to placebo on brain aß plaque levels and clinical decline as measured by amyloid positron emission tomography pet imaging and cdr sb respectively across all aducanumab dose groups in the prime emerge and engage clinical trials group level analyses based on data from these trials demonstrated a positive association between aducanumab treatment effect on brain amyloid beta plaques and clinical measures across dose groups and studies with the exception of the high dose group from engage the second set of analyses assessed the relationship between treatment effects of aducanumab on brain aß plaque levels downstream biomarkers of alzheimer s disease pathophysiology and clinical measures in participant level analyses in emerge and prime a greater reduction in brain aß plaque levels was associated with less decline across clinical endpoints in each study in emerge greater reduction in brain aß plaque levels was also associated with greater reduction in cerebrospinal fluid csf markers of tau and neurodegeneration as well as less decline on clinical endpoints several of these relationships were not apparent in engage in which a clinical treatment effect of aducanumab was not observed the third analysis showed that a smaller magnitude of clinical decline was observed in patients in prime emerge and engage whose brain aß plaque levels were lowered to a threshold considered to be amyloid negative relative to patients who did not reach this threshold together these results are consistent with the hypothesized mechanism of action of aducanumab and support a relationship between aducanumab induced changes in biomarkers of alzheimer s disease pathophysiology and

as the global spread of the covid 19 pandemic has not yet subsided the cgtn think tank has released an analytical report on the global situation of the covid 19 pandemic the report by sourcing data from the johns hopkins university website our world in data and pharmaceutical technology that have not been comprehensively processed analyzing research literature from the academic community and referring to the known impact of the pandemic on global economic and social development as well as the recommendations on its prevention and control from renowned public health experts the report puts together the data on pandemic prevention and control measures in 51 sample countries to make rankings as a way of reflecting the current situation of pandemic control in these countries it focuses on the importance that countries attach to personal safety social and environmental stability thereby providing ideas and directions for countries around the world to fight the pandemic the report analyzes and evaluates the current status of pandemic prevention and control in the 51 countries based on five indicators including the total number of confirmed cases the number of newly confirmed cases the total number of deaths the number of vaccinations and the full cycle from pandemic outbreak to control as of 14 july the data shows that the united states has the worst performance on three of the five statistical indicators the u s has over 34 million confirmed cases in total the highest in the world and over 600 000 deaths in total also the highest in the world and the number of days with less than 5 000 daily new cases in the full cycle from pandemic outbreak to control is only 62 still the worst among the sample countries according to the data the situation in main european countries is not encouraging when it comes to the total number of confirmed cases and deaths france the uk and italy all rank high the data shows that some asian countries have performed well in pandemic prevention and control thanks to effective measures such as entry bans quarantine and stringent testing at the border china has the lowest number of confirmed new cases among the sample countries and the highest number of vaccinations in the world singapore and vietnam rank low among all sample countries for the total number of covid 19 deaths and south korea has adjusted the level of pandemic response in a timely manner resulting in 537 days with less than 5 000 daily new cases in terms of the number of vaccinations china is one of a few developing countries with the highest number of covid 19 vaccinations due to its ability to develop and manufacture its own vaccines at present over 1 4 billion doses of covid 19 vaccines have been administered in china china has also supplied more than 500 million doses of covid 19 vaccines and stock solutions to more than 100 countries and international organizations worldwide equivalent to one sixth of the total global vaccine production however the statistics also lay bare that the vaccination progress in developing countries is significantly worse than that in developed countries due to the severe inequality in the global distribution of vaccines countries with a poor vaccination record such as vietnam and iraq are still far from reaching herd immunity due to various limitations such as poor health service and vaccine hoarding by certain developed countries the polarization in the number of confirmed cases the number of deaths and the number of people vaccinated in different countries and regions of the world as shown by the objective statistics is very much related to national pandemic prevention and control policies and measures and highlights the crucial role played by a country s government in pandemic prevention and control
baby salmon are dying by the thousands in one california river and an entire run of endangered salmon could be wiped out in another fishermen who make their living off adult salmon once they enter the pacific ocean are sounding the alarm as blistering heat waves and extended drought in the u s west raise water temperatures and imperil fish from idaho to california hundreds of thousands of young salmon are dying in northern california s klamath river as low water levels brought about by drought allow a parasite to thrive devastating a native american tribe whose diet and traditions are tied to the fish and wildlife officials said the sacramento river is facing a near complete loss of young chinook salmon due to abnormally warm water a crash in one year s class of young salmon can have lasting effects on the total population and shorten or stop the fishing season a growing concern as climate change continues to make the west hotter and drier that could be devastating to the commercial salmon fishing industry which in california alone is worth 1 4 billion advertisement the plummeting catch has already led to skyrocketing retail prices for salmon hurting customers who say they can no longer afford the 35 per pound of fish said mike hudson who has spent the last 25 years catching and selling salmon at farmers markets in berkeley hudson said he has considered retiring and selling his 40 foot boat because it s going to get worse from here winter run chinook salmon are born in the sacramento river traverse hundreds of miles to the pacific where they normally spend three years before returning to their birthplace to mate and lay their eggs between april and august unlike the fall run chinook that survive almost entirely due to hatchery breeding programs the winter run is still largely reared in the wild federal fisheries officials predicted in may that more than 80 of baby salmon could die because of warmer water in the sacramento river now state wildlife officials say that number could be higher amid a rapidly depleting pool of cool water in lake shasta california s largest reservoir is filled to only about 35 capacity federal water managers said this week the pain we re going to feel is a few years from now when there will be no naturally spawned salmon out in the ocean said john mcmanus executive director of the golden state salmon assn which represents the fishing industry when lake shasta was formed in the 1940s it blocked access to the cool mountain streams where fish traditionally spawned to ensure their survival the u s government is required to maintain river temperatures below 56 degrees fahrenheit in spawning habitat because salmon eggs generally can t withstand anything warmer advertisement the warm water is starting to affect older fish too scientists have seen some adult fish dying before they can lay their eggs an extreme set of cascading climate events is pushing us into this crisis situation said jordan traverso a spokeswoman for the california department of wildlife and fish the west has been grappling with a historic drought and recent heat waves worsened by climate change stressing waterways and reservoirs that sustain millions of people and wildlife as a result the state has been trucking millions of salmon raised at hatcheries to the ocean each year bypassing the perilous downstream journey state and federal hatcheries take other extraordinary measures to preserve the decimated salmon stocks such as maintaining a genetic bank to prevent inbreeding at hatcheries and releasing them at critical life stages when they can recognize and return to the water where they were born fishermen and environmental groups blame water agencies for diverting too much water too soon to farms which could lead to severe salmon die off and drive the species closer to extinction we know that climate change is going to make years like this more common and what the agencies should be doing is managing for the worst case scenario said sam mace a director of save our wild salmon a coalition working to restore wild salmon and steelhead in the pacific northwest advertisement we need some real changes in how rivers are managed if they re going to survive she added on the klamath river near the oregon state line california wildlife officials decided not to release more than 1 million young chinook salmon into the wild and instead drove them to hatcheries that could host them until river conditions improve much is riding on this class of salmon because it could be the first to return to the river if plans to remove four of six dams on the klamath and restore fish access to the upper river go according to plan across the west officials are struggling with the similar concerns over fish populations in idaho officials recognized that endangered sockeye salmon wouldn t make their upstream migration through hundreds of miles of warm water to their spawning habitat so they flooded the snake river with cool water then trapped and trucked the fish to hatcheries and environmentalists went to court this month in portland ore to try to force dam operators on the snake and columbia rivers to release more water at dams blocking migrating salmon arguing that the effects of climate change and a recent heat wave were further threatening fish already on the verge of extinction low water levels are also affecting recreational fishing officials in wyoming colorado montana and california are asking anglers to fish during the coolest parts of the day to minimize the impact on fish stressed from low oxygen levels in warm water advertisement scientists say the salmon population in california historically has rebounded after a drought because they have evolved to tolerate the mediterranean like climate and benefited from rainy wet years but an extended drought could lead to extinction of certain runs of salmon we re at the point where i m not sure drought is

proponents of the waiver had hoped to conclude their negotiations by the end of july and are now criticizing the european union and other developed nations for sandbagging the talks the european commission which opposes a wto trips waiver has proposed a series of measures that it argues will create greater legal certainty for nations to leverage existing trade tools in order to expand their production capacities the eu is not interested gupta said switzerland norway and the united kingdom are not engaging they re saying this or that won t work the waiver won t work there is no intention of engaging a spokesman for the eu mission in geneva declined to comment critics counter that the proposal from brussels is a distraction to redirect focus from india and south africa s earlier waiver proposal and to prevent members from engaging in more detailed negotiations the eu s actions are incredibly cynical and dangerous said lori wallach the founder of public citizen s global trade watch they have submitted a paper that basically conflicts with the text based negotiations by saying we don t want a waiver the u s meanwhile has taken a back seat in the process and enthusiasm about washington s engagement on the issue has begun to wane in the three months since trade representative katherine tai announced american support for a waiver though tai s surprise announcement briefly knocked shares of moderna inc pfizer inc and biontech se the stocks quickly rebounded and all are now trading at or near their highest levels of the year people feel that message from ambassador tai is not playing out on the ground or being implemented in a meaningful way said thiru balasubramaniam a managing director at knowledge ecology international in europe u s support for waiving intellectual property protections for coronavirus vaccines provided important momentum for the wto process u s trade representative spokesman adam hodge said via email we remain deeply engaged in discussions towards finding consensus while the biden harris administration continues to ramp up our efforts to donate doses and expand the manufacturing and equitable distribution of vaccines around the world most nations producing the vaccines oppose a blanket waiver to the wto s intellectual property rules because they say it would harm innovation do little to expand access to vaccines and may even backfire specifically opponents to the waiver say it would create a chaotic patchwork of laws unravel existing industry partnerships lead to a supply crunch for scarce vaccine inputs and inject even more uncertainty into already complex arrangements there s also the possibility that an ip waiver could result in the production of counterfeit and substandard medicines which could increase vaccine hesitancy that s already pervasive in even the world s wealthiest nations everybody knows ip isn t the problem and there is no quick fix to vaccinating the world with the latest technology said robert grant a senior director at the u s chamber of commerce most governments know this but due to the political sensitivities they won t say it publicly

silicon valley still the world headquarters for tech startups has never seen so much loot more valley companies went public in 2020 than in 2019 and they raised twice as much money when they did forbes calculates there are now 365 billionaires whose fortunes derive from tech up from 241 before the virus loading silicon valley made the tools that allowed americans and the us economy to survive the pandemic people got their jigsaw puzzles air purifiers and digital thermometers delivered by amazon instead of picking them up two blocks or 2 miles away the consumer economy swerved from local to national tech is triumphant in a way that even its most evangelical leaders could not have predicted no single industry has ever had such power over american life dominating how we communicate shop learn about the world and seek distraction and joy what will silicon valley do with this power who if anyone might restrain tech and how much support will they have wealth and the ability to command and control tend to produce hubris more than modesty as algorithms and artificial intelligence rearrange people into marketing groups it is uncertain to put it politely how aware the tech industry is of the potential for abuse especially when it generates profits with the house judiciary committee s recent vote to advance a series of bills that aim to reduce the power of the most dominant tech companies and with president joe biden appointing regulators who have sharp views of big tech these issues are finally set for a wider debate it has been a tumultuous 18 months and even the tech companies are having trouble absorbing what happened paypal the digital payments company had 325 million active accounts before the pandemic it reported 392 million in the first quarter the winds were blowing in our direction but we had to set the sails said dan schulman the chief executive the wind was so strong it blew tech into another universe of wealth and influence the pandemic as a whole it became clear was a tailwind for tech in very basic ways when tens of millions of people were urged and sometimes ordered to stay put in their homes naturally companies whose very existence involves facilitating virtual lives benefited the rise of the teleconferencing company zoom as both a verb and stock market winner was perhaps the easiest call of the year zoom meetings become a new normal during the coronavirus pandemic credit istock call it half luck being in the right place at the right time and half strategic tactics by companies recognising this was going to be a once in a lifetime opportunity said dan ives a managing director at wedbush securities what for most industries were hurricanelike headwinds was a pot of gold for tech pushing back the biggest and perhaps the only threat to tech now is from government tech antitrust reformers say the government response to the pandemic including the national eviction moratorium repudiated decades of entrenched belief in a hands off economic approach now the activists say they will have their moment when the government moved in a robust way to keep everybody afloat free market ideologies died said stacy mitchell co director of the institute for local self reliance a research and advocacy organisation that fights corporate control people now appreciate that the government can either make choices that centralise power and wealth or it can structure markets and industries in ways that deliver benefits more broadly there are signs of pushback against tech that would have been unimaginable a few years ago beyond the house bills ohio sued google saying it should be regulated like a public utility the teamsters one of the biggest labor unions passed a resolution to supply all resources necessary to help organise workers at amazon lina khan who made her reputation as a critic of amazon was appointed federal trade commission chair on tuesday the white house said it would nominate jonathan kanter a tech critic to be the justice department s top antitrust official but there are signs of movement in the other direction too the ftc and a coalition of state attorneys general saw their antitrust lawsuits against facebook dismissed by a washington judge last month the ftc can refile an improved suit by the end of this month any measures restricting tech will ultimately need public sentiment behind them to succeed even some of tech s biggest supporters see the potential for worry here we went from being pirates to being the navy marc andreessen a central figure in silicon valley for a quarter century told substack writer noah smith in a recent interview people may love pirates when they re young and small and scrappy but nobody likes a navy that acts like a pirate and today s technology industry can come across a lot like a navy that acts like a pirate loading beyond the threat of misuse of tech lurks an even darker possibility a misplaced confidence in the ability of one loosely regulated sector to run so much of the world weeks before the pandemic the rand corp published a study on systemic risk and how a problem with one company can imperil others in its network systemic risk was a big issue in the 2008 financial collapse when the government propped up some companies because their downfall might imperil the whole system they were too big to fail the research group investigated whether tech companies had supplanted financial firms as a key node in the economy and if the economy was growing too dependent on them amazon whose aws cloud division has millions of customers was highlighted in december rand s point was made when solarwinds which makes software that allows other companies to manage their networks was revealed to have been infiltrated by russian hackers since solarwinds had so many clients including fortune 500 companies and federal agencies the breach became one of the worst on record pushing forward the pandemic gave tech companies the power and the cash to make aggressive bets on their individual destinies buying another company was one way to do this global deal values in tech soared 47 3 per cent in 2020 from a year ago zillow a digital real estate company in seattle spent us500 million in february to buy showingtime a scheduling platform for home showings a few weeks later zillow said it would hire 2000 people increasing its workforce by 40 per cent but its biggest bet will take longer to play out before the pandemic zillow discouraged working from home like most companies then last summer it said 90 per cent of its employees could work remotely

found in the release also in our remarks we will be making forward looking statements and ask that you please refer to the safe harbor language contained in our news release with that krishnan i ll now turn the call over to you krishnan rajagopalan president and chief executive officer thank you susan good afternoon everyone and thank you for taking the time to join our call today as you can see from our press release our second quarter closed out a very strong first half of the year for heidrick while we performed exceptionally well and we see a number of positive market trends underway i think it s important to note that many of our clients and communities around the world continue to navigate through the pandemic we remain vigilant and are closely monitoring the situation globally as we advise our clients through the difficult challenges they face and also help them prepare for the new opportunities in a post pandemic world turning to our results building on the strong momentum of our record first quarter our recovery accelerated into the second quarter with another outstanding performance once again our results exceeded our expectations and our team delivered robust growth both sequentially and year over year in addition we re ahead of our pre pandemic performance levels in terms of both revenue growth and profitability for the second quarter record net revenue increased 79 year over year and 34 sequentially newly acquired btg which operates in the high growth on demand talent segment of the market exceeded our revenue growth expectations profitability also reached all time highs with our adjusted ebitda margin expanding 590 basis points from the first quarter of this year to 14 4 and adjusted eps of 1 14 more than tripled from last year and increased more than 30 sequentially while a portion of the strong performance can be attributed to some pent up demand still working its way through the system at this stage the outperformance is really the result of a confluence of larger forces including a seismic change in how we work driven by people working differently and new skill sets that are required to be successful companies must be agile adaptive and fluid through our executive search consulting and on demand capabilities we are helping clients solve for these complex issues while addressing major trends accelerated by society and the pandemic including diversity equity and inclusion digital transformation esg and others the result is more projects with more clients that have greater sustainability and a more diverse revenue stream we also continue to benefit from changes we ve made in the way we operate and our strong positioning in the market developed over the past several years through our own digital transformation we are executing searches at a faster pace and delivering new solutions virtually additionally tech enabling our business has accelerated productivity when we look back at our peak productivity levels in 2018 we reached 1 9 million per consultant than is one would expect this drop during the pandemic to 1 6 million per consultant in 2020 balancing our historical trends with our current rate we see this rate returning on average to annual levels of around 2 million per consultant in our heidrick consulting business we have expanded our role with clients as leadership advisors and are focused on the client journeys where we believe we can have the most impact and recently we added on demand talent capabilities through our acquisition of btg these businesses together with our firm s ip technology and global data and insights have enhanced our platform and our approach creating a stickiness with our clients that we haven t previously had turning to our recently completed acquisition of btg we are extremely pleased with the second quarter performance as revenue growth exceeded our expectations these results demonstrated accelerated client interest in high end on demand talent as companies seek fast and flexible support for a variety of business needs including corporate growth initiatives change management interim executives and project consulting btg catapults our firm into the high growth on demand segment of the talent market and also allows us to bring our clients a new solution that strongly complements our portfolio of leadership advisory and talent services and builds off of an exclusive 2 5 year partnership we had with btg prior to acquiring them as a reminder btg s talent pool includes a broad range of highly skilled independent professionals who bring deep expertise across industries and functions and are pursuing independent project work largely to increase their professional control over what they work on and who they work with while the business was already benefiting from the need for organizations to be agile there is no doubt that covid and new ways of working have greatly accelerated the business needs that btg can address demand continues to grow and already in the last few months we have raised the visibility of on demand services by engaging with the c suite with the integration of our go to market approach for executive search consulting and on demand we continue to drive productivity and collaboration across our businesses with over 40 of heidrick consulting s revenue driven by executive search we ve seen great collaboration and innovation coming from our teams including terrific cross border work leadership assessments with a focus on future ready leadership assignments and development needs the optimization of leadership pipelines culture resets as companies reenergize their workforces and align around the future of work and returning to work and how a hybrid model impacts culture among many other client projects we also continue to position ourselves as thought leaders in the market by publishing important ip including our recently issued board monitor reports in our piece on aligning culture with the bottom line how companies can accelerate their progress as the war for talent continues and the demand for our services around the globe grows our firm is thoughtfully augmenting our team to address many human capital growth opportunities we now see emerging importantly we are extremely well positioned as we go to market as one heidrick bringing the best portfolio of solutions to help our clients solve their most complex talent leadership and culture issues as i mentioned at the beginning of my remarks a larger set of themes and trends are taking hold and evolving across multiple industries further driving our momentum and likely resulting in elongated future cycles these teams include leadership teams in crisis acceleration at the top significant pe growth increased m a activity digital transformation major organization and culture shifts driven by the future of work and a renewed focus and urgency on de i and esg drilling down on a couple of these themes in terms of our integrated de i service offering which we launched in april of last year we re applying an exciting and truly differentiated approach through what we call the abcs of de i a is for accelerating the impact on results of de i b is for building the diverse leadership teams and their talent pipelines and c is for creating inclusive leadership behaviors and workplace cultures our approach to de i is resonating with our clients on the build side halfway into the year our overall u s diverse placements were tracking at 52 we also continue to focus on accelerating diverse representation at the board levels and we ve seen a significant increase in diversity placements there as well again at the mid year mark 73 of our board placements in the u s diverse and that figure was 66 globally also our de i advisory pipeline is strong with many clients focusing on the culture side developing inclusive cultures and leaders and accelerating the impact on results we expect this trend to continue and even accelerate as organizations recognize that culture is the key to attracting and retaining talent as many companies have started returning to work post covid there is also an additional impetus in terms of esg we see emerging demand from companies who are concerned about these issues and their stakeholders and are ready to take action this has translated into a sharp increase in the number of chief sustainability officer assignments we re also seeing a growing interest in board wanting to better understand the landscape and their own company s position in the private equity and vc world we see significant activity at the investment professional and at the portfolio company level where we are winning multiple searches with these clients and establishing deeper relationships from a vc and disruptive innovator s perspective functional tech and product talent remains in high demand especially from a diversity prospect our second quarter and year to date results are reflective of these trends and as mark will take us through in a moment our guidance implies continued strong performance going forward on a global basis the pandemic and geopolitical events remain fluid but we re increasingly confident in our own visibility into the positive movements we re seeing and the post pandemic opportunities play directly into heidrick s strength and position importantly we re helping our clients focus on priorities coming out of the pandemic in executive search we are placing top talent to address new needs and urgencies with a focus on increasing visible representation and diversity in heidrick consulting we re advising companies on their adaptation to new and upcoming challenges as leaders think about workplace culture and inclusion and bringing employees back to work utilizing hybrid office models and in btg we are filling on demand needs in an agile way and providing an alternative solution that resonates with our clients as always we remain focused on solving our client s most critical problems and working at the top of organizations where heidrick s brand fits today beyond tech enabling our current portfolio and further enhancing our platform to capture even more future growth opportunities we are making specific investments in our capabilities to bring our ip analytics and data to our clients and creating solutions that leverage technology and will enable us to deliver and deepen the impact of our client offerings in summary the heidrick s story is one of growth and innovation and we see multiple paths to continue our transformation to this end we remain focused on executing on our three growth initiatives which include first growing the scale and impact of both search and consulting delivering a premium service experience and the heidrick way to clients second expanding the development of leadership solutions and capabilities to address new and ongoing client comparative such as on demand talent and third investing in new product development and strategic expansion into adjacent and complementary areas with innovative tech driven offerings to drive the future growth and shareholder value in closing we are in an excellent position with an innovative strategy and the best team to help our clients deliver performance i want to thank all of our employees around the world for the great work they re doing and for the important contributions they make each and every day toward advancing our clients agendas now i ll turn the call over to mark to walk us through heidrick s very strong quarterly performance and our third quarter outlook mark mark harris chief financial officer thank you krishnan and good afternoon everyone thank you for joining our call today the continued hard work of the heidrick struggles team allowed us to continue to deliver record results in the second quarter putting our first half eps on a record pace for the full year as krishnan mentioned net revenue in the second quarter was marked by strong double digit improvements both sequentially and year over year driven by each of our businesses our practices in each region this growth coupled with strong management of the p l resulted in all time high levels of profitability before i begin my review on the second quarter i d like to point out some changes in our reporting format that we think you ll find helpful first you ll notice we established a new reporting segment called on demand talent to reflect the acquisition of btg in the quarter related to btg we added a cost of service line item on the consolidated p l the line item includes both third party contract costs primarily related to btgs independent talent and to a much lesser extent but also includes third party cost of services for some of heidrick consulting s engagement delivery which were previously included in general and administrative expenses with that today my remarks will focus more on the sequential trends as i believe these are the most meaningful comparisons in the previous year s performance last year s second quarter was clearly impacted by the global pandemic and while we recognize that many clients and communities around the world continue to struggle we see overall demand of our services continuing to grow as we advise our clients on the new challenges in a post pandemic world we re very pleased with the current market trends yet we remain vigilant of potential disruptions from the pandemic and continue to closely monitor the situation now let me provide you with some details of our historic second quarter results i m pleased to announce that we crossed over 200 million in net revenue for the first time in a quarter and hit a record net revenue of 260 million in the second quarter which was 78 6 above last year s second quarter and 34 2 above the 193 7 million we reported in the first quarter of this year which also was a record quarter of its own clearly this is much stronger than we expected when we publicly commented on our last call and coupled with the demand momentum we ve seen thus far in july we re encouraged about the third quarter which is reflected in our guidance i will comment more on this later in my prepared remarks looking at executive search net revenue was 224 1 million up 44 5 million or 24 8 compared to 179 6 million in the last quarter looking at our performance sequentially we experienced growth in all regions with the americas up 26 5 europe increasing 19 3 and asia pacific we saw growth of 25 this growth is reflected in our company s new confirmation record which increased 6 2 to nearly 1700 confirmations compared to the prior record of approximately 1600 confirmations we achieved in the first quarter of this year in addition to the higher number of engagements we closed in the period the better than expected strength was also driven by the higher value of these searches when we look at adjusted operating margin by executive search segments there is some noise in the second quarter numbers to the catch up adjustments and consultant bonus deferred compensation movements and strategic hires therefore i think it s more helpful and relevant to look beyond the quarter to the year to date numbers as the six month period better reflects our achievements when you compare adjusted operating margin from the first half of 2021 to the first half of 2020 you will see 80 basis points decrease in the americas 310 basis points improvement in europe and a 580 basis points improvement in asia however when you back out mark to market adjustments on investments from both numbers in the respective periods we see improvements of 570 basis points 790 basis points and over a 1 000 basis points in americas europe and asia respectively or 700 basis points overall in executive search in short we re very pleased with our margin improvements and given the continued market performance we expect to continue to invest in our teams accordingly turning to heidrick consulting net revenue was 17 1 million in the second quarter of 2021 which was up 3 1 million compared to the 14 million last quarter an increase of 22 this was driven by outstanding execution of our backlogs and new client engagements in fact we saw 74 increase in confirmations from 12 9 million in q1 2021 to 22 4 million in q2 2021 while also increasing our backlog at the end of the second quarter by 14 compared to the first quarter all of this helps to drive our performance expectations for the third quarter which is embedded in our revenue guidance as you see in our income statement we added our new segment on demand talent with net revenue in the second quarter of 18 7 million this performance was an outstanding achievement with revenue growth of just over 50 from a year ago and this is also much stronger than expected based on our investment models as krishnan mentioned we continue to raise the visibility and growth in demand in the on demand segment an important part of our growth strategy further revenue generated from the heidrick channel continues to show strong performance with growth year over year turning to expenses we saw salary and benefits increase with fixed compensation increasing by 6 1 million in the quarter primarily driven by increases in hiring costs separation costs and deferred compensation plans variable compensation increased by 38 6 million primarily due to the record revenue performance in the quarter irrespective salaries and benefits as a percentage of revenue decreased to 71 6 compared to 73 in the first quarter of 2021 looking at general and administrative expenses they were essentially flat for the first quarter at 27 4 million primarily due to office occupancy savings lower levels of professional services and bad debt partially offset by increases in first time intangible amortizations associated with the acquisition of btg information technology and travel and entertainment as a percentage of net revenue general and administrative expenses were 10 5 compared to 14 1 in the first quarter of 2021 a 360 basis points improvement while we re very pleased to see g a move down to under 11 our annual expectation is for an increase in the second half of the year as we expect travel occupancy and other costs to normalize a bit below historical levels with that i would imagine g a as a percentage of revenue would be closer to 12 to 13 as anticipated and disclosed in our first quarter conference call we recorded a restructuring charge of 3 2 million in the second quarter due to our real estate strategy this charge is accounting related to the specific timing of office closings moving forward we do expect additional restructuring charges pertaining to real estate in the third quarter of approximately 1 to 2 million but very limited spillover in the fourth quarter and beyond excluding the restructuring charge we re pleased to report that adjusted operating income in the second quarter of 2021 was 31 9 million a 35 9 increase from the 23 5 million we had in the first quarter of 2021 while we only saw adjusted operating margins improve approximately 20 basis points between the second and the first quarters of 2021 it s important to note that only the second quarter includes the new on demand margins when removing on demand adjusted operating margin improved 110 basis points to 13 2 from the 12 1 we saw in the first quarter of 2021 this all translated to adjusted ebitda of 37 6 million a 30 increase over the first quarter and adjusted ebitda margin of 14 4 our first half ebitda is now at 66 5 million in 2021 compared to 36 1 million in 2020 or an increase of 84 our margins also improved 330 basis points to 14 7 in the first half of 2021 our adjusted net income in the second quarter of 2021 of 22 9 million increased 31 6 from the 17 4 million in the first quarter of 2021 and adjusted diluted earnings per share of 1 14 increased 32 6 from the 0 86 with the first half 2021 adjusted eps of 2 we are on record pace to close out the year at an annual level never seen before here at heidrick given our performance in the second quarter our board of directors approved and we announced that we were paying a 0 15 per share dividend in august for all shareholders of record on august 6 now let me turn to our balance sheet where we ended the second quarter with cash and cash equivalents of 237 8 million compared to 187 8 million at june 30 2020 when backing out the 2020 credit facility outstanding balance an increase of 27 this is clearly driven by our performance discussed and we expect this trend to continue as our accounts receivable grew to 168 5 million while maintaining a strong dso target also given the completion of our acquisition of btg in the second quarter our balance sheet now reflects the addition of 5 8 million for customer relationships within 11 year amortization period software with respect to btg s talent database of 3 1 million amortized over three years trade name of 1 7 million amortized over three years and 23 8 million for the btg earn out which will accrete over the next two years as the payout becomes more estimable with regards to revenue and operating income achievements finally please also note that we added 45 5 million of goodwill to our balance sheet as well for the acquisition with regards to our strong balance sheet we re also pleased to announce that earlier this month we took advantage of favorable market conditions by renewing and extending our credit facility to july 2026 with this renewal we expanded our credit facility to 200 million with an accordion option to increase that up to 275 million now at the same terms as our previous credit facility with our strong cash position and no outstanding borrowings coupled with the new credit facility this allows us plenty of dry powder for even further flexibility to execute our growth strategy now let me turn to our third quarter outlook given the strong performance we re seeing in our markets and looking at our models we believe our third quarter revenue will be in the range of 245 million to 255 million of course this can change materially if we see other spikes in covid 19 especially with the delta variant continuing to recaveat which has impacted global equity markets how the government s choose to respond such as further lockdowns or if the governments don t take necessary steps in stimulus as well as other macro events or acute business events that are unforeseen to heidrick at this time in summary this was an outstanding quarter driven by an incredible team at heidrick and we anticipate we will continue on our current growth trajectory further we re very pleased with how quickly heidrick struggles managed through the 2020 recession returning well past pre pandemic levels within a very short period of time and the financial position we are in to successfully execute through the new growth cycle we re currently experiencing with that we ll be happy take your questions operator over to you questions and answers operator thank you for our first question we have josh vogel from sidoti josh your line is open josh vogel sidoti company analyst thanks good afternoon guys thanks for taking my questions i have a couple here my first one just given the need for talent you discuss pent up demand and obviously the robust activity levels of late are you finding this elevated war for talent that s yielding any uptick revenue or just instances where the actual comp is exceeding what the original estimates were mark harris chief financial officer sure josh it s mark would you mind just repeating that one more time josh vogel sidoti company analyst yes sure i was just curious if you were benefiting from any uptick revenue where the actual comp was coming in higher than your original estimates just given how is the elevated war for talent and pent up demand by global companies mark harris chief financial officer yes so the answer is yes and what we were able to see was a couple of things the first one is in terms of normal retainers we haven t seen really any material modifications in terms of what that is as well as the mix etc so i think we ve held that pretty well the structures have held pretty well the uptick definitely have come in stronger than we anticipated we have seen higher upticks in the previous periods but it was obviously a great strength so for example in americas they were up about 9 in europe they were up almost 32 in asia pacific they were up almost 20 so in terms of where we thought those would come in i think you had kind of two things going on within the revenue guidance one is clearly we had great confirmation trend we ve disclosed almost 1700 confirmations and that was up from the record 1600 not more than just a quarter ago but by holding and maintaining our discipline in terms of both structure and the components of it with the upticks kind of kicking in that clearly helped everything out josh vogel sidoti company analyst thank you for those insights and krishnan you had a comment about executing searches at at a faster pace enabled by technology i was wondering if you could quantify this and is that may be a new norm or given the growing use of technology in the search process or is it just a function of the current environment and pent up demand mark harris chief financial officer josh i m going to try answer that for you in washington dc there is a fire alarm going off and krishnan had to run out of the building so i m going to do my best to be krishnan if that s ok josh vogel sidoti company analyst okay mark harris chief financial officer one of the things that we saw to answer your question is with the enablement of the technology and let s be frank a little bit a big push from the covid side of it has really allowed us to kind of reduce our days to complete by almost 25 so without flying candidates all over the place with the implementation of zoom interviewing with the digital assessments which we ve had for a long time but really i think has forced the acceptance rate of a lot of the technology of heidrick connect and everything that we kind of put in place that and it s hard to unscramble how much is waiting on that but we have seen a nice drop and i guess the question for us is is that the new norm we think actually it probably is there might be some lingering for final mile to meet candidates but it doesn t seem to be changing the new methodology if i can call it that similar with heidrick consulting where we ve seen again acceptance of our digital delivery mechanism we ve seen that kind of come through that s helped us out a bit in terms of quickly achieving again some revenue targets and again i think their accomplishment of the 17 million over 17 million in revenue they were able to achieve this quarter is really speaking to that so and btg obviously we ll get you some comparisons and rollout to have another quarter in there and we can kind of demonstrate it but i think really that is really unlocking some value for us and hopefully some differentiation which we think is really helping us in the market josh vogel sidoti company analyst that s helpful thank you and i just have a couple of quick ones around btg and how should we think about the cost of service line going forward from like a quarterly run rate perspective is it more fixed is it variable in there just how should we think about that as btg grows mark harris chief financial officer btg is always going to have kind of that cost of service percentage in their model right so unlike an executive search or heidrick consulting where there s an internalization of us able to process this is clearly going to come from independent outside consultants that are going to be engaging so you have to figure that plus or minus around that amount of percentage of revenue is kind of going to walk out that door because we have to pay the third party consultants to implement interim and project work the idea what we should have behind it is really a scale right as we continue to grow that element we should be able to see that scale kind of come through it was really nice for their first reported quarter to show more than breakeven as i ve made comments about last quarter it s always going to flirt with plus or minus on the breakeven side of it they had a real excellent quarter and again the team there does a fantastic job in managing that side of the business so we saw i think it was 0 8 margin to figure as we kind of get further down the road with scale we should be able to get that up considerably but again just to set expectations we re not expecting this to be a 15 20 margin business this will always kind of play in that 8 10 maybe a slightly above that margin business when it s finally its steady state of growth josh vogel sidoti company analyst that s helpful thanks and i think that it s still a small but rapidly growing part of the business i was just curious how much on demand or btg revenues into your q3 guidance number using q2 as a base and just kind of like a tangent to that how much visibility do you have in the btg pipeline relative to executive search mark harris chief financial officer it s very similar right so they have a backlog they understand the client engagements they know what s in their pipeline in the sales strategy they re a very well managed business so their number is obviously in our guidance we don t really break that out in terms of how much of hc or on demand or executive search we all lump it up into one but i guess my comment would be it s not going to be too dissimilar on what you re seeing around the quarter in the first quarter at least and you would expect again as we kind of grow the business and we think about strategically this is very much a u s centric type business right now with a little bit in europe and but we want to again work with them in our channel and really open up really open up asia pacific and really see where we can take the growth of this next that s kind of where one plus one equal three here josh vogel sidoti company analyst great and thank you and just lastly i have seen my notes btg doing about 50 million in 2020 the run rate is 50 growth based on q2 is that a good number we should think about 2021 mark harris chief financial officer well i think 50 growth is very very high yes i don t think we re going to accord with that too much i would say again when we talk about kind of high growth we re thinking about i guess respective high growth maybe that s a nice way to say it where we would say look it s certainly going to be long term better than executive search executive search as you know has been a 4 5 third year growth business and we would obviously expected it to be significantly better than that especially as they re kind of coming into that early stage if you will in terms of being plugged into our engine etc so my overarching comment would be i think you re going to see growth obviously we think it s very strong growth the ability to do so but 50 is a pretty pretty lofty target i don t think we can achieve that one josh vogel sidoti company analyst all right got you well thanks so much for the insights and for taking my questions mark harris chief financial officer no problem operator and for our next question we have tobey sommer from truist securities tobey your line is open tobey sommer truist securities analyst thanks i was curious if you could catch us up and just remind us of how many partnerships like btg the company has entered into in recent years because it seems like you had kind of learned how to work together before coming together thanks mark harris chief financial officer yes we don t obviously disclose that externally and we have partnerships again if you think about it this partnership was probably a little bit more of tobey what i would kind of call a third lane or an adjacency something very similar to what we do but in a different way partnerships that we also look at are what we will call vendor type partnerships technology partnerships etc that really won t become part of us it really is partnering and potential revenue share stream back and forth so in terms of the way that we kind of categorize our partnerships they can either land in alignment it can land in technology it can land in again processing and making us much more efficient which again kind of goes into that 25 reduction in days to complete methodology so those are the types of things that we kind of look at in terms of our partnerships but we don t really want to go out with how many partnerships we have so we think it s just that s less concerning more than when we get something and we talk talked to you about it and like we do with btg we talk we announced the partnership you re going to hear those and those ones we will announce when we have them tobey sommer truist securities analyst okay could you talk about what remote work might mean in terms of the executive search business are you seeing search confirmations or seniors in the c suite people that are more flexible geographically now and if so if there is a client in a not a sort of a top city if their c suite could potentially work in different locations at least primarily what are the implications for your business mark harris chief financial officer well i think that s exactly right i think the idea is it s opened up the market to a much greater population because of what i would say the clients in assistance if you will on having to be in a set place heidrick is probably a good example of that you have myself in the new york stanford area you have krishnan in dc mike cullen coo he sits up in boston enrolled in different locations yet we ve been very i think we ve been very effective in our working and i think a lot of companies are more like that growing to that model where it is less important on where the sea is located probably more about world travel is going to be more of the topic but we are and that of course opens up a lot more of the population where if there is lack in insistence of the person needs to move to wherever the headquarters is it really allows you to kind of interview more candidates and i think that s also helping us get the placements a little bit quicker because of the quality of candidates may not be actually in the cities where you re looking at your headquarter so we ve seen that quite a bit we re continuing to see that trend quite a bit and i don t think that s going to slow down tobey sommer truist securities analyst thanks is it also a contributor to the upticks because if you re able to recruit out a market you theoretically might be recruiting from a city with a higher cost of living than where the headquarters of your client may be mark harris chief financial officer it s a bit i had a similar question and here s what it kind of gets first on the board work it s kind of irrelevant i think you agree with that on the ceo or cfo or where we kind of look at that it s not i would imagine as much of a differential as you would think right if you have a ceo of a fortune 500 it s pretty much going to be on par with the ceo of a fortune 500 and it s really dramatic but for the most part we really see that kind of space that industry that seg is really going to be what you re competing against or competing again if i just use the coke pepsi right they re both competing potentially for the same type of resource and that s really what drives it more than where the location of that role is so i think that s probably less agnostic toward that end of it obviously that will play a little bit of role especially in london where it s very expensive i d imagine that would play versus somebody in cork ireland so again we do see it a little bit but i think in overall i don t think that s a real differential in terms of the big difference in price tobey sommer truist securities analyst okay just a couple more from me how do you view the company s performance versus growth in the end markets that you have exposure to to the extent you re able to rather benchmark or communicate with competitors and what they re seeing mark harris chief financial officer maybe an example tobey just help me understand the question tobey sommer truist securities analyst are you taking share keeping share or losing share based on your growth rates mark harris chief financial officer that s it directly and it s like the krishnan is back as well i ll try to answer it and if krishnan wants to jump in he can but in terms of market share it s always very difficult for us to measure as you know there is only one other public company and the rest is private and some of the industry data we get is survey based and i don t put a lot of weight on it overall based on the growth that we re seeing based on what we can benchmark ourselves to i definitely know we re holding our own eyes highly suspect on that we re doing better in terms of some market trends but without really again i m very specific on actually having numbers that are audible if you will it gets to be quite difficult but we do see it and lot of the other metrics that we kind of manage in terms of wins in terms of things that we re competing against in terms of what we know and what we re seeing out in the market i definitely have a positive feel krishnan i don t know if you want to jump in on that as well krishnan rajagopalan president and chief executive officer sure hi apologies good to see the fire emergency systems continue to work in these buildings look we entered the we tracked this last year and i think we held our own we ve more than held our own last year based on the information we were able to grab and as marks says it s hard to see that so we felt we had excellent positive momentum on share so we continue to do well so i think we re in a good spot on it we don t have yet the numbers so we ll probably take six months or so in this business to understand that a bit more but feeling pretty good about it tobey sommer truist securities analyst thanks and last one from me how are you thinking about internal headcount growth in executive search and consulting going forward because the productivity has been surging and i don t know whether that has continued room to run or what have you but at the end of the day it s still a people business and over the long term you ve got to grow those to grow the company krishnan rajagopalan president and chief executive officer yes look we re going to continue to add strategically which is what we ve done actually we ve been very strategic in our hiring filling in gaps in geographies and practice areas and we re going to continue to do that so heidrick will be doing that it s going to be on limited basis it s going to be great culture fits and and just going back to productivity look that productivity number is very heady right now and i think on average if we look at it we re going to be over time i think will annualize to back to the 2019 if not a little above that 2 million level so given everything that we ve done we feel good that we can continue to drive productivity as well tobey sommer truist securities analyst thank you very much operator for the next question we have kevin steinke from barrington research kevin your line is open kevin steinke barrington research analyst thank you good afternoon so i wanted to just continue on the discussion about btg a little bit and how you go about growing and scaling that business over the longer term i know you re now able with that as part of your business you re introducing it to your clients but do you have the number of independent on demand professionals in the network needed to meet current and long term demand or do you how do you go about continuing to attract that independent talent to the network that you need to grow over the longer term krishnan rajagopalan president and chief executive officer yes let me start with that and mark if you want to add to that as well look we ve got a in btg we ve got a fantastic asset in the talent as well it was always at the high end of premier destination for executive talent at that level and we continue to grow that and we think the relationship with heidrick only helps that as well so we are there is a process in place and we continue to augment we continue to grow that and as the market grows that needs to grow as well and it will so that isn t the limiter right now so we re not worried about it and we will continue to grow the asset kevin steinke barrington research analyst okay great are there other would you see this as an area for other potential acquisition opportunities the independent on demand talent space to further scale that area of the business krishnan rajagopalan president and chief executive officer yes look first i want to say that i think btg is doing a great job as just organic growth so we look to btg to continue to do that we number two look to the heidrick channel to be able to continue to augment that growth and then i know we ll clearly in some markets will be open to look at different ways to grow that business as well btg is in europe but it s not everywhere in europe so there could be opportunities there so there are many other opportunities like that but btg is doing a great job and we ll be open to looking at various avenues for growth there kevin steinke barrington research analyst okay thanks and then i guess just finally on btg can you just talk a little bit more about the cost that you need to scale that you need to leverage to get to those targeted margin levels over the longer term is it kind of a sales and marketing investment you re leveraging or some sort of back office g a internal head count just trying to get a sense of how you drive the scale and leverage in that business over the expense base mark harris chief financial officer sure i mean again remember that the cost of sales is always going to be that percentage plus or minus so that s you re really playing with kind of what s left over and the answer to your question is there s always going to be minor scale in the sales leadership side of it potentially some here and there but this is where again at this level and above we should start seeing where the margin improvements start coming in as you kind of let s call it double the business is where you would be able to see those margins really starting to kind of come twofold in terms of what we kind of discussed in early part of the call so it s marginal it s incremental it will be a bit of a part over time but as you know again just for sake of argument and for analytics doubling the business you d expect that would move you up into the margin kind of again getting closer and closer to the sustainable side of it whichever kind of those margins that we were discussing it s not going to happen overnight that will be my comment kevin steinke barrington research analyst okay great that s helpful and mark you mentioned g a getting closer to 12 to 13 of revenues should we think about that as kind of a longer term target or where you think it will trend this coming quarter just any more color around that mark harris chief financial officer yes i mean when i saw it at 7 4 i just wanted to make sure that people understood is that was one heck of a revenue number on the top line and even though on a gross dollar value we did a heck of a job we ve been cutting into that so the real estate shift in the strategy we did last year as well as kind of rebalancing ourselves etc i think we ve done a really good job at maintaining that at a reasonable expectation i think when the reason it will go up for the most part is we would expect time and expense and mills to kind of start coming back a little bit as people travel a little bit more hopefully and other components occupancy costs as well as potentially some professional services costs those will come back into the mix and that s when it makes that people understood is don t hold me at the 10 i mean look it s a heck of a lot better than last year at 19 and our peak of 25 so i do think when we re talking about holding in that 12 13 is really kind of an objective but as you know all too well that is a function of revenue too so if this revenue maintained we would have no problem maintaining that the question is is the market really long at this level and that s the part that i m sure like all of us we re eager to find out kevin steinke barrington research analyst okay thanks that s helpful and then just lastly krishnan i believe you mentioned in your prepared comments you made a reference to potential for elongated future cycles i think related to some of the just the demand drivers and market drivers you re seeing can you maybe just expand upon what you meant by that in terms of maybe a future demand cycle being elongated or longer lasting or what you re thinking about in terms of the market you re seeing right now yes absolutely okay i was talking about a lot of the thematic things that are shaping society as well and we think are influencing our business as opposed to simply economic cycles so give you two examples i mean if you look at de i we see that as a journey that s going to continue for a while outside of purely economic cycles if you look at what s starting to happen with esg sustainability side we re going to see that continue we are seeing digital transformation which actually started several years ago continues as well so this is what i was referring to when i was talking about elongated cycles really macro themes that are impacting and driving our business as well in a positive way that go a bit outside of the traditional gdp scenario okay thanks that s helpful commentary i appreciate you taking the questions mark harris chief financial officer no problem thank you there are no further questions at this time i would like to turn the call over back to krishnan for closing comments krishnan rajagopalan president and chief executive officer great thank you and thank you everyone for joining the call let me just close by acknowledging the great work of our team these are still somewhat uncertain times ahead for all of us we are encouraged by progress that we see with vaccine rollouts in some places but also recognize that it s not universally positive news yet i think our global team has done incredible job and remain focused on the things we can control particularly focused on taking care of our clients and that hard effort we ve been putting in as a team to transform our business is also paying off not only for our clients but also for us in performance so thanks all of you for participating today and your interest in heidrick struggles have a great week and we look forward to catching up with you again soon thank you operator duration 50 minutes call

chief executive officer thanks jennifer good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining the call today today i will review our second quarter performance and will provide the outlook for third quarter i will also make a few comments on dynamics in the markets and technologies that amkor is well positioned for future growth we delivered solid financial results in the second quarter with an all time quarterly revenue record of 1 41 billion above the high end of guidance and an increase of 20 year on year and 6 sequentially following a strong first quarter continued momentum resulted in better than expected performance in all end markets most notably communications and consumer where we saw a sequential increase of 6 and 9 respectively high factory utilization for our advanced technology portfolio and continued improvement in our mainstream business resulted in a record second quarter eps of 0 51 the 6 sequential growth in communications exceeded our expectations after a strong first quarter in the segment year on year our communications business grew 28 representing 40 of total quarterly revenue for the full year of 2021 we expect continued growth in this business driven by the strength in the smartphone market particularly in 5g with current industry forecast of over 500 million 5g enabled smartphones to be built this year amkor has a leading position in the 5g rf domain and over recent years we have established a proven technology portfolio to address the advanced requirements needed to enable 5g with our vs and bga advanced sip platform we have established a preferred advanced packaging solution for this demanding application amkor s industry leading design rules dual sided molding technology conformal shielding together with in line rf testing deliver best in class integration levels in the high volume high yield manufacturing process we continue to develop technology and manufacturing scale to support our customers in this growing market segments in the automotive and industrial market we achieved another quarterly revenue records year on year growth of 33 underlines the recovery in this end markets some supply chain constraints especially in the wafer and substrate supply dampened the even further growth we continue to see strength in the mainstream part of our automotive portfolio and have received several customer endorsements especially for the quality and delivery performance in our philippines factories in the advanced product part of our portfolio we ran several new products in the automotive sensor domain for radar sensors we utilized wafer level fan out technology in our portugal factory customers are rapidly adopting this technology due to the strict requirements of radar sensors in addition to the growing sensor market we also ran several new products targeting the automotive high power domain accelerated by the growth of the ev market for the second half of the year we anticipate the automotive supply chain will gradually improve resulting in further growth beyond the second half we believe the growth drivers in this market remain in place and we expect that semiconductor content per car will further increase due to accelerated proliferation of driver assistance electronics and the electrification of more car models strength in the consumer market resulted in a better than expected sequential increase of 9 we continue to diversify our product and customer portfolio in iot wearables and ran several new products in the quarter we expect this markets will be an important driver of growth and our overall product and customer pipeline for advanced sip solutions in this domain remains strong in addition to the wearable market we also experienced strength in traditional consumer products like gaming display and video devices and we expect continued growth going forward revenue in the computing market set another quarterly record with sequential growth of 6 and year on year growth of 21 we experienced solid performance in all computing applications and a further strengthening of our project pipeline we are investing in technology and manufacturing scale to capitalize on opportunities across the computing domain from personal computing to infrastructure and data centers we see more opportunities in this market in the emerging segments like ai and high performance computing and then the changes brought by the ongoing de verticalization in this market finally our test business grew 12 year on year in the second quarter as we broaden the scope of our test services for 5g communications and the system level testing and expand our test attach rates to prepare for the volume ramp in the second half of 2021 our manufacturing organization has expanded clean room space and capacity most notably for advanced packaging in our factories in korea also we are encouraged by progress in the u s on investment policies to incentivize domestic semiconductor manufacturing the amkor team is exploring a possible factory location to align with the investments in the u s supply chain of other major semiconductor companies during the quarter we increased our capex target for the year to around 775 million partially an anticipation of some initial investments in a new factory location other major investments in 2021 are planned for wafer level and flip chip technology sip and test capacity as well as facility expansions and specific investments to support our industry 4 0 program now let me turn to our third quarter outlook we expect significant growth with revenue of 1 7 billion at the midpoint of guidance this would represent a sequential increase of 21 and the year on year increase of 26 the ongoing short term constraints in the supply chain of materials and equipment are expected to continue into the second half of 2021 and we are working closely with our suppliers and customers to help mitigate these risks for full year 2021 we expect growth in all end markets particularly communications and we are well positioned to support the continued recovery in automotive we remain confident in our strong market position and the overall demand environment and expect to outgrow the semiconductor market in 2021 megan will now provide more detailed financial information megan faust executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you giel and good afternoon everyone today i will review our second quarter results and then provide some comments about our third quarter outlook second quarter sales were better than expected up 6 from the first quarter to an all time quarterly record of 1 41 billion all of our end markets experienced growth this quarter and as giel noted revenue in both automotive and industrial as well as computing were new quarterly records advanced products revenue grew 17 in the first half of 2021 over the same period last year and represent approximately 70 of our business our mainstream products revenue also improved driven by the recovery in automotive and increased 20 in the first half of 2021 over the same period last year advanced sip products grew double digit sequentially in q2 primarily in support of the communications and consumer end markets with strong growth in both advanced and mainstream products gross margin grew 300 basis points over prior year q2 to 19 4 and gross profit dollars of 273 million is a second quarter record material content increased 150 basis points sequentially and cost in support of second half growth moderately constrained gross margin operating expenses for the quarter came in slightly lower than expected at 118 million and operating income margin growth outpaced gross margin expansion increasing 365 basis points year on year to 11 net income for the quarter was 126 million resulting in record q2 eps of 0 51 q2 ebitda increased over 40 year on year to 295 million and ebitda margin was 21 we ended the quarter with 885 million of cash and short term investments and total liquidity of 1 3 billion our solid financial position provides flexibility to continue to invest in growth opportunity moving on to our third quarter outlook we expect revenue to be between 1 65 billion and 1 75 billion gross margin is expected to be between 18 5 and 20 5 consistent with historical seasonality q3 expectations include a significant increase in communications driven by advanced sip products we expect q3 operating expenses of around 115 million our plans for controlling opex in a significant growth environment are expected to contribute to operating income margin expansion of around 150 basis points we expect full year effective tax rate to be reduced to around 15 due to discrete tax benefits recognized in the first half of 2021 and favorable foreign currency movements q3 net income is expected to be between 150 million and 200 million resulting in eps of 0 60 to 0 80 this would represent over 80 growth in eps at the midpoint compared to the prior year quarter we are increasing our planned capital expenditures to 775 million for the year to meet strong second half demand and for our initial investments in a new factory location our target capital intensity remains in the low teens and we expect free cash flow for 2021 to exceed prior year free cash flow with that we will now open the call up for your questions operator questions and answers operator thank you and our first question comes from haas liu with credit suisse please state your question angela dai credit suisse analyst hi this is angela on behalf of randy and congratulations on the great quarter so if you can give a little more color on what has drove the strength of your third quarter what would be driving the strength of your third quarter sales and relative strength and weakness by application and your initial views for 4q megan faust executive vice president and chief financial officer hi angela let s just clarify the question there was a little bit of audio on our side so i think your question is to add some color with respect to any supply constraints that we might be experiencing heading into the third quarter two perhaps expand by application on those supply constraints and then whether or not we have any comments as it relates to impact in the fourth quarter did i capture your question appropriately angela dai credit suisse analyst actually my question is more so around this larger drivers of your performance megan faust executive vice president and chief financial officer okay so end market drivers okay angela giel would you like to address the end market drivers giel rutten president and chief executive officer yes angela let s try to summarize that the main catalyst for growth is certainly in the third quarter is 5g communication then iot specifically iot wearables generally automotive and in automotive we see strength in the driver assistance features and also in the automotive power domain and then of course high performance computing in general but if you look specifically into q3 we see that the communication market is strong we expect growth both in the volume of smartphones to be sold in the third quarter as well as an increase in the number of 5g handsets to be sold comparing to last year it is expected that this year 500 million smartphone 5g enabled handsets will be deployed into the market which is a doubling compared to last year and that drives a significant semiconductor content where amkor has a good position in the rf domain but also in multiple other components in the 5g smartphones megan faust executive vice president and chief financial officer so angela just to add to giel s comments to give you some color our 21 increase for q3 at the midpoint are the last five years we ve had about 15 increase so that significant increase in q3 we re expecting as giel mentioned is led by communications typically if you look back at our q3 performance you d see around a 30 increase for communications and we re expecting something around 40 for the communications market any follow up questions angela angela dai credit suisse analyst yeah sure about your third q gross margin guide it s you briefly mentioned about some cost factoring in can you elaborate up on that the mid 20 margin megan faust executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah angela are you speaking specifically to the q3 guide for gross margin or specific to the q2 actuals i just wanted to make sure i addressed the right question angela dai credit suisse analyst yeah the 3q guide megan faust executive vice president and chief financial officer okay yeah so our mid point for the gross margin guide is flat sequentially acknowledging revenue is expected to increase 21 so as you know gross margin can fluctuate based on utilization or product mix so advanced sip revenue is increasing significantly in q3 as i mentioned that is supporting the communications market and advanced sip does have a higher material content and so that s what impacts product mix however our gross profit dollars are projected to be up over 50 million or 20 and operating income margin is expected to expand around 150 basis points sequentially eps is also expected to be up around 0 20 or 40 to a record 0 70 so overall while the product mix can have an impact on gross margin percentage advanced sip is profitable generating good results and cash flow any angela dai credit suisse analyst and a follow up around yeah around your sip pipeline can you give an update of your sip pipeline the revenue expectation for the full year and do you see growing factoring multi sourcing on some of the consumer audio products giel rutten president and chief executive officer thanks angela let me try to answer that question i think with respect to our sip pipeline as we already mentioned earlier we have a strong pipeline both in the communications segment as well as in the consumer segment for communication we see healthy growth in the third quarter and of course we don t guide for the full year but we expect that to extent in the fourth quarter also for the consumer end market we are ramping up several new products in the second quarter as well as in the third quarter and we see continued strength there proliferating in multiple products as well as in multiple customers there so going forward we expect sip to be an important product part of our product portfolio in amkor where it goes from starting with communication it extends into the consumer market as well as in the automotive and to computing market any further questions there angela dai credit suisse analyst yeah thank you on lead times are your lead time running normal for assembly and test and how are your lead times now are you getting additional equipment giel rutten president and chief executive officer okay angela in the supply chain we share we are experiencing several challenges one is in the lead time of equipment in our new equipment we saw over the last six to eight months lead times actually doubling but overall we were able to install the capacity that we require for our ramp in the third quarter so although that lead times are extending we don t see that as a bottleneck for the second half of this year and we share already an anticipation of these lead times we in selective areas ordering equipment for the following year now if you look to the lead time for our manufacturing process these lead times are not changed we don t see an extension there we start our manufacturing process when we have all the materials available and then our manufacturing lead time is unchanged and that was both for assembly as well as test of course besides equipment we see more challenges in the supply chain for material specifically where we see significant challenges for substrates and lead frames in different parts of the market for the second and third quarter we are able to work with our suppliers and customers to deliver on our forecast however we see a challenge to support further upsides angela dai credit suisse analyst okay great and next regarding the industry poll showing data so the billings are at a record high and do worry some investors so how do you see the industry respond and do you have any concern on the reversal to over supply and do you negotiate with your customers on any agreements to guarantee volume and mitigate risks giel rutten president and chief executive officer okay thanks angela let me start with the second part of your question is the agreements that we have with our customers in the current market conditions we see several agreements with our customers that go beyond our regular agreements that we have and they range from prepayments to minimum loading agreements in critical areas where we see significant increases and customers are willing to support these changing commercial terms and work with us then go back to your first part of the question that was very much related to billings in the equipment industry and this is indeed a very strong year for the equipment industry we see significant installation of new capacity in the course of this year the way that we look at this is very much that in 2020 we saw a significant moderation in the installed capacity due to the covid situation so i see 2021 a bit of a catch up year where there is higher investments that will continue of course the industry is expected to grow but i see this year very much as a catch up year versus a moderate 2020 investment year when it comes to the lead times for critical equipment we are working with our suppliers there to assure that we have a forecast for 2022 in such a way that our suppliers can pre empt the volumes that they need to build for us next year and we have confident that we are able to also support our customers in the coming year does it answer your question there angela angela dai credit suisse analyst yeah thank you so much operator thank you and our next question comes from art winston with pilot advisors please state your question arthur winston pilot advisors analyst thank you and congratulations on such a great quarter for shareholders my first question is would you anticipate if you forget seasonality that the 5g business will continue to grow from this level or would you anticipate it should flatten out going forward giel rutten president and chief executive officer yeah that s a good question i mean we see the transition from 4g to 5g continue for the next two to three years this year s expected 500 million handsets being built with 5g capability which is about 40 of the total handset market we expect that to grow in 2022 to something like 65 to 70 and then the year after it will gradually move to a higher percentage the overall smartphone market if you take the overall volume it grows mid single digits percentage this year and we expect let s say a moderate growth going forward we saw some of the critical markets like for example the india market holding back a bit in the second quarter but we expect that to recover going forward so that s what we see over the next two years continued growth in 5g we have a strong footprint there and that is a strong growth driver for amkor going forward arthur winston pilot advisors analyst good in terms of capacity utilization are we bumping up against utilization any place like korea or someplace where we re fully utilized giel rutten president and chief executive officer well we installed significant incremental capacity actually in the second quarter to prepare for the third quarter ramp currently our lines are highly utilized we see still some utilization improvement possibilities in our japan factory for example but generally in the third and fourth quarter we are close to fully utilized and we also expect this year to be close to fully yield utilized in the third and fourth quarter arthur winston pilot advisors analyst well ok have you picked a location in the united states and if so what do you think the whole project will cost when you finished up with it giel rutten president and chief executive officer well we re watching closely the activities in the u s with establishing semiconductor manufacturing supply chain of course we are encouraged to see the passage share of the chips for american founding amkor is uniquely positioned to be an osat in the u s we re a u s based company we are headquartered in tempe arizona of course with respect to the u s cost structure as compared to the asian cost structure we are really currently working with federal state and local jurisdictions to really understand the incentives that could become available to build a competitive supply chain in the u s i mean currently we are actively exploring and evaluating potential sites for u s facility and to bring that up in line with other investments in the supply chain to be able to support our customers in the u s arthur winston pilot advisors analyst but nothing has been signed so far if you have yeah giel rutten president and chief executive officer no but we re zooming in to a few possible locations and we expect to finalize this in the next phase arthur winston pilot advisors analyst okay my last question is on a couple of older conference calls you alluded to going into sort of where high technology testing and emphasizing testing going forward but you really not talking about very much so is that is testing growth in the course for the future giel rutten president and chief executive officer test let me step back here to create a perspective i think turnkey services for amkor is important and turnkey basically includes bumping probing assembly and final test so testing is an integral part of our offering and we re investing significantly to expand our test capability and capacity very specifically in the 5g domain where 5g testing is a new technology area where we started to invest in about two years ago and we now have significant volume capability in place in our korea facility arthur winston pilot advisors analyst okay well thanks and thanks for the results as well giel rutten president and chief executive officer okay i appreciate that operator thank you and at this time i m showing no further questions i would like to turn the call back over to giel for closing remarks thank you giel rutten president and chief executive officer okay thank you before closing the call i would like to recap our key messages for the second quarter of 2021 we delivered all time record revenue of 1 41 billion and record second quarter eps of 0 51 for the third quarter we expect robust year over year growth of 26 with revenue of 1 7 billion supply chain constraints are expected to continue in the second half of this year with gradual recovery occurring through the first part of next year we are working closely with our customers and suppliers to help mitigate risks from these ongoing constraints the main catalyst for growth are 5g iot automotive and high performance computing and with amkor s position in these key markets we expect to outgrow the semiconductor market in 2021 and last but not least i would like to thank the global amkor team for delivering another great quarter

by chris isidore cnn business tesla reported stronger than expected second quarter with a record net income of 1 1 billion it was far more than double the 438 million it made in the first quarter and more than 10 times the net income it reported a year ago and it answered a major criticism of investors who ve been bearish on the stock over the strength of tesla s results notably tesla didn t depend on selling regulatory credits to other automakers to achieve its blockbuster earnings those credits were responsible for just 354 million in revenue in the quarter in previous quarters even when tesla reported positive adjusted earnings its net income depended on selling credits to rivals that needed to buy them to meet tougher environmental standards critics have long attacked tesla for that saying the company wasn t making money actually selling cars the company s adjusted income which is the measure more closely watched by investors jumped to 1 6 billion far better than the 1 1 billion forecast by analysts it was also up from its previous record earnings on that basis of 1 1 billion in the first quarter revenue of 12 billion also easily topped forecasts of 11 3 billion chip and battery shortage but ceo elon musk did acknowledge that the company s growth has been hampered by the computer chip shortage hitting all other automakers and many other manufacturers while we re making cars at full speed the global chip shortage situation remains quite serious he told investors for the rest of this year our growth rates will be determined by the slowest part in our supply chain adding that there are a wide range of chips that will serve as that brake on growth and tesla and musk did give cautious outlook about a number of other plans and products it has promised tesla repeated its earlier guidance that it expects to complete construction of factories near austin texas and in berlin and start limited production of the model y suv at those plants later this year but it s not just a chip shortage dogging the company there is also a shortage of the cells used to make the large batteries each vehicle needs tesla said monday that it won t start production of its cybertruck pickup until after the model y is up and running in texas and it pushed back the plans for a semi tractor truck until 2022 due to the limited availability of battery cells and global supply chain challenges cybertruck and semi actually both are heavy users of cell capacity said musk so we ve got to make sure we have the cell capacity for those two vehicles we are looking at a pretty massive increase in cell availability next year but he said that increase won t all be available at the start of 2022 but will ramp up through the course of next year challenges for cybertruck a number of other established automakers such as ford and general motors on the verge of selling their own electric pickups so there is pressure on tesla to get its first pickup into the market the company was already on the record saying it was expecting volume production of the cybertruck in 2022 musk also acknowledge that the pickup s unusual design will make the launch a challenge it s such a new architecture it s going to be a great product it might i think be our best product ever he said but there s a lot of fundamentally new design ideas so there ll probably be challenges because there s so much unexplored territory in a tweet recently he said tesla will open up its supercharger network to electric vehicles from other automakers later this year while he still didn t have details he said the plan to do that will lower charging costs for tesla customers and he said it s in keeping with the company s overall mission to convert the world from gasoline powered cars to evs our goal is to support the advent of sustainable energy he said it is not to create a walled garden and use that to bludgeon our competitors which is sometimes used by some companies while musk thinks full self driving subscriptions will produce significant revenue starting next year right now does it make sense for somebody to do fsd subscription i think it s debatable small loss on bitcoin holdings in february tesla disclosed it used some of its cash on hand to purchase 1 5 billion in bitcoin in april it disclosed that it has sold some of those holdings and booked net income of 101 million from its crypto trading the bitcoin transactions made some investors nervous especially since the cryptocurrency has lost more than a third of its value since then some had expected the company could report a 75 million loss on its bitcoin trading in the quarter said dan ives tech investor for wedbush securities but instead it reported only a 23 million loss while supply chain issues remain it appears to be moderating heading into the next six to nine months said ives he said the report should confirm those expecting tesla to hit full year sales of 900 000 vehicles up from the 500

to overcome rising material costs and a 23 million bitcoin impairment said karl brauer executive analyst at iseecars com tesla s numbers beating estimates by a healthy margin confirm strong global demand for evs continues enough to more than offset tesla s near term challenges one of his last quarterly calls musk s comments were rather mild compared with some of his previous quarterly earnings calls in which he sometimes picked fights with analysts or went on rants against safety measures put in place to combat the covid 19 pandemic calling them fascist he said monday that it will be uncommon in the future for him to be on the call at all if i m doing interviews and i can t do actual other work he said i only have so much time in the day musk who is also ceo of spacex has a tunnel digging company called the boring company and recently hosted saturday night live suggested his time constraints would keep him off many quarterly calls in the future i ll do the annual shareholder meeting but i think going forward i will most likely not be on earnings calls unless there s something really important that i need to say tesla shares have been battered this year as earlier earnings

baby salmon are dying by the thousands in one california river and an entire run of endangered salmon could be wiped out in another fishermen who make their living off adult salmon once they enter the pacific ocean are sounding the alarm as blistering heat waves and extended drought in the u s west raise water temperatures and imperil fish from idaho to california hundreds of thousands of young salmon are dying in northern california s klamath river as low water levels brought about by drought allow a parasite to thrive devastating a native american tribe whose diet and traditions are tied to the fish and wildlife officials said the sacramento river is facing a near complete loss of young chinook salmon due to abnormally warm water a crash in one year s class of young salmon can have lasting effects on the total population and shorten or stop the fishing season a growing concern as climate change continues to make the west hotter and drier that could be devastating to the commercial salmon fishing industry which in california alone is worth 1 4 billion the plummeting catch already has led to skyrocketing retail prices for salmon hurting customers who say they can no longer afford the 35 per pound of fish said mike hudson who has spent the last 25 years catching and selling salmon at farmers markets in berkeley hudson said he has considered retiring and selling his 40 foot boat because it s going to get worse from here
arthrex exposes a number of systemic failures of the uspto s legal culture and presents an imperative to begin a transformation to demonstrate to the public that it takes the law seriously in part i we looked at two of the legal principles that govern arthrex director review director review must be implemented by notice and comment regulation not website and the administrative procedure act apa requires that the director s decision demonstrate reasoned decisionmaking today we ll look at a few more legal obligations that confine the u s patent and trademark office s uspto s discretion as the uspto seeks a lawful implementation of director review this part ii concludes with a plea that the uspto take the public interest seriously as the public interest is reflected in various statutes outside the patent act questions numbers 1 and 2 are addressed in part i of this series question 3 can the director delegate review to the ptab no page 10 of the arthrex slip opinion points out that rehearing cannot be delegated by the director to the patent trial and appeal board ptab itself such review simply repeats the arrangement challenged as unconstitutional in this suit if the director does not conduct the review personally reviews must be delegated to persons that do not report up through the chief administrative patent judge apj question 4 can the director delegate review without identifying the decision makers no the supreme court has explained that due process requires that decision makers be known and named see in re oliver 333 u s 257 266 271 1948 it would be impossible to enforce the apa s protections against conflicts of interest partiality ex parte communications etc if the identity of decision makers remains unknown the uspto s updated arthrex q a page in answer to d1 states that an advisory committee established by the director will advise the director on whether decisions merit review and identified various uspto components from which committee members will be selected however it stated that the director will determine whether review will be granted or denied each decision should include the names of the members of the advisory committee that participated in the decision question 5 what time limits apply 35 u s c 316 a 11 requires that the final determination as distinct from the final written decision of 318 be issued within one year from the date of institution extendable on good cause for 6 months the statute carefully differentiates between the final written decision fwd which is subject to one set of deadlines and allows rehearings and other post fwd proceedings to extend beyond those deadlines and the final determination which requires a complete wrap up by a hard immoveable deadline of 18 months from institution 316 a 11 during the q a portion of the ptab s july 1 boardside chat chief apj boalick stated that the director s review of the final written decision would not implicate the time periods in 316 a 11 because the issuance of a fwd stops the clock judge boalick did not explain how equating decision with determination squares with the plain language of the statute question 6 what about director review of institution decisions 314 d 324 d provide that the director s decision whether to institute shall be final and nonappealable not the board s at the very least a board panel decision to deny institution seems to be inevitably in the class that requires director review what about decisions to institute institution is initially vested in the director and delegated to the ptab under common law principles a principal that has a duty to protect others continues to hold that duty even if performance is delegated to an agent restatement third agency 7 06 7 07 the director has a duty to ensure that the ptab acts in a fair impartial and equitable manner 35 u s c 3 a 2 a does that add up to an obligation to review institution decisions the director can only ensure the ptab is acting in a fair impartial and equitable manner if he stands ready to review to ensure that panels comply with basic rules of reasoned decisionmaking under the apa and basic fairness question 7 what about apj compensation bias in the last year multiple parties have challenged unconstitutional pecuniary bias of the ptab new vision gaming v sg gaming inc corrected opening br fed cir no 20 1399 ecf no 29 jun 30 2020 cellspin soft

criteria used to determine retention and bonuses ip watchdog has reported on the new vision case here here and here us inventor filed an amicus brief ecf 45 aug 3 2020 showing that to a statistical certainty of over 90 the ptab s compensation structure influences the ptab s institution decisions in an april ip watchdog webinar james carmichael a former apj himself explained the existence and pull of these financial incentives there is a structural incentive to get credit for writing final written decisions you get more credit for doing the final written decisions and the only way to get those credits is to institute and once you ve done the work of deciding whether to institute it s a good deal from a credit perspective the amount of additional work that you would do to get to the final written decision in my opinion it s a good deal but i hasten to add all of the apjs i know are of the absolute highest character and guard against making any decisions based on any kind of personal interest or incentives there is a structural incentive but i have never seen it with the apjs that i deal with actually making a difference ip watchdog ptab masters 2021 day 3 at 2 07 33 apr 21 2021 in june dr ron katznelson published a study on the empirical relationship between bonus awards of ptab judges and their decision types based on information from the uspto and office of personnel management the pecuniary interests of ptab judges empirical analysis relating bonus awards to decisions in aia trials june 21 2021 dr katznelson shows that an apj s bonus award is statistically correlated with that apj s decisional outcomes legally due process turns on the incentives created by the ptab s compensation structure and no showing of actual cause of outcome is required nonetheless us inventor s brief mr carmichael s explanation and dr katznelson s article show that both incentives and actual outcome changes exist to a statistically significant degree the director created the flawed compensation structure the director can fix it by simply mirroring the compensation structures for aljs which includes no bonus awards and by walling the apjs that decide institution from the apjs that benefit via compensation and retention for trial phase arthrex notwithstanding it s not clear that the ptab can proceed until this is fixed but that will take time fitting the pieces into a bigger picture for reform the uspto s lawyers have spent years surrounding the director with landmines and arthrex now requires the functions and duties director to walk through that minefield for the transition period until validly promulgated regulations are in place the ptab s option to deny all institutions to ensure the efficient administration of the office and the ability of the office to timely complete proceedings seems to be a duty 35 u s c 316 b 326 b harmonic inc v avid tech inc 815 f 3d 1356 1367 fed cir 2016 director is permitted but never compelled to institute an ipr proceeding long term the most important constraints on director review are 557 c parties are entitled to a reasonable opportunity to submit exceptions to the decisions of subordinate employees and the record shall show the ruling on each exception presented and the 316 a obligation to act by regulation as discussed in part i but those are still only the tip of an iceberg the ptab should be the best operation in the uspto and it probably is this article portrays a culture of shortcutting and or ineptitude in the ptab s legal machinery the problems pervade uspto operations and are worse elsewhere as julie burke and michael spector described earlier today this culture is arguably failing the public and failing the honest hard working employees at the uspto statutory changes in the 1990s gave the uspto the responsibility of self funding through user fees freedom from many of the hiring and management constraints and financial controls that apply to other agencies 3 b 3 b 42 b and exemption from the limits on bonuses that apply to almost all other government employees contrast 35 u s c 3 b 2 b 50 bonuses for pto senior career staff to 5 u s c 4505a a 2 capping most bonuses at 10 with exceptional cases at 20 unlike public companies where laws and stock market rules require compensation be set by independent directors uspto bonuses are set by a committee composed almost entirely of the very executives to whom they re paid the uspto and its senior management are now in the position of a company that holds a statutory monopoly and can exercise it under sovereign immunity the law shifted incentives for the uspto s management and legal culture from the public interest to the pecuniary interest of uspto career staff and conduct appears to have shifted with those incentives today too many decisions appear to be made in the uspto s and the individual decision maker s immediate financial interest and respect for inconvenient laws is often seemingly barely considered when the law requires the uspto to spend quality time on the reasoned decisionmaking required by the apa or to limits fees to only honest services or to evaluate the cost to the public of new rules in my experience the uspto consistently short shrifts its legal obligations in favor of its fee collections over time conflicts of interest have been increasingly built in as a feature the uspto responds to its largest stakeholders and ptab frequent flyers and pays little attention to any other constituency employees that don t shortcut are disadvantaged that culture seems to have cross infected from the examining operation over to the ptab the laws i describe in this article are designed to ensure accountability and avoidance of conflicts of interest to require agencies to engage with the full spectrum of the public to design regulatory programs for benefit of all to seriously consider cost benefit analysis and economic effect and to carefully consider the needs of small inventors and startups the lifeblood of the american economy and they ensure that honest and hard working employees who attend to detail and completeness don t suffer by comparison the pattern of omissions i describe in this article is too pervasive to be explained as individual lapses of attention there are only a few explanations a not a single one of 260 apjs has sufficient competent legal knowledge 6 a of the apa so no one has objected b the supervisory culture makes it impossible for an apj to raise obviously unlawful agency conduct to the bosses or c a concerted effort by uspto senior career staff office of general counsel and the ptab itself to brazenly defy legal obligations arthrex exposes a number of systemic failures of the uspto s legal culture and presents an imperative to take a long pause for self reflection and reform implementation of arthrex director review is an opportunity for the uspto to take the law seriously and most importantly to demonstrate to the public that it takes the law seriously editor s note this article was updated on july 27 to include james carmichael s full quote for accuracy

the construction of the first affordable housing tower in forever stacey walters station house is seen by some as something of a success the building is able to offer apartments to people who earn between 27 800 to 55 500 a year because sound transit sold the property to an affordable housing developer community roots housing for what in our late day can be described as a song the deal was this sound transit had extra land around the capitol hill station which was completed in 2016 and it sold 75 of it to the usual suspects luxury this luxury that and 25 at at a deep discount the result 110 apartments for working and middle class workers in the heart of a very pricey part of town a world class public transit system is useless to you if you can t afford to live near it says wilsonkatieb of seattletru that s why we need agencies like soundtransit to do everything in their power to site affordable housing near transit hubs transit riders union seattletru july 26 2021 now reasons to be cheerful a website launched by the pop icon david byrne in 2018 reports that station house has become a model that sound transit plans to replicate using other surplus land near future stations to build more affordable housing this news would mean a lot if it didn t hit the wall almost immediately of two serious facts about housing in seattle the one fact that rarely receives mention in local and national discussions about affordable housing is the negative impact of hope vi a hud program initiated at the beginning of a decade the 1990s whose middle years were occupied by the peak of neoliberalism doctrines hope vi with its mixed income platform destroyed a large amount of the us s public housing stock in the 1970s and 1980s those between the center left and all of the right successfully convinced the mainstream that the last thing the working poor wanted was dirt cheap housing even in modernist towers but nothing could be further from the truth the demand for such housing was and still is high station house is in a word not affordable for those close to or below the poverty line but there s a second fact concerning hope iv its project displaced a large number of those at the bottom rung of the urban poor and in a very systematic predictable preventable way hope vi projects in seattle holly court high point park lake and so on all participated in this displacement though admittedly with less devastating consequences than similar projects in new orleans chicago and atlanta but there are two excellent academic papers that provide a detailed picture of the harm that was done by hope iv in our region rachel garshick kleit s and lynne c manzo s to move or not to move relationships to place and relocation choices in hope vi university of washington 2010 and karen j gibson s the relocation of the columbia villa community views from residents portland state university 2007 one can distill these papers into this key point between 10 to 25 of those in projects could keep afloat while in public housing but not while out of it even for a very short period of time hope vi and other mixed income and affordability schemes sent a good number of these vulnerable people right to the street this was gibson s conclusion in the section of her paper titled maintaining a stable housing situation many of these people are still homeless and for the most part excluded from local and national discourses on affordability amazing view of soundtransit s transit oriented development project on first hill plymouthhousing and bw_housing are developing 360 affordable homes in seattle s first fully affordable high rise in over 50 years tod affordablehousing pic twitter com bfz6i0mexp dustin akers dustinakers july 22 2021 a little under a year ago capitol hill seattle blog posted a story with this depressing headline seattle s first affordable high rise in seattle in more than 50 years set to break ground on first hill it is no accident that the last time this kind of thing happened was at the end of the us s 40 year dalliance with social democracy also known as the new deal the 1970s saw the spirit of capitalism regain the strength it lost during the great depression and move through the history of american housing i call this period the twilight of the goodtimes what the period makes clear is that the subject of history is capital not the worker and this one movement through historical time is as objective as spacetime in general relativity the geist or the the self moving substance which is subject dominates us with a force that feels so real too natural

in gordon lightfoot s 1976 song the wreck of the edmund fitzgerald he figuratively blames the sinking of that ship on the witch of november folks more familiar with ojibway mythology might however have pointed to mishipizheu one of the most important of the underground mythological creatures of the northeastern and midwestern north american tribes this pictograph of the great lynx known as mishipizheu was created by ojibway spiritual leaders at agawa rock in lake superior provincial park in ontario canada chris hill adobe stock was mishipizheu a god or a monster the great lynx mishipizheu blurs the line between god and monster and thus sheds light on what it takes to be one or the other the ojibway an indigenous people from southern canada and the northern midwestern united states believed mishipizheu was a giant lynx like creature an apt description would be that the mishipizheu was a horned panther covered in copper scales with razor sharp spikes down its back and a long flexible tail according to ojibway mythology mishipizheu lived under the vast waterways of their territory in the canadian shield in and near the great lakes it exercised complete control over the waterways and had a mean streak which had to be placated with copper or tobacco offerings lest it use its tail to create violent whirlpools or harsh waves to drown the people residing in the area on the one hand we might consider him a god as he exercised supernatural power over a vast area of waterways and accepted tokens or sacrifices for his cooperation with human endeavors on the other hand he is primarily a malevolent presence drowning those who forget their offerings to him creating tumult capriciously with a whip of his tail and standing in opposition in many stories to the heroic thunderbird he was godlike in his power but monster like in his malevolence the ss algoma went down on lake superior in 1885 it was the worst loss of life in the history of lake superior public domain the malevolent intentions of mishipizheu the underwater panther it is no wonder that a malevolent spirit was felt to inhabit lake superior some people believe mishipizheu has sunk at least 400 ships on the lake in recorded memory alone in addition to the edmund fitzgerald some have even said that the island of michipicoten in ontario canada in the northeastern part of lake superior is the primary abode of mishipizheu when he is not swirling through underground tunnels and caverns throughout the region the belief of indigenous tribes of the region is that mishipizheu lives and travels through a vast system of tunnels and caverns underlying the vast waterways of midwestern united states and canada often wreaking havoc on those who sail those waters but why mishipizheu guards the vast amount of copper which to this day lies within the great lakes native inhabitants of the great lakes region stretching back to about 7 500 bc discovered copper that was 99 pure in lake superior in veins or just lying around in nugget form initially they used the copper for spear points and tools but as a larger social organization developed the copper was used for personal ornamentation denoting social standing there was only one problem lake superior was not a gentle lake to those extracting the copper in fact it was quite fierce the fierceness was attributed to a creature which seemed obviously to be guarding the copper hence the existence of mishipizheu indeed if we dig a little deeper the belief in this creature points to why monsters were created in the first place in pre scientific cultures folks often attributed evil intentions or ill will to events possessing no evil intentions or ill will to this day in some villages when someone falls ill a shaman might declare that a personal enemy sent an evil spirit to possess the victim a person does not just fall ill someone or something must desire that thus it is with the sea and other bodies of water unpredictable tragedies occurred and we were quick to attribute the tragedies to an invisible malice or ill will anything other than natural causes we seem to be wired for whatever reason to be super keen to perceive and attribute malice and malevolence to adverse things that happen to us it was too difficult for us to believe that things affecting us negatively could just happen mishipizheu became the figuration of the malice of the sea part godlike in his scope mostly monstrous in his intentions but interestingly we attributed a reason for his malice his irrational desire to possess all the copper in lake superior stormy sky over lake superior the home of mishipizheu boundlessimages adobe stock mishipizheu ancillary stories the odds are that the origin of the mishipizheu myth is derived from the destructive power of lake superior and other violent waterways of the canadian shield and the emotionally painful tragedies caused by the unpredictable harshness of these bodies of water mishipizheu became the malicious element causing the lake to harm innocent people from this initial birth of the monster various tribes added on stories which is not uncommon in myth making in fact we can look at mishipizheu as a good example of the possible evolution of a myth hunting and gathering peoples often have animistic beliefs every natural element has a spirit even stones and streams perhaps it was recognized early on that lake superior s was not a gentle spirit lake spirits often became personified in world mythology if you can imagine one being or creature controlling the lake it is easier to deal with this entity through sacrifice and bargaining once you create a god spirit or monster that you can appease or cajole then stories concerning the exploits of this being can be constructed you can even think of the greek myths this way zeus was once a sky and thunder spirit then through story telling he morphed into the leader of a pantheon and a character in a rich mythological tradition some of the stories concerning mishipizheu even purport that he engaged in acts of benevolence thus adding to his stature as a god and not solely a monster in one story mishipizheu was responsible for the primordial flood in another story we learn that swamps and quicksand are due to his slithering on the ground when he chose to take shortcuts from river to river in one particular mythological tale mishipizheu is referred to as the ancestor of all snakes due to the belief that he was hit by lightning and shattered into thousands of those creatures another story tells of mishipizheu the trickster a shaman seeks a powerful medicine from mishipizheu who happily complies unfortunately the medicine only works for the shaman as he remains healthy while he watches his family and loved ones deteriorate and die around him artists rendering of the famed mishipizheu australopithecusman cc by sa final verdict on mishipizheu godly extortion or defender of humanity so is mishipizheu more monster than god what might tip the scales is that he does not engage in acts of benevolence he is predisposed to cause harm continually and only will desist from this if he receives basically extortion money but gods receive extortion money too do they not did the ancient greeks not placate poseidon before sea travel it seems that the gods like to be appreciated and remembered but are also quick to do good things for good people they also might need to be coaxed a little into supplying help and it is not like the gods are a constant threat which has to be avoided so the scales would seem to tip more toward monster in this case yet one interested in mythology might ask whether a primarily malevolent god is possible or dare we stretch and say that mishipizheu was not at all malevolent but merely attempted as well as he could to steer humanity away from the world bought through copper in an attempt to keep humanity living in a land of paradise top image the malevolent mishipizheu monster god of lake superior source sjb1995 cc by sa by daniel gauss

washington san francisco reuters a u s federal reserve divided over how to respond to fast rising prices meets this week with the fresh complication of increased coronavirus infections and a global supply chain that far from sorting out its problems may be headed for more inflation inducing trouble fed officials are likely to affirm after their two day meeting that a strong u s recovery and their planning for an eventual policy shift both remain underway but the new risks threatening the twin ills of slowed growth and higher prices mean the rosy future seen in june seems less assured debate over how to shape post pandemic monetary policy has just begun and decisions were not expected before the fall but since the fed met just six weeks ago what had seemed a blue sky setting for that debate has become clouded by a quadrupling of daily infections led by the more contagious delta variant to levels approaching those seen in last summer s virus surge even if the worst of the new outbreak is concentrated among less vaccinated communities economists see it potentially changing consumers willingness to spend and travel and say it will likely require the fed to strike a balance between keeping faith in the recovery while taking explicit stock of what could go wrong so far the risks to growth remain just that data on air travel and restaurant visits show consumers are still in recovery mode not hunkering down a new policy statement is to be issued wednesday at 2 p m 1800 gmt followed by a press conference by fed chair jerome powell again and again we ve seen over the last 18 months that the no 1 determinant of economic activity is the virus said karen dynan a harvard university economics professor and former assistant u s treasury secretary i think that we will continue to make forward progress but that progress will be slower than otherwise developments since the last meeting strengthened the case against pulling back on accommodation prematurely given the new uncertainty about the recovery and despite higher than expected june inflation goldman sachs economist david mericle wrote the fed continues to buy 120 billion in government bonds each month and hold its policy interest rate near zero measures rolled out in the spring of 2020 to buttress the economy from the pandemic some fed officials already feel it is time to pivot from those policies because of the unexpected pace of recent price increases and trading in bond markets in recent weeks showed investors betting the fed may have to accelerate its exit from the crisis programs supply issues not going anywhere yet it is indeed a long list of new problems that have arisen since june 16 when the fed expressed confidence the pandemic was fading and that progress on vaccinations will likely continue to reduce the effects of the public health crisis on the economy the rise of infections could if it continues weigh on the recovery and would do so at a particularly tenuous moment the fed is still hoping the economy can regain all of the 6 8 million jobs missing since the start of the pandemic but that depends on other aspects of the recovery continuing apace particularly a full reopening of public schools in the fall that s anticipated to help free parents to return to jobs but the process could be set back if the health crisis intensifies again any slowdown in the recovery or hiring meanwhile would occur amid the expiry of the federal spending and benefits that sustained personal incomes last year a fiscal cliff already expected to slow annual economic growth from its current high octane pace of around 7 rising inflation had been the immediate focus of federal reserve officials in recent weeks cleaving the central bank between those worried prices may be increasing too fast and those arguing that the economy needed much more time to grow and regain lost jobs before any change in monetary policy powell was peppered with questions about that politically sensitive subject during recent hearings on capitol hill the issue is being watched carefully at the white house as well with both the core of fed officials and the biden administration saying they remain convinced current price increases are mostly the result of a complicated economic reopening and will ease on their own there may be new reason to doubt a collision of events including floods in germany and china are again clogging the flow of parts and materials around the world prolonging the supply bottlenecks that fed officials and the white house have counted on getting resolved to help ease price pressures supply side issues are clearly not going anywhere citi economists wrote on friday costs from inputs and supplier wait times are likely to continue appearing in consumer inflation for months to come from a relatively straight forward and even somewhat old fashioned dilemma in june was inflation too high or not the fed now has risks in two directions said former fed monetary policy director and yale school of management professor william english with the likelihood of more embedded inflation now running alongside risks to growth and the waning of federal fiscal support things could play out in a way they didn t expect english said reporting by howard schneider and ann saphir editing by dan burns and andrea ricci by howard schneider and ann saphir

i don t often go back far enough when i m writing and researching my stories for 365 ttc so today let s go a little further than we normally do formed in 1887 and organized may 7th 1910 upton county was named in honor of john cunningham upton a distinguished confederate officer who was killed at manassas in 1962 the county is made up of sheep raising and cattle with dotted oil wells throughout it was mainly a stock raising county the original county seat was upland which would now be considered a texas ghost town it happens to be just about 10 miles north of rankin so one of these days i ll try and find it and take some pictures for you guys screenshot of upland county courthouse remains anyway back in july of 1890 a cowboy named sam murray worked on a the ballet ranch at centralia draw on the morning of july 21st he woke up early as he always did to get after the days work his normal a m routine was interrupted however with the discovery of his missing quirt and two saddles a quirt is a short handled riding whip with a braided leather lash after noticing a pair of older discarded saddles nearby he put two and two together and figured the theft had happened at some time during the night four riders had been seen passing through the ranch the night before with the fresh tracks that were left by the riders leading west in the direction of upton county murray hurried over to the bartlett ranch to see if he could get some help finding the saddle thieves at the bartlett ranch he found a young stockman will landrum who was ready to help they set off tracking the saddle thieves twenty five miles to castle gap where they saw four men having lunch under a windmill from a distance sam identified the saddles the men had on their horses as being his apparently one of the men was easy to pick out of the posse his name was lorenzo porrez and could be spotted by the limp he had from one of his legs being shorter than the other birth defects were far more common place back in the days of old west health care will and sam decided that will would keep tracking the posse and sam would go back for more help this endeavor however did not work out like it was planned and around 4 o clock will caught back up to sam and the posse ended up getting the jump on the two they had circled back on sam and as he caught up with will the four riders began galloping toward the duo guns a blaze n as they say sam and will shot back as they raced away but were split up during the melee sam murray was able to outrun the horseback shoot out and made it to the t x ranch a large spread covering crane and upton county where he reported that the last time he saw will landrum alive was about 2 miles back with porrez and another mexican about 200 yards behind him still in hot pursuit there he would recruit backup and head back to the last place he had seen will landrum landrum s hat was found and his horse wandering aimlessly his quirt was laying across the trail and blood was seen ten or fifteen feet off the road with fresh drag marks in the dirt sam and the help he gathered followed the drag marks to the body of will landrum he had been stabbed twice in the chest with one stab wound piercing his heart it was reported in the paper that wills brains had been beaten out and piled up on a rock with his body behind dragged nearly a mile off and left beside the road off in a distance three riders could still be seen as they made their retreat screenshot of landrum grave will landrum was buried by sam right were he was found which is the mcelroy ranch today just northeast of castle gap at the time the area was under the jurisdiction of midland county so word was sent to midland county sheriff allison it took about four months to apprehend three of the four men responsible sam murray was able to identify lorenzo porrez pretty easy with that distinct limp of his he was sentenced to hang in midland for will landrum s murder by judge kennedy at some point after the sentence was given to porrez he was visited by a priest in prison it was in the prison in front of the priest all the other prisoners and sheriff allison that porrez stated that he was in fact responsible for killing will landrum he stayed that it was him who used the knife to stab landrum while another mexican it s the paper s vernacular not mine held him down juan benavidez s trial in big spring ended in a hung jury his second trial in colorado city however would set him free he was found not guilty benavidez confessed that he was with porrez during the altercation and that he did pursue sam for a bit but was not involved in his murder he also swore to the fact that will and sam shot at them first a third un named member of posse was also charged with the murder in the second degree and sentenced to twenty five years in prison the forth of the pistol packing saddle thieves was never caught lorenzo porrez walked up the steps of the scaffold for his hanging that was set up on the northeast corner of the midland county courthouse square he was led by sheriff allison that day on november 27th 1891 his rights were read to him by stanton catholic priest albert wagner and he made a full confession of his guilt before his sentence was carried out in front of the large crowd that had gathered at 3 15 that day lorenzo porrez is said to have been the first man to be legally hung in midland county his grave is likely in the northwest corner of fairview cemetery in midland in the paupers sections in an unmarked grave i didn t even know there was such a section and will be locating it within the week screenshot of old midland county courthouse screenshot of some of the locations mentioned much of the information for today s story was found at the upton county

repeats from monday spacs make up bulk of u s ipos only a fraction in ems singapore s grab brazil s embraer unit line up for spac deals spac deals could boost em companies fund raising prospects london july 26 reuters emerging markets have so far been on the fringes of a fundraising boom using so called spacs or special purpose acquisition companies which could potentially unlock a vital new source of cash for entrepreneurs in developing regions but the take off of spac fundraisings in these markets hinges in part on the success of a few recently delayed landmark deals reflecting wider global investor caution about this funding tool spacs allow investors to list a shell company on public markets before they have identified a business to buy which provides a speedier route to an initial public offering in excess of 115 6 billion has been raised via more than 400 spacs or blank check companies this year mainly on wall street where spacs make up two thirds of all initial public offerings ipos although activity has slowed as regulatory and valuation concerns have increased in contrast a total of 1 18 billion has been raised this year via six spacs by emerging market issuers including two apiece from israel and china this is just a fraction of the 96 3 billion raised via traditional ipos from emerging markets based on refinitiv data but spacs are expected to feature more prominently in future fundraisings for emerging market entrepreneurs opening up more capital and operational expertise just this month spacs formed by abu dhabi s mubadala capital and singapore s fat projects spac filed with the u s securities and exchange commission to raise up to 300 million in ipos the former is targeting media and entertainment highlighting growth opportunities in emerging markets such as india and china while the latter s focus includes businesses cashing in on southeast asia s booming consumer market for investors emerging market spacs can offer high returns but also greater potential risks related to transparency and disclosure all eyes are on the fate of the emerging market deals already underway singapore s grab going public through a spac merger worth 40 billion said last month it expected to complete the deal during the fourth quarter the company had previously said it aimed to close the deal by july assuming grab does well people are going to pay attention to that said allen taylor managing director of california based venture capital firm endeavor catalyst an investor in more than 180 emerging market portfolio companies he said entrepreneurs and investors in southeast asia will see this as a credible option for how to go public more people will follow and i think the same is true for latin america as those are the two regions i m most bullish on brazilian planemaker embraer said in june its subsidiary eve which develops aircraft in the electric vertical take off and landing business had entered into a spac deal analysts estimated eve could reach a market value of 2 billion abu dhabi based music streaming app anghami said in march it would become the first arab tech company to list on the nasdaq after agreeing to merge with a spac vehicle in a deal that was expected to close in the second quarter but one banker who covers the region said the small size of the listing for new york anghami s deal implies an enterprise value of about 220 million had prompted concern from some spac watchers about its outcome anghami said in response to reuters questions on the timing and progress of the deal the spac merger process has a number of technical milestones that must be met before completion we have been working towards completion but these processes invariably take some time anghami said it looked forward to completing the remaining steps in the process to make the group the first arab tech company to list on nasdaq in new york reflecting cautious investor sentiment towards spacs share prices of the vehicles merging with grab and anghami have both fallen from the levels they were at when the deals were announced one arrow in the quiver emerging markets urgently need more fundraising options currently these markets only account for around 8 of private capital and 11 of stock market capitalisation based on world bank data spacs do offer them a new route to raising cash they represent one arrow in the quiver alongside private capital traditional ipos and acquisitions said alexandre lazarow a venture capitalist with cathay innovation but it will not be plain sailing the global spac boom at the start of this year showed signs of fading by may amid investor worries about valuations some u s businesses have halted plans to list the explosion and subsequent quenching of spac enthusiasm in developed markets provides a potential lesson for emerging markets to learn from said alex korda analyst at consultancy the edge group nirgunan tiruchelvam head of consumer equity research at research firm tellimer said u s listed spacs may be appropriate for emerging market companies where a loss making history or limited operating records make it hard for them to list via an ipo as for listing spacs on emerging country stock exchanges this looks much more uncertain singapore s stock market in march said it was proposing introducing regulations to allow spac listings while dubai s bourse is consulting market participants on the issue investors may shun this untested regulatory structure for the established spac market in the u s tiruchelvam wrote in a research note liquidity in em will not match u s levels for em related spacs there is massive chasm between the liquidity of the u s listed em tech stocks and those listed on local exchanges editing by jane merriman

this is an archived article and the information in the article may be outdated please look at the time stamp on the story to see when it was last updated san francisco ap baby salmon are dying by the thousands in one california river and an entire run of endangered salmon could be wiped out in another fishermen who make their living off adult salmon once they enter the pacific ocean are sounding the alarm as blistering heat waves and extended drought in the u s west raise water temperatures and imperil fish from idaho to california hundreds of thousands of young salmon are dying in northern california s klamath river as low water levels brought about by drought allow a parasite to thrive devastating a native american tribe whose diet and traditions are tied to the fish and wildlife officials said the sacramento river is facing a near complete loss of young chinook salmon due to abnormally warm water a crash in one year s class of young salmon can have lasting effects on the total population and shorten or stop the fishing season a growing concern as climate change continues to make the west hotter and drier that could be devastating to the commercial salmon fishing industry which in california alone is worth 1 4 billion the plummeting catch already has led to skyrocketing retail prices for salmon hurting customers who say they can no longer afford the 35 per pound of fish said mike hudson who has spent the last 25 years catching and selling salmon at farmers markets in berkeley hudson said he has considered retiring and selling his 40 foot 12 meter boat because it s going to get worse from here winter run chinook salmon are born in the sacramento river traverse hundreds of miles to the pacific where they normally spend three years before returning to their birthplace to mate and lay their eggs between april and august unlike the fall run chinook that survives almost entirely due to hatchery breeding programs the winter run is still largely reared in the wild federal fisheries officials predicted in may that more than 80 of baby salmon could die because of warmer water in the sacramento river now state wildlife officials say that number could be higher amid a rapidly depleting pool of cool water in lake shasta california s largest reservoir is filled to only about 35 capacity federal water managers said this week the pain we re going to feel is a few years from now when there will be no naturally spawned salmon out in the ocean said john mcmanus executive director of the golden state salmon association which represents the fishing industry when lake shasta was formed in the 1940s it blocked access to the cool mountain streams where fish traditionally spawned to ensure their survival the u s government is required to maintain river temperatures below 56 degrees fahrenheit 13 celsius in spawning habitat because salmon eggs generally can t withstand anything warmer the warm water is starting to affect older fish too scientists have seen some adult fish dying before they can lay their eggs an extreme set of cascading climate events is pushing us into this crisis situation said jordan traverso a spokeswoman for the california department of wildlife and fish the west has been grappling with a historic drought and recent heat waves worsened by climate change stressing waterways and reservoirs that sustain millions of people and wildlife as a result the state has been trucking millions of salmon raised at hatcheries to the ocean each year bypassing the perilous downstream journey state and federal hatcheries take other extraordinary measures to preserve the decimated salmon stocks such as maintaining a genetic bank to prevent inbreeding at hatcheries and releasing them at critical life stages when they can recognize and return to the water where they were born fishermen and environmental groups blame water agencies for diverting too much water too soon to farms which could lead to severe salmon die off and drive the species closer to extinction we know that climate change is going to make years like this more common and what the agencies should be doing is managing for the worst case scenario said sam mace a director of save our wild salmon a coalition working to restore wild salmon and steelhead in the pacific northwest we need some real changes in how rivers are managed if they re going to survive she added on the klamath river near the oregon state line california wildlife officials decided not to release more than 1 million young chinook salmon into the wild and instead drove them to hatcheries that could host them until river conditions improve much is riding on this class of salmon because it could be the first to return to the river if plans to remove four of six dams on the klamath and restore fish access to the upper river go according to plan across the west officials are struggling with similar concerns over fish populations in idaho officials recognized that endangered sockeye salmon wouldn t make their upstream migration through hundreds of miles of warm water to their spawning habitat so they flooded the snake river with cool water then trapped and trucked the fish to hatcheries and environmentalists went to court this month in portland oregon to try to force dam operators on the snake and columbia rivers to release more water at dams blocking migrating salmon arguing that the effects of climate change and a recent heat wave were further threatening fish already on the verge of extinction low water levels are also affecting recreational fishing officials in wyoming colorado montana and california are asking anglers to fish during the coolest parts of the day to minimize the impact on fish stressed from low oxygen levels in warm water scientists say the salmon population in california historically has rebounded after a drought because they have evolved to tolerate the mediterranean like climate and benefited from rainy wet years but an extended drought could lead to the extinction of certain runs of salmon we re at the point where i m not sure drought is appropriate term to describe what s happening said andrew rypel a fish ecologist at the university of california davis he said the west is transitioning to an increasingly water scarce environment hudson the fisherman said he used to spend days at sea when the salmon season was longer and could catch 100 fish per day this year he said he was lucky to catch 80 to sell at the market retiring would be the smart thing to do but i can t bring myself to do it because

we are accustomed to drawing an automatic link between exchange rates and exports through the trade competitiveness channel of exchange rates this column highlights another important channel through which exchange rates affect global trade activity the impact of a stronger dollar on tighter financial conditions which in turn adversely affects credit availability for working capital of exporting firms figure 1 is a striking illustration of how global trade activity fluctuates with the strength of the dollar the chart plots the ratio of world goods exports to world gdp over the past 20 years or so we see the strong growth in exports before the 2007 2009 global crisis a deep decline as the crisis hit and an equally sharp rebound in its aftermath thereafter global trade was on a gentle declining trend relative to gdp until the covid 19 pandemic struck last year what is striking is the negative correlation between global trade activity and the strength of the dollar trade activity is strong when the dollar is weak but global trade suffers when the dollar is strong this pattern is remarkable in its consistency and has remained intact even during the pandemic figure 1 global goods trade and the dollar notes 1 federal reserve board trade weighted nominal dollar index broad group of major trading partners of the us broad based on trade in goods and services an increase indicates appreciation of the us dollar 2 both exports and gdp are measured in constant prices sources federal reserve bank of st louis fred imf world economic outlook world trade organization datastream bis calculations what could possibly account for such a striking pattern one candidate explanation is that credit conditions for exporters working capital dance to the tune of dollar strength so that trade fluctuations are shaped by financial conditions it is well known that merchandise trade is heavily dependent on bank finance for working capital amiti and weinstein 2011 niepmann and schmidt eisenlohr 2017 due to the time lags between incurring costs and receiving payments what is new and distinctive about our candidate explanation is that the dollar exchange rate serves as a barometer for credit conditions the philosopher rené descartes famously argued that the nature of the mind is distinct from that of the body and that it is possible for one to exist without the other similarly in debates about trade globalisation there is a tendency for some economists to draw a sharp distinction between trade and finance for instance by claiming that trade activity is mostly a matter of trade openness and removal of trade barriers but the financial and real effects are two sides of the same coin what happens in financial markets does not always stay in financial markets financial conditions also have real economy consequences through their influence on real variables among indicators of financial conditions the us dollar exchange rate plays a particularly important role as a barometer of dollar credit conditions bruno and shin 2015 figure 2 plots fluctuations of the broad dollar index and dollar denominated credit to emerging market economies the panel shows the negative relationship between the annual growth of dollar bank loans and the broad dollar index dollar credit grows faster when the dollar is weak and grows more slowly or declines when the dollar is strong a phenomenon we have dubbed the risk taking channel of exchange rates bruno and shin 2015 figure 2 us dollar credit to emerging market economies notes 1 annual growth of us dollar denominated credit or

federal reserve bank of st louis fred thomson reuters xtrakter ltd national data bis locational banking statistics bis effective exchange rate statistics bis calculations the financial channel and exports in a new paper bruno and shin 2021 we explore the impact of financial conditions on international trade through the dollar exchange rate using finely disaggregated data on export shipments from mexico we trace the impact of dollar strength on the shipments of exporters who have financing needs for working capital the sample period of the study 2013 2016 was one where the dollar strengthened substantially during a period when emerging market economies experienced tighter financing conditions and capital outflows exchange rates figured prominently in financial commentary at the time especially the impact of the stronger dollar for this reason our sample period serves as an ideal test period for the risk taking channel of exchange rates the broad dollar index appreciated by 30 in four years even as the normalisation of monetary policy in advanced economies was on hold for much of the period the message of our paper is that a strong dollar dampens trade volumes through the financial channel outweighing any improvement in trade competitiveness we show this through a two step empirical analysis making full use of the detailed data on export shipments first we find that following an appreciation of the us dollar banks with a high reliance on us dollar short term wholesale funding reduce supply of credit more to the same firm compared to banks with low dollar wholesale funding exposures in other words there is an important connection between the dollar and bank credit supply shedding light on the negative relationship in figure 2 this leads to the second and crucial step of our analysis which examines the knock on effect of reduced bank lending on exporting firms that borrow from such banks firms that borrowed more from banks that are more reliant on us dollar wholesale funding can be expected to take the brunt of the decline in credit following the dollar strengthening ultimately this will affect exports through the increased costs of working capital this is exactly what we find the funding shock to banks from a stronger dollar are transmitted to the borrowing firms and these firms suffer a greater decline in export shipments the highly detailed dataset allows us to control for the other confounding factors the working capital needs are even larger when exporting firms are components of global value chains where the time needed to deliver final goods to customers are even longer indeed we confirm that firms that are enmeshed in supply chains by selling intermediate goods are more sensitive to the impact of a stronger dollar this and other corroborating findings point to the impact emanating from the financial channel it is important to stress that the financial channel behind our results is not just a crisis related story where a crisis induced credit crunch suppresses trade volumes during non crisis periods we find that changes in the supply of dollar funded credit do not uniformly affect supply chain activity specifically they have a mild impact on domestic sales and goods with less intensive working capital needs points of contact with the literature our paper fits with the narrative emerging from an active literature on the us dollar as a global factor in economic and financial activity our results are particularly notable in the context of international trade as exchange rates also affect trade competitiveness but typically in the opposite direction instead our findings suggest that the impact on exports through tighter trade finance conditions goes in the opposite direction to the positive improvements from trade competitiveness our paper provides a conceptual bridge between the literature linking trade and finance and the literature that examines the impact of dollar invoicing of trade goldberg and tille 2009 gopinath et al 2020 the connecting link comes from the fact that dollar invoicing implies that the trade financing requirements also translate into a need for dollar credit in this way a stronger dollar goes hand in hand with tighter trade financing conditions more broadly a key point of contact of our paper with the invoicing channel is the finding on exports to the us this subsample of shipments provides an important benchmark to test the financial channel because the us dollar is the currency of the destination country as well as being the invoicing currency it provides a clean test of whether the financial channel exerts an additional force beyond the invoicing channel we again find that exporters who are reliant on dollar funded bank credit suffer a decline in exports also to the us following dollar appreciation so the financial channel operates over and above the invoicing channel and the broad dollar index assumes the central role as an indicator of bank balance sheet costs around which the financial channel operates authors note the views expressed here are those of the authors and not necessarily those of the bank for international
