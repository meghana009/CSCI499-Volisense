starbucks workers at a store in buffalo new york voted to unionize on thursday a first for the 50 year old coffee retailer in the u s and the latest sign that the labor movement is stirring after decades of decline the national labor relations board said thursday that workers voted 19 8 in favor of a union at one of three locations in buffalo a second store rejected the union in a vote of 12 8 the results of a third store could not be determined because of several challenged votes if the labor board certifies the results a process expected to take about a week it would be the first for any starbucks owned store in the u s to unionize starbucks has actively fought unionization at its stores for decades saying its stores function best when it works directly with employees workers watching the vote count over zoom on a big screen at a union office in buffalo erupted into cheers and chants of elmwood elmwood elmwood when the results of that location were announced jumping up and down and hugging each other we still made history barista and union organizer casey moore told the others watching as it became clear the second store had voted down the union effort a general view of a starbucks store on dec 9 2021 workers at all three stores began voting by mail last month on whether they wanted to be represented by workers united an affiliate of the service employees international union the national labor relations board began counting ballots thursday from union elections held at the stores around 111 starbucks workers were eligible to vote by mail starting last month yes votes could accelerate unionization efforts at other u s starbucks stores already three more stores in buffalo and a store in mesa arizona have filed petitions with the labor board for their own union elections those cases are pending union backers at the first three buffalo stores filed petitions with the labor board in august seeking representation by workers united an affiliate of the service employees international union those workers say starbucks stores had chronic problems like understaffing and faulty equipment even before the pandemic they want more input on pay and store operations we have no accountability right now we have no say said moore who has been working at a buffalo area starbucks for around six months with a union we will actually be able to sit down at the table and say this is what we want related starbucks to give raises to all us store employees starbucks insists its 8 000 company owned u s stores function best when it works directly with its employees which it calls partners many employees in the buffalo area work at more than one store depending on demand starbucks says and it wants to have the flexibility to move them between stores starbucks asked the labor board to hold one vote with all 20 of its buffalo area stores but the board rejected that request saying store by store votes were appropriate under labor law in a letter to starbucks u s employees this week starbucks president and ceo kevin johnson reiterated the company s wish to include all buffalo area stores in the union vote while we recognize this creates some level of uncertainty we respect the process that is underway and independent of the outcome in these elections we will continue to stay true to our mission and values johnson wrote johnson also reminded employees of the company s generous benefits including paid parental and sick leave and free college tuition through arizona state university late last month the company also announced pay increases saying all its u s workers will earn at least 15 and up to 23 per hour by next summer related starbucks hits sales record as customers return to stores but backers of the union say starbucks can do more if starbucks can find the money to pay their ceo nearly 15 million in compensation i think maybe they can afford to pay their workers a decent wage with decent benefits said u s sen bernie sanders a vermont independent in a recent twitter post sanders held a virtual town hall with buffalo starbucks workers earlier this week johnson earned 14 7 million in salary and stock awards in the company s 2020 fiscal year starbucks or the union can contest individual votes in the election which could delay the certification process by the labor board but if the votes do get certified starbucks is legally obligated to begin the process of collective bargaining with workers united and any of the three stores that vote to unionize said cathy creighton the director of cornell university s industrial and labor relations buffalo co lab in some cases companies have closed a location rather than deal with a union but that s difficult for a retailer like starbucks since it would be illegal to close one store and then open another nearby creighton said related us jobless claims hit lowest level in 52 years amid seasonal volatility starbucks has shown a willingness to bargain outside the u s in victoria canada workers at a starbucks store voted to unionize in august 2020 it took starbucks and the united steelworkers union nearly a year to reach a collective bargaining agreement which was ratified by workers in july the union votes come at a time of heightened labor unrest in the u s striking cereal workers at kellogg co rejected a new contract offer earlier this week thousands of workers were on strike at deere co earlier this fall and the u s labor board recently approved a redo of a union vote at an amazon warehouse in alabama after finding the company pressured workers to vote against the union labor shortages are giving workers a rare upper hand in wage negotiations and dan graff director of the higgins labor program at the university of notre dame said the pandemic gave many workers the time and space to rethink what they want from their jobs ____ thompson reported from buffalo new york and durbin reported from detroit michigan
starbucks workers in buffalo vote to unionize first us store owned by the coffee chain to do so share copy link copy welcome back to cheddar is news trap one of our top stories of the day is that all important quit rates september officially breaking august s record for the most americans to quit their job in a month nearly a million workers quit and leisure and hospitality alone worker unrest is more widespread than ever and buffalo new york for example ballots have been sent to workers at three different starbucks locations to decide whether they will unionize for the first time ever this while kellogg s files a lawsuit against its striking serial workers the rise of the worker it s upon us joining us with more is virginia diamond who is helping with starbucks campaign and is the president of northern virginia a f l c i o virginia welcome to the show such a pleasure to talk to you so let s dive in what protections and rights are these employees organizing for looking for well the workers at starbucks in buffalo are simply asking for the right to engage in collective bargaining to have a voice on the job a seat at the table as equals with management uh and so they have joined together and they have petitioned an election to have a union and unfortunately um the this billion dollar company has swooped in and is doing everything it possibly can to prevent these workers from from having a union but i believe that they will continue to hold strong and uh they will exercise their fundamental right so starbucks has said from the very beginning their employees have rare benefits like stock in the company what else is the company s argument in opposition of this well uh the company like many major corporations want to have all the control you know over recent decades uh as union density has declined uh billionaires and corporate executives have uh attained all of the wealth that has been created and the middle class has been hollowed hollowed out so working class living standards have been declining so their argument is that they like it the way it is and they want to stay in charge of make all the decisions that affect the workers pay benefits and it s up to them and the workers are saying we believe that the working class and workers should also have powers to have a voice and i believe that what they re doing is really essential to preserve democracy virginia we spoke to a member of the starbucks workers union yesterday and here s what she had to say about the efforts the company has taken to convince employees to vote no i m going to play a part of that and i ll talk to you on the other side about it it s an all consuming effort from them i mean they ve been they ve been present in our stores at the corporate levels since about two days after we filed our petitions and that was back on august 29 so um for about 70 days um they have sort of infiltrated our entire area specifically the three stores that are that have filed the petitions to vote virginia is this intimidation uh it s absolutely intimidation and its interference uh and it s you know a perfect example of why workers have had such a hard time organizing you know back in the day before the 19 eighties we had 34 of the workforce in unions and therefore we had a middle class people had had jobs they had benefits and they had a good living standard as middle class people but since then uh as workers have tried to organize particularly in the service sector uh the employers have engaged in union busting activity starbucks is a perfect example of this uh terrible union busting which is trying to prevent the workers from simply having a voice we ve seen a lot of employees band together lately for push for unionization what s driving this do you expect this movement to get even bigger absolutely this is a turning point it s a crossroads in american history because if we do not increase the number of workers that are able to bargain collectively and if we do not allow workers to regain their living standards benefits health care pensions that they had in previous generations then we will not be able to sustain a democracy our country is not sustainable with all of the wealth being captured by those at the top the only way to turn that around and to restore our middle class democracy is to uh is to allow workers to organize and workers are standing up for themselves after 40 years of being pushed down another story we re following very closely at the network is kellogg s is actually suing striking employees towards unionizing is this legal what s the president they re setting here in virginia well i think it s absolutely disgusting how kellogg s is attacking uh their workforce what the workers are standing up for is a fair contract they re trying to end two tier wages which basically takes new employees and and reduces their pay and their benefits and um the company is making record profits and so they should not be attacking their own workers that s what starbucks is doing as well in addition to the other corporations and so workers solidarity is what s going to turn this around and honestly it s what s going to save this country because we will descend not only into oligarchy but into division if we don t restore the right of workers to have unions and to have a voice you can t have an entire population of people 60 of the population has has less than 2 of the nation s wealth it s all being concentrated at the top that s not a sustainable model so we all should hope that these workers continue to band together continue to stand up to continue to be courageous and achieve justice on the job virginia diamond the president of the northern virginia a f l c i o great insight thank you so much virginia this is such an important story we will continue to follow get national breaking news alerts the latest breaking updates delivered straight to your email inbox your

how jussie smollett went from victim of a heinous crime that shocked america to a national laughing stock and convicted liar and it was all done to boost his career smollett claimed he was attacked on january 29 2019 he didn t want to report it to police but his friends did the case was leaked to the press immediately and he won unanimous sympathy from stars and politicians donald trump the then president called it horrible smollett had said trump supporters beat him up he went on a pr tour doing shows and going on good morning america before being arrested on feb 20 the star then became a laughing stock and immediate meme material while maintaining his innocence a first set of charges were dropped in march 2019 smollett was friendly with the prosecutor kim foxx he was eventually charged by special prosecutor dan webb in february 2020 a year after the attack jussie smollett was charged with six counts of disorderly conduct the trial finally began last week the verdict was reached after a 10 day trial by a jury of 10 white people one black man and a hispanic woman smollett 39 maintained his innocence throughout and he took to the stand on the final days of testimony brothers abel and ola osundairo also testified about how he d paid them to beat him up for publicity it was a horrific crime that shocked and saddened america a young black and gay actor brutally beaten in the middle of the night by two racist bigots who launched homophobic slurs and even threw a noose over their victim s neck in a sickening modern day lynching that is how the world first reacted to the attack jussie smollett said he was the victim of on january 29 2019 the actor then somewhat well known but nowhere close to as famous as he is now won an outpouring of sympathy and support from politicians on either side of the aisle and fellow hollywood stars now nearly three years after the attack was first reported the controversy surrounding it is over guilty verdict graph as a jury ruled this week smollett lied telling people he didn t know his attackers when he d in fact paid them to perform the attack in a sickeningly selfish bid to boost his own celebrity profile not guilty graph as a jury ruled this week there is no proof that smollett lied nor is there any explanation for why the nigerian brothers who attacked him and who were his friends turned on him the case took many twists and turns before it ended up with a jury in cook county illinois and it all began with a gushing of support for the man who claimed in court last week that he d been a victim of a racist police force and public that never wanted to believe him and still doesn t the attack and the world s sympathy jussie smollett is shown on facetime in hospital with creator lee daniels in the immediate aftermath of the attack dailymail com s headline on january 29 2019 the first whispers of the attack emerged in local chicago media outlets and blogs with little on the record from smollett then a 36 year old actor on the hit show empire soon it was confirmed by friends of his from the 20th century fox production that he d been attacked in the street outside his apartment at around 2am on january 29 2019 the details were hazy but it was immediately reported that he was the victim of a bigoted hate crime the world snapped into outrage then president donald trump called the attack horrible telling reporters in the oval office it doesn t get worse than that and i mean it i can tell you that it s horrible it doesn t get worse he said of the attack kamala harris called for everyone to support smollett and described it as a modern day lynching jussie smollett is one of the kindest most gentle human beings i know i m praying for his quick recovery this was an attempted modern day lynching no one should have to fear for their life because of their sexuality or color of their skin we must confront this hate everyone from naomi campbell john legend fergie shonda rhimes and the reverend al sharpton rallied behind smollett who stayed quiet for a few days then returned to the public eye president donald trump said when he was first told about the attack that i can tell you is horrible i seen it last night i can tell you it was horrible it doesn t get worse than that and i mean it kamala harris tweeted her sympathy bernie sanders shared his al sharpton shonda rhimes zendaya ana navarro he released a statement saying i am ok my body is strong but my soul is stronger more importantly i want to say thank you the outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than i will ever be able to truly put into words he added that while he was frustrated with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations about the case he believes justice will be served an intense police investigation as smollett soaked up the sympathy of politicians chicago police detectives were scrambling to try to identify the men who he said had attacked him there was resounding shock including from smollett when police revealed publicly that the attack hadn t been caught on surveillance camera footage there were surveillance cameras of the surrounding streets and of smollett s buildings but not of the actual incident the surrounding cameras were able to pick up the movements of other people in the nearby streets however and they crucially identified two men of bulky build walking near the scene of the attack at the right time chicago pd have identified the two men they described as persons of interest in the jussie smollett case earlier this month two weeks after the actor was attacked and within hours of his first interview about it the two persons of interest have not been named chicago pd released the surveillance footage saying they were persons of interest and asking anyone with information to come forward it was horrible it was a hate crime the noose the bleach everyone from the mayor on down wanted answers detective michael theis the investigation was intense according to former chicago detectives who worked on it and who testified at the trial they said that the message came down from the mayor rahm emanuel at the time that no expense was to be spared in pursuit of the attackers dozens of officers were put on to work round the clock to find those responsible it was horrible it was a hate crime the noose the bleach everyone from the mayor on down wanted answers detective michael theis testified smollett soaks up the sympathy while cops work to find his attackers smollett returns to the stage on february 3 declaring himself the gay tupac and telling an audience in los angeles that he was bruised in the attack i was bruised but my ribs were not cracked they were not broken i went to the doctor immediately my friend fred jackson drove me but i was not hospitalized smollett says in the video both my doctors in chicago and los angeles cleared me to perform but they said to take care obviously and above all i fought the f back smollett then paused and stated i m the gay tupac there were whoops and cheers from the crowd by february 14 chicago pd had worked out that it was the osundairo brothers in the surveillance footage after tracing their cell phone gps records and their uber activity on the night of the attack the brothers took a rideshare under their real names using their normal accounts which is what put them on the radar of the detectives the cops then checked their social media and quickly realized they were friends with smollett that is when chicago cops say their investigation changed course smollett who was publicly grumbling about media leaks about the case was doubling down on his story wearing a collection of pins to show support of pride and freedom first among others in his interview with good morning america that aired on thursday jussie smollett spoke in detail about the attack he suffered on january 29 and was overcome with emotion at several points back in action jussie smollett spoke out about his attack on sunday while performing for fans in los angeles above he went on good morning america arriving to set two hours late to plead his case to robin roberts and insist once and for all he was innocent he wept to roberts i m p d off it s the attackers but it s also the attacks at first it was a thing of like listen if i tell the truth then that s it cause it s the truth i want a little gay boy who might watch this to see that i fought the f back they ran off i didn t smollett on good morning america on february 14th then it became a thing of like oh how can you doubt that how can you not believe that it s the truth and then it became a thing of like oh it s not necessarily that you don t believe that this is the truth you don t even want to see the truth he said i want a little gay boy who might watch this to see that i fought the f back they ran off i didn t he said when asked by robin roberts if the men in the surveillance footage were the men who attacked him he said without doubt that they were the tide turns on jussie abimbola abel left 25 and olabinjo ola osundairo right are the two brothers being questioned over the jussie smollett attack whose home was raided in chicago on wednesday between february 14 and february 20 chicago police department were slowly building a case against jussie which they gave to a grand jury the first whispers that the actor may have been lying emerged on february 14 2019 when multiple news outlets cited unnamed police sources who said it was being considered as a possibility dailymail com reported on february 14 did empire star stage hate crime on himself to save his job jussie smollett is accused of setting up maga racist and homophobic attack because he was being written out after two show extras are detained the brothers names weren t yet in the public eye but it was being leaked that those who were in the surveillance camera footage had connections to empire which raised serious doubt then followed a week of back and forth between jussie s supporters and the police critics said it was an example of a racist police force in action that officers never believed jussie and the top brass couldn t be trusted top brass at the time was eddie johnson he has since been fired for getting drunk and having an affair with a female member of his team he lost his position after being found asleep at his car wheel smollett was arrested on february 20 five days after the brothers were identified and after they testified before a grand jury that he had paid them to participate in the hoax surveillance footage emerged on wednesday showing ola and abel osundairo buying ski masks the day before the attack smollett gave them a 100 bill to pay for the bleach ski masks red hat and gloves that they used according to prosecutors the brothers names are included in this inventory list that police left with their relatives detailing all the items they took from the house as part of their investigation the list included proof of residency for both brothers and bottles of la s totally awesome bleach smollett follows the brothers joint instagram account where they post videos and photographs of themselves working out smollett immediately pleaded his innocence jussie smollett is shown in his mugshot from february 21 2019 he returned to the set of empire after being released on a 10 000 bond and told his co workers i swear to god i did not do this police namely chief johnson skewered him publicly for wasting police time and resources at a press conference johnson who is also black said it was despicable for smollett to have fanned the flames of racial tension in the country once the evidence was laid out about the facts that smollett knew the brothers had been exchanging messages with them in the hours and days before the attack and without any other suspects in the frame for being on the streets on the night in question the public s view of smollett had all but crumbled some resisted the urge to convict him and waited for the trial others seized on it the reactions varied from memes which destroyed the actor s credibility to serious commentary about the damage he d caused in an already polarized america jussie becomes a laughing stock while he awaits his fate in court the court of public opinion and pop culture finds smollett to be a liar almost immediately he became the butt of the joke for pundits and comedy show hosts including charles barkley who roasted smollett for writing the brothers a 3 500 check as apparent payment if you re gonna break the law do not write a check he said during his nba show inside the nba memes popped up all over the internet mocking jussie with fake taglines like when america is so great that you have to hire 2 dudes to beat you up we all make mistakes jussie don t beat yourself up about it and believe in something even if it didn t happen chris redd and sandra oh on saturday night live in march 2019 after smollett had been arrested smollett s attorneys kick into overdrive trying to undermine the brothers one went on nbc s today show to make the wild claim that the reason smollett described them as being white or light skinned is that they may have been wearing white make up on the night of the attack he did tell police that from what he saw he thought it was white or pale skin that s what he initially said obviously you can disguise that you can put make up on she said tina glandian one of jussie smollett s lawyers abel osundairo is shown in a 2016 video dressed up as the joker she went on to point to a 2016 youtube video of abel osundairo the brother in question where he is wearing white make up to perform a joker monologue as potential proof of her theory there s a video it took me all of five minutes when i was looking into the brothers to of one of the brothers in whiteface doing the joker monologue she said whitewash of justice first set of charges dropped by jussie s friend kim foxx and her deputies cook county da kim foxx smollett was indicted on sixteen felony counts that were returned from a grand jury and the case went into the hands of kim foxx the cook county district attorney and her office soon afterwards texts emerged between her and friends of smollett s family friends namely tina chen who was friends with the obama family and had worked for michelle obama the texts had been sent before he was arrested but as rumors swirled that he may not be being truthful and foxx agreed to help foxx recused herself after those were exposed but the damage was done on march 26 the decision was made by foxx s deputy joseph magats to drop the charges against smollett he even admitted that he thought smollett was guilty but said he had to make the decision to drop the charges because he d had no criminal record smollett ended up doing just 16 hours of community service he never had to plead guilty nor admit that he lied in exchange for the charges being dropped there was immediate uproar from mayor rahm emanuel and chief eddie johnson who called it a whitewash of justice they are making fools of all of us emanuel said they then sued jussie for the money they said was spent wasting police time on the case jussie kept somewhat of a low profile relaxing with family and friends in hawaii and in los angeles he d been cut out of empire where cast and crew were fiercely divided new prosecutor and a new trial that was delayed by covid eventually after much back and forth special prosecutor dan webb was appointed as taking on the case he charged jussie with six counts of felony disorderly conduct in february 2020 then the world soon shut down due to covid 19 and courts became suddenly backlogged it gave webb and the defense nearly two years to put together their case before it began at the end of november in chicago 2021 nearly three years after the original hoax attack webb pulled no punches throughout he was hard and clear on evidence driving the fact that the brothers had been seen in an uber tracked by gps and seen on surveillance cameras on the night of the attack at the right time smollett s attorneys focused on trying to chip away at the brothers credibility they were never able to present a firm motive for why the brothers would have made it up nenya uche smollett s leading defense attorney suggested two that olabinjo was a homophobe and abel was trying to deny his relationship with smollett and his sexuality or the pair wanted smollett to hire them as security a court sketch of jussie smollett squaring off with prosecutor dan webb in court in chicago on tuesday as he took the stand for a second day jussie smollett leaves court on wednesday december 8 as the jury begins deliberating his fate the actor was flanked by his family neither one of them was extensively played out for the jury to consider there was minimal drama inside the courtroom and smollett showed up every day with his mother janet and his siblings he took the stand twice on the final two days of testimony and was cool while being questioned by his own attorneys when it came to the prosecution s cross examination he lost his temper and snapped at times the jury was made up of white men five white women a black man and a hispanic woman advertisement it lasted less than two weeks bringing a final end to the scandal that smollett sparked when he first told police nearly three years ago that he a proudly black and gay man had been the victim of an attack that never happened

washington afp us senators voted thursday to create a one time law allowing democrats to lift the nation s borrowing authority and avert a disastrous credit default without requiring votes from the opposition republicans advertising read more the move allows democratic controlled congress to lift the debt limit by a specific dollar amount with a simple majority in both chambers meaning it can pass into law without republican fingerprints on the hike we still have a few more steps to take before we completely resolve this matter but i am optimistic that after today s vote we will be on a glide path to avoid a catastrophic default democratic senate majority leader chuck schumer said a debt limit increase would normally require 60 votes in the 50 50 split senate meaning republicans who are always keen to project themselves as fiscal conservatives would have to chip in with votes in favor but the new law approved thursday means the body can now pass solely with support from every democrat and a tie breaking yea from vice president kamala harris meanwhile the republicans can essentially stand on the sidelines not blocking the democrats but offering no votes themselves to raise the limit the compromise caps weeks of fraught negotiations and comes just days ahead of the deadline for the debt limit being reached without action the united states would no longer have been able to meet its debt repayment obligations soon after next wednesday america spends more money than it brings in through taxation so it borrows money by issuing government bonds seen as among the world s safest investments around 80 years ago lawmakers introduced a limit on how much federal debt could be accrued the ceiling has been lifted dozens of times to allow the government to meet its spending commitments usually without drama and with the support of both parties and stands at around 29 trillion the final simple majority house and senate votes on raising the debt ceiling itself are expected early next week democratic leaders spent weeks underlining the havoc that a default would have wrought including the loss of an estimated six million jobs and 15 trillion in household wealth the battle has been a bruising affair for mitch mcconnell who leads the republicans in the senate and has come under heavy fire from his own side and from former president donald trump for helping democrats stave off the crisis the kentucky senator shocked washington in the summer when he demanded that democrats use a complicated and time consuming legislative process called reconciliation to raise the borrowing cap on their own his plan was to force democrats to increase the debt by a specific number without any republican involvement at all and then hammer them for out of control spending on the campaign trail instead of gumming up the process mcconnell agreed in the end to the equally convoluted but much quicker approach playing out now schumer thanked mcconnell describing their talks to reach a deal as fruitful candid and productive 2021 afp

the penny uranium stock is far riskier than you might think what happened uranium prices have almost single handedly driven uranium stocks in recent weeks yet despite uranium prices popping in the month of november uranium stock ur energy urg 4 52 tumbled 14 4 in the month according to data provided by s p global market intelligence there s no respite in sight for ur energy the stock s down another 6 so far in december so what the only release from ur energy in november was a quarterly earnings report ur energy has only one operational mine the lost creek in wyoming the company though is barely producing any uranium right now as it requires higher uranium prices to be commercially viable as of oct 27 ur energy had 285 000 pounds of uranium inventory but management stated it doesn t expect to sell any of that uranium over the next 12 months the biggest takeaway from ur energy s earnings report was its decision to advance development of lost creek to prepare the mine for a production ramp up as end markets demand this step even encouraged analyst jake sekelsky at alliance global partners to raise his price target on ur energy stock to 2 50 per share from 2 20 per share sekelsky believes ur energy s move should position the company to become a domestic producer of uranium quickly once a positive restart decision is made ur energy stock popped only briefly in early november and slid back down as the month progressed for one big reason the company s announcement to sell shares worth 100 million in parts such an offer will dilute existing shareholders wealth at a time when the company is not making any money moreover the company said it will use the proceeds from shares sale for general corporate purposes and not for growth now what ur energy is at best a speculative penny stock the company doesn t really stand to gain anything right now even if uranium prices were to inch higher unless it bags sales contracts from utilities nuclear reactors run on uranium fuel and utilities are eventually the key end consumers that drive long term demand for the fuel however such contracts run for years and even the largest uranium producers are still waiting for utilities to make a comeback given the backdrop there are far better uranium stocks than ur energy you could buy right now

reasons for upward trend in cotton prices and future outlook not entirely clear by jon devine to say the least it has been an interesting couple of years for the cotton market with covid an initial effect was a large overhang in supply before the pandemic the expectation was that cotton production and mill demand would be virtually even in the 2019 20 crop year when the virus shuttered spinning mills around the world it caused a yawning surplus at nearly 20 million bales it represented the second largest addition to global supply on record only behind the addition made to stocks in 2011 12 after the 2010 11 spike according to market and trade data from the united states department of agriculture usda foreign agricultural service fas since then a global production deficit occurred in the 2020 21 crop year 5 million bales and a small deficit is expected for the world in the current 2021 22 crop year 2 million bales the net result expected after these three crop years is the addition of more than 10 million bales to global stocks according to the usda fas before covid the world was not facing a shortage of cotton with supplies swollen a persistent question is why cotton prices have been able to continue to climb undefeated uptrend part of the reason may be that cotton prices have simply been unable to break lower since april 2020 cotton prices have moved only in one direction this has happened despite the emergence of the covid delta variant recurring lockdown orders around the world persistent shipping challenges inflation and concerns about the future trajectory of chinese economic growth cotton s undefeated uptrend may be partly due to what has been called the everything rally that has spanned financial markets an illustration is the correlation between cotton futures and the s p 500 both tracked a nearly linear trend line since april 2020 relative to their averages in january 2020 pre covid nearby cotton futures were down 31 percent at the start of april 2020 and the s p 500 was down 25 percent by the end of august 2021 nearby cotton futures were up 37 percent versus their january 2020 average and the s p 500 was up 38 percent according to data from reuters and calculations by cotton incorporated one common thread shared among cotton and other seemingly unrelated financial markets was the rising macroeconomic tide in place since the worst of the shutdown period relatedly another shared connection is exposure to the unprecedented stimulus measures that were unleashed to counter the effects of shutdowns and other restrictions on economic activity among other efforts the federal reserve has been pumping 120 billion of new money into the economy each month since the spring of 2020 the fed has been doing this to prevent the collapse of asset values in this regard it appears to have been succeeding with prices across many asset classes rising together this economic effort plus other stimulus measures has left many u s consumers better off than before the pandemic direct payments and reduced spending lifted consumer savings rates to level nearly double those before the pandemic according to the u s bureau of economic analysis on top of that the value of consumers largest assets including their homes and retirement accounts have risen sharply according to federal reserve data rebound in consumer demand with travel and other recreational services still affected by covid related regulations and concerns this has translated into spending growth on physical goods like clothing relative to the same period in 2019 consumer spending on apparel has been up 25 percent over the past six months u s bureau of economic analysis data shows normal rates of spending growth for apparel are 2 to 3 percent so consumer demand is well beyond what could have been expected without the virus even with port congestion and rising costs retailers and brands have been ramping up imports of finished textiles in terms of raw cotton equivalence u s imports of apparel are set to post their highest volume since 2010 and u s imports of home textiles are on pace to set a new record according to the usda cotton and wool outlook and cotton incorporated calculations demand pull from other countries has not been as strong but the world has collectively pulled out of recession during recessions companies commonly seek to conserve cash to survive this generally means pulling back on orders and inventory when demand resurfaces during the recovery a common result is a wave of orders to refill pipelines the scramble to secure capacity can bid up costs for materials and manufacturing u s supplies tight while stimulus and the everything rally may help explain the linear growth in prices from the spring of 2020 through the summer of 2021 desperation to secure cotton to meet near term needs may help explain the acceleration in cotton price increases since late september compounding the difficulty of getting cotton shipped to mills in a timely fashion is that the world s largest cotton exporter the united states experienced significant tightening last crop year the combination of adverse weather conditions and strong demand from china caused u s cotton stocks to drop by more than 50 percent between the start and end of 2020 21 according to the usda fas the current stocks to use ratio estimate for the united states in 2021 22 is below 20 percent this ratio has fallen below that level just a handful of times over the past couple decades in 2021 22 the united states is expected to collect a healthy harvest however strong import demand from china and other markets is expected to keep u s stocks at relatively tight levels through the end of the 2021 22 crop year according to usda fas data heavy speculator investment likely has been another factor in the recent price surge among other possible factors speculators could have been attracted to the cotton market due to the tightness in u s supply strong chinese purchases of u s cotton and memories of what happened to cotton prices after the last recession the commodity futures and trade commission cftc the government agency that oversees all u s futures markets reports positions in futures according to participant type between september 21 and october 5 the cftc reported that speculator bets that cotton prices would increase grew 48 percent that surge of money on the long side of the market could have contributed to volatility looking ahead an old saying in commodities markets is that the best cure for high prices is high prices the reason is that higher prices motivate producers to increase supply while they simultaneously depress demand one decade ago cotton prices rose to levels much higher than they have currently record prices in 2010 11 resulted in a new record for global acreage in 2011 12 those record prices also caused a seven year depression in cotton demand with it taking until 2017 18 for world mill use to recover back to its 2009 10 level the everything rally pulled corn and soybean prices higher alongside those for cotton however the latest surge in the cotton market has made cotton more favorable and three digit cotton can be expected to boost cotton acreage in the next crop year the outlook for demand is less clear but a slower pace could be expected to follow the initial push to refill supply chains if forecasts for 2022 23 call for a significant surplus in the united states and globally they could prove to be the challenge that finally upend the uptrend editor s notes jon devine is a

brand during a very difficult time that i believe was a pivotal moment for ifai and really shone a light on steve schiffman s leadership ifai has a military division and usifi for advocacy that strongly supports the berry amendment the membership of those divisions really pushed hard during 2020 to get textiles to mask and gown producers and push for long term commitments for domestically produced ppe tw as the leader of an innovative textile business how do you see the current state of the industry including current and or future challenges and opportunities bircher unfortunately the textile industry has been dealt tough issues that may not go away any time soon from labor issues to supply chain issues everyone is fighting the good fight to get products to their customers in a timely manner these are unprecedented times and one that i have never seen in my long textile career this is also a time to be very connected to your customers as good partners and get creative on servicing their needs we are always innovating and looking for opportunities to move forward and we will get through these challenging times in the end i think we will come out stronger than before and having gained knowledge that we never thought to seek we are continually investing in our industry and in 2022 mmi textiles is moving to our new 40 000 square foot headquarters facility in cleveland ohio and we are adding equipment in our lenoir n c narrow weaving facility to expand capacity and capabilities tw for textile industry leaders who step forward to serve in elected positions there is a tremendous commitment of time and brain power to the duties involved how will you balance those new demands with your responsibilities at mmi textiles bircher thankfully i have the best team in place within mmi textiles that will allow me to have the time to commit to my responsibilities as chairman i have also had time to prepare for this moment i take this role and responsibility seriously mmi stands for me myself and i a commitment that i will give 110 percent to anything that i do and that is the same with my responsibilities as ifai chairman tw trade has been a significant issue for the current administration what are your thoughts as ifai chairman as well as a ceo of a company with global business interests bircher from an mmi perspective trade has been and always will be a tough topic for business we live in a global environment with trade policies evolving and potentially changing all the time we import product from asia including china and while tariffs affected me when they were put in place i actually agree with them what has been difficult is the tariff exclusions for ppe we have proven that the united states can produce ppe products and we need to have those products produced on american soil what happened when we were cut off from ppe out of asia where some 80 percent was produced pre pandemic and the subsequent price gouging is a wake up call that we can t rely on foreign entities to keep us healthy and safe now we are fighting for made in usa ppe laws so that all of the companies that made huge investments in equipment can continue to produce ppe in this country from an ifai perspective the organization is global and must remain neutral in its opinions on trade however it does have the usifi division that advocates for regulatory and legislative issues to protect its usa based manufacturing membership tw imagine you are looking back on your year as chairman where is ifai and what contributions did you make to the organization bircher after one year i hope i have provided steve and his leadership team with the support they need from me in my role to continue to propel them forward in the manner for which they have approached their vision and mission every day we will also have finished our rebranding and unveiled to the industry at large tw what do you see for ifai in the future beyond your tenure as chairman bircher post chairman role i see great ifai board leaders and next chairmen continuing the hard work and support of steve schiffman and his team to stay the course they have taken in their strategic vision for ifai the organization will continue to evolve and will not only strengthen and grow its core divisions but will add new markets that feel the need to belong to ifai november december 2021

production the company reported 402 million in revenue for q3 even though the total production of 51 8 million barrels of oil equivalent per day was down 20 yoy the company s cash flow was strong too oasis saw 294 million in net cash from operations during the quarter with a free cash flow of 65 million and it has no debt on the balance sheet growing revenues and a rising stock price support the company s dividend which is yielding 4 8 truist analyst neal dingmann sees the cash flow and dividend as key attractors for investor here as they hold the promise of solid returns based on a growing share value he writes oasis continues to run a consistent moderate program that we forecast will result in notable fcf largely paid to shareholders given the little to no total debt on the balance sheet we anticipate a program going forward that could be a combination of dividends and potential stock buybacks it should be unsurprising then that dingmann rates oas a buy not to mention the 168

t here is something slightly tedious about the dollar s rude health it seems as inevitable as lying politicians and stormy winters the dxy a gauge of the dollar against half a dozen other rich world currencies is up by almost 7 since the start of the year the broad dollar index which measures the dollar against 26 of america s trading partners has also risen markedly since june it is difficult to imagine what might check its rise but it is still worth trying you may find that the case for a reversal of the dollar in 2022 is more plausible than you had thought listen to this story enjoy more audio and podcasts on ios or android your browser does not support the element the dollar s current strength is tied to american exceptionalism of a sort the s p 500 index of leading shares consistently outperforms the stockmarkets of other countries america s economy has proved to be a reliable source of growth it has emerged from the pandemic more strongly than just about anywhere else after a brief loss of energy in the summer it is now showing renewed vigour as a consequence inflation is stubbornly high the chairman of the federal reserve jay powell has already said that the fed will move faster towards ending its bond purchases thus paving the way for interest rate increases elsewhere things are running less hot china s gdp growth is sluggish in europe a wave of covid 19 infections has led to some restrictions on business activities and while the full implications of the omicron variant are not certain there is a general feeling it will prove to be more of an economic headwind outside america one currency that has kept up with the dollar is the yuan this is because more money is flowing into china than out of it bumper exports to america have contributed to a huge trade surplus portfolio capital is washing in foreign investors are loading up on bonds and stocks which are now a bigger part of their benchmarks meanwhile less money is leaking out spending abroad by chinese tourists has all but vanished as a consequence of travel bans still the risks seem tilted towards a fall in the yuan against the dollar china is leaning towards a looser monetary setting as policymakers grapple with distress in the property sector this week s reduction in reserve requirements might even be a hint that beijing would prefer a weaker yuan put this all together and the argument for a strong dollar looks watertight but the situation is fluid there is a decent case that the dollar will peak in the coming months and then weaken for that to happen three conditions need to be fulfilled first the global growth gap must narrow america s economy has more than recovered other countries still have ground to make up they will eventually do so too much of the sluggishness of asia is put down to china s slowdown and not enough to the lingering effects of the pandemic across the region europe has never quite reopened fully and there is fiscal stimulus from the eu recovery fund in the pipeline america may still lead the pack but the race will be closer a second condition is lower inflation oil prices have fallen already there are tentative signs that bottlenecks are easing business surveys in goods producing hubs such as taiwan and vietnam show a pickup in delivery times if these developments translate into lower headline inflation says mansoor mohi uddin of the bank of singapore it will allow the fed to pivot towards a less hawkish stance a third condition for a weaker dollar it is hard to be an interest rate dove when inflation is so high but if it falls back during 2022 and the economy slows the fed s focus could easily tip back to the jobs part of its mandate by the spring or early summer markets may find themselves pricing in more interest rate rises than the fed is minded to deliver it is easy to forget but other central banks get to do monetary policy too a recovering euro zone economy might easily stir the hawks at the european central bank says kit juckes of société générale a bank even the hint of an interest rate rise in the euro zone could be a game changer for currency markets for dollar bulls this might all sound a bit far fetched a lot of their enthusiasm is tied to high inflation and its implications for interest rates but this carries dangers inflation is not a high quality reason for backing a currency says steven englander of standard chartered another bank quite so if inflation in america proves stubborn in the medium term that is not obviously good for the dollar either for now the greenback is a winning currency but there are still a few ways it could lose for more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to money talks our weekly newsletter read more from buttonwood our columnist on financial markets have spacs been cleaned up dec 4th 2021 why the bond market has become jumpier nov 27th 2021 baillie gifford and the three quandaries of fund management nov 20th 2021
brian mayhew stepped into his job before the turn of this century taking on fiscal responsibility for a set of bridges that urgently needed upgrades to protect them against california s earthquakes more than two decades and many billions of dollars in debt later he will retire as chief financial officer of the san francisco bay area s metropolitan transportation commission and bay area toll authority the refits and new construction on the region s seven big state bridges haven t yet been tested in an earthquake but mayhew had to guide them through recession market turmoil and pandemic bay area toll authority cfo brian mayhew shown at the bond buyer s 2017 deal of the year award ceremony will retire in january every time mayhew thought he could think about leaving he said outside events convinced him to stay the first time i submitted my retirement papers was just before the great recession mayhew said the portfolio was in perfect shape everything was going well the market was good at that point i didn t know what else they would need me for he ll walk out the door with something on the order of 20 billion of financings and refinancings under his belt when brian got to mtc i don t think we had any outstanding debt at all said steve heminger former executive director of mtc who now serves on the board of directors of the san francisco municipal transportation agency and the peninsula corridor joint powers board the authority a public agency created in 1997 by california lawmakers administers the toll revenues from seven state owned toll bridges in the san francisco bay area the antioch bridge the benicia martinez bridge the carquinez bridge the dumbarton bridge the richmond san rafael bridge the san francisco oakland bay bridge and the san mateo hayward bridge bata was created to handle the money realized from toll operations that was used to make those bridges seismically safe and to provide financing for maintenance programs in conjunction with the california department of transportation lawmakers formed bata to speed up the retrofit of the bay area bridge system a critical link in an area defined by the geography of the san francisco bay and its connected waterways lawmakers had mandated that caltrans improve the state s nearly 1 000 bridges following the bay area s loma prieta earthquake in 1989 and los angeles northridge earthquake in 1994 i thought i would work here for a decade and then retire or become a commercial banker mayhew said instead he steered bata through multiple external crises starting in the 2008 recession that crushed much of the bond insurance business and undermined the liquidity arrangements supporting many of bata s variable rate bonds and associated interest rate swaps he deserves a tremendous amount of credit for standing up the enterprise and seeing us through troubling times like the 2008 great recession and construction challenges heminger said when the market cratered bata needed to restructure at a time when market access was in question we were trying to figure out how to keep a 100 million a month capital program going mayhew said we couldn t keep it fed when the federal government came along with build america bonds allowing the sale of taxable bonds with federal subsidy as an alternative to selling traditional tax exempts that allowed bata to access international investors and finish the bridge financing program mayhew said his road into municipal finance began after college when his sister referred him to a job doing energy analysis and working on energy bonds he applied for that position because there weren t opportunities to work as a commercial banker when he graduated from the university of california at santa barbara with a bachelor s degree in economics and a master s degree in political science a 2011 photo shows construction on eastern span of the san francisco oakland bay bridge that bridge which opened in 2013 is the highest profile piece of the earthquake safety project on the bay area s seven state owned bridges bloomberg news my father edward was a banker and my grandfather was a gold trader mayhew said i never expected to be working with municipal bonds even as his career progressed and he ended up working as a financial director for the city of westminster california and earlier as a revenue officer for the city of mountain view california he expected to head over to commercial banking at some point then an opening occurred to be the chief financial officer for the bata and mtc and he decided to apply with no experience in transportation finance mayhew said he was a third round draft pick we decided to hire him despite one of the most disastrous job interviews heminger said he got something caught in his throat on the flight up and coughed through the entire interview but that third round draft pick ended up not only being selected to be bata s cfo but has held the job since october 1999 that longevity means mayhew has been the cfo nearly the entire time that bata has been in existence i had a chance to finance 1 billion in capital projects and that s a lot it was the ability to do project financing at the highest level mayhew said i didn t even know if i was good enough heminger said mayhew had exactly the kind of experience the mtc wanted in the position because the state has strong regional transportation organizations that oversee many of its projects in that sector and mayhew had local government experience and extensive financial experience his financings have earned bata multiple far west deal of the year recognitions from the bond buyer the first was in 2002 the first year of the deal of the year award the most recent came in 2017 for a 1 95 billion dollar deal that saved money by combining the remarketing of bonds that were approaching their mandatory tender date with a fixed rate refunding the deal employed a soft put step up structure the authority pioneered in 2013 the fixed rate refunding bonds were amortized first and the term rate bonds second this wrap allowed bata to reduce the average life of costly fixed rate debt by approximately five years at no incremental cost the amortization also took into account all outstanding debt service to reduce bata s maximum annual debt service bata most recently shocked by a pandemic that undercut toll bridge traffic and end cash toll collections overnight was back in the market this week with a 1 3 billion deal that mayhew said he hoped would smooth debt as well as provide funding for projects and position his successor well for the future

by laura sanicola reuters oil prices settled lower on thursday on fears about the economic outlook in the world s biggest oil importer following ratings downgrades to two chinese property developers and after some governments took measures to fight the omicron variant of the coronavirus brent crude futures settled down 1 40 or 1 9 to 74 42 a barrel backing off a session high of 76 70 u s west texas intermediate wti crude futures were down 1 42 or 2 at 70 94 after hitting a peak of 73 34 on thursday ratings agency fitch downgraded property developers china evergrande group and kaisa group to restricted default status saying they had defaulted on offshore bonds while a source said that kaisa had started work on restructuring its 12 billion offshore debt the news exacerbates the chinese gdp growth fears and ultimately could impact the oil buying appetite of the world s biggest crude customer said rystad energy analyst louise dickson on wednesday british prime minister boris johnson imposed tougher covid 19 restrictions in england saying people should work from home where possible wear masks in public places and show covid 19 vaccine passes for entry to certain events and venues although laboratory tests showed that the pfizer vaccine has a neutralising effect on omicron new measures are being introduced to try to stop the spread of the virus said tamas varga of oil brokerage pvm denmark also plans new restrictions including closure of restaurants bars and schools while china has halted group tourist trips from guangdong south korea has registered record infections while cases remain elevated in singapore and australia the number of americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits dropped last week to the lowest level in more than 52 years amid an acute shortage of workers according to new data published by the u s labor department the oil market doesn t always respond well to good economic news either because it could prompt the federal reserve to tighten monetary policy said john kilduff partner at again capital llc in new york markets were buoyed by comments from biontech and pfizer that a three shot course of their covid 19 vaccine could protect against infection from the omicron variant the omicron outbreak sparked a 16 slump in brent prices from nov 25 to dec 1 more than half of the drop has been recouped this week but analysts say a further recovery could be limited until omicron s impact is clearer u s inventory data released on wednesday also weighed on prices energy information administration eia data showed that crude inventories were down by 240 000 barrels last week much less than analysts in a reuters poll had expected with stocks at the cushing delivery hub in oklahoma rising by 2 4 million barrels fuel stocks also rose by a combined 6 6 million barrels the data showed additional reporting by adhmad ghaddar in london sonali paul in melbourne and muyu xu in beijingediting by david goodman kirsten donovan and david gregorio
after months of struggling to pay down its massive debts china evergrande group has defaulted a ratings agency said thursday fitch ratings said in a statement that it had placed the embattled home builder and two of its subsidiaries hengda real estate group and tianji holding into restricted default the designation means it has missed a debt payment but hasn t entered into bankruptcy or other process that would suspend operations the default was largely expected by analysts and investors probably blunting its effect on global markets the major u s stock indexes all coming off a three day rally were down slightly in afternoon trading thursday investors aren t reacting much because this has been baked in for a long time said nick lardy senior fellow with the peterson institute for international economics it s a slow motion car crash and i think we ll see more coming because they have a lot of debt that s due over the next year another chinese developer kaisa group holdings also was given a restricted default rating thursday it failed to repay senior notes totaling roughly 400 million that were due tuesday fitch said in a statement its shares were suspended from the hong kong stock exchange on wednesday according to reuters evergrande founded in 1996 rode its way to the top of china s housing boom while building up a mountain of debt its founder xu jiayin briefly became china s wealthiest business executive in 2017 and evergrande the world s most valuable real estate company in 2018 as of june 30 he and his wife ding yumei together owned 77 of the shares according to a september investor note from the ratings agency moody s fitch says it s one of china s three largest developers by contracted sales the company says it has more than 200 000 employees and supports about 3 8 million jobs its assets are worth approximately 2 3 trillion yuan according to the associated press or 360 6 billion but in recent months the company has been staggering under the weight of 300 billion in liabilities in september moody s predicted evergrande would be unable to generate enough cash flow to meet its debt and operating needs over the next 12 months on friday evergrande said that it had received a demand to make good on a 260 million obligation but that it couldn t guarantee it would be able to keep up with its debts fitch said thursday that evergrande provided no indication of how it will settle the debts or whether it intends to do so at all it also said the company did not respond to its request for confirmation of payment after the 30 day grace period on the coupon payments lapsed dec 6 we are therefore assuming they were not paid fitch said the chinese developer s precarious finances had raised alarms about a worst case scenario one in which its collapse could snowball across the global financial sector as lehman brothers did in 2008 those fears have been tempered partly because of beijing s signals that it will prevent wider fallout lardy the peterson institute senior fellow said he sees little commonality between evergrande s problems and the mortgage crisis that hit the united states more than a decade ago china s lenders are financially responsible for whether home loans are repaid making it harder for them to spread risk across the financial system as was the case before the 2007 2008 crisis in the united states the bigger risk for china is that people will lose confidence in the housing market if paid for houses aren t delivered evergrande has fueled much of its expansion by preselling apartments leaving it with hundreds of thousands of unfinished projects that it will need to complete or offload the company has been scrambling to sell those assets to free up cash the government is very concerned about whether the millions of people who have bought houses from evergrande will get their houses lardy said if that doesn t happen confidence in the property sector will erode fortunately he says china has more than 90 000 property developers so even a large default is likely to be viewed as little more than a drop in the bucket and even a worst case scenario in china is unlikely to rattle global markets the way the lehman collapse did i think this is primarily a risk to china lardy said china s central bank has rushed to assure the public that it can contain any broader damage to the nation s economy on thursday chinese central banker yi gang said evergrande s problems are not expected to cause lasting harm according to a transcript referenced by the associated press the short term risk of individual real estate companies will not affect the normal financing function of the medium and long term market yi said according to the ap scott kennedy an expert on chinese economics with the center for strategic and international studies says evergrande is effectively being drawn down through a government managed process the chinese government is aiming for to basically die a gradual death that is managed in a way that doesn t have a huge impact on the rest of the chinese economy and for us as well kennedy said it s possible that some core of the company will remain once its least profitable elements are sold off kennedy said but i don t think there s any option that keeps the company in the recognizable form that we see now evergrande currently trades over the counter at about 23 cents per share the stock price is down 85 in the past six months
joe biden needed an agreement with vladimir putin that would help reduce tensions in europe over ukraine and nato expansion so he manufactured a crisis as an excuse for putting a us position on the table the news coming out of ukraine was dire russia had mobilized between 95 125 000 troops along its border with ukraine and us intelligence agencies were predicting that an invasion was imminent nato was panicking and vladimir putin was insisting that ukraine must never be allowed to join the transatlantic alliance biden to clear the air with putin agreed to a video conference with the russian president where he looked him in the eye and warned of serious consequences including unprecedented economic sanctions and the threat of deploying additional us forces to europe should russia invade ukraine while much of the public reaction to the biden putin video conference has centered on the sanctions threat it is the threat to deploy military forces to europe which provides the greatest insight into the thinking of the biden administration when it comes to russia today first and foremost the us threat to reinforce nato s eastern flank is empty and everyone knows it the us army is already stretched to the breaking point by maintaining the existing rotation of a single heavy armored brigade some 5 000 troops in europe by 2022 the us is scheduled to complete the construction of an army prepositioned stock aps facility in poland designed to store a brigade s worth of equipment about 85 battle tanks 190 armored combat vehicles 35 artillery and four armored vehicle launched bridges along with hundreds of supporting equipment sets and pieces that will reduce the deployment time for the assigned brigade from the us to poland from the 45 to 60 days associated with shipping the equipment into a european port to the four to seven days needed to fly in the troops and issue the equipment for operational employment but even with 10 000 troops backed by 170 tanks 380 armored combat vehicles and 70 artillery pieces the us army would be in no shape to take on a potential russian opponent back in the 1980s the us military understood the true nature of soviet military capabilities we studied their doctrine at the national training center ntc in fort irwin california the us army created an opposition force opfor organized and equipped to replicate two soviet motorized rifle regiments opfor soldiers a 1986 article about training at the ntc noted are thoroughly trained in soviet battle tactics for the purpose of fighting stateside combat elements as though it were an actual war adding that the opfor soldiers dress in soviet uniforms and use replicas of russian armored vehicles to make their kills every move and action of the opfor adheres to soviet principles of armored warfare we had an average of 311 870 troops stationed in europe per year between 1986 and 1990 we had another 250 000 prepared to deploy to europe within 10 days the singular focus of all these men and women was to defeat the soviet army in combat we had a robust military attache program in place at our moscow embassy that aggressively collected and reported on soviet military capabilities attached to the soviet group of forces germany were 14 us military officers assigned to the us military liaison mission whose sole job was to monitor the soviet military presence in east germany the defense intelligence agency published an annual report soviet military power which was required reading for all us military personnel the cia maintained the office of soviet analysis sova where the best and the brightest resided publishing intelligence based assessments of soviet military capabilities they were backed up by the directorate for operations soviet east european division which oversaw the cia s moscow station where the most elite case officers were sent to ply their trade in short we knew and understood soviet military capabilities and the threat they posed today when it comes to the russian federation the united states is flying blind at the ntc the soviet opfor has been replaced with a scaled down version whose job is to replicate insurgencies and near peer opponents i e nothing at all what the us military would be facing if it were to be called upon to confront russian troops in a european ground war russian military doctrine no longer serves as the foundation of our own counter doctrine russia may very well be training to fight us and nato forces but we no longer anchor our doctrinal philosophy on the singular principle of closing with a destroying the russian threat for the past 20 years military careers have been defined by the global war on terror and more importantly waging low intensity conflict in afghanistan and iraq every aspect of the military establishment from recruiting training clothing equipping organizing deploying and fighting was re worked to deal with this new mode of fighting combined arms warfare the art of war centered on creating lethal synergism between infantry armor artillery airpower and intelligence was no longer practiced and the muscle memory that had accrued from over three decades of training atrophied our intelligence services support that which has been given priority and since the end of the cold war russia has not been a priority once a reservoir of unmatched talent the departments and offices that once monitored soviet military power have all been disbanded replaced by eurasian analysts who treat russia as but one part of a larger intelligence puzzle sova has been dissolved taking decades of institutional knowledge about all things russia along with it our military is no longer trained equipped or doctrinally prepared to fight a russian foe in a non nuclear matchup the result is all too predictable the military of course is aware of this and is gradually working toward rebuilding this lost capability but this will take time and resources not simply happen overnight joe biden knows this as well which is why he has taken pains in the aftermath of his video conference with putin to emphasize that the us obligation to defend its nato allies does not extend to ukraine the idea that the us is going to unilaterally use force to confront russia invading ukraine is not on the cards right now biden told the press after his conversation with putin this of course begs the question as to what biden hoped to accomplish by threatening to deploy more american forces to poland and the baltics in the first place especially if the us is not planning on any military confrontation with russia in the case of a russian invasion of ukraine the answer lies in biden s political need to shape perception both at home and abroad the expectations on the part of his democrat allies is that he would be tougher on russia than former president trump this public pronouncement has boxed him in considerably especially when common sense policy options must be put to the side in favor of posturing biden was caught off guard last april when russia mobilized 100 000 troops along its border with ukraine especially when his military leadership informed him that there was little the us could do about it the key problem facing the biden national security team on the need to engage russia was the fact that any engagement which considered russian concerns would be seen as a concession biden needed to be seen as operating from a position of strength as such when russia conducted its fall military maneuvers the us purposefully exaggerated what was little more than internal troop movements in response to similar nato exercises in poland and the baltics and ukrainian muscle flexing along the donbass front turning it into an imminent threat that triggered the current crisis biden s threat to deploy additional us forces now makes sense first and foremost he s not going to do it second russia is not preparing to invade ukraine and biden knows it the current crisis is being driven by ukraine s ongoing refusal to implement the minsk accords when it comes to recognizing the autonomy of the donbass region and its continued military posturing as a mechanism of gaining nato support for its ambition to reconquer the donbass and crimea russia has been insisting that the us put pressure on ukraine s president volodymyr zelensky to adhere to the minsk agreement and that the us provide assurances that nato would stop its eastward expansion any move by the us void of an additional predicate would be seen by both the american domestic audience and america s nato allies as a sign of weakness however by building up a non existent threat i e a russian invasion of ukraine and then threatening to dispatch non existent troops to eastern europe if russia were to invade biden can now take credit for being strong in the face of russian aggression moreover when russia doesn t invade and it won t unless responding to any large scale military provocation by ukraine biden can take credit for making putin back down in this context jake sullivan s announcement that the biden administration is open to broad talks with russia about the future of european security coupled with biden s announcement that the us would not come to the aid of ukraine in the event of a russian invasion and a similar announcement by biden that the us would not support ukrainian membership in nato for at least 10 years can be spun as responsible actions taken from a position of strength instead of the logical response to realpolitik rt com

what is donald trump really worth to a business he s known for making lavish claims about what his brand is worth others have punctured his estimates as wildly inflated especially since the reputational hits he took at the end of his presidency but now we have a new kind of answer thanks to investors the trump aura alone at least to a media startup appears to be worth a neat 1 billion that s how much secret financiers are investing in trump s newly formed trump media technology group which is going public by merging with a shell company called digital world acquisition tmtg as bloomberg opinion s timothy l o brien and matt levine explain has no products no revenue no cash flow no known intellectual property no big names attached and no clear business plan only a wispy promise to build a new social media network truth social to take on twitter facebook amazon and other tech companies and yet the company has excited traders enough to boost its current market value to more than 2 billion you might think that this means the trump brand is actually worth 2 billion but you d be wrong the speculative run up of the stock is a reaction to the 1 billion the trump brand attracted not to the trump brand alone did we say there are no big names attached to tmtg well trump is chair and he is a big name but he has no tech experience and a mixed record at best as a company builder the second biggest name at tmtg is devin nunes whom trump just appointed as the company s ceo nunes is a soon to retire republican member of congress who has degrees in agriculture science and lots of experience running his family s dairy farm but no tech background sounds like a great starting rotation for a phantom team the ridicule that s gushing down on trump s company from the tech and financial press is wholly warranted putting money into the company is is closer to gambling than investing says marketwatch tmtg has already blown through its promise to produce a beta version of its truth software by november and the securities and exchange commission has commenced an investigation of whether trump s media company had broken securities laws in its formation all this flakiness gives us a safe harbor the size of the san francisco bay to speculate that trump hasn t set out to create a viable media business as much as he has dreamed up a new fusion of politics media and finance designed with one primary objective to give people who like trump an easy and legal way to give trump money the way tmtg has come charging out of the gate with no product and no revenue but ample investors has financial journalists comparing it to a meme stock like gamestop amc and blackberry securities that appeal to naïve retail investors who willingly ignore business fundamentals and buy depending on which way the social media winds blow a different point of comparison might be with other ex presidents looking to cash in on their political celebrity trump isn t the first to board the money go round after leaving office in the first dozen years out of office bill clinton collected 106 million for giving speeches barack and michelle obama reportedly signed a 65 million book deal but no former president and certainly no former president who is preparing to run again has ever dipped his cup into financial markets to raise the sort of money tmtg has raised overnight the prospect of another trump run again raises fresh ethical issues who might the unnamed investors enlisted by trump be o brien asks in his column to whom might trump become financially beholden who will have financial hooks into him if he regains the white house the saudis united arab emirates russian oligarchs drug cartels any one of these groups would represent a conflict of interest not to mention a potential national security threat that would make his trump hotel entanglements look like free tickets to a monster truck show what exactly did unnamed investors buy when they dropped their millions into tmtg and should we worry about them getting fleeced no this is 2021 after all and even naïve investors know the wretched history of trump s bankruptcies his poor record of running public companies and his failure to pay back loans that he s a stinker of a business partner is deeply baked into his persona by now anybody willing to invest with him today has either convinced themselves they ll find a greater fool they can sell their shares to later at a profit or has decided that millions of dollars they ve invested will pay off with favors if he returns to the white house trump s media company may look like a scam but you ve got to admire the way he s leveraged his name into a billion dollar cascade that fills his coffers and also gives him a new vantage point to conduct his campaign against other media 1 billion sends an important message to big tech that censorship and political discrimination must end america is ready for truth social a platform that will not discriminate on the basis of political ideology was the way trump bragged about it in a saturday press release about a new round of investment the size of trump s own stake in tmtg remains unknown but it s likely to have produced a better short term payout than the 40 percent of the company the social media site parler was said to have offered him at the beginning of the year to make it his home on the web why share his aura with parler he obviously thought when capturing most of the value of trumpiness for himself was possible will tmtg end up a financial winner like trump tower or a dud and an embarrassment like trump steaks the 2016 election results are a permanent reminder that nobody should ever underestimate trump but does he possess the drive and retain the personal appeal to his fans that convert them into devoted users of truth social dan alexander who has been following the trump initiative for forbes writes that the company could be worth 5 6 billion if it succeeds in attracting about 29 million users one third of the 86 million who followed trump on twitter they become dedicated users and tmtg serves them ads at twitter s rates 186 per user these are all big ifs of course changing users media habits with a new site can be formidable parler launched in 2018 as a twitter alternative for the right leaning had only about 2 3 million active users last december according to cnn in the coming months as truth social goes live and users download the app we ll quickly find out if trump is worth the 1 billion bet investors have placed on him or if the trump aura is actually a mirage as tmtg collapses into lawsuits acrimony and financial penalties extracted by the federal government in trump university fashion either way you can be assured that trump will come out of it with a handful of cash he always seems to truth social should market itself as america s first anti social media site send one liners to shafer politico gmail com my email alerts miss orkut

billion in the latest week after inflows of 53 250 million the previous week looking ahead as the close of 2021 approaches municipal experts are looking back at the previous 11 months and weighing their technical forecast for 2022 and supply is a primary consideration according to jeff lipton managing director and head of municipal credit and market strategy and municipal capital markets at oppenheimer inc forecasting 2022 s overall volume at between 450 billion and 460 billion lipton said his prediction would have been closer to 500 billion were it not for the fact that a new version of direct pay and a reinstatement of tax exempt advance refundings did not make it to the build back better legislation he said supply will be influenced by available federal stimulus funding which could obviate the need for bond financing the outlook for the economy in general including gdp employment and inflation and for municipal credit specifically as well as historically low interest rates according to lipton he noted that so far in 2021 volume trends were influenced by some unique considerations that shifted issuer sentiment pandemic driven developments particularly allocations of federal stimulus money directed toward state and local issuers that relieved certain pressures to float new bonded debt and a wait and see approach taken by many issuers awaiting the future of key muni bond provisions as part of a broader legislative package certainly influenced volume trends lipton said in a report wednesday january 2022 may bring about a more typical january effect with lighter weekly calendars as extended pent up supply came about toward the end of 2021 coupled with growing reinvestment needs from maturing securities and bond redemptions lipton said muni technicals coupled with a more favorable credit outlook than initially anticipated will likely bring continued active buyer interest from smas etfs and mutual funds through at least the early months of 2022 lipton said all in all we believe that performance for the first month of 2022 begins from a good place lipton wrote noting that new issue product ramped up in december providing buyers with cash on hand the opportunity to choose among a generous suite of offerings in terms of satisfying credit structure and diversification needs other aspects of the supply forecast should lead to some upticks in volume in 2022 according to lipton we would also posture that expectations for still historically attractive interest rates should provide fertile ground for the issuer community lipton said at the same time he expects that improving cash flows available stimulus funds and compelling long term rates should keep short term note issuance lower next year lipton made the case for solid performance in the coming year ahead similar to 2021 sustained favorable technicals throughout 2022 should be accretive to performance and munis can be expected to outperform treasuries with net negative supply potentially extending this outperformance and given what we expect to be a march to higher rates as a tighter monetary policy takes hold lipton said he anticipates 2022 performance for the municipal bond index to be comparable to or modestly lower than 2021 aggregate performance parsing the performance data for november municipals earned 85 basis points to slightly outperform treasuries by eight basis points and continue to earn better returns year to date even compared with other fixed income asset classes such as corporate bonds lipton wrote year to date through dec 7 municipals are outperforming treasuries 1 44 versus a loss of 2 15 respectively lipton said high yield muni performance should be positive in 2022 however he predicts that it will be lower year over year as investment grade spreads display some widening movement relative value ratios are demonstrating a richer bias so far for december with the 30 year benchmark right where it was about a year ago lipton said noting that current ratios are close to their historical tightness of 40 years ago going forward lipton said the taxable muni presence in 2022 should elevate its appeal to existing tax efficient investments such as retirement accounts seeking alternative investment proxies as well as to foreign buyers desiring to add diversification and above average credit quality to their portfolios this will likely occur against a backdrop of zero to negative yielding global sovereign debt continuing to form a redefined muni buyer base he said having said this we believe that taxable issuance has the potential to fall below the 20 threshold with a noted drop in taxable advance refundings as treasury yields are likely to trend higher and the universe of outstanding tax exempt advance refundable candidates continues to narrow lipton added that pension obligation bonds are one area to watch for continued taxable growth in 2022 aaa scales refinitiv mmd s scale was unchanged save for a one basis

updated dec 10 1 pm a toxicologist who downplayed the health effects of synthetic turf fields in testimony before the martha s vineyard commission is under renewed scrutiny about her credentials to make such claims particularly when it comes to per and poly fluoralykyl substances more commonly referred to as pfas laura green ph d an environmental consultant and president of green toxicology llc has been disavowed by the federal environmental protection agency epa on her résumé submitted to the martha s vineyard commission mvc public records on the project green s top professional experience states she is a special government employee for the epa concerns raised by the epa were first reported by greenwire environmental energy news green called the questions about her epa credentials a nonstory she said in her comments before the mvc she was talking about a different type of pfas which has not been identified by the epa as having adverse health effects when asked to verify epa positions showcased in the greenwire article the epa replied with a stock answer epa considers harmful pfas to be an urgent public health threat facing communities across the united states under administrator regan leadership epa has set forth a pfas strategic roadmap that outlines a comprehensive approach to addressing pfas and sets timelines by which epa plans to take specific actions and set bold policies to safeguard public health protect the environment and hold polluters accountable when pressed for answers on green the epa provided a follow up statement the agency does not support or agree with any of the statements attributed to ms green that you cited in your question dr green was not conducting work for the office of chemical safety and pollution prevention ocspp federal advisory committees faca when the referenced statements on pfas were made has not conducted work for any of ocspp s faca committees since 2020 and has not ever conducted work for ocspp faca committees that relates to pfas in a phone conversation with the times green said she was a special government employee hired in 2016 to do peer review work she said there was nothing misleading about stating that on her résumé or putting it as the lead item it s the most recent appointment that s the way résumés are done it s just in reverse chronological order i was appointed in 2016 and that s the most recent appointment she said it s just a standard format nothing more than that green called the story written by greenwire environmental energy news a libelous piece of propaganda though she doesn t intend to sue the publication the story has renewed the raging debate on the vineyard about whether green was a hired gun for the synthetic turf industry or a knowledgeable scientist on the health risks associated with the popular playing fields which narrowly won approval 10 6 before the mvc and have been referred for a special permit from the oak bluffs planning board pfas is a class of compounds that contains around 6 000 or more individual compounds currently with existing laboratory methods only around 40 of those pfas can be identified in massachusetts six pfas compounds are listed as being the highest points of concern according to state data green an environmental consultant and president of green toxicology llc dismissed the potential risks pfas pose to human health repeatedly throughout the mvc public hearing and deliberation she s also been known to reach out to people who raise concerns at public meetings and dismiss the potential health effects of pfas in an email to emma green beach director of the martha s vineyard shellfish group for example green indicated it wasn t pfas that was responsible for tumorous dead cows in west virginia and instead blamed it on molybdenum based catalysts used in the manufacturing of teflon products green beach now an oak bluffs select board member declined to comment on green except to say the emails from her were unsolicited green defended her work as a consultant on the mvrhs project the pfas of interest meaning the pfas that s used to extrude plastic grass blades for that matter plastics of all kind that you have in your house if you have a plastic toothbrush the pfas of interest is not pfoa pfos any of the regulated pfas any of the volatile pfas it s the same thing i tried to explain that s implanted in people if they have surgical meshes or that s used to sew up wounds this is a nonissue there is no contradiction whatsoever as the conversation continued green got more agitated and complained that the reporter did not write her an email to request an appointment i have no interest whatsoever in talking to you or anyone else about an article that was masquerading as journalism that instead was an attempt to do a hatchet job put yourself in my shoes why would i want to talk about that put yourself in my shoes and imagine that i called you cold i didn t even have the decency to write and ask for an appointment after calling the piece libelous she reiterated she would not sue look i m a 67 year old grandmother if you don t think i haven t heard every piece of crap that any child or grandchild can throw at me then you haven t been around the block at 67 years old i have been consulting since the 1970s on controversial projects that span the continent of the united states if you think i ve ever sued anyone about anything then you don t know me she then abruptly ended the interview suggesting that the times request an appointment in writing in light of the greenwire revelations the times asked mvc chair joan malkin what the mechanisms were for potentially reconsidering a past vote malkin said she believed the mechanisms in place for reconsideration were narrow and not intended to cover decisions made months ago malkin said by mandate and jurisdiction the oak bluffs board of health and planning board might be better equipped to explore new information mvc executive director adam turner declined comment and martha s vineyard public schools superintendent matt d andrea could not be reached for comment when asked about the school s involvement with green school committee chair and liaison for the project amy houghton said mvrhs didn t find green initially didn t contract with her and never paid her for any services there has never been a school committee meeting that has discussed laura green i saw her on a zoom that s my involvement with laura green houghton said when asked if the school regretted having green as part of the process houghton said she doesn t know enough about her to comment but the school committee followed the direction of the commission in approving taxpayer funds to contract with tetra tech and horsley witten she said the focus on pfas in synthetic turf is misdirected when there are other known problems with heavy metals in surface soil and pfas is ubiquitous on the island i think we have a lot of conjecture and this might happen and this could happen but we all know about the levels of lead around the vineyard and the known impact of lead on the developing brain houghton said when pressed on whether she thought green had a significant impact on the result of the mvc deliberation and swayed public opinion on the synthetic turf field houghton said there were many who took up airtime during the public hearing process many of whom if we scrutinized we would find something that doesn t stack up people commenting on fields that have no background in fields the landscape is changing because of people s personal agendas if the process is followed the right way then the third party investigators are going to determine what to do changing the rules because you didn t get your way seems a little questionable in my mind she said but terry donahue of mv play the organization originally responsible for bringing green into the project defended green s hiring and called it just another attack on green why are you so interested in who hired her donahue asked the times calling unsolicited after the interview ended with green it s nobody s f______ business donahue went on to blame the field fund a nonprofit that has advocated for grass playing fields for the greenwire story and the ongoing attacks against green s credibility to slander dr green is beyond offensive he said donahue said green used science while the opponents used scare tactics in an attempt to sway the mvc she s wiping the floor with them she uses facts and they don t have any he said it s like donald trump if you rant about lies long enough people believe them emily bramhall executive director of the martha s vineyard community foundation said the foundation acted as a fiscal sponsor for vineyard athletics in one instance 10 738 was paid to green toxicology llc on feb 10 2021 it s unclear how much additional money was paid to green donahue confirmed the arrangement he said the community foundation paid green and he along with other supporters of the project he would not name paid the money back bramhall wrote in an email that no foundation money was ever given to green in a conversation with the times bramhall explained that the foundation has taken no position on the field project the community fund feeling about the fields is that we want student athletes to have playing fields where they won t break their ankles or get injured she said our position is we want fields that are up to standards whether those are grass fields or synthetic turf is up to the martha s vineyard commission and the oak bluffs planning board she said we don t have a position bramhall said we re agnostic we want the kids to have good playing fields with green s credentials being called into question bramhall said she didn t know enough about it to take a position on whether to regret acting as a fiscal sponsor we are not taking a position on the experts that either of the two organizations chose we re a step away from it she said i m in no shape and have no expertise at all we re relying on those who do have the expertise we were a fiscal sponsor we provided the same service to both of these groups in a follow up email bramhall pointed out that the fiscal sponsorship relationships with both the field fund and vineyard community sports complex were temporary and have ended we no longer have anything to do with either organization she wrote donahue confirmed that he ended the arrangement three weeks ago because of attacks on bramhall and members of the board the reason i closed that account was the amount of hate that group was getting because of this crazy war that s been going on donahue said the vineyard nonprofit field fund a sharp critic of the artificial field project issued a statement about green and the published report this reporting confirms the concerns that the field fund had about dr green s scientific integrity that prompted us to write a letter to the editor this past january it is particularly troubling that the superintendent assistant superintendent and martha s vineyard regional high school leadership chose to work closely with dr green as she downplayed the risks of pfas and plastic pollution associated with their proposed plastic field to our island community and permitting boards all with their students watching and that they still refuse to say who is funding her the field fund which is led by up island residents mollie doyle dardanella slavin and rebekah thomson has advocated for a grass field chirs huntress the designer of the high school s track and field project had no comment on the greenwire article huntress told the times he hasn t read it commissioner ben robinson was one of the voices during the mvc public hearing process to bring up concerns that green has provided misleading and contradictory testimony in other circumstances during an april 2 public hearing of the mvc robinson identified a report relating to crumb rubber used for a synthetic turf field in the town of hamden conn green acted as a consultant for the report and concluded that the evidence on crumb rubber and rubber mulch does not suggest let alone demonstrate that rubber mulch poses significant risk to the health of children or others green uses the same language to minimize the risk of rubber mulch in a consumer product safety commission report comment she made in 2015 which was referenced by other school districts in their planning processes green states in the report that she was asked by rubberecycle a leading rubber mulch manufacturer to provide comment the memorandum can be found on the synthetic turf council website at the mvc hearing green said we understand that using recycled car and truck tires isn t a good idea those are what turn into microplastic and things like that that is not an issue with this field green said robinson told the times he believes approving the use of synthetic turf for the athletic complex project has set the island back in terms of thinking deeply and seriously about environmental dangers i think this is one of the worst decisions the mvc ever made robinson said although some elements of green s testimony were accurate he said such as the fact that pfas are present in many everyday items like cooking utensils makeup and clothing and are also commonly found in surface soil samples these general statements potentially obfuscated the deleterious effects of the chemicals for commissioners the island public and other communities that are looking at these issues this is why she has a sort of sheen of credibility when she talks about lead being worse than pfas and other things she paints this picture of it not being a really big deal but what she missed in that story is that it s all really bad robinson said and when you have the option of plastic turf over real grass you can choose the option that doesn t do those things for things like food packaging and clothing coming in contact with pfas may be inevitable robinson said but that doesn t mean it shouldn t be avoided when possible that s why the decision was so troubling to me we had the opportunity to do the right thing he said we sort of revived career as being a shill for this synthetic turf industry with this new information on green robinson said he wonders why she was involved with the school who initially contacted her and decided to retain her and who is paying her we still really don t know any of this why would our school system be using that type of person to further their aims he asked school officials at the time said that green s consulting work was paid for by a community funder and she was retained by vineyard community sports complex inc not the school district but robinson said he still has questions about how the money was acquired and spent and about the martha s vineyard community foundation acting as a fiscal sponsor for vineyard athletics i think the school really needs to be challenged on their decisionmaking robinson said speaking to a comment by assistant superintendent richie smith at a feb 20 mvc hearing stating that the school at that time had no donors to back the installation of the field robinson added if the school didn t have any donors where did they get the money to pay for dr green robinson stressed that huntress president of huntress associates inc the designer chosen by the high school for the field project is at the leading end of the synthetic turf industry and is a member of the synthetic turf council at their year end prospectus that group goes through how much they need to increase their industry and how many fields they are going to try and produce each year he is not just an independent landscape architect he is a member of this council he is pushing this product just as dr green is pushing these products robinson said huntress said his company has membership to some organizations in order to procure continuing education credits but he denied he is a member of any sort of pro artificial turf organization and said he was disappointed robinson didn t reach out to him before making assertions about his credentials it s disappointing that he would make statements like that without actually doing his homework huntress said updated to correct the name of the organization that paid for green s services ed

resort along the upper hoback river road the opposition to the zoning change consisted of republicans democrats vaxxers anti vaxxers environmentalists ranchers conservatives and liberals in other words they represented a broad constituency united in their fight to hold the planning and zoning board and the county commissioners accountable to the sublette county comprehensive plan and the zoning and development regulations these citizens were concerned about the many negative externalities of the development the lack of a good business plan for the development its potential to be a revenue drain on sublette county and the deficient studies on traffic water access to labor and affordable housing provided with the application and they were concerned with the way the zoning change would begin to alter what is one of the most remarkable rural communities left in the united states and the wildlife that is supported therein that development would move bondurant away from its historic and customary land use and the community that surrounds it it clearly did not have the welfare of the sublette county residents in mind as these residents are positioned to shoulder the negative externalities from the development with few if any benefits advertisement story continues below joe ricketts attended the meeting in order to give the imprimatur of legitimacy he claimed the development is necessary in order to maintain the financial viability of the ranch for his grandchildren it is purportedly needed to supplement the income to run the ranch how a bad business plan on the part of a billionaire will do that is unclear it would seem that a diversified stock fund with the money mr ricketts would spend on the project would surely secure the financial viability of that ranch in perpetuity for his grandchildren and with a much greater contribution to his purported dedication to conservation the sublette county taxpayers will underwrite this project did the commissioners analyze for sublette county the income and expenses associated with this project if they did why weren t these data provided at the meeting to assure the public and if they didn t do this analysis it seems negligent mr ricketts also claimed he wanted the development to provide an educational experience for people who desire to understand rural ranching life in wyoming i guess the assumption is that city dwellers from far and wide will spend thousands of dollars to ride a wagon around the buffalo ranch have an hour lecture on percheron horses maybe have a barbeque or two and do some fishing on the stretches of the hoback river that run through the ricketts ranch and are inaccessible to the public all of the experiences mr ricketts wants his guests to have are available under current zoning laws if his property is utilized as a dude ranch we don t have the final tally of the letters in favor of the zoning change and those opposed but we would like to get that tally for the public record it is safe to say there was unanimous opposition to the zoning change based on the letters sent to the planning and zoning board and the voices heard at the sublette county commissioners meeting it is important that the residents of sublette county understand a few salient facts about what happened at that meeting and in the time leading up to it it should inform them about how important it is to vote for commissioners that actually think they owe something to their constituents the facts and the recommendation of the planning and zoning board rather than allegiance to the feudal lord of the upper hoback river the many residents that had a stake in the decision needed to be able to access the meeting virtually because of the timing of the application some were no longer in bondurant and because some residents were cautious about being exposed to covid the planning and zoning board arranged for this to happen that board voted against the zoning change but the process of setting up a virtual link to the commissioners meeting seemed optional to at least one of the commissioners joel bousman told us that it was not possible to arrange to access the meeting virtually because their it person had passed away thus in the time of covid and in the case of a decision that was strategically applied for when many residents were not there we were told it would not be possible to gain remote access to one of the most important meetings of the sublette county commissioners in decades what joel bousman should have said was this it is a requirement for public participation to have citizens access that meeting virtually and i will see that it happens had it not been for the work of dave stephens and most importantly doug vickrey two of the commissioners who clearly understood the necessity of public participation the residents of bondurant and sublette county would have been faced with hiring their own it person to access the meeting or not gaining access to the meeting at all in the end we came to understand why some of the commissioners didn t really want the residents to have access to the meeting that would have meant there would be more accountability accountability they wanted to avoid joe ricketts didn t show up to sway the commissioners he showed up to lend an element of legitimacy to the vote of the three commissioners who were clearly preparing to violate the public trust in order to do his bidding in the end it actually didn t matter whether the residents were there or not it was clear to the people at the meeting that the die was cast before the meeting ever began three commissioners sam white joel bousman and tom noble voted in favor of the zoning change and offered little to nothing by way of explaining how they could cast such a vote in the face of the many sound arguments the sound reasoning the unanimous opposition to the zoning change the recommendation by the planning and zoning board not to approve the zoning change and in violation of essential aspects of the sublette county comprehensive plan and the zoning and development regulations honestly those of us at the meeting felt we could have been political prisoners in russia being tried for opposition to putin s political agenda in that case the facts wouldn t matter in this case it didn t matter what the citizens said it didn t matter the sound and reasoned arguments it didn t matter the unanimous opposition nor the violation of important components of the institutional structure of decision making none of it mattered we want commissioners who voted for this zoning change to explain according to chapter 8 section 2 subsection d of the regulations why they voted the way they voted we want them to publicly defend their decision in published form in light of the opposition to it and the fact that they did not take the recommendation of the planning and zoning board and the fact that the rezoning violates many of the stated purposes of the zoning and development regulations in short we want the commissioners who voted in favor of granting this zoning change to be held accountable for this egregious violation of the public trust and the framework that is supposed to guide such decisions the hoback basin coalition
the retired investor holiday spending expected to stay strong despite the recent scare caused by omicron the new novel coronavirus mutation retailers are hoping consumers will continue spending in december 2021 i like that bet the national retail federation nrf is expecting a record holiday season totaling a take of between 843 billion and 859 billion in revenues throughout november 2021 and december 2021 that would be a record year for retailers such as target walmart and amazon time is running out however given that we have less than three weeks to go until christmas day remember too that the shopper began picking up gifts earlier than normal this year due to fears of continued supply chain shortages many consumers fearing that popular gifts may be out of stock or subject to shipping delays were shopping for gifts as early as september 2021 the most recent data indicates that the total number of shoppers as well as average spending fell during the extended thanksgiving weekend compared with sales results during the last two years during the five day thanksgiving weekend almost 180 million shoppers descended on the nation s retailers but that is six million less than in 2020 and 10 million less than in 2019 the average spend per customer came to 301 27 compared to 311 75 last year and 361 90 in 2019 cyber monday saw a 1 4 percent decline versus last year the nrf indicated that the price point of shopping carts rose by almost 14 percent on cyber monday 19 percent for the holiday season in general as consumers bought more higher priced big ticket items however some of those gains were the result of a higher rate of inflation sky rocketing prices due to inflation may have deterred some shoppers price pressures have also been partially responsible for reducing the number and amounts of discounted items offered by retailers this shopping season between now and the end of the year the average discount on many items will fade to no more than 5 10 percent according to some experts the disappointing numbers between black friday to cyber monday could also be the result of poor timing most shoppers woke up to the news that south african medical experts announced a new and possibly more virulent coronavirus mutation on black friday morning i know my own family s mood was impacted by the news and any shopping intentions were immediately curtailed for the rest of the weekend since then the stock markets had plunged fearing the worst but then rebounded recent data seems to support that this new strain omicron is no worse than the present delta mutation and that existing vaccines should be effective against omicron this should bolster the consumer s confidence that the u s economy will continue to grow jobs will remain plentiful and spending for the holiday season can continue unabated retailers will tell you that we are in the december lull it refers to the few weeks between cyber monday and leading up to christmas eve when consumers sit on their hands feeling somewhat shopped out that does not mean the consumer is finished shopping they are just waiting for their second wind i am guessing that about 50 percent of holiday shopping is in the bag but that still leaves half of america s gifts to buy for me i ll put my faith in the consumer who wants to celebrate a better world by spending thanks to the safety provided by vaccinations
joe biden needed an agreement with vladimir putin that would help reduce tensions in europe over ukraine and nato expansion so he manufactured a crisis as an excuse for putting a us position on the table the news coming out of ukraine was dire russia had mobilized between 95 125 000 troops along its border with ukraine and us intelligence agencies were predicting that an invasion was imminent nato was panicking and vladimir putin was insisting that ukraine must never be allowed to join the transatlantic alliance biden to clear the air with putin agreed to a video conference with the russian president where he looked him in the eye and warned of serious consequences including unprecedented economic sanctions and the threat of deploying additional us forces to europe should russia invade ukraine while much of the public reaction to the biden putin video conference has centered on the sanctions threat it is the threat to deploy military forces to europe which provides the greatest insight into the thinking of the biden administration when it comes to russia today first and foremost the us threat to reinforce nato s eastern flank is empty and everyone knows it the us army is already stretched to the breaking point by maintaining the existing rotation of a single heavy armored brigade some 5 000 troops in europe by 2022 the us is scheduled to complete the construction of an army prepositioned stock aps facility in poland designed to store a brigade s worth of equipment about 85 battle tanks 190 armored combat vehicles 35 artillery and four armored vehicle launched bridges along with hundreds of supporting equipment sets and pieces that will reduce the deployment time for the assigned brigade from the us to poland from the 45 to 60 days associated with shipping the equipment into a european port to the four to seven days needed to fly in the troops and issue the equipment for operational employment but even with 10 000 troops backed by 170 tanks 380 armored combat vehicles and 70 artillery pieces the us army would be in no shape to take on a potential russian opponent back in the 1980s the us military understood the true nature of soviet military capabilities we studied their doctrine at the national training center ntc in fort irwin california the us army created an opposition force opfor organized and equipped to replicate two soviet motorized rifle regiments opfor soldiers a 1986 article about training at the ntc noted are thoroughly trained in soviet battle tactics for the purpose of fighting stateside combat elements as though it were an actual war adding that the opfor soldiers dress in soviet uniforms and use replicas of russian armored vehicles to make their kills every move and action of the opfor adheres to soviet principles of armored warfare we had an average of 311 870 troops stationed in europe per year between 1986 and 1990 we had another 250 000 prepared to deploy to europe within 10 days the singular focus of all these men and women was to defeat the soviet army in combat we had a robust military attache program in place at our moscow embassy that aggressively collected and reported on soviet military capabilities attached to the soviet group of forces germany were 14 us military officers assigned to the us military liaison mission whose sole job was to monitor the soviet military presence in east germany the defense intelligence agency published an annual report soviet military power which was required reading for all us military personnel the cia maintained the office of soviet analysis sova where the best and the brightest resided publishing intelligence based assessments of soviet military capabilities they were backed up by the directorate for operations soviet east european division which oversaw the cia s moscow station where the most elite case officers were sent to ply their trade in short we knew and understood soviet military capabilities and the threat they posed today when it comes to the russian federation the united states is flying blind at the ntc the soviet opfor has been replaced with a scaled down version whose job is to replicate insurgencies and near peer opponents i e nothing at all what the us military would be facing if it were to be called upon to confront russian troops in a european ground war russian military doctrine no longer serves as the foundation of our own counter doctrine russia may very well be training to fight us and nato forces but we no longer anchor our doctrinal philosophy on the singular principle of closing with a destroying the russian threat for the past 20 years military careers have been defined by the global war on terror and more importantly waging low intensity conflict in afghanistan and iraq every aspect of the military establishment from recruiting training clothing equipping organizing deploying and fighting was re worked to deal with this new mode of fighting combined arms warfare the art of war centered on creating lethal synergism between infantry armor artillery airpower and intelligence was no longer practiced and the muscle memory that had accrued from over three decades of training atrophied our intelligence services support that which has been given priority and since the end of the cold war russia has not been a priority once a reservoir of unmatched talent the departments and offices that once monitored soviet military power have all been disbanded replaced by eurasian analysts who treat russia as but one part of a larger intelligence puzzle sova has been dissolved taking decades of institutional knowledge about all things russia along with it our military is no longer trained equipped or doctrinally prepared to fight a russian foe in a non nuclear matchup the result is all too predictable the military of course is aware of this and is gradually working toward rebuilding this lost capability but this will take time and resources not simply happen overnight joe biden knows this as well which is why he has taken pains in the aftermath of his video conference with putin to emphasize that the us obligation to defend its nato allies does not extend to ukraine the idea that the us is going to unilaterally use force to confront russia invading ukraine is not on the cards right now biden told the press after his conversation with putin this of course begs the question as to what biden hoped to accomplish by threatening to deploy more american forces to poland and the baltics in the first place especially if the us is not planning on any military confrontation with russia in the case of a russian invasion of ukraine the answer lies in biden s political need to shape perception both at home and abroad the expectations on the part of his democrat allies is that he would be tougher on russia than former president trump this public pronouncement has boxed him in considerably especially when common sense policy options must be put to the side in favor of posturing biden was caught off guard last april when russia mobilized 100 000 troops along its border with ukraine especially when his military leadership informed him that there was little the us could do about it the key problem facing the biden national security team on the need to engage russia was the fact that any engagement which considered russian concerns would be seen as a concession biden needed to be seen as operating from a position of strength as such when russia conducted its fall military maneuvers the us purposefully exaggerated what was little more than internal troop movements in response to similar nato exercises in poland and the baltics and ukrainian muscle flexing along the donbass front turning it into an imminent threat that triggered the current crisis biden s threat to deploy additional us forces now makes sense first and foremost he s not going to do it second russia is not preparing to invade ukraine and biden knows it the current crisis is being driven by ukraine s ongoing refusal to implement the minsk accords when it comes to recognizing the autonomy of the donbass region and its continued military posturing as a mechanism of gaining nato support for its ambition to reconquer the donbass and crimea russia has been insisting that the us put pressure on ukraine s president volodymyr zelensky to adhere to the minsk agreement and that the us provide assurances that nato would stop its eastward expansion any move by the us void of an additional predicate would be seen by both the american domestic audience and america s nato allies as a sign of weakness however by building up a non existent threat i e a russian invasion of ukraine and then threatening to dispatch non existent troops to eastern europe if russia were to invade biden can now take credit for being strong in the face of russian aggression moreover when russia doesn t invade and it won t unless responding to any large scale military provocation by ukraine biden can take credit for making putin back down in this context jake sullivan s announcement that the biden administration is open to broad talks with russia about the future of european security coupled with biden s announcement that the us would not come to the aid of ukraine in the event of a russian invasion and a similar announcement by biden that the us would not support ukrainian membership in nato for at least 10 years can be spun as responsible actions taken from a position of strength instead of the logical response to realpolitik rt com

gabrielle coco chanel friend of artist jean cocteau and lover of musician igor stravinsky transformed women s fashion across the world pablo picasso said of her chanel is the woman with the most sense in europe chanel s fashion vision transformed both women s appearances and definitions of luxury for the 20th century how did she pull this off what is the continuing attraction and how do we recognise her complex background difficult choices and ongoing legacy with the opening of a new show gabrielle chanel fashion manifesto at the national gallery of victoria curated by paris fashion museum the galliera supplemented with works drawn from the ngv s collection chanel s life and work are in the spotlight once more who was coco chanel coco chanel was born in 1883 in saumur france the illegitimate daughter of a street vendor who struggled to raise her she lived for a time with nuns whose white linen and fine sewing influenced her later approach to good dressing chanel began her life as a singer in cabarets where she sang a tune that gave her the nickname coco she took up a series of lovers not unusual for struggling women in that time which gave her the capital to become a milliner an occupation requiring modest investment and little space to set up in a foretaste of her later work with serial repetition chanel used basic templates such as the boater or wide brimmed straw hats which she dressed very simply her work struck a modern note and was popularised by actresses making the modern woman chanel opened boutiques at deauville and biarritz fashionable seaside resorts where she observed and wore beach garments made of the wool jersey that she later made her own signature she took up with wealthy english men who introduced her to hunting dress and the scottish tweeds that she also transformed into day wear for women we associate chanel with the little black dress of the 1920s which could be made of wool jersey for day or silk and tulle for evening a short tubular garment it took the world by storm vogue called it the ford signed chanel in 1926 referring to the mass produced and affordable car that also came in only one colour the emphasis on the little black dress has distorted chanel s output which always extended to vibrant but tonal colours and other materials such as lace and satin for evening the little black dress also came from somewhere the first world war brought with it the death of millions of young men the disruption of succession in the great landed english estates and the destruction of huge swathes of europe cultural pessimism was common out went the lavish historical styles associated with the robber barons and the belle epoque france had the greatest casualties of wwi nearly 2 million were dead chanel witnessed the collective mourning of thousands of french women dressed in black she also saw the large numbers of women working in male occupations who suddenly wore uniforms with trousers external pockets overalls and boiler suits the 1920s was a time of living for the moment and experience culture sex sport travel and fast changing fashion 1920s french women s fashion was marked by a new engagement with the street and the notion of repetition the italian futurists proposed cancelling fashion altogether chanel was ready for this change even if her approach was more subtle in the 20th century the innovative silhouette and cut of clothes became the most important ambition for designers who wished to present new dress fashions cubist painters such as picasso and braque fractured the body their geometries were also adopted in clothing chanel both learned from and inspired the paris modernist avant gardes the poet colette remarked chanel s approach was modernist in that she was interested in the idea of a template for day wear in the late 1920s she made suits with unlined jackets revealing the selvedge reinforced edge of the piece of fabric and overstitching on the seaming her monochrome palette which often used black blue red beige and white was the opposite of the oriental sensuality of fashion design before the great war her wide belts referred to both men s wear and working wear as did her famous striped matelots from military dress she used the concept of the jacket s lining extending to the revers or lapel facings chanel once noted one wears clothes with the shoulders a dress should hang from the shoulders like her older contemporary madeleine vionnet she created dresses that seemed diaphanous and sculptural simultaneously her use of pin tucks created dresses that clung so closely to the body they appeared almost nude her 1920s dresses appear deceptively simple but include skirts pieced together with up to 20 panels although she usually cut on the straight grain chanel made clever use of fabrics with tensile qualities such as lace tulle jersey chiffon georgette crepe de chine and loosely woven tweeds blurring the distinction between the flou dress making and the tailleur tailoring by applying techniques from each process to the other chanel did not depart from the lines of the body the focus on the chanel suit has deflected attention from her evening wear of the 1930s which is notable for its hyper feminine effects using lace and sequins and suggestions of the bustle skirts of the 1870s chanel was interested in a playful and conceptual design approach in which real gems might be intermingled with fakes and a practical pocket book bag first introduced in 1927 could hold everything a woman required for the day there was no need to flaunt money in materials and craft but luxury could be expressed in subtle ways that only other women might recognise yet this was no democratic move in any sense of the word chanel s modern luxury was for those in the know and it continued to cost a great deal read more chanel s new fragrance reminds us of the rebel entrepreneur who started it all chanel s innovative luxury chanel was probably the person who contributed most to redefining luxury in the first half of the twentieth century we associate chanel with the term chic although this was not her invention theophile gautier the french journalist and literary critic used the term in 1864 calling it a dreadful and bizarre word of modern fabrication with chanel chic came to mean an approach to style that was not simply dependent upon money although money often helps this explains her use of simple materials muted colours and rigid lines she claimed that she was not interested in diamonds and pearls many of hers were in fact fine fakes crafted by the jeweller verdura chanel s concept of luxury had as its opposite vulgarity she was revolted by the approach to luxury connected with the vibrant ballets russes of the early 1910s and the associated fashions perfumes and household products retailed most notably by the fashion designer paul poiret in the case of chanel clothes can been seen as dynamic forces that helped produce the modern woman not the other way around that is to say the women becoming modern and demanding fresh clothes coco chanel was among those at this time who argued that luxury was not necessarily physically embodied in artefacts diamonds could therefore be replaced by imitation paste silk or velvet by a wool jersey chanel was partisan in a titanic struggle between the protectors of elite forms of luxury today referred to as metaluxury or über luxury and the growing middle class comforts and commodities of the time chanel number 5 although known as a couturière chanel made her fortune from the sale of chanel number 5 a very expensive perfume made with the rarest luxury ingredients from the south of france but with the novelty of adding synthetic ingredients the base was an imperial russian scent whose heaviness was alleviated by the new aldehydes which gave a sharp floral and ylang ylang kick it was first released in 1922 in its medicinal looking bottle stripped of all historical association chanel was not the sole author of these ideas regarding a luxurious simplicity clearly associated with wider aesthetic minimalism they appear also in the popular writings of decorator elsie de wolfe who wrote in 1913 that the woman who wears paste jewels is not so conspicuously wrong as the woman who plasters herself with too many real jewels at the wrong time read more smell like a woman not a rose chanel no 5 100 years on an iconic fragrance born from an orphanage luxury and the right wing chanel s redefinition of luxury was part of a wider french debate about twentieth century taste and manufactures one of her great loves was the french illustrator and entrepreneur paul iribe who designed the famous art deco rose motif iribe also ran a pro nationalist magazine called the witness le temoin between 1933 35 only red white and blue ink the colours of the french tri couleur was used in the printing iribe promoted the idea that france was the pre eminent centre of luxury and criticised modern german and american design and also jewish business iribe depicted chanel as marianne saviour of the french on one of the covers of the witness iribe was also behind an intriguing publication the defence of luxury 1932 a printed manifesto that attacked aesthetic modernism maintaining that france remained the centre of luxury despite the rise of other societies particularly north america and germany the defense also had anti semitic and anti cosmopolitan overtones suggesting an international conspiracy was attempting to drive away the old value system that had created france as the pinnacle of luxury taste and style aristocracy and a pure french race were required iribe argued in order for luxury manufacturing to continue chanel s designs nonetheless in their focus on craftsmanship taste and elite luxury they were extremely expensive were both a reaction to the state of affairs iribe posited and also a confirmation paris remained the centre of luxury chanel s own anti semitism not uncommon for high society elites of the time came to stand as a shadow over the subtlety of her designs later in life as did her relationship with high ranking nazis including her lover during the occupation of paris many claims some disputed have been made about chanel s level of collaboration with the nazis but she clearly benefited from her highly placed and opportunistic access to powerful people in france and england chanel worked against the wertheimer family who risked having their businesses aryanised sold to non jewish owners partly because she resented the great profits they made from her house due to their earlier stock control following the war enquiries were made into chanel s relationship with the nazis and with the possible support of winston churchill whose english aristocratic friend had been her lover she retreated to lausanne in switzerland chanel s comeback returning to work in 1954 chanel surprised everyone with the famous two piece chanel suit worn with a co ordinating blouse the irony of the template is that it could be modified with trims and details in order to maintain a sense of something fashionable and timeless out of fashion simultaneously the cost of these simple looking clothes is indicated in a 1965 order for marlene dietrich a white day suit cost us 6000 perhaps us 55 000 today the controlled and modernist chanel chromatic was a striking foil to much 1960s fashion particularly colourful and more revealing styles for women chanel herself once said that she would not be surprised if women might start showing their ass in the future the sight of belly buttons and midriffs was enough to horrify her in the 1960s and 1970s chanel would have been very puzzled by our contemporary bust ops and facework she once said i can think of nothing more ageing than trying to make oneself look younger chanel died in 1971 aged 87 let s conclude by giving her the last word in the grumpy attitude typical of many of her pronouncements of the 1960s author peter mcneil distinguished professor of design history uts university of technology sydney

the possibility of wind turbines off southeastern north carolina shoreline is coming into focus as federal and state interests signal strong support for advancing clean energy initiatives meanwhile local concerns over adverse visual impacts persist the bureau of ocean energy management boem released a draft environmental assessment wednesday providing an updated overview of anticipated impacts prompted by potentially leasing the wilmington east wind energy area roughly 128 000 acres offshore located about 17 miles from bald head island up to three companies could lease the region as outlined in boem s proposed sale notice issued nov 1 should a lease be awarded the patch of ocean could generate 1 5 gigawatts gw of offshore wind energy enough to power half a million homes according to boem estimates that would get north carolina more than halfway to its goal of 2 8gw of offshore wind energy by 2030 detailed in gov roy cooper s executive order 218 issued in june the governor s commitment to clean energy was further christened through his signing of house bill 951 in october which orders state utility regulators to come up with a plan to cut carbon emissions by 70 by 2030

in a first starbucks workers agree to union in buffalo ny starbucks coffee store photo goarorelooam wikipedia cc by sa 3 0 buffalo ny ap starbucks workers at a store in buffalo new york voted to unionize on thursday a first for the 50 year old coffee retailer in the u s and the latest sign that the labor movement is stirring after decades of decline the national labor relations board said thursday that workers voted 19 8 in favor of a union at one of three locations in buffalo a second store rejected the union in a vote of 12 8 the results of a third store could not be determined because of several challenged votes if the labor board certifies the results a process expected to take about a week it would be the first for any starbucks owned store in the u s to unionize starbucks has actively fought unionization at its stores for decades saying its stores function best when it works directly with employees the union votes come at a time of heightened labor unrest in the u s striking cereal workers at kellogg co rejected a new contract offer earlier this week thousands of workers were on strike at deere co earlier this fall and the u s labor board recently approved a redo of a union vote at an amazon warehouse in alabama after finding the company pressured workers to vote against the union labor shortages are giving workers a rare upper hand in wage negotiations and dan graff director of the higgins labor program at the university of notre dame said the pandemic gave many workers the time and space to rethink what they want from their jobs starbucks workers watching the vote count on thursday over zoom on a big screen at a union office in buffalo erupted into cheers and chants of elmwood elmwood elmwood when the results of that location were announced jumping up and down and hugging each other we still made history barista and union organizer casey moore told the others watching as it became clear the second store had voted down the union effort workers at all three stores began voting by mail last month on whether they wanted to be represented by workers united an affiliate of the service employees international union the nlrb began counting ballots thursday from union elections held at the stores around 111 starbucks workers were eligible to vote by mail starting last month yes votes could accelerate unionization efforts at other u s starbucks stores already three more stores in buffalo and a store in mesa arizona have filed petitions with the labor board for their own union elections those cases are pending kent wong the director of the ucla labor center says that it s a big deal for even one starbucks location to vote for a union calling it a symbolic victory for the labor movement wong noted that it could not only galvanize workers at other starbucks locations but also at fast food chains people are looking at what is happening in buffalo wong said union backers at the first three buffalo stores filed petitions with the labor board in august seeking representation by workers united an affiliate of the service employees international union those workers say starbucks stores had chronic problems like understaffing and faulty equipment even before the pandemic they want more input on pay and store operations we have no accountability right now we have no say said moore who has been working at a buffalo area starbucks for around six months with a union we will actually be able to sit down at the table and say this is what we want starbucks insists its 8 000 company owned u s stores function best when it works directly with its employees which it calls partners many employees in the buffalo area work at more than one store depending on demand starbucks says and it wants to have the flexibility to move them between stores starbucks asked the labor board to hold one vote with all 20 of its buffalo area stores but the board rejected that request saying store by store votes were appropriate under labor law in a letter to starbucks u s employees this week starbucks president and ceo kevin johnson reiterated the company s wish to include all buffalo area stores in the union vote while we recognize this creates some level of uncertainty we respect the process that is underway and independent of the outcome in these elections we will continue to stay true to our mission and values johnson wrote johnson also reminded employees of the company s generous benefits including paid parental and sick leave and free college tuition through arizona state university late last month the company also announced pay increases saying all its u s workers will earn at least 15 and up to 23 per hour by next summer but backers of the union say starbucks can do more if starbucks can find the money to pay their ceo nearly 15 million in compensation i think maybe they can afford to pay their workers a decent wage with decent benefits said u s sen bernie sanders a vermont independent in a recent twitter post sanders held a virtual town hall with buffalo starbucks workers earlier this week johnson earned 14 7 million in salary and stock awards in the company s 2020 fiscal year starbucks or the union can contest individual votes in the election which could delay the certification process by the labor board but if the votes do get certified starbucks is legally obligated to begin the process of collective bargaining with workers united and any of the three stores that vote to unionize said cathy creighton the director of cornell university s industrial and labor relations buffalo co lab in some cases companies have closed a location rather than deal with a union but that s difficult for a retailer like starbucks since it would be illegal to close one store and then open another nearby creighton said starbucks has shown a willingness to bargain outside the u s in victoria canada workers at a starbucks store voted to unionize in august 2020 it took starbucks and the united steelworkers union nearly a year to reach a collective bargaining agreement which was ratified by workers in july
one of my favorite food moments during this second year of covid came on a warm summer day in brooklyn i was relaxing on a bench on the coney island boardwalk watching a thunderstorm roll in as i ate crisp uzbek pastries filled with lamb and pumpkin it was a perfect 10 meal and the ambiance from the ocean waves to the russian seaside performers to the dark clouds rolling in was free make no mistake i love indoor dining a practice i resumed in april after receiving my second shot of the moderna vaccine the act of eating birria tacos at a good bar while reading the new yorker is an irreplaceable luxury a reality that s all the more true for someone like me who seeks the company of strangers after a long day of solitary work my dream is that we can continue to spend the winter hanging out inside the city s restaurants albeit with a mask on until that first glass of natural wine arrives that s not something we should take for granted recent history has taught us indoor dining is a privilege not an inalienable right and one that could go away at a moment s notice if covid 19 takes a turn for the worse again but regardless of how things shake out i hope the pandemic has reminded us that there s a lot more to eating out than in a reservation heavy space where a staffer takes your three course order and fetches you another glass of pinot noir every 18 minutes indeed when i look back at 2021 i think less about my time at fine dining institutions and more about the time i smeared kecap manis onto singaporean egg sandwiches as flowers bloomed around me in highbridge park this was i hope another year when restaurants helped us enjoy more of our city in its full glory rather than hide us from it the top three tacos at taqueria ramirez you wait in line tania apolinar takes your order you wait some more chef giovanni cervantes pulls a mess of tripe out of the bubbling choricera torches it then places it on a lard slicked corn tortilla he hands it to you and you eat it right there on the spot or maybe a few seconds later if you step outside the process is as intimate as at an omakase sushi parlor and the flavors the warming longaniza the slippery innards the crisp al pastor pork are no less precise these are some of the city s best tacos period 94 franklin street on oak street greenpoint pirashki at sofreh cafe new york is going through a mini bakery boom of sorts but persian pastries are still reasonably rare within the five boroughs enter ali saboor and nasim alikhani of sofreh fame who are serving some serious iranian pirashki in this modern bushwick space for a savory version saboor stuffs kale feta mushrooms and walnuts into a doughy bun balancing a tangle of bitter salty and umami rich notes against the sweetness of the roll for an equally lovely take on an iranian street snack the chef takes rounds of fried dough as yeasty as good zeppoles and fills them with a faintly sweet rose custard that dessert pirashki is easily one of the city s best new doughnuts 252 varet street near bogart street bushwick vegan mole at aldama the flavors of ash salt sugar fungi pepitas sugar and soil in aldama s mole negro appear on your palate like freeform trumpet notes in a miles davis ensemble sometimes seemingly out of nowhere the inky dish includes no clunky proteins to hide the nuances chef gerardo alcaraz instead gives us a minimalist 30 sauce along with a scattering of mushrooms and truffles on a gray ceramic plate a preparation that skirts the line between traditional and avant garde it is one of the city s great moles and unlike most of its counterparts this one happens to be vegan 91 south 6th street near berry street williamsburg dishes of the year the long list gurda kapoora at dhamaka chef chintan pandya and

of gurda kapoora a generous serving of chile laced goat testicles imagine the texture of unpeeled grapes and kidneys firmer and funkier you load the offcuts onto soft pao bread to make an organ sandwich a blend of meatiness and squishiness that will light up your insides like a glow stick 119 delancey st near norfolk street lower east side pastries at bánh by lauren the only upside to lauren

an egg mixture over the meat then places a toasted baguette over it all to soak up the creamy mixture when ready everything gets snatched up into the hero which is finished with a good measure of

parts sweet pork crunchy viennoiserie and funky fromage 26 28 jackson avenue near queens plaza south long island city lodi s flauto al cioccolato ignacio mattos and baker louis volle have given the city what might be its most innovative and unusual pain au chocolat in quite some time rather than present patrons with a typically flattish rectangular viennoiserie the lodi team has changed up the format by creating a long and lofty ribbed rod it s not so much a study in pillowy croissant like pastry as it is an expression of firm geometric exterior crunch and with an interior that boasts a hint of stretchiness and with three slabs of dark chocolate hiding inside its core mattos and volle have essentially created something that looks and tastes like a pastry candy bar 1 rockefeller plaza

by l c leach iii this might be the year to consider shopping early for christmas gifts that is for christmas 2022 whether it s automobiles clothing smart phones computers and other digital electronic devices or maybe just a favorite kind of food or toy product distributors across the u s are finding it tough to stock many items due to snagging supply chains at many u s ports supply chains have slowed and been disrupted by many factors including labor shortages packed warehouses that can t receive any more cargo ships tied up in harbors waiting to deliver cargo to the packed warehouses and constraints on worldwide shipping in an effort to contain the spread of covid related viruses and analysts and experts are expecting these kinds of disruptions to the supply chains to continue for at least another year i anticipate product shortages continuing through 2022 said brian mangum founder of brightflow technologies a services and security firm in mint hill n c it will take at least that long to build more factories in the supply chain as the demand for goods continues to increase one of the biggest product demands and shortages is computer chips tiny modules that store memory or provide logic circuitry for microprocessors the manufacturing process for these chips is typically greater than 26 weeks exactly half a calendar year but mangum added that because 75 percent of the world s chips come from china south korea and taiwan geopolitical tensions between these three countries and the u s have only made the supply chain issue worse for american consumers in march 2021 the chip shortage led to the temporary closing of the volvo cars plant in ridgeland s c the global car and electronics industries are impacted by the shortage of semiconductors and so are we said volvo spokeswoman stephanie mangini volvo has since resumed business with plans to expand operations but shortages have trickled down to many companies that supply the auto industry such as the reynolds company maker of adhesives and coatings with operations in greenville s c jerry broome the company s vice president of operations and purchasing said earlier this year the computer chip shortage affected reynolds normal supply cycle operations because its orders for the kind of glue needed for automobiles had stalled broome said a general shortage of raw materials and components across the board not just for adhesives affected a lot of industries reynolds for example sells to the bedding industry but when those companies can t get mattress springs it has a domino effect that reduces the number of orders to reynolds broome says it s not just a glue thing he says a lot of things are in short supply and in the automotive market which is a large adhesive user a computer chip shortage affected the vehicle supply and thus reynolds operations it s not that they can t get our adhesives broome says it s because they can t get the chips they can t get the chips so they can t make automobiles if they can t make automobiles they don t need any glue the reynolds company in greenville was founded in 1978 by hays reynolds jr he was a member of the class of 1944 at clemson college now clemson university after serving in the armed forces in europe hays returned to south carolina and began a career selling starch to textile mills throughout the southeast it was in the early 1960s when he launched an adhesive manufacturing company called tanco adhesives with over 150 employees and sales throughout the united states canada europe and asia its customer base is comprised of fortune 500 customers as well as smaller more regional customers the company produces hot melt water based adhesives and dry blend adhesives in a recent report cbre global leader in commercial real estate services and investment said disruptions to global supply chains have consumer goods and logistics companies scrambling to increase their inventories and expand their warehouse space creating opportunities for industrial and logistics property owners and investors strong demand for industrial space is forecast for markets near large population concentrations as well as seaports inland ports and major air hubs product sourcing will expand beyond long dominant countries like mainland china as distributors implement multi location strategies to mitigate risk and increase inventories in the face of continued supply chain disruptions industrial demand will shift to different ports of entry as countries of origin change in the u s shifts in product sourcing to south asia and europe will benefit east and gulf coast ports especially charleston savannah and houston in europe the greek port of piraeus and the spanish ports of algeciras barcelona and valencia are expected to attract more container volume alternative port choices in asia pacific include xiamen qingdao nansha and shekou in mainland china and tanjung pelepas in malaysia more nearshoring or reshoring of manufacturing particularly to northern mexico will help relieve supply disruptions affecting the u s market dr joseph von nessen research economist with the university of south carolina s darla moore school of business in columbia emphasized that the long continuing labor shortage across both south carolina and the u s also has been a chief contributor to both a lower supply of goods and accompanying inflation for many products such as automobiles the price of used cars for instance rose by 42 percent between july 2020 and july 2021 von nessen said to put this into perspective if the price of used cars had remained unchanged over the past year the current inflation rate of 5 4 percent would instead be just 3 5 percent so this increase in price has been a direct result of the shortage of new cars that emerged due to the shortage of semiconductors further due to a shortage of workers to make enough of them to meet consumer demand an august 2021 gallup poll reported that for the months of june and july 71 percent of americans had either been unable get a product they wanted because of shortages or experienced significant delays in receiving a product they ordered myrtle beach hyundai is one business that attempted to get ahead of this shortage by getting more cars but general manager robert wingate said that this action actually hurt the dealership for future allocation because we had so many cars on the ground we usually sell about 135 vehicles a month but that s been down 10 or 15 percent a month since the supply chains issue wingate said and at this point it s a mystery as to how we re going to meet demand beyond automotive other u s industries are also feeling the supply crunch including food suppliers toy companies and a wide range of manufacturers such as s c steel in greenville s c inbound raw materials from one of the mills in arkansas ran several weeks late in q1 and q2 of 2021 resulting in our having to shorten production hours in our facility said charles wall president s c steel we have also experienced paint shortages from a major paint brand they tell us that resin is in short supply regular grocery items are bare on many shelves for example if you are a regular shopper with local food retailers you might see odd shelf offerings such as cake icing but no cake mix brewing coffee but no instant coffee canned soup but no soup crackers and the suspension reinstatement and then re suspension of its bulk almonds even international businesses with their own production facilities aren t immune plus plus usa for instance is a denmark based company which manufactures toys in its own factory for shipping to north america its u s office is in greenville s c the company said it has been forced to raise toy prices because of the increase in cost for materials our raw material prices have almost doubled since last year said ryan hamilton head of operations for the company s greenville s c office our cost of shipping from europe to the u s has almost doubled as well and changes almost weekly and fedex a transportation company best known for its overnight delivery service recently announced that effective nov 1 2021 a fuel surcharge increase would be applied to fedex express domestic package and freight services fedex ground and fedex freight shipments the company also announced that effective jan 3 2022 fedex express fedex ground fedex ground economy and fedex freight rates will increase reasons include a tight labor market and ongoing shifts in volume which the company said have increased our total fuel consumption and the corresponding increase in the fuel surcharge will allow fedex to provide customers with the best service possible as we adjust to rising fuel costs and spikes in demand but while costs for fuel shipping and materials can be adjusted as necessary by business and industry the lack of workers remains one of the biggest wild cards for trying to predict when the supply chains might recover this past summer the federal reserve bank of richmond reported that while the manufacturing wage index hit a record high in august firms are struggling to find workers with the necessary skills and expect this trend to continue in the coming months the unprecedented import surge fueled by american consumer spending since last summer has put a strain on all aspects of the supply chain said phillip sanfield director of media relations with the port of los angeles calif we handle more than 10 million teus twenty foot equivalent units per year and ship to all parts of the u s but we expect the u s supply chain issues to last through 2022 the port of charleston s c is trying to address the supply chain problem for the east coast through investments in port infrastructure to increase storage capacity those investments include the charleston harbor deepening project which is on track to achieve a 52 foot depth in 2022 this would make charleston harbor the deepest on the east coast and capable of handling mega container ships at any time of year during any tide a three phase buildout of the leatherman terminal which will allow for the handling of 2 4 million teus of cargo nearly 3 5 times its current capacity a 28 million expansion to inland port greer s c a terminal which extends the port of charleston s reach 212 miles inland terminal manager will angelich said this expansion will help ease supply chain issues by allowing ipg to efficiently handle more imports and exports for customers moving goods through the port of charleston but even with increased cargo capacity at ports and terminals professor von nessen said the extra storage space is only going to be as useful as the presence or absence of enough workers to ship all the cargo and products that people are wanting going forward as we head further into the 2021 holiday season and the new year the emergence of the coronavirus delta variant makes the possibility of additional significant labor force growth for the next several months or longer more uncertain to make the holiday shopping season as smooth and stress free as possible for its large amount of customers walmart inc executive joe metzger recently announced that the super retailer plans to hire 20 000 permanent supply chain positions and more truck drivers to help move products through our facilities as quickly as possible we have hired more than 3 000 drivers this year with more in the pipeline said metzger executive vice president for walmart s supply chain operations we ve added storage capacity in our fulfillment and distribution network through new facilities and we re working aggressively to ensure we have associates available to help customers and fill online orders by hiring 150 000 associates across the country so we re prepared to serve customers whether they choose to shop in store or online to meet his own client demand in the short term future brian mangum said brightflow began doubling orders of new computers back in the spring and are currently holding the most inventory in the history of our business in order to plan for a shortfall we communicated with our clients this past spring to buy early for the desktops monitors servers and laptops that they would need for the rest of 2021 he said and as i have not yet seen any indication for a return to normalcy in the supply chains business owners and managers need to plan now for what new devices they will need for next year

hedge funds in november suffered their worse monthly decline since the start of the pandemic in march 2020 a global market selloff sparked by concerns over the omicron a global market selloff sparked by concerns over the omicron ccp chinese communist party virus variant led to the poor performance according to a dec 8 report from hedgefund research hedge funds lost 1 7 percent last month with equity hedge funds leading the declines as they were caught off guard by omicron with hfri s equity hedge index falling 2 7 percent macro funds were also battered by volatile bond markets with a 2 5 percent decline the worse since october 2018 according to preliminary figures from the bloomberg hedge fund indices the hfri fund weighted composite index which aggregates the performance of funds of all sizes fell 2 2 percent the index has not seen a decline of that magnitude since march 2020 when it saw a 9 1 percent drop the hfri index increased by 1 3 percent in october before slowly dipping in november financial markets plummeted in the last week of november with u s stocks losing nearly 4 percent in the last five trading days of the month after news of omicron hit headlines currency and bond market volatility also shook to the news november was an interesting month it marked a reversal of october trends said kenneth heinz hfr president at a dec 8 press conference in the final days of the month you saw a reversal of the post quarantine post pandemic and inflation positive trades that have the last few months he added that the losses were primarily attributable to a steep late month global equity market selloff driven by investor panic related to the spread of the omicron coronavirus variant in addition to this hedge fund performance was also impacted by evolving expectations for higher inflation and interest rates in the us sooner than had been expected by many investors heinz said on the day after thanksgiving and the final day of the month you ended up seeing sharp declines adding that the trends had already begun to correct themselves in early december people became very concerned with the spread of the variant and there was a messy panic across a number of asset classes that undid a lot of trades heinz said a lot of those trends have already corrected themselves in the early part of december from a financial market perspective we had one more decline based on the variant but you ve generally seen a strong start to december reversing a lot of those trends heinz believes that the initial panic caused by the emergence of the new variant was merely a setback and expects a strong end to the year bloomberg reported that hedge funds were still up by 8 7 percent this year through november despite the selloff
starbucks workers in buffalo vote to unionize first us store owned by the coffee chain to do so share copy link copy welcome back to cheddar is news trap one of our top stories of the day is that all important quit rates september officially breaking august s record for the most americans to quit their job in a month nearly a million workers quit and leisure and hospitality alone worker unrest is more widespread than ever and buffalo new york for example ballots have been sent to workers at three different starbucks locations to decide whether they will unionize for the first time ever this while kellogg s files a lawsuit against its striking serial workers the rise of the worker it s upon us joining us with more is virginia diamond who is helping with starbucks campaign and is the president of northern virginia a f l c i o virginia welcome to the show such a pleasure to talk to you so let s dive in what protections and rights are these employees organizing for looking for well the workers at starbucks in buffalo are simply asking for the right to engage in collective bargaining to have a voice on the job a seat at the table as equals with management uh and so they have joined together and they have petitioned an election to have a union and unfortunately um the this billion dollar company has swooped in and is doing everything it possibly can to prevent these workers from from having a union but i believe that they will continue to hold strong and uh they will exercise their fundamental right so starbucks has said from the very beginning their employees have rare benefits like stock in the company what else is the company s argument in opposition of this well uh the company like many major corporations want to have all the control you know over recent decades uh as union density has declined uh billionaires and corporate executives have uh attained all of the wealth that has been created and the middle class has been hollowed hollowed out so working class living standards have been declining so their argument is that they like it the way it is and they want to stay in charge of make all the decisions that affect the workers pay benefits and it s up to them and the workers are saying we believe that the working class and workers should also have powers to have a voice and i believe that what they re doing is really essential to preserve democracy virginia we spoke to a member of the starbucks workers union yesterday and here s what she had to say about the efforts the company has taken to convince employees to vote no i m going to play a part of that and i ll talk to you on the other side about it it s an all consuming effort from them i mean they ve been they ve been present in our stores at the corporate levels since about two days after we filed our petitions and that was back on august 29 so um for about 70 days um they have sort of infiltrated our entire area specifically the three stores that are that have filed the petitions to vote virginia is this intimidation uh it s absolutely intimidation and its interference uh and it s you know a perfect example of why workers have had such a hard time organizing you know back in the day before the 19 eighties we had 34 of the workforce in unions and therefore we had a middle class people had had jobs they had benefits and they had a good living standard as middle class people but since then uh as workers have tried to organize particularly in the service sector uh the employers have engaged in union busting activity starbucks is a perfect example of this uh terrible union busting which is trying to prevent the workers from simply having a voice we ve seen a lot of employees band together lately for push for unionization what s driving this do you expect this movement to get even bigger absolutely this is a turning point it s a crossroads in american history because if we do not increase the number of workers that are able to bargain collectively and if we do not allow workers to regain their living standards benefits health care pensions that they had in previous generations then we will not be able to sustain a democracy our country is not sustainable with all of the wealth being captured by those at the top the only way to turn that around and to restore our middle class democracy is to uh is to allow workers to organize and workers are standing up for themselves after 40 years of being pushed down another story we re following very closely at the network is kellogg s is actually suing striking employees towards unionizing is this legal what s the president they re setting here in virginia well i think it s absolutely disgusting how kellogg s is attacking uh their workforce what the workers are standing up for is a fair contract they re trying to end two tier wages which basically takes new employees and and reduces their pay and their benefits and um the company is making record profits and so they should not be attacking their own workers that s what starbucks is doing as well in addition to the other corporations and so workers solidarity is what s going to turn this around and honestly it s what s going to save this country because we will descend not only into oligarchy but into division if we don t restore the right of workers to have unions and to have a voice you can t have an entire population of people 60 of the population has has less than 2 of the nation s wealth it s all being concentrated at the top that s not a sustainable model so we all should hope that these workers continue to band together continue to stand up to continue to be courageous and achieve justice on the job virginia diamond the president of the northern virginia a f l c i o great insight thank you so much virginia this is such an important story we will continue to follow get national breaking news alerts the latest breaking updates delivered straight to your email inbox your

i groaned as i watched a clip of white house press secretary jen psaki responding sarcastically to a reporter s suggestion that there might be better ways to improve access to rapid coronavirus tests than letting americans get reimbursed by insurance companies for their cost should we just send one to every american psaki asked inwardly i screamed that kind of lack of imagination about how health care can work is beyond frustrating to witness once you ve experienced a system that takes a different approach one that s both simple to navigate and free at the point of service one that yes provides free coronavirus tests to everyone i am a dual citizen of the united states and britain now living in edinburgh scotland and i am able get rapid antigen tests anytime i want to at no cost and with no hoops to jump through i know that americans pay more than 20 for a package of two tests if they re in stock here you can walk into your local pharmacy and they will just hand you packs of seven tests at no charge in my neighborhood i can also go to the local recreational center and collect packs of tests free for my family or swing by a coronavirus testing center when i pick up tests at these places i don t fill out any forms i don t have to show any insurance cards they don t even ask my name why would they collecting such information would just create unnecessary paperwork and spawn a bureaucracy to deal with it instead the government just buys tests and then distributes them that s it no fees and no middlemen oh and if i don t have time for an errand i can fill out a quick online form and the next day a pack of seven tests will arrive in the mail at my house the policy is that you can order one such pack per person every 24 hours in fact the very day the president s spokeswoman tossed cold water on the idea of mailing out free tests a package containing seven tests for each member of my family arrived in the mail i d realized the previous day that we were running low so i placed an online order the postman knocked when he saw i was in and handed them to me the packages are designed to fit through the post slots most british homes have in their doors regular rapid testing is ubiquitous here in edinburgh and it has helped us to return to some semblance of normal life i have two children in high school and the official guidance is that they should take a rapid test twice a week when they started this regimen last school year i had to sign a form saying my children had permission to take part that friday they came home laden with piles of tests for the coming weeks the school usually gives them 24 at a time lately my kids haven t remembered to go to the school office to get resupplied so i ordered a few extra online for adults the advice has also been to take a rapid test twice a week if anyone tests positive or has coivd 19 symptoms regardless of testing we are advised to get a pcr test the more accurate kind we can get those free too at a national health service testing center or through the mail there are priority post boxes you can drop your sample in so it gets picked up faster this past week with the rise of the omicron variant the scottish government has asked that on top of twice weekly rapid testing people test anytime they plan to socialize travel on public transport or enter a public indoor space that includes shopping we also wear masks in public places following a government mandate omicron s emergence has everyone on edge but the system encouraging rapid testing will help britain keep an eye on cases when i talk about my experiences with health care in scotland with friends and family in the united states they are almost always incredulous they find it hard to fathom health care with no charges at the doctor s office no red tape no bureaucracy no copays no insurance company to argue with if you ve only known the u s system the concept that health care can be as simple as it is in britain can be hard to grasp but such a system does exist and it could exist too in the united states of course the united states does not need to nationalize its health care system to discover the benefits of free rapid testing for all it s just common sense yes ms psaki you should just send a test to every american who wants one april wallace who lives in edinburgh is a freelance writer she wrote this for bloomberg opinion

the us economy added just 210 000 jobs in november down from 546 000 jobs added in october this weaker than expected increase in roles was compounded by the unemployment rate also dropping 0 4 to a 21 month low of 4 2 all indicators are that the us labour market is tightening and this is putting pressure on the us federal reserve to speed up its reduction in regular asset purchases this would help to ward off surging inflation â except for the headline number the report seemed quite strong across the board the household survey was up 1 1 million that suggests there are probably revisions coming to the non farm payrolls side â said president of the federal reserve bank of st louis james bullard adding that it would be ideal to end the taper process in march as reported by bloomberg in an interview with fox business network at the beginning of november bullard indicated that the jobless rate was expected to fall below 4 in the first quarter of 2022 there will be two rate hikes next year bullard added â we are going to see downward pressure on the unemployment rate and we are going to continue to see a very hot jobs market with compensation rising â said bullard â weâ ve got quite a bit of inflation here â we definitely want to see that come down closer to our inflation target â thomas costerg senior us economist at pictet wealth management believes itâ s inevitable that the fed will look to speed up its tapering programme he told bloomberg â the probability of an accelerated taper is going up â the fed canâ t ignore the unemployment rate falling to a mere 4 2 â â he fed canâ t ignore the unemployment rate falling to a mere 4 2 â pictet wealth management us economist thomas costerg â faster tapering and the wall street with the unemployment rate being pushed down faster than expected the rate could fall below 4 in the next couple of months but what would the speeding up of tapering mean for wall streetâ s main indices all of the major indices experienced choppy trading in the week commencing 29 november not only did investors have to digest the latest jobs report they also had to factor in the volatility being caused by fears that the omicron variant could evade vaccines and be more likely to cause serious illness amid a broad sell off the s p 500 closed the week down 1 22 while the nasdaq composite index fell 2 9 the dow jones average dropped 0 91 and the russell 2000 index 3 86 the indices could continue to trend downwards until scientists release data to answer questions about the efficacy of vaccines against omicron until then the uncertainty could cause more sell offs â right now there were some expectations that we d hear a more dovish federal reserve but we re not we re hearing a more hawkish fed but not that hawkish to the extent that people are betting that they ll raise rates sooner next year â national securities chief market strategist art hogan per reuters as for tapering the next federal open market committee meeting is on 14 and 15 december based on bullardâ s recent comments itâ s expected that the fed will vote to speed up tapering right now there were some expectations that we d hear a more dovish federal reserve but we re not art hogan chief market strategist at new york firm national securities told reuters we re hearing a more hawkish fed but not that hawkish to the extent that people are betting that they ll raise rates sooner next year the major indices have also faced pressures from supply chain constraints including the global chip crunch in recent months product and component shortages have pushed up consumer prices high demand and the supply chain issues can be seen as a clear sign that the fedâ s bond buying programme has been working faster tapering can help to reduce demand and ease the bottlenecks but omicron may prove to be a new test for global supply chains â the omicron variant downside risks to employment and economic activity and increased uncertainty for inflation â federal reserve chairman jerome powell has commented as reported by cnbc concerns about the spread of omicron could see people less willing to work and this could end up slowing the progress the us job market has been making powell added â the omicron variant downside risks to employment and economic activity and increased uncertainty for inflationâ federal reserve jerome powell per cnbc this is a worst case scenario of course and early hospital data from south africa shows that fewer than a third of patients admitted for covid 19 during the latest wave linked to omicron are experiencing severe illness compared with two thirds in the early stages of the last two waves but the uncertainties at play mean the major us indices will likely see volatility in the months ahead

starbucks workers at a store in buffalo new york voted to unionize on thursday a first for the 50 year old coffee retailer in the u s and the latest sign that the labor movement is stirring after decades of decline the national labor relations board said thursday that workers voted 19 8 in favor of a union at one of three locations in buffalo a second store rejected the union in a vote of 12 8 the results of a third store could not be determined because of several challenged votes if the labor board certifies the results a process expected to take about a week it would be the first for any starbucks owned store in the u s to unionize starbucks has actively fought unionization at its stores for decades saying its stores function best when it works directly with employees the union votes come at a time of heightened labor unrest in the u s striking cereal workers at kellogg co rejected a new contract offer earlier this week thousands of workers were on strike at deere co earlier this fall and the u s labor board recently approved a redo of a union vote at an amazon warehouse in alabama after finding the company pressured workers to vote against the union labor shortages are giving workers a rare upper hand in wage negotiations and dan graff director of the higgins labor program at the university of notre dame said the pandemic gave many workers the time and space to rethink what they want from their jobs starbucks workers watching the vote count on thursday over zoom on a big screen at a union office in buffalo erupted into cheers and chants of elmwood elmwood elmwood when the results of that location were announced jumping up and down and hugging each other we still made history barista and union organizer casey moore told the others watching as it became clear the second store had voted down the union effort workers at all three stores began voting by mail last month on whether they wanted to be represented by workers united an affiliate of the service employees international union the nlrb began counting ballots thursday from union elections held at the stores around 111 starbucks workers were eligible to vote by mail starting last month yes votes could accelerate unionization efforts at other u s starbucks stores already three more stores in buffalo and a store in mesa arizona have filed petitions with the labor board for their own union elections those cases are pending kent wong the director of the ucla labor center says that it s a big deal for even one starbucks location to vote for a union calling it a symbolic victory for the labor movement wong noted that it could not only galvanize workers at other starbucks locations but also at fast food chains people are looking at what is happening in buffalo wong said union backers at the first three buffalo stores filed petitions with the labor board in august seeking representation by workers united an affiliate of the service employees international union those workers say starbucks stores had chronic problems like understaffing and faulty equipment even before the pandemic they want more input on pay and store operations we have no accountability right now we have no say said moore who has been working at a buffalo area starbucks for around six months with a union we will actually be able to sit down at the table and say this is what we want starbucks insists its 8 000 company owned u s stores function best when it works directly with its employees which it calls partners many employees in the buffalo area work at more than one store depending on demand starbucks says and it wants to have the flexibility to move them between stores starbucks asked the labor board to hold one vote with all 20 of its buffalo area stores but the board rejected that request saying store by store votes were appropriate under labor law in a letter to starbucks u s employees this week starbucks president and ceo kevin johnson reiterated the company s wish to include all buffalo area stores in the union vote while we recognize this creates some level of uncertainty we respect the process that is underway and independent of the outcome in these elections we will continue to stay true to our mission and values johnson wrote johnson also reminded employees of the company s generous benefits including paid parental and sick leave and free college tuition through arizona state university late last month the company also announced pay increases saying all its u s workers will earn at least 15 and up to 23 per hour by next summer but backers of the union say starbucks can do more if starbucks can find the money to pay their ceo nearly 15 million in compensation i think maybe they can afford to pay their workers a decent wage with decent benefits said u s sen bernie sanders a vermont independent in a recent twitter post sanders held a virtual town hall with buffalo starbucks workers earlier this week johnson earned 14 7 million in salary and stock awards in the company s 2020 fiscal year starbucks or the union can contest individual votes in the election which could delay the certification process by the labor board but if the votes do get certified starbucks is legally obligated to begin the process of collective bargaining with workers united and any of the three stores that vote to unionize said cathy creighton the director of cornell university s industrial and labor relations buffalo co lab in some cases companies have closed a location rather than deal with a union but that s difficult for a retailer like starbucks since it would be illegal to close one store and then open another nearby creighton said starbucks has shown a willingness to bargain outside the u s in victoria canada workers at a starbucks store voted to unionize in august 2020 it took starbucks and the united steelworkers union nearly a year to reach a collective bargaining agreement which was ratified by workers in july

redistricting of virginia s congressional districts has taken a significant step forward one that seems to be a fair compromise that republicans and democrats should be able to live with according to virginia tech s nicholas goedert the most significant change is the dismantling of three republican leaning districts in central virginia one of which had flipped democratic when abigail spanberger was elected in 2018 said goedert an assistant professor of political science working on a broad research agenda related to legislative elections and american politics they are replaced by two more heavily republican districts and a new democratic leaning district in the northern exurbs this puts spanberger in an awkward position but doesn t fundamentally change the partisan balance of the map the process of drawing new districts stalled out when the virginia redistricting commission failed to reach bipartisan agreement that s when the virginia supreme court appointed two special masters a democrat and a republican to resolve the matter it s certainly a mixed bag in terms of the success of the new process the court acting as a backstop appears to be operating in a conscientious and nonpartisan way so fears that a court controlled by republican nominees would implement a blatant republican gerrymander appear to be unfounded said goedert it is my hope that given the divided nature of virginia s new state government there may be sufficient pressure for the legislature to reform the commission to be more nonpartisan and not include involvement from sitting legislators in the future

few countries on earth so exemplify the deep inequity of the climate crisis as bangladesh despite producing only 0 56 of the global emissions changing our climate bangladesh ranks seventh on the list of countries most vulnerable to climate devastation according to germanwatch s 2021 global climate risk index cri this threat is not an abstract one the data shows that from 2000 to 2019 bangladesh suffered economic losses worth 3 72 billion and witnessed 185 extreme weather events due to climate change the story of how that came to be is in many ways a story about geography located east of india on the bay of bengal the country is known for its many waterways including the world famous ganges river these are waterways that produce rich agricultural soil allow extensive travel by boat and provide access to the rest of south asia and the world what s more bangladesh is home to the sundarbans the world s largest contiguous mangrove forest this unesco world heritage site both provides a livelihood for local people and makes world renowned biodiversity possible a bountiful mustard crop field in sirajganj bangladesh however this same geography also makes bangladesh one of the most vulnerable countries in the world to sea level rise increasingly powerful cyclones floods and more what s more a 2018 u s government report found that whopping 90 million bangladeshis 56 percent of the population live in high climate exposure areas with 53 million subject to very high exposure the threat could hardly be clearer so here s a breakdown of some of the major ways climate change threatens bangladesh sea level rise rising seas are a growing threat to people all around bangladesh that s because a staggering two thirds of the country is less than 15 feet above sea level for reference the elevation of lower manhattan in new york city ranges from 7 feet above sea level to a high of 13 feet and the threat becomes even clearer knowing that about a third of the population of bangladesh lives by the coast it has been estimated that by 2050 one in every seven people in bangladesh will be displaced by climate change specifically with a projected 19 6 inch 50 cm rise in sea level bangladesh may lose approximately 11 of its land by then and up to 18 million people may have to migrate because of sea level rise alone looking even further down the road scientific american describes how climate change in bangladesh has started what may become the largest mass migration in human history some scientists project a five to six foot rise by 2100 which would displace perhaps 50 million people what s more these rising seas now threaten to inundate the sundarbans the mangrove forest in southern bangladesh this is a doubly dangerous effect given that this coastal forest doesn t just sustain biodiversity and livelihoods but also shields bangladesh from the worst of the region s many cyclones the sundarbans mangrove forest in southwest bangladesh but sea level rise isn t just a problem because of outright land loss it s also a problem because of salinization the process by which salt infiltrates agricultural land hindering crop growth by limiting their ability to take up water on top of increasingly ruining crops salinization threatens the drinking water supplies of tens of millions of people in coastal communities consuming this salty contaminated water can expose populations to health problems like cardiovascular diseases for context in 1973 8 3 million hectares 321 623 square miles of land were affected by encroaching seawater by 2009 the number grew to over 105 6 million hectares 407 723square miles according to bangladesh s soil resources development institute overall salinity in the country s soil has increased by about 26 over the past 35 years flooding and unmanageable urbanization it s a well known fact that all around the world climate change is making rainfall more erratic and often far more intense in bangladesh this reality rings especially true this phenomenon of stronger downpours combined with rising temperatures melting the himalayan glaciers that feed rivers around bangladesh is leaving massive swaths of the country far more prone to devastating floods increasingly supercharged water levels in the ganges meghna brahmaputra river basin are destroying entire villages and hundreds of thousands of livelihoods devastation that contributes to over 10 million bangladeshis already being climate refugees flood affected area in the bandarban district of bangladesh as unicef describes around 12 million of the children most affected live in and around the powerful river systems which flow through bangladesh and regularly burst their banks the most recent major flooding of the brahmaputra river in 2017 inundated at least 480 community health clinics and damaged some 50 000 tube wells essential for meeting communities safe water needs of course that example specifically describes the impact of flooding on children but the takeaway is clear millions of bangladeshis are having to uproot their lives and migrate because of overflowing rivers by one estimate up to 50 of those now living in bangladesh s urban slums may be there because they were forced to flee their rural homes as a result of riverbank flooding similarly a study completed in 2012 of 1 500 bangladeshi families migrating to cities mainly dhaka showed that almost of all of them cited the changing environment as the biggest reason for their decision overwhelmingly when these migrants move into big cities they don t find refuge from rural climate challenges but rather more and at times worse problems as the video below describes they re forced to settle into densely populated urban slums with rudimentary housing conditions poor sanitation and limited economic opportunities for context take dhaka bangladesh s capital and biggest city dhaka holds 47 500 people per square kilometer nearly twice the population density of manhattan yet nowadays up to 400 000 more low income migrants arrive in dhaka every year the riverine flooding and other climate impacts contributing to this unmanageable urbanization has no end in sight especially without serious climate action cyclones the bay of bengal narrows towards its northern shore where it meets the south coast of bangladesh this funneling can both direct cyclones towards bangladesh s coast and make them more intense these effects combined with the fact that most of bangladesh s territory is low flat terrain can make storm surges absolutely devastating the bay of bengal funneling up toward the coast of bangladesh maps data google landsat copernicus sio noaa u s navy nga gebco sk telecom over the last decade on average nearly 700 000 bangladeshis were displaced each year by natural disasters according to the internal displacement monitoring centre the annual number spikes during years with powerful cyclones such as the following back in 2007 cyclone sidr struck the country s coast with wind speeds of up to 149 miles 240 km per hour claiming 3 406 lives just two years later in 2009 cyclone aila affected millions of people claimed the lives of about 190 and left about 200 000 homeless in 2016 cyclone roanu caused disastrous landslides and submerged villages leaving thousands homeless forcing half a million people to evacuate and causing 26 fatalities three years later in 2019 cyclone bulbul swept through the country forcing over 2 million people into cyclone shelters bulbul spent about 36 hours over bangladesh making it one of the longest lasting cyclones the country has faced in recorded history in 2020 cyclone amphan took the lives of 10 people in bangladesh and 70 others in india left thousands homeless and destroyed at least 176 007 hectares of agricultural land in 17 coastal districts it was the strongest cyclone ever recorded in the country s history a coastal storm rolling into chittagong bangladesh for a final example just this year cyclone yaas made landfall with a wind speed of 93 miles about 150 kilometers per hour like its predecessors bringing momentous devastation and claiming unnecessary lives now it can be easy to get lost in the numbers especially when they re so overwhelmingly large but the takeaway is clear stronger cyclones are becoming more common because of our changing climate as a result bangladesh is bearing more and more of the same tragic aftermath climate injustice talking about climate impacts in bangladesh would hardly be complete without mention of the staggering injustice bangladesh faces because overwhelmingly climate impacts are being imposed on bangladesh by high emitting wealthy countries not by the people of bangladesh themselves as a country bangladesh emits only a tiny fraction of the greenhouse gas emissions causing climate change perhaps more telling the average person in bangladesh emits 0 5 metric tons of co2 per year in the us for comparison that number is 15 2 metric

by charles schelle social workers at their core are devoted to social justice environmental justice as an extension within the social work field is one way to apply that devotion to help people confronted by climate change and pollution from top left to right lisa reyes mason lauren brown lee jordan ruth ann norton leanna powell dante swinton and shashawnda campbell vulnerable populations such as low income communities individuals with disabilities and certain racial and ethnic minorities are disproportionately exposed to unsafe living and working conditions and are more negatively impacted by our changing environment said nicole mattocks phd msw research assistant professor at the university of maryland school of social work umssw in an interview these are issues of environmental injustice in which social workers could and should get involved social workers are uniquely positioned to advance environmental justice because we possess valuable direct practice skills and are experts in building relationships and connections across groups we know how to work collaboratively with individuals and communities and we approach these relationships with respect humility and attention to social injustices mattocks added the umssw daniel thursz social justice lecture on tuesday dec 7 assembled a panel of baltimore area nonprofits to discuss their role in assisting people who are impacted by environmental quality issues and how social workers can carve out a role watch a recording of the event here panelists included leanna powell from blue water baltimore dante swinton from clean air baltimore lee jordan from black yield institute ruth ann norton from green healthy homes initiative shashawnda campbell from south baltimore community land trust social workers in the role of an advocate or a community organizer among others can meet people facing a myriad of environmental issues it could be sewage backups caused from increased flooding and inadequate infrastructure or lead paint abatement fracking in western maryland health issues from air pollution created by an incinerator among others in her guest lecture lisa reyes mason phd msw associate professor at the university of denver school of social work presented the evolution of social workers involved with policy advocacy and community organizing with environmental issues even issues that may not be initially associated with climate change in denver where i am now and in so many other cities racist redlining policies codified 100 years ago are clearly connected to climate injustice today reyes mason said redlined neighborhoods have experienced intentional disinvestment and now they tend to have less green space and tree cover they tend to be hot spots of urban heat islands or being higher risk flood zones than non redlined areas that study could easily replace denver with baltimore the organizations that appeared at the lecture also intersect the areas of environmental and racial justice in baltimore where environmental issues are disproportionately affecting black residents this is where social workers can do a lot of good with expertise in conflict resolution sincerely listening to people s needs and working on solutions green healthy homes initiative focuses on the intersection of degradation of housing stock and lead poisoning in children by advocating for lead free and lead safe neighborhoods along with lower asthma injuries and increased energy efficiency the organization approaches it from a moral standpoint addressing racial disparities said the initiative s president and chief executive officer ruth ann norton in our organization we also provide legal representation and case management at the core of the education and achievement of the advocacy goals is our social work practice norton said the nonprofit has numerous opportunities for social workers including positions for organizing and legislative policy on climate energy and

fitch ratings has just downgraded evergrande china s real estate giant to restricted default after it failed to make two coupon payments during a grace period that ended this monday while there has been no official commentary or confirmation from evergrande it marks the first time the company has been labeled as a defaulter by a major ratings company reported bloomberg brendan ahern chief investment officer at kraneshares sat down with etf trends to discuss the current outlook in china and how evergrande s restructuring is being seen from the side of the chinese the size of evergrande may be both its greatest downfall and the very thing that prevents it from having any type of catastrophic default the vast majority of evergande s debt is mired within mainland china and the real estate giant has outstanding debts across multiple industries the view in china is that an outright default would have a significant consequence on constituents in china ahern explained these constituents include the individuals and businesses that have paid evergrande to build a project such as paying for apartments the entities that funded the construction projects and the construction companies themselves given the scope of projects that evergrande has the new york times puts estimates at close to 800 projects unfinished and 1 6 million people still waiting on homes allowing the company to default and collapse would prove catastrophic to china s economy there are upwards of 120 banks that are owed money and over 100 nonfinancial institutions that evergrande owes money to allowing a complete default and collapse would be akin to a bear stearns moment ahern said the failure of bear stearns a global investment bank and its hedge funds led to the collapse of the lehman brothers and the financial crisis of 2008 the local government has stepped in to assist with restructuring to prevent a default and collapse that would send a similar tidal wave through china s markets and economy concerns that offshore bond payments would go unpaid are unfounded as ahern explained that china has said on many occasions that it would be treating evergrande s repayment of bonds the same as onshore bonds restarting construction there isn t much expectation for considerable market turbulence within china as investors have had a long time preparing for an evergrande default the chinese government has stepped up efforts to ease the failing company s impacts by reducing the reserve requirements for banks freeing up more money for lending as well as local governments working to help get construction restarted on many of the stalled apartments projects when it comes to restructuring the loans and bonds ahern anticipates it being very similar to how the european central bank ecb handled greece s debt crisis you can extend the maturities you can cut the interest rate so you allow evegrande to muddle through this will give the company time to complete its projects and then ahern anticipates a slow dismantling by region and breaking the company up into different parts allowing it to complete projects before the company eventually goes away entirely this aligns with the chinese government s stance that it has indicated on numerous occasions an unwillingness to bail a company out due to poor corporate leadership and decision making in the immediate microcap companies within china s real estate sector will most likely suffer from regulation changes ahern believes but largely chinese markets remain unaffected by evergrande s inevitable collapse it paints a much different picture for mainland china s perspectives than perspectives in the u s two of the best sectors in hong kong and china today real estate ahern said for investors interested in investing in the chinese economy that is mainly unaffected by evergrande s default and restructuring the kraneshares bosera msci china a share etf kba is an option that grants access to china s a shares the etf captures mid cap and large cap representation of chinese equities listed on the shenzhen and shanghai stock exchanges which have been historically closed to u s investors and carries an expense ratio of 0 59 for more news information and strategy visit the china insights channel

for many of us the prospect of working from home is a dream come true and the pandemic lockdowns have made it a reality it s become commonplace these days for companies to give their employees the option to work from home and most find that productivity goes up while costs go down many change resistant supervisors were reluctant to make the transition from on site to remote work fearing their employees would spend their day pretending to work while actually streaming tiger king and working on their sourdough recipes when put into practice remote work harnessed the power of a workforce confined to their homes helping to protect our nation s health and preserve our economy being forced to work from home proved both to workers and management teams that remote work works everyone knows buying or renting office space for employees and contractors can gobble up a sizable portion of a company s budget so it s no surprise that remote working just makes sense for many businesses but as with most things there s a dark side to remote work as well if you have remote employees there s always the threat of a hacker working from his parent s basement infiltrating your company and destroying all of your hard work information security is one of the essential components of any business but it s especially true for online businesses suppose you have trade secrets proprietary information such as customer lists or other sensitive data on your website that you don t want exposed to a malevolent third party it would help if you had the guidance and protection of a dedicated information technology professional but sometimes that s not possible or practical especially in expensive southern california for instance if you have multiple locations or need round the clock coverage your it staffing needs may exceed your actual budget a los angeles it consulting firm can assist you more and more companies now exist in southern california that offer to manage the technology needs of small businesses through outsourcing when considering outsourcing your it services you should first evaluate your current situation which problems you need to prioritize and what you need help with the most it s important to find a firm with expertise in your field that can offer a customized solution to address your areas of need finally you need to make sure they can train your employees and provide you with cyber security measures to protect your business another thing to consider is whether or not the consulting firm has the capacity to manage information security in compliance with local and global requirements this is especially important if they manage part of your it infrastructure remotely and if you provide services to other jurisdictions or countries before you decide if outsourcing your it department is right for your small business there are several significant benefits to consider for example you don t have to pay for employee insurance you ll benefit from wider access to a vast array of experts you ll have access to cutting edge technology without having to purchase it yourself you ll share risk with your it service provider who s responsible for data security and protection you can use consulting fees as a tax write off you ll ensure that your employees are set up on your network and properly trained in using the technology by expert consultants you will be free to focus on your core competencies outsourcing your it department is a viable affordable option for many small businesses it consulting companies have the talent expertise and resources to deliver results that surpass expectations offering competitive rates without sacrificing quality
