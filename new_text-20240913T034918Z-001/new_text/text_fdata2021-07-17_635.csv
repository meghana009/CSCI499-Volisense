as soon as casey morrissey opened the box of books they were furious the title at the top of the stack was abigail shrier s irreversible damage the transgender craze seducing our daughters a contentious tome that has sparked cries of transphobia since its release last summer do you know how that feels as a trans bookseller and book buyer morrissey who works at greenlight bookstores in brooklyn tweeted wednesday it isn t even a new title so it really caught me in the gut do better the american booksellers association quickly apologized for including the nonfiction book which it characterized as anti trans in its july mailing to its 750 member bookstores the trade organization s monthly white box includes marketing materials advance copies of books and finished titles the aba wants booksellers to consider stocking advertisement this is a serious violent incident that goes against aba s policies values and everything we believe and support the aba wrote on twitter it is inexcusable the organization also vowed to take concrete steps to remedy the harm it said it had caused a firestorm ensued with some including the book s author arguing that the booksellers association was essentially trying to censor irreversible damage and others calling the aba s apology insufficient sales of the title surged as a result its publisher said the dispute comes days after the aba drew ire for featuring the wrong book cover image for a young adult novel about black teenagers caught in a precarious position the book industry has frequently been pressured to drop controversial titles in recent months simon schuster a major publishing house canceled publication of republican sen josh hawley s book about technology companies after the jan 6 riot at the capitol and later backed out of publishing a memoir by louisville police sgt jonathan mattingly who fired his weapon in the raid that killed breonna taylor publishing platforms focused on conservative books including regnery publishing which printed irreversible damage picked up hawley mo and mattingly s titles morrissey the brooklyn bookseller said they re normally excited to choose books from aba s boxes and find that most are aligned with the association s stated equity goals from the most recent box they said they chose blue skinned gods by sj sindu and inseparable by simone de beauvoir among others advertisement i would love to see the aba take this moment to especially think about the black trans community who they have wronged twice in the past week and how they will make their trade organization a space where they feel valued morrissey wrote to the washington post several booksellers have suggested that the aba give free space in future mailings to books by transgender authors morrissey said they added that the aba could also donate the payment it received from regnery to a black led transgender rights organization in her book shrier argues that gender dysphoria has become an epidemic in which teenagers are mistakenly jumping to the conclusion that they re transgender she contends that teens are too young to choose to medically transition although she has said in interviews that she supports adults right to do so major medical associations including the american academy of pediatrics support gender affirming medical treatment for children and adolescents advertisement lgbtq advocates have criticized irreversible damage as dangerous and full of misinformation i think of all the times ways i was told my transness wasn t real the daily toll that still takes chase strangio the aclu s deputy director for transgender justice tweeted about the book in november we have to fight these ideas which are leading to the criminalization of trans life again after the aba apologized for mailing out her book shrier tweeted that the organization was promoting book banning and belonged in a hall of fame for capitulations to woke bullies in a statement to the post she defended the aba s decision to send her book to booksellers but aba s groveling performative hyperbolic apology in which they call their mailing of a book a serious violent incident displays their contempt for an open liberal society tolerant of a diversity of viewpoints shrier wrote that s a tragically misguided position for a bookselling organization to take tom spence regnery s president said his publishing house rarely suggests its books for the aba s white boxes but regnery staff thought independent bookstores might be interested in irreversible damage a bestseller and one of the economist s books of the year for 2020 so spence said the publisher paid about 1 500 to send the aba 750 copies of the book newly in paperback with a one page descriptive flier the aba did not object to the nomination he added advertisement since the aba s apology spence said sales of irreversible damage have spiked far beyond the number of sales regnery expected to make because of the white box some conservatives and free speech advocates have used the controversy to encourage people to buy the book which spence defended as temperately written he said criticism of the text as anti trans was empty rhetoric share this article share my takeaway from this is the aba responding to the hysterical reaction of some of its members has taken the position that presenting booksellers of all people with books that make an argument that they disagree with that merely presenting the book to them is an act of violence spence said and this is the same organization that is about to sponsor banned books week at the end of september with the slogan this year censorship divides us the booksellers association is not the only organization to find itself centered in the battle over irreversible damage mega retailer target promised in november to take the book off its shelves but soon reversed itself the title was not listed on target s website friday advertisement this spring hundreds of amazon employees asked the company to stop selling the book and at least two recently resigned in protest of the company s decision to keep stocking it nbc news reported irreversible damage was ranked as a bestseller on amazon on friday amazon founder jeff bezos owns the washington post in a letter to booksellers obtained by publishers weekly american booksellers association ceo allison hill listed eight steps the organization planned to take to better support marginalized communities including revising the group s internal checks and balances and changing the submission process for its white box program the aba s board of directors followed up with its own note to booksellers saying the distribution of irreversible damage and the cover mix up were evidence of systemic problems the aba did not respond to a question from the post about how irreversible damage was chosen for this month s mailing and how the cover switch occurred advertisement luis alberto correa a member of the aba s diversity equity and inclusion committee said he was disappointed by the passive language the aba used in its initial apology but was satisfied by the follow up messages from hill and the aba s board of directors the diversity committee is not involved in choosing books for the mailings correa an operations manager and bookseller at avid bookshop in athens ga said he rejects the idea that bookstores as private entities need to promote books with a range of viewpoints his goal is to make customers from marginalized communities feel comfortable at his establishment i feel like i stock better books as a result correa said and i get better more loyal customers in the store who feel not only represented in the books i m sharing but also feel welcome in the space advertisement christopher ferguson a psychology professor at stetson university who reviewed irreversible damage in january said he would characterize shrier s book as intentionally provocative but not transphobic ferguson who studies moral panic and the formation of cultural narratives said irreversible damage oversimplifies a nuanced issue i think the hypothesis is plausible and there may even be some evidence to suggest that there may be an element of truth to it he said but it wasn t as scientifically grounded of a book as i was necessarily hoping to see

additional drug candidates into human testing the san diego based company initially planned to offer 17 5 million shares in the range of 14 to 16 each but erasca was able to upsize the deal to 18 75

times throughout its ipo filing playfully the company reveals that it refers to its employees as erascals but the company name also reveals its approach eradicate ras driven caancer founder and ceo jonathan lim wrote in a letter included in the prospectus ras genes encode proteins that play a role in cell signaling acting like an on off switch that regulates cell growth mutations can keep the switch stuck in the on position the result is unregulated cell growth that drives cancer while ras s role in cancer is understood drugging it has been difficult erasca is developing therapies that shut down the ras gene and the mapk pathway which form one of the most frequently altered signaling pathways in cancer of the company s 11 pipeline programs two have reached the clinic eras 007 is in phase 2 testing in patients whose solid tumors have been altered by ras mapk regardless of the type of tissue where the tumor developed eras 601 is in phase 1 testing in ras mapk altered tumors both are oral small molecule drugs but erasca isn t tied to a particular type of drug and while its singular focus is on shutting down ras mapk it says it can do so with small molecules large molecules or protein degrading drugs additional programs are making progress toward clinical trials we expect to have four product candidates in the clinic within the next six quarters plus an additional filing

undruggable in may amgen won fda approval for lumakras a drug for non small cell lung cancer nsclc that targets a rare mutation of kras part of the ras family but nsclc has a tendency to spread to the brain and this is one area where erasca believes it can stand apart in the ipo filing erasca cites animal tests of the approved amgen drug and the experimental adagrasib from mirati therapeutics showing that those medicines did a poor job of penetrating into the central nervous system erasca says it is developing drugs that go after the same rare kras mutation and offer comparable or even better efficacy while also having the ability to cross the blood brain barrier city hill ventures is erasca s largest shareholder with a 10 3 post ipo stake according to the prospectus arch venture

photo by drew angerer getty images washington the director of president joe biden s domestic policy council susan rice has divested herself of millions of dollars worth of holdings in a company that s leading a contentious pipeline project supported by the biden administration according to newly released financial disclosure reports and a white house official rice has liquidated nearly 2 7 million worth of shares she and her husband owned in enbridge a canadian company building the line 3 pipeline which would carry hundreds of thousands of barrels of canadian oil through minnesota and wisconsin last month the biden administration gave a public boost to the trump era pipeline project calling for the dismissal of a court challenge brought by environmental groups seeking to protect minnesota watershed and tribal lands from the pipeline the enbridge stock sale is part of a series of large divestments that rice one of the wealthiest members of the biden white house has recently made or is planning to make in the coming days divesting is a common measure that newly appointed public officials take to ensure that their government duties don t overlap with their personal interests a certificate of divestiture issued by the office of government ethics last week shows rice s plans to sell holdings in more than three dozen companies and several investment funds that she and her family own assets currently worth a total of more than 30 million enbridge s stock price has been on an upward trend since november and the value of rice s holdings in the company has increased from roughly 2 4 million when she joined the biden administration earlier this year to nearly 2 7 million as of friday it s unclear if rice netted any capital gains from the sale of her enbridge shares but those who divest assets under a certificate of divestiture are allowed to defer taxes on capital gains a white house official told abc news that during the transition period leading up to biden s inauguration rice had agreed to divest from all of the listed assets in the meantime while waiting for her certificate of divestiture to be issued she recused herself from matters involving companies in which she had investments the official said that as of early this week rice had divested all of her canadian assets including the enbridge holdings and more than 14 million worth of shares in canadian pacific railway ltd as well as many u s assets her remaining u s stocks are in the process of being divested a process that will be finished before july 27 the official said among the other assets she is divesting according to her disclosure reports are 1 million worth of shares in johnson johnson more than 823 000 worth of shares in apple and nearly 289 000 worth of shares in comcast she will retain major holdings in canadian banks including 5 million to 25 million each in the royal bank of canada and the toronto dominion bank according to her disclosure reports rice s certificate of divestiture was first reported by the daily poster as abc news previously reported several other senior members of the biden administration similarly divested themselves of their assets to comply with ethics rules earlier this year biden s white house climate envoy john kerry was issued a certificate of divestiture in march for liquidating 4 million to 15 million in assets from more than 400 companies including energy sector interests in may energy secretary jennifer granholm divested 1 6 million worth of shares in electric vehicle producer proterra kedric payne general counsel and senior director of ethics at the good government group campaign legal center said that considering the large number of diverse stocks that rice is divesting it s difficult to say whether the timing of the biden administration s support for the line 3 pipeline project and rice s divestiture raises any questions but he said that rice s divestment from those assets shows the highest level of effort to avoid a conflict of interest ethics laws allow an official to resolve conflicts of interest with recusals waivers and blind trusts but divesting assets is typically the most extreme remedy payne said when officials are transparent about conflicts and sell their relevant assets to avoid such conflicts the ethics laws are working as intended copyright 2021 abc audio all rights reserved

investigations and threat management service a security unit within the department of commerce conducted unauthorized investigations targeting asian american employees a senate report detailing the rogue unit was released tuesday by republican mississippi sen roger wicker a security unit within the department of commerce acted as a rogue unaccountable police force across multiple presidential administrations targeting asian american department employees a new senate report based on allegations from over two dozen whistleblowers says the unit named the investigations and threat management service itms conducted unauthorized and oftentimes overzealous investigations that targeted those employees in an attempt to weed out supposed connections between them and the chinese government beginning as early as 2014 the report says in one case itms investigated chinese born hydrologist sherry chen on charges of espionage and providing false statements alleging she distributed unclassified information to a foreign national the report reads agents reportedly interrogated her for seven hours and told her she could never discuss the interrogation with anyone including her superiors the report reads in a lawsuit filed against federal officials chen said that itms agents ignored exculpatory evidence throughout the interview reached false conclusions without even a cursory investigation of underlying facts and reported false results reflecting their racial and ethnic bias when the case was referred to the fbi all charges were dropped in other instances the report says itms investigations resulted in the seizures of work phones and computers secret searches involving identity concealing tactics including the use of facemasks latex gloves and shoe coverings and lock picking of offices and personal storage poor management and weak oversight allowed the itms to operate outside the norms of the law enforcement community the report reads deficient policies and procedures outlining the unit s investigative capabilities led to repeated instances of malfeasance including the purposeful prolonging of investigations unauthorized use of secured messaging systems and overclassification of documents to protect the unit from external scrutiny an investigation into the unit was launched in february by the senate committee on commerce science and transportation the whistleblower reports of improper activity dated back to the mid 2000s the report says the report was released tuesday by republican mississippi senator roger wicker a ranking member of that committee it is my duty to ensure that we hold agencies accountable especially when whistleblowers come forward with information suggesting chronic abuses of power wicker said in a statement congress has a defined role in performing oversight and i intend to make sure that the federal agencies operate within the proper bounds
officials reactivate regional housing authority as la plata county residents struggle to find affordable housing options local governments have reactivated a tool they believe will help durango bayfield ignacio and la plata county unanimously decided in early july to activate the area s regional housing authority which tackles affordable housing projects partnerships and programs the authority went dormant in 2017 but with the post 2020 rush to rural areas rapidly rising housing prices and bottomed out housing stock la plata county governments are bringing the authority back online this is such a pressing need in our community it would not be prudent to let the tool the regional housing authority go away said la plata county commissioner marsha porter norton local governments pushed la plata county s authority called the regional housing alliance into dormancy to reduce costs and redundancy local organizations took on the area s affordable housing needs but the county like communities across colorado and the u s is facing a tight housing market housing stock is quickly snapped up and prices are soaring companies are hearing that housing prices are a significant barrier to recruiting employees officials are worried that durango s core workforce servers teachers small business employees cannot afford to live in the city local municipalities decided to reactivate the housing alliance as one of many strategies to address the problem which some including porter norton have called a crisis we see an opportunity to use the alliance to create housing now not five years from now said durango mayor kim baxter during an early july retreat disbanding the alliance was an option porter norton said the government officials vetted the idea and unanimously decided not to go in that direction we can do more together than if we all went our separate ways she said the regional housing alliance will explore ways to partner with existing groups that already work on affordable housing such as homesfund housing solutions for the southwest and the la plata county economic development alliance but the alliance can leverage unique tools which are not available to those organizations as an intergovernmental entity the regional housing alliance can ask voters for a sales or property tax increase to support its operation and programs it can condemn property it can create enterprises for self funded projects such as rental housing and have greater access to state and federal grants we have not decided that the rha here would take on all these functions porter norton said in the past the alliance was able to plan finance acquire construct repair manage and operate housing projects for families of low or moderate income housing authorities are not the be all to housing options however from a small town perspective a housing authority can field or support the complex housing grants requirements and gather valuable resources said bayfield town manager katie sickles ignacio like the other rha members wants to build housing at all levels with a focus on middle income workforce housing there are many pieces to the house building puzzle and we need to understand them and incorporate what we can into the project so that we achieve our goal said mark garcia ignacio s interim town manager we are much smaller than the other members but have the same issues and challenges the alliance might be reactivated but local governments have a lot to do to get it up and running the government partners need to negotiate a new intergovernmental agreement which will outline how the alliance will be staffed organized and funded in the past each partner provided a percentage of the funding based on population the alliance needs to consider how much housing is needed what it should look like and where it should go baxter said i m very excited about it i think there s a real opportunity here she said the rha is a unique vehicle for creating housing we don t have anything quite like it right now already the partners know that middle income workforce housing is a top priority there is no reason for it the alliance to exist unless we can help more inventory come online and there s many ways to do that porter norton said we need to vet them and see which ones are feasible they are also waiting for the results of a housing study conducted by the southwest colorado council of governments and housing solutions for the southwest the study is expected to wrap up in july or august and will assess the need for different types of housing units for people at different income levels porter norton said the governments are looking at ways to use one time american rescue plan funding to assist with affordable housing projects the city of durango also is looking at options to use hotels motels and city property for middle income housing baxter said i think this is critical to maintaining the character of our community she said we have an opportunity here to stay the real town we are and not to become a resort economy i don t remember a time where i ve seen so much passion and energy happening porter norton said everyone has the best intentions to make this work smullane durangoherald com

photo by drew angerer getty images washington the director of president joe biden s domestic policy council susan rice has divested herself of millions of dollars worth of holdings in a company that s leading a contentious pipeline project supported by the biden administration according to newly released financial disclosure reports and a white house official rice has liquidated nearly 2 7 million worth of shares she and her husband owned in enbridge a canadian company building the line 3 pipeline which would carry hundreds of thousands of barrels of canadian oil through minnesota and wisconsin last month the biden administration gave a public boost to the trump era pipeline project calling for the dismissal of a court challenge brought by environmental groups seeking to protect minnesota watershed and tribal lands from the pipeline the enbridge stock sale is part of a series of large divestments that rice one of the wealthiest members of the biden white house has recently made or is planning to make in the coming days divesting is a common measure that newly appointed public officials take to ensure that their government duties don t overlap with their personal interests a certificate of divestiture issued by the office of government ethics last week shows rice s plans to sell holdings in more than three dozen companies and several investment funds that she and her family own assets currently worth a total of more than 30 million enbridge s stock price has been on an upward trend since november and the value of rice s holdings in the company has increased from roughly 2 4 million when she joined the biden administration earlier this year to nearly 2 7 million as of friday it s unclear if rice netted any capital gains from the sale of her enbridge shares but those who divest assets under a certificate of divestiture are allowed to defer taxes on capital gains a white house official told abc news that during the transition period leading up to biden s inauguration rice had agreed to divest from all of the listed assets in the meantime while waiting for her certificate of divestiture to be issued she recused herself from matters involving companies in which she had investments the official said that as of early this week rice had divested all of her canadian assets including the enbridge holdings and more than 14 million worth of shares in canadian pacific railway ltd as well as many u s assets her remaining u s stocks are in the process of being divested a process that will be finished before july 27 the official said among the other assets she is divesting according to her disclosure reports are 1 million worth of shares in johnson johnson more than 823 000 worth of shares in apple and nearly 289 000 worth of shares in comcast she will retain major holdings in canadian banks including 5 million to 25 million each in the royal bank of canada and the toronto dominion bank according to her disclosure reports rice s certificate of divestiture was first reported by the daily poster as abc news previously reported several other senior members of the biden administration similarly divested themselves of their assets to comply with ethics rules earlier this year biden s white house climate envoy john kerry was issued a certificate of divestiture in march for liquidating 4 million to 15 million in assets from more than 400 companies including energy sector interests in may energy secretary jennifer granholm divested 1 6 million worth of shares in electric vehicle producer proterra kedric payne general counsel and senior director of ethics at the good government group campaign legal center said that considering the large number of diverse stocks that rice is divesting it s difficult to say whether the timing of the biden administration s support for the line 3 pipeline project and rice s divestiture raises any questions but he said that rice s divestment from those assets shows the highest level of effort to avoid a conflict of interest ethics laws allow an official to resolve conflicts of interest with recusals waivers and blind trusts but divesting assets is typically the most extreme remedy payne said when officials are transparent about conflicts and sell their relevant assets to avoid such conflicts the ethics laws are working as intended copyright 2021 abc audio all rights reserved

still in beta testing to monitor unborn babies vitals going from college students in a garage to trading on the new york stock exchange within five years has required significant adaptability and some growing pains and stretch marks we got told no time and time again by utah investors and investors abroad owlet ceo kurt workman said every investor looked at us like we were crazy just a team of bumpkins from provo the ones that did take a chance on the company were even more appreciated because of that rejection elsewhere pelion and peak ventures are local investors who have been supportive of owlet since day one like most innovative efforts the device and the company were born from necessity in 2012 at the time workman and his wife shea were planning on starting a family but shea workman has a congenital heart defect that caused her to stop breathing and be taken to the hospital she had two more cardiac surgeries on the workman side of the family there was a history of child loss to sudden infant death syndrome workman s aunt had just given birth to premature twins and he saw the toll that stress took on her he wanted to create a device that would help create peace of mind for parents including his own family he thought of the tech typically used on patients fingers in the hospitals to allow doctors and nurses to monitor their patients even while they are away and applied that to babies and parents and that led to the smart sock now used on over 1 million babies the device uses pulse oximetry a noninvasive method of measuring the saturation of hemoglobin in the blood to monitor the heart rate and blood oxygen levels and sleep trends of babies as they sleep and alert parents of any changes through an app notification so they can help their child twenty eight thousand babies pass away unexpectedly between the last half of pregnancy and the first year of life he said one commonality is that parents are away this would allow them to be there in the moment they need them because the baby doesn t have a voice soon his classmates at byu jordan monroe zack bomsta jake colvin and tanor hodges who all had newborns or babies on the way joined him to create a company that could stay up all night with babies so parents didn t have to which is how they settled on the name owlet a nocturnal animal that could watch over the children now 28 5 of utah babies leave with an owlet smart sock and they have used the data to create the largest data set of infant health that has ever been collected when asked what the secret to his success is workman cites the good people that were brought in on along the way when your company has a real purpose and a mission then you can hire real quality people he added we were also successful because it wasn t until the product was truly great that we sent it out he said we went through 14 iterations of the product before shipping all three of workman s kids have used owlet s products one time when he was sleep training his youngest son river the baby finally stopped crying after two hours and the smart sock alarm went off workman found his baby laying face directly into the mattress with low air supply he was able to roll him over and the baby gasped and kept sleeping maybe he would have rolled over on his own but maybe he wouldn t have but his father was able to be there to prevent the worst case scenario owlet inc ceo and co founder kurt workman holds his youngest son river workman started the company to monitor his children for possible congenital heart defects owlet made its debut on the new york stock exchange on friday july 16 2021 photo owlet inc owlet has received close to 500 similar stories from parents who were alerted and able to help their babies we believe the number of babies that pass away while sleeping should be zero workman said but the benefits aren t just for the babies owlet has published data that shows that 96 of parents report less anxiety while using the owlet and 94 report better sleep every night i get up and check the doors i check the kids i check everything it s that moment before my head hits the pillow that i think is there anything else and then that s when owlet comes into play and i can fall asleep workman said

approach couples affordable housing programs with substance use and mental health treatment the city of denver embarked on a five year experiment in 2016 to see if it could disrupt the city s robust homeless to jail pipeline by providing permanent supportive housing which couples housing with services such as substance use and mental health treatment the results a remarkably successful initiative said mary cunningham vice president of the metropolitan housing and communities policy center at the urban institute who helped conduct an independent evaluation of the program the social and economic policy research organization based in washington d c released its final report tuesday looking at housing stability rates health outcomes and whether the initiatives decreased people s interactions with the criminal justice system the independent evaluation which was paid for by the city of denver found that within the three year evaluation period 68 of people who were enrolled in the program remained in housing 12 had died and 1 had moved into other permanent housing the report said the report noted the high mortality rate 28 people among those in supportive housing was in line with what was seen in a control group people experiencing homelessness have an average life expectancy of around 56 years almost 18 years below that of housed populations according to the national institutes of health other notable outcomes from the study included a 34 reduction in police contacts compared with the control group a 40 decrease in arrests and emergency department visits and a 155 increase in primary and preventive care visits in 2014 the city estimated it spent 7 million a year to serve 250 people experiencing chronic homelessness who were frequently interacting with expensive emergency systems not designed to support their long term needs according to a denver city government news release a total of 724 people experiencing chronic homelessness who had prior involvement with the criminal justice system were enrolled in the program half of whom were provided with supportive housing through the colorado coalition for the homeless or mental health center of denver the remaining participants referred to as the control group received only the resources that were available in the community because these results are from our rigorous experimental evaluation we can be confident that any differences between these two groups are because of supportive housing cunningham said during a panel discussion on thursday announcing the results of the study to fund the five year program denver partnered with eight private investors that agreed to pay 8 6 million in upfront costs to house 250 people who had frequent interactions with the city s jail system the investors agreed to only get paid back if the program proved successful an approach referred to as a social impact bond initiative given the program s success the city will pay 9 6 million back to investors representing a 1 million return in investment according to the study about 4 5 million is for costs saved on housing stability and 5 1 million for the reduced number of jail stays the denver sib was one of the first supportive housing programs funded through a social impact bond model according to the study greatest thing that s happened in my life walter boyd a 54 year old lakewood resident who obtained supportive housing through the program said it gave him an opportunity to get his life back on track really it saved his life he said after leaving a bad marriage he found himself homeless in 2020 in the middle of the pandemic and stayed at the emergency men s shelter at the national western stock show for four months a few weeks before the shelter was scheduled to close he got stopped by a staff member i was scared because i was a little late but they said they had a message for me from the coalition he said the message was from the colorado coalition for the homeless saying it had found him temporary housing at a hotel he stayed there for two months then moved into permanent supportive housing last october in lakewood it s a beautiful suburb i can t even believe i m still here he said i ve been here almost a year sometimes i feel like i got to pinch myself he said he was able to get medical treatment for his depression and scoliosis and get help finding employment he said he s now working with denver health as a consultant helping to conduct a survey on homelessness the colorado coalition for the homeless also provided him emotional support when his mother died last year it really was a hard time he said if i was still on the street i would have never never been able to get on my feet he added so my case managers were able to talk to me and refer me to different programs he wants every person living on the streets to be able to access the supportive housing program i just pray that it continues boyd said it s the greatest thing that s happened in my life need drastically outpaces availability though the program proved to be a success for those who participated the need for supportive housing in denver and across the country far outpaces its availability according to the report unsheltered homelessness in denver has increased by 25 since 2017 from 3 336 people to 4 171 in 2020 the estimate is based on annual point in time surveys which are considered an undercount because the counts occur on a single night in the dead of winter and only accounts for people willing to be interviewed john parvensky president and chief executive officer for the colorado coalition for the homeless said during the panel discussion that the report reinforces what housing and homelessness providers have known for 20 years the housing first approach works that supportive housing with wraparound services works and that integrated health care provided and linked to housing works he said parvensky wants the city to invest more in building supportive housing as well as increase rental assistance and access to health care and mental health treatment we need to expand programs like this by eight times just to meet the needs of the people who are homeless tonight he said cunningham said in order for denver to scale the supportive housing program to serve 1 200 people experiencing chronic homelessness which is still well below the need it would cost between 14 6 million and 18 7 million per year but she added the efforts would ultimately save the city 8 3 million in emergency services such as hospital and jail stays opportunity to change approach vinnie cervantes director of denver alliance for street health response said he would like to see denver reallocate public safety money which accounts for 42 of the city s 1 3 billion municipal budget according to the denver post and direct it toward housing and mental health services cervantes organization helped pave the way for denver s star program which sends mental health professionals to crisis calls instead of law enforcement officers for cervantes the outcomes outlined in the urban institute report directly contradict the city s current approach to homelessness which includes conducting continuous homeless sweeps of encampments that are in violation of the city s urban camping ban the city is doubling down on that approach with this new set program the street enforcement team he said denver city officials announced on tuesday their plans to establish a street enforcement team to issue citations to residents for disobeying city ordinances including the urban camping ban the team will include six unarmed civilians this is going to only increase the barriers that people face to get out of the situation they are in cervantes said we re not going to enforce our way out of these crises the city of denver has done everything to prove that they re gonna double down on those efforts of criminalization and harm and compounding trauma and i think that this report hopefully will at least be a way for them to reverse course he said for more stories by colorado newsline visit coloradonewsline com

don t miss out on the headlines from victoria followed categories will be added to my news this coronavirus article is unlocked and free to read in the interest of community health and safety click here for full digital access to trusted news from the herald sun and leader for just 1 a week for the first 12 weeks melbourne has recorded no new local covid cases overnight and just one new case in hotel quarantine acting premier james merlino said it is good news and news i know everyone in victoria wanted to hear but he warned that while it was a terrific outcome it was nowhere near over victorians have done an awesome effort in getting tested getting vaccinated following the rules we are not out of the woods yet today having zero cases is a great reflection of the work of all victorians there is a total of 75 active cases in the community and 17 604 tests were processed on thursday mr merlino urged those in craigieburn to get tested as he said testing numbers were lower than expected in some areas we would like to see an uplift because of community transmission it was lower than we would have liked in some parts of melbourne i am asking victorians that if you live in the craigieburn area and did not get tested yesterday please go out and get tested today he said acting premier james merlino says victorians are not out of the woods yet picture david crosling chief health officer brett sutton also urged victorians to keep testing efforts up the week ahead probably won t be all zero cases we have thousands of primary close contacts some of which will become positive it is not a concern as they all quarantined for the entire period it has only been 48 hours since we had cases of uncertain acquisition the genomic sequence from the four mystery cases in the same reservoir household has indicated they re carrying the kappa strain of virus prof sutton said that finding was consistent with the existing city of whittlesea outbreak the dhhs is still searching for the source of exposure for the two queensland cases in melbourne they have gone through a long interview process with us prof sutton said we thank them for that it is a tiring process lots of detail around where they have been we have been looking quite a bit earlier than june for that acquisition where they may have picked it up whether or not they were infectious through that he said mr merlino said a number of exposure sites would come up as a result of the couple who had travelled to queensland but could not say if the pair would be fined a large line forms at the food bank pop up in la trobe street after the easing of restrictions picture nca newswire david crosling elective surgery to resume from tuesday june 15 melbourne hospitals will be able to resume elective surgeries mr merlino confirmed but mr merlino warned of backlogs and delays stating it was not as simple as flicking a switch staff at kirk s wine bar in melbourne s cbd prepare to resume trading picture getty images masks remain mandatory outside picture david crosling restrictions to stay in place prof sutton said the state would not ease restrictions sooner than planned given the kappa variant link with the reservoir household he said he wasn t suprised by friday s zero cases obviously primary close contacts isolating at home has helped to control this he said although tracing work has helped to control this and all the great testing that has been done has allowed us to find cases and then control them so we are going to get days of zero i expect they will be more and i also expect there will be days when we have new cases each day it isn t over yet we are on the right track as the city s restrictions eased on monday prof sutton said he had never backed lockdowns as the first measure to tackle an outbreak they will never be the first measure they will be a measure that we implement when we have to do and only when we have to do there are so many sad stories and struggles that people are reporting on my heart goes out to them i cannot fathom what it has meant across victoria throughout lockdown and through all of the circuit breakers and lockdowns across australia we are doing this with the minimum restrictions that keep us safe the alternative with this running away is too awful to imagine in some respects however he said mystery cases would trigger tighter restrictions but couldn t say whether the emergence of more mystery cases would lead to another lockdown of course mystery cases where there are concerns about high risk settings would be of concern there will be mystery cases where people have had very little interaction or there is a significant suggestion where they may have picked it up geographically or otherwise there is no one size fits all each on its own merits chief health officer brett sutton says mystery cases will trigger more restrictions picture andrew henshaw shopper return to bourke street mall picture david crosling covid jab a path out of lockdowns more than 17 000 victorians were vaccinated on thursday mr merlino said the commonwealth had assured it had enough pfizer vaccination in stock for a second dose he said vaccination was a pathway out of future blanket lockdowns the sooner we get our community vaccinated at a much higher proportion the more comfort is provided to public health in terms of our response to any particular outbreak qld authorities put victorians on notice queensland health minister yvette d ath said she had been informed that there were other victorians who managed to come into queensland without the correct exemptions i ve been advised this morning by the deputy police commissioner that there are other people coming across our border from victoria who are driving up through new south wales crossing our border from victoria who do not have the exemptions or travel declarations to do so ms d ath said we will be making sure that you are found this is an offence you cannot come into this state if you are from a hotspot and put our state at risk and we will make sure that you will face the consequences if you do that queensland police deputy commissioner steve gollschewski confirmed five other people have been identified as failing to comply with directions coming into queensland two in the darling downs one in dalby and two in the wide bay district all five people who entered queensland without border passes were sent to hotel quarantine and returned negative test results more suburbs on alert victorian health authorities uncovered more concerning sewage detections of covid 19 as melbourne emerged from tough lockdown restrictions covid was detected in wastewater in bendigo glenroy pascoe vale and across whitehorse manningham and monash council areas the health department said there had also been positive detections of coronavirus viral fragments in wastewater samples taken in the scoresby and vermont areas in a statement late on thursday these new

epidemiologist labelled the state government s move to keep masks mandatory outdoors a burden on melburnians with very little health evidence melbourne s lockdown will be lifted as planned on friday but health experts have reneged on their proposal to scrap outdoor mask wearing despite admitting coronavirus had not been transmitted outside in any recent outbreak it comes as authorities scramble to work out how a family of four mysteriously caught the virus a woman in her 70s and three men in their 80s 50s and 20s from the same reservoir home tested positive on wednesday none have visited an exposure site or been identified as a close contact of a positive case and their strain is unknown one of the family members is a recipient of a disability pension while another provides care in an informal setting chairs were out at 6 30am on friday at the peddler cafe in nunawading as sit in dining returned in melbourne deputy chief health officer allen cheng said these new cases are really the strongest reminder that we are no means out of the woods yet but health officials deemed the cautious easing of melbourne s restrictions allowing schools to reopen restaurants to have 100 patrons only 50 indoors and travel up to 25km could go ahead we are moving ahead but we are on high alert acting premier james merlino said questions have been raised as to the effectiveness of wearing masks outdoors after both professor cheng and covid 19 commander jeroen weimar confirmed no cases in the current cluster or recent outbreaks had been acquired while outside we have no evidence that we ve seen yet in this particular outbreak or the most recent ones we ve dealt with of outdoor transmission mr weimar admitted on thursday professor cheng said there was pretty good evidence around masks reducing transmission and that cases where the virus was passed outdoors in the second wave might have gone unnoticed when asked about reports that transmission was 20 times less likely to happen outdoors prof cheng said that doesn t mean zero there is still a risk infectious diseases expert prof peter collignon said little to no transmission occurred outdoors unless in crowded situations where people gathered for prolonged periods unless you ve got uncontrollable spread like in the uk or europe i can t really see it ll provide much benefit to wear masks outdoors prof collignon said there can t be much community transmission in melbourne right now if any mr merlino said the continued wearing of masks was a small price to pay we don t have the luxury of picking and choosing public health advice that we like or don t like he said melbourne exited lockdown at midnight on thursday picture ian currie acting premier james merlino said victorians must wear masks outdoors victoria police chief commissioner shane patton revealed on thursday about 50 people were fined 4500 for blatant breaches during the recent lockdown meanwhile queensland authorities confirmed a melton couple who tested positive for coronavirus did not have an exemption to enter the state but are believed to have been moving their for work the couple both in their 40s left melbourne on june 1 and travelled through nsw before arriving on the sunshine coast on june 5 they first became symptomatic on june 3 but victorian contact tracers have little information on the case given they are now in the hands of queensland authorities prof cheng flagged the new cases could stall the planned easing of restrictions in greater melbourne from thursday june 17 we may need to hold on the current settings for a little longer prof cheng said more exposure sites added a mcdonald s drive through multiple coles supermarkets and a woolworths are among the latest additions to victoria s long list of covid 19 exposure sites the state s health department made eight additions to the alerts list of venues visited by a confirmed case of covid 19 on thursday as melbourne s tough lockdown was lifted all of the new venues were listed as tier 2 exposure sites meaning people who visited during the times listed need to get tested and isolate until they receive a negative result see the full list here originally

sales reps took on an unprecedented workload during the past 16 months adapting to the needs of booksellers amid pressing demand for children s and ya titles all while working remotely the question of which pandemic era innovations are effective and which should go by the wayside is one that many are considering as they return to in person appointments in an industry that has undergone substantial change in a short period of time every single account is doing something just a little bit differently in terms of how they are buying how they are ordering and how they are paying attention to books says scholastic senior manager for field brand marketing nikki mutch in many ways mutch adds the diversity of approaches taken by booksellers has created opportunities for her to develop deeper relationships with stores for instance with buyers managers and owners pressed for time during the pandemic they have had to rely more on frontline booksellers mutch says for the first time those booksellers with approval from managers have been calling to talk about forthcoming titles which provides her with a better sense of what the employees who deal most frequently with customers are seeing and hearing they re the gatekeepers to the customer mutch notes they re the ones who recommend books to them they re the ones who stock the shelves and it is also coming from younger booksellers who i love to hear they have new ideas and their owners and booksellers are letting them run with those ideas it s been a very exciting thing to see with increased digital communication chronicle sales representative emily cervone says that remote sales calls are also here to stay i love my stores that are far away cervone says but sometimes i spend four hours in the car and the way that everything is on edelweiss now it s hard to want to drive for hours when you re going to talk to them for 40 minutes cervone believes that a generational divide among sales reps will have a lot to do with which publisher accounts go back to all in person meetings and which take a more hybrid approach there are a lot of old school traditional reps she says who are going to say i still need to go see this teeny tiny account in vermont but instead of driving cervone says she has been able to take the time she saves to prepare digital tools that enhance her conversations with booksellers for example french publisher twirl which is distributed by chronicle has highly interactive books that children s booksellers need to see but the cost of creating advance reader s copies is prohibitive instead twirl has created videos for its titles that cervone s customers can watch since cervone also handles much of the edelweiss catalog information for chronicle and its affiliates she embeds the videos in the edelweiss listings and goes through them with booksellers using the digital catalog as a guide for their meetings going forward she says i feel like you re going to see a lot more of that kind of marketing chesapeake hudson sales rep keith arsenault says social media has also been a new space for conversations with booksellers who post about books they re interested in he notes that it has been exciting to engage booksellers in what feels like a sustained and ongoing dialogue about books during a time when he could not see them face to face but he adds publishers will need to make print material available for in person sales calls especially for children s books and he worries that many publishers are moving away from providing them for children s books some of arsenault s biggest accounts still rely heavily on blads and f g s prior to the pandemic he would occasionally even leave his entire sales kit with a store in advance of a meeting so its buyers had time to review everything closely he worries that publishers will try to find short term cost savings by ceasing the production of advance print material but warns that it poses a real problem there s a lot of screen fatigue out there arsenault says and a lot of the buyers whom i ve talked to old and young are saying okay if i have to i will use the digital format but i am tired of staring at the screen and i really want to hold a book especially a picture book i want to be immersed in the text and see the interplay of the texts and the images and i don t get that from flipping through them on my laptop or my ipad as with mutch and cervone arsenault sees the coexistence of traditional and digital approaches as the way forward with careful consideration about how to balance them in the interest of getting new children s books into the hands of booksellers and ultimately young readers as he navigates the uncertainties that are likely to continue in the trade for some time arsenault s decisions are focused on using both approaches these kids are going to become the next generation of adults who are going to have kids he says you want to nurture their love of reading
kuala lumpur july 17 the ringgit is expected to trade at current levels next week and is poised to reach the 4 30 level against the us dollar should risk on sentiment hold and oil prices continue to decline according to a trader the lack of local positive catalysts coupled with the high number of covid 19 cases would dampen investors confidence and they may adopt a wait and see approach the trader explained on friday the ministry of health reported that new covid 19 cases declined to 12 541 compared with 13 215 infections the day before bringing the cumulative number of domestic cases to 893 323 meanwhile malaysian industrial development finance bhd research economist abdul mui zz norhalim said the ringgit is expected to be influenced by growth concerns as the market is expected to continue focussing on the covid 19 situation in malaysia advertisement furthermore we expect the ongoing talks about the quantitative easing tapering by the united states federal reserve could also affect the performance of emerging market currencies including the ringgit for now we believe the impact of the oil price movement on the ringgit will be rather limited because the market is focusing on near term growth outlook and changes in the global financial market he told bernama abdul mui zz however said any further movement in oil prices beyond the current level may provide some positive support to the ringgit at least from weakening further against the us dollar advertisement on a weekly basis the ringgit weakened versus the us dollar to 4 2040 2070 from 4 1895 1940 a week ago meanwhile the ringgit was lower against other major currencies against the singapore dollar the local unit depreciated to 3 1053 1078 from 3 0953 0991 a week earlier and fell against the british pound to 5 8129 8170 from 5 7798 7860 it also weakened against the euro to 4 9687 9723 from 4 9667 9720 in the preceding week and slipped vis a vis the japanese yen to 3 8180 8207 from 3 8076 8120 previously bernama
even as parts of the united states emerge from the covid 19 pandemic the retail outlook for children s booksellers remains unclear store browsing protocols are complicated by the fact that children under 12 are unvaccinated varied and inconsistent school reopening plans make fall planning a challenge author tours will likely remain digital through christmas but children s booksellers know that something extraordinary has happened too despite predictions of a pandemic induced retail apocalypse booksellers swiftly incorporated new tools learned novel skills deepened their engagement with readers and survived and in some cases thrived having adapted their businesses to the most extreme retail challenges in generations many are now taking stock of which pandemic era changes are here to stay pw caught up with four children s booksellers to see what postpandemic bookselling looks like to them some see their businesses being transformed by a few major shifts in how they work others see changes that affect every aspect of their businesses from the back office to the front door but all are certain that the ways they buy and sell children s books are not what they were a year and a half ago and never will be again shifting patterns new insights when in store events came to a halt at 4 kids books toys in zionsville ind owner cynthia compton filled the event space with books for teen readers a decision that reflects the strong sales to individual readers that made up for lost event sales she says that the effective decisions she has made since the pandemic began come down to one major shift brought on by the store s success with e commerce data is king compton says we re in communication with our customers way more we know much more about their buying habits we re crunching the numbers on who our top 200 customers are what they buy and what the categories are that turn we re just much more aware of what our sales look like and how to buy for it and how to sell to it the data led to major changes in the way compton runs her store which then led to new data that has helped her deepen her understanding of customer buying habits even more among the biggest changes she has made is the way she orders books from publishers prior to the pandemic she placed orders seasonally as almost all other booksellers do but the uncertainty of the pandemic meant that seasonal ordering was risky we needed to dial back and be more immediate about things and be able to respond to openings and closings compton recalls we weren t sure if we were going to stay open or stay closed or if it was going to go back and forth so we felt strongly that we needed to get away from the large seasonal order compton began placing monthly orders instead as the store s social media sales channels developed to market new releases that customers once learned about in store she found that thinking in terms of months created opportunities to develop marketing that was more responsive to readers preferences in a given moment than seasonal orders would allow in the process of shifting orders and marketing compton saw two changes in customer buying habits preorders dropped off which she believes is a reflection of competing digitally with other e tailers at the same time midlist sales grew substantially looking back compton says the midlist boost that came from shifting her ordering is entirely understandable when you cut down your ordering to a monthly basis and you re really only looking at the frontlist that s coming out in the next six weeks you re paying attention to a much smaller number of books and you re marketing differently rather than pitching a book ahead to your customers that s coming out three months from now you have the opportunity to talk about each and every title which likely is going to be midlist if it s not on one of the eight big days of the year when everybody has to publish their books all at the same time you have a chance to really focus on all of those different titles increased midlist sales reflect a growing readership especially among middle graders the pandemic was like fertilizer for middle grade sales compton says for her summer reading program alone a program with a substantial middle grade readership she saw a 30 rise in participation in 2020 compared with the previous year this year 1 800 readers are participating which is a rise of another 18 the slow return to something that resembles pre pandemic business does not mean that compton is prepared to drop the methods that have given her so much new insight into her customers reading interests for the foreseeable future she is planning a hybrid approach of the new and the old she will continue to buy on a monthly basis except for the holiday season when advance ordering is crucial for having stock on hand her only exceptions will be for major releases and books from smaller publishers to ensure they know she is committed to them in the long term since she knows that the advance notice is helpful for their sales projections i am writing to them for the full season just to say you re important we re going to keep buying from you and you can know to have this many copies in your pending list she says gaining new e space in 2017 peter glassman opened a second location of books of wonder his children s bookstore near union square in manhattan on the upper west side having a second store gave us a little more clout with publishers and more options for events glassman says it gave publishers just a little more reach for events throughout the city but unlike his store s flagship location which draws a loyal and longtime clientele the west 84th street store was vulnerable during the pandemic the store shuttered from march to july 2020 when it did reopen it was the only retail store on the block to do so gamestop closed on the corner nearby the amc movie theater across the street remained closed then the building changed hands and at the end of june glassman closed the store permanently while he sought out new locations yet despite the loss of a major events venue glassman is sanguine about his experience in part because the pandemic also created conditions where he could solve a preexisting problem for the store for years he has scrambled to find large venues for hosting author events that draw sizable crowds in new york city cost and space availability both posed significant challenges while some stores struggled to move their events online glassman realized that virtual events could eliminate the need for large venues while engaging the large base of customers around the world who have visited the store on trips to new york city at the same time authors who might visit the city infrequently but want to support the store could join from anywhere over the past year glassman has tested the idea the store had just completed a website overhaul prior to the pandemic which helped optimize the sale of signed editions while it was closed to in person traffic glassman added the online events platform crowdcast for hosting readings and began scheduling events in the past year he has hosted virtual author events with audiences of more than 1 000 attendees and equally high book sales among them were events for rick riordan and kwame mbalia who appeared together in conversation for the launch of riordan s the trials of apollo last october and tui t sutherland who had the launch for her 14th wings of fire title the dangerous gift this march along with reducing the cost of hosting events and reaching a broader audience glassman has also been able to feature authors who otherwise might not have made their way to new york for the launch of the other side of the sky in september 2020 coauthors amie kaufman and meagan spooner joined the event from australia and washington d c respectively events for fall 2021 will almost certainly continue to be virtual to some degree and glassman says he is excited to keep using the system he s established while incorporating some aspects of pre pandemic in person events multi author events are more successful than single author ones he says and weekend events are easier for parents to watch with their kids than those on weekdays in september glassman will host a large event for the release of brian selznick s kaleidoscope scholastic and he is fully prepared to host it online but he is already looking past the pandemic and envisioning hybrid events hosted in the bookstore with a live audience and streaming to viewers through crowdcast having sold books for 45 years he says he is always thinking about ways to reach more readers while ensuring the long term stability of his store the fact of the matter is no matter how long we do this for he says we re never going to reach as many of the kids as we want to but with a new way to host events he is able to reach more than ever before burnout and breakthroughs with the pandemic the protests and a presidential election last year the washington d c area was a study in burnout at barston s child s play book buyer molly gilroy olivo saw firsthand how these overwhelming events led to positive change but also felt that a postpandemic world could not come soon enough much of what she encountered involved the store s close working relationship with public schools for summer reading list orders and school book fairs the rise in e commerce at the beginning of the pandemic put the store s reliance on shopify to the test uploading title information was labor intensive and creating lists was difficult especially for virtual book fairs the front end labor was high olivo says and the payoff was questionable out of five virtual book fairs only one went well olivo quickly learned that the digital format fundamentally changed what the fairs were for kids and their parents a book fair is an exciting event she says everyone gets to go you get to shop around and you get to tell your friends which books you re reading but when the events were solely online they felt more like an obligatory ask for money to support the school at a time when people were already under pressure barston s will return to in school book fairs when it can but olivo says the virtual experience was not a loss in the long run when fairs resume the store plans to offer a digital component even when in school options are available too barston s ability to provide e commerce sales and support is the result of two new hires who are off site digital marketing and online sales support staff the new positions reflect the store s streamlining of systems and operations overall prior to the pandemic olivo says each of the store s three locations had varied approaches to the workflow issues in a given day in a multi location business that operates with really strong managers we end up in situations where we re all kind of operating very independently most of the time she notes throughout the year the staff steadily abandoned different approaches in favor of universal ones group chats are used for broad communication while shared documents guide universal processes it s something we ve gotten significantly more efficient about she adds by the end of this school year the increased bandwidth created by the new systems and hires allowed olivo to take a more active role in developing orders for school accounts at a moment when teachers and librarians were running out of energy many schools turned to barston s to place orders for the end of the fiscal year and to support summer reading but school personnel were also less able to develop the reading lists themselves for the first time they asked olivo to do much of the work and she was able to with one school she developed a list of 127 children s books that reflected the diversity of the region s student body only four titles were authored by white men i was really excited olivo says from a bookseller perspective being able to say that i m getting to influence the amazing potential diversity that these kids are going to read all summer that part is really great she is uncertain whether she ll continue to play that role after the pandemic but she hopes she will it was a covid 19 byproduct the school gave us a little more leeway and said we trust you cementing social media within weeks of the emergence of covid 19 in the u s the booksellers at the novel neighbor in st louis mo knew they would need to improve the store s social media if they wanted to reach readers we had been talking about trying to get into tiktok but no one here knew anything about how to do it says children s buyer and event coordinator melissa posten then a résumé arrived in her inbox at first posten was confused by it kassie king had moved home to st louis after working in los angeles and on capitol hill but she did not seem to have bookselling experience then posten learned that as a kid king had been a booktuber she s obsessed with books posten says during her first month as social media and marketing manager at the store king made a booktok for a novel titled honey girl and it went viral garnering half a million views boosting the store s followers to 20 000 and resulting in nearly 100 copies sold that was just the beginning in the year since the novel neighbor has come together in support of king s social media work learning which platforms are best for certain titles and tailoring content to each when the bookstore staff accidentally told booktok viewers that the trade edition jacket of rachel griffin s ya novel the nature of witches was a special edition cover king followed up with a video joking about their mistake the humorous approach paid off and the store sold 80 copies posten says she and king have learned that ya sells well on tiktok instagram is good for parents of young children facebook adds on grandparents and twitter is the place for reaching educators she is seeing the same trends that compton observed at 4 kids books toys including the rise of interest in midlist titles on social media for the posts she says we use new releases that are not the big splashy titles taylor jenkins reid does not need any more publicity everybody knows the new wimpy kid book is coming we want to try to get people excited about other new titles and i think at least it s helping us sell midlist in addition posten has seen a boost in paperback backlist sales with readers sometimes coming into the store and buying entire series at once someone will just come in and say i saw this stuart gibbs book on your social media i ll just take the whole series she notes it s very low tech posten says of social media marketing you don t have to have video editing software you don t have to learn how to use imovie or anything like that as long as you can figure out how to use tiktok and frankly there are a billion videos out there showing you how if you don t have a kassie like we do instead of the past 16 months leading to bookstore closings stores like the novel neighbor have expanded their reach while improving the services they offer customers all of it means a more stable business that can weather the uncertainty of the current stage of the pandemic and last well into the future now we re everywhere posten says we re on twitter we re on instagram we re on facebook especially during the last four to five months when stuff was opening a little bit and people were unsure about coming in it was a way to keep our at home customers engaged with the bookstore and now that we ve sent these orders out all across the country we have a slightly more national audience that we re also reaching out to return to the main feature
a year before the american revolution dr samuel johnson wrote a letter to the bishop of killaloe in which he remarked the irish are a fair people they never speak well of one another this clever characterization or caricature if you like may rub you the wrong way but you will recognize in it a small germ of truth namely the social habit the irish themselves call begrudgery you may even mourn the passing of such bold forthrightness as dr johnson could display so blithely so long ago for under the powerful influence of political correctness it has become unthinkable in respectable circles to engage in any form of group characterization that patently unfair verbal net by which all members of a particular ethnic racial or religious group are made to wear the same costume of loud unsubtle colors by which all poles are made to appear stupid all jews grasping all african americans hapless truth to tell such characterization however clever tends to limit and confine at best and at its worst it is a principal tool of unreflective bigotry nonetheless let us examine that elusive phenomenon called the irish character surely there is no one for whom that phrase does not summon up a rush of spontaneous images of parents and grandparents aunts and uncles even tales of distant forebears so the phrase must mean something specific or suggest a cluster of specific qualities even if these are awfully hard to articulate though i shall be engaging in characterization i hope to avoid caricature nor do i bank on your speaking well of me when i m done i d like to concentrate on the observations of two men one a sixteenth century englishman the other a twentieth century american neither of them irish in even the most diluted sense but each for me at least was able to describe what i would dare call the essence of irishness the first man is edmund campion born in 1540 the son of a london bookseller at fifteen he went to oxford university on scholarship and was made a fellow of st john s college two years later when he was but seventeen his brilliance attracted the attention of many of the leading figures of his day including queen elizabeth at twenty four he was ordained deacon in the anglican church but a sojourn in ireland where he had the leisure to study theological issues convinced him to return to the catholicism of his boyhood he fled to the continent joined the jesuits and was ordained a priest at prague where he taught in 1580 he became one of the first two jesuits chosen to return to england to minister in secret to catholics in a country where catholicism was now illegal thanks in part to a bullheaded pope who had taken the unnecessary step of formally excommunicating the queen and absolving her subjects from all allegiance a papal action directly responsible for the subsequent state persecution of catholics throughout britain and ireland a year after arriving in england campion was captured tortured horribly hanged drawn and quartered three hundred and eighty nine years later he was declared a saint but it is campion s sojourn in ireland that interests us here he was much taken with the irish whom he found to be markedly different in temperament from the english campion wrote a prose of such delighted expansiveness that he can be compared favorably with his younger contemporary william shakespeare and like shakespeare and every englishman of his day he spoke his native tongue with what would sound to us to be an irish accent as you hear campion describe the irish of more than four centuries ago i ask you to compare what he says to what you know of irish friends and relatives long gone and even to living irish people of our own moment the people are thus inclined wrote edmund campion religious franke amorous irefull sufferable of paines infinite very glorious many sorcerers excellent horsemen delighted with warres great almsgivers passing in hospitalitie they are sharpe witted lovers of learning capable of any studie whereunto they bend themselves constant in travaile adventurous intractable kind hearted secret in displeasure well is it any exaggeration to say that whatever may be the case with other ethnic groups the irish will never change the second observer i would bring to your attention is the great american defense attorney of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries clarence darrow darrow s adult life was spent defending the defenseless people such as the labor leader eugene debs who had dared organize a strike against the all powerful railroad barons the mcnamara brothers who were accused of dynamiting the los angeles times and j t scopes a tennessee teacher who had dared instruct his students about evolution darrow called himself attorney for the damned in 1936 two years before his death he wrote an article for esquire magazine entitled how to pick a jury darrow was by anyone s standards an outspoken man but as a lawyer his lack of equivocation seems almost unparalleled of course he cannot resist telling us who he would not pick to be on the jury if a presbyterian enters the jury box and carefully rolls up his umbrella and calmly and critically sits down let him go he is cold as the grave he knows right from wrong although he seldom finds anything right he believes in john calvin and eternal punishment get rid of him with the fewest possible words before he contaminates the others unless you and your clients are presbyterians you probably are a bad lot and even though you may be a presbyterian your client most likely is guilty if possible the baptists are more hopeless than the presbyterians they too are apt to think that the real home of all outsiders is sheol and you do not want them on the jury and the sooner they leave the better beware of the lutherans especially the scandinavians they are almost always sure to convict either a lutheran or a scandinavian is unsafe but if both in one plead your client guilty and go down the docket i humbly beg the pardon of my friends who are presbyterian baptist lutheran and or scandinavian and rush to remind them that it is not i who am talking but clarence darrow the great american defense attorney but now we come to the passage i have promised an irishman is called into the box for examination there is no reason for asking about his religion he is irish that is enough we may not agree with his religion but it matters not his feelings go deeper than any religion you should be aware that he is emotional kindly and sympathetic if he is chosen as a juror his imagination will place him in the dock really he is trying himself you would be guilty of malpractice if you got rid of him nearly four centuries separate clarence darrow s observations from those of edmund campion the irish of edmund campion s day were living in difficult times to be sure but his observations were made before the seventeenth century which became the century of persecutions long before the eighteenth century which became the century of the exclusion of the irish from all forms of economic life long long before the nineteenth century which became the century of death the century of the great famine and the death ships there is a buoyancy in campion s description that is absent from or at least muted in darrow s description the irish of darrow s day were no longer the excellent horsemen delighted with warres that they d been in the sixteenth century they had been prohibited by the anti catholic penal laws of the eighteenth century from owning a horse worth more than five pounds then in the nineteenth century they had lost everything including their amorousness which was beaten away by priests who had to be educated abroad where they became infected with the joyless spirit of jansenism the catholic form of calvinism even campion had guessed that the irish were capable of suffering paines infinite but to my eye and ear at least this is not simply a story of loss it is also a story of growth yes the irish had lost everything everything countable in the material world but their imaginations always spectacular had grown only larger so that now they could feel the pain of others and put themselves imaginatively into others shoes the kindhearted generosity that campion admired had also grown larger into a singular sympathy for those in need for those in the dock for all those whom polite society has damned in our time nearly seventy years after clarence darrow wrote his article many things have continued to change not least the economic position of ireland though no one should wish to turn back the clock it remains to be seen whether young irish people can continue to cherish the old sensibility in a time of unprecedented prosperity certainly some of their prosperous irish american cousins seem to have misplaced the singular sympathy the kindhearted generosity that makes an irishman an irishman some have even joined the republican party whereas irish imagination was never limited to the here and now to stocks and bonds and profit and loss there are irish americans who recently imagined they had beheld something called a compassionate conservative a creature of rhetoric more rare than a unicom but setting controversy aside i would prefer to leave you with an image the ancient image of cathleen ni houlihan the beautiful woman who for the dispossessed poets of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries represented ireland few can see her beauty because she is penniless beaten down and dressed in rags but true irishmen recognize her for who she is they can discern the delicacy of her face smiling through tears they can spot the harp in her hands primeval symbol of sympathy and feeling and on her head they see the crown the golden crown that tells the world that despite her tribulations and her centuries of pain her soul is still her own

by sarah anderson during the pandemic low wage workers have lost income jobs and lives and yet many of the nation s top tier corporations have been fixated on protecting their wealthy ceos even bending their own rules to pump up executive paychecks a new institute for policy studies report finds that 51 of the country s 100 largest low wage employers moved bonus goalposts or made other rule changes in 2020 to give their ceos 29 percent average raises while their frontline employees made 2 percent less among these 51 rule rigging companies average ceo compensation was 15 3 million in 2020 while median worker pay was 28 187 on average the average ceo worker pay ratio 830 to 1 how exactly did these companies rig their ceo pay rules let s look at a few examples hilton ceo christopher nassetta had the largest paycheck among the rule rigging companies after he failed to meet the goals associated with his multi year stock awards the board modified the awards by disregarding poor 2020 financial results and changing the performance metrics those maneuvers inflated his total compensation to 56 million 1 953 times as much as the company s median worker pay of 28 608 in 2020 at yum brands the owner of kfc pizza hut and taco bell ceo david gibbs garnered positive media coverage by donating 900 000 of his salary to pay for 1 000 bonuses for restaurant general managers but the board changed its bonus metrics to give gibbs a special cash bonus and stock grant worth more than 2 5 times his voluntary salary cut this largesse boosted gibbs s total compensation to 14 6 million 1 286 times as much as median worker pay of 11 377 the fast food giant did not offer hazard pay to these frontline employees whose average wages are just 9 75 per hour according to payscale don t like ads become a supporter and enjoy the good men project ad free at coca cola none of the top executives met their bonus targets last year either but the company board used discretion to give them all bonuses anyway for ceo james quincey that 960 000 bonus combined with new stock based awards drove his total compensation package above 18 million over 1 600 times as much as the company s typical worker pay in december 2020 coca cola announced plans to cut about 2 200 jobs or 17 percent of its workforce about 1 200 of the layoffs will hit u s workers how did corporations justify such extreme disparity in a year of extraordinary hardship for workers the most common defense was the talent retention argument in a report filed with the sec for example hilton explained that the projected zero payouts on the ceo s performance stock awards would ve impaired the awards ability to retain key talent this is the great man theory one heroic individual in the corner office almost single handedly creates company value so pay him whatever it takes to prevent him from abandoning ship the notion that one ceo is worth hundreds if not thousands of times more than their workers has always been absurd but in the middle of a pandemic crisis when frontlines employees are demonstrating just how essential they are to our economy and health it s even more preposterous so what can we do about it one bill pending in congress the tax excessive ceo pay act would use tax policy to incentivize corporations to narrow their pay divides by reining in executive compensation and lifting up worker wages under this proposal companies with pay gaps between their highest paid executive and median worker of less than 50 to 1 would not owe an extra dime corporations that refuse to narrow their gaps below this threshold would face graduated rate increases starting at 0 5 percentage points on ratios of more than 50 to 1 and topping out at 5 0 percentage points for companies with gaps above 500 to 1 the tax excessive ceo pay act would generate an estimated 150 billion over 10 years that could be used to create good jobs and meet human needs if the bill had been in place in 2020 walmart with a pay gap of 1 078 to 1 would have owed an extra 1 billion in federal taxes enough to fund 13 502 clean energy jobs for a year amazon with a 1 596 to 1 pay ratio also would have owed an extra 1 billion enough to underwrite 115 089 public housing units for a year amazon s highest paid exec last year was worldwide consumer ceo david clark with 46 3 million home depot with a 511 to 1 gap would have owed an extra 800 million enough to create 18 329 jobs that pay 15 per hour with benefits for a year it s time for public policy to shift corporate america away from a business model that creates obscene wealth for a few at the top and economic insecurity for so many of the rest of us by inflating executive compensation while their workers struggled during a pandemic corporate boards have just strengthened the case for tax penalties on huge ceo worker pay gaps sarah anderson directs the global economy project at the institute for policy studies and is the lead author of the new report

that it is now my pleasure to introduce kansas city southern s president and ceo pat ottensmeyer patrick j ottensmeyer president and chief executive officer okay thank you ashley and good morning everyone thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2021 earnings presentation i ll start on slide 4 we re going to change this format a bit this morning and mike upchurch and i will go through a brief presentation i m told that this is a record for us in terms of brevity of our formal remarks but given the assumption that there will likely be a lot of questions related to matters other than our quarterly earnings we re going to change the format go through the prepared material fairly quickly and expand the time for q a the only other comment that i ll make on this slide is we have included adam godderz adam is our chief legal officer given the fact that we have a proxy statement out and shareholders meeting set for august 19 ask adam to join us in the event if there are any technical or specific questions related to that moving on to slide 5 i m going to start with three slides just to touch on and speak about the proposed merger with canadian national obviously most of you have heard this before but given the timeline for events going forward specifically the ksu special stockholders meeting which is now set for august 19 i wanted to spend just a few minutes and reiterate some of the more significant characteristics and benefits of this transaction so again just looking at some of the highlighted comments here on this slide we believe this is a pro competitive deal and will deliver more choices more single line service options to shippers than exist currently there has been a commitment to keep all gateways open on commercially reasonable terms and provide greater price transparency specifically through rule 11 rates to those gateways to satisfy any potential competitive concerns that might arise this merger this combination is driven by growth and the opportunity for growth across north america it is not a combination that is focused on consolidation or eliminating options or facilities it is all about growth and as you see in some of the appendix material we have been blessed with a very strong and widespread support for the merger over 1 700 close to 1 800 letters now supporting the transaction we are confident that the voting trust that we are proposing to meet the stb requirement for installation from control and the public interest requirements and specifically the financial viability of both canadian national and kcs during the voting trust period moving on to slide 6 this is a very brief timeline path to completion you can see the first items on the left are completed the next milestone as i mentioned a few minutes ago is the august 19 special meeting of kansas city southern s stockholders and the proxy material has been circulated we will fall back and refer to that proxy statement on a number of questions and we ll be happy to explain anything that s in that proxy further as far as other milestones these are really expectations as you know the surface transportation board will take whatever time they need and we respect that requirement as far as the completion of their review and a determination regarding the voting trust our expectation is that that will come in the second half of this year and then beyond that again it is our expectation that a decision on the merger would be the second half of 2022 and of course the voting trust would remain in place until we have full stb approval and then wrapping up the merger discussion on slide 7 just reiterating again this combination is pro competitive and we believe will yield significant public benefits some of those benefits are stated on this slide i won t read them and then importantly the cn kcs filings on july 6 in response to public comments and an opposition to the merger we think are very strong and powerful and are available on our website as well as the website for our transaction which is connectedcontinent com and the voting trust approval which is the stage that we re in now we are very confident that the voting trust satisfies the requirements for independent and in public interest and the financial viability of both cn and kcs during the voting trust period is assured moving on just now to a few slides on the quarter second quarter revenue increased by 37 from the previous year gross ton miles up 30 volumes up 21 sorry 31 obviously the headline here is easy comps as a result of the covid collapse in business that occurred in the second quarter of 2020 our results were clouded by the accounting treatment of the 700 million termination fee for the canadian pacific transaction mike upchurch will get into some of those details later i would like to draw your attention for purposes of our really representation of our underlying performance to the adjusted numbers shown on this slide second quarter adjusted operating ratio of 61 4 which was a 380 basis point improvement versus last year and adjusted diluted earnings per share of 2 06 which was a 79 improvement from last year again on an adjusted basis moving on to slide 9 our outlook there are a couple of changes to this slide from what you saw in january and april revenue growth we are confirming our guidance from previous quarters of double digit revenue growth in 2021 for the full year operating ratio we are changing our full year operating ratio guidance to about 60 approximately 60 for the full year that is revised from 57 5 guidance that we had provided earlier the headlines to that revision are a number of factors that you all are very aware of in general the chip shortages that have affected the auto industry and certainly our automotive business that has been affected by that as evidences recently as earlier this week we have been informed of three new planned plant outages in mexico mike naatz is here to answer any questions about adding greater detail but as you all know that chip shortage that s really plagued many industries across north america has been a bit of a moving target and difficult to predict how long that s going to last in addition to that in our case there have been disruptions in the flow of refined products into mexico due to some regulatory developments and other factors that are more unique to kansas city southern that have affected both our performance and our outlook for the full year those developments have created some additional congestion in addition to other factors so there is a bit of an increase in congestion related costs and then in addition to those factors the extended impact on the expense side of our business related to the polar vortex and other delayed plant openings all contribute to our revised guidance here in operating ratio for the full year and mike upchurch will provide more color regarding the path to our 2022 guidance in a few minutes earnings per share we have made a slight revision to our guidance there for the full year at approximately 9 a share in 2021 versus in the prior two quarters our guidance was greater than 9 a share so a slight revision to that guide and then beyond that our longer term eps guidance as well as our capital expenditure and free cash flow guidance remains unchanged from the previous two quarters moving on to slide 10 key operating metrics which this chart had a little more green on it but again there is some explanations to go behind the numbers looking at train velocity and terminal dwell those numbers are considerably below and worse than a year ago for the second quarter but remember what had happened a year ago with the rapid downturn in business volumes during the second quarter of 2020 a good way to think of that is there weren t many cars on the freeway at this time last year so our speed and our dwell were at very high levels this year our volumes recovered and we had other issues to deal with including some of the weather related issues and the regulatory developments in refined products that i mentioned a couple of minutes ago so our network was much busier and these statistics reflect a combination of those factors in the second quarter of 2020 i ll draw your attention to the four boxes in yellow at the bottom of this page that are highlighted and these are some of the things that we have done intentionally to support the service recovery as well as the increase in volume and outlook that we have for the rest of the year we have proactively brought additional power online leading to a 39 increase in active locomotives we have also proactively added crew starts and hired additional crews in the transportation and mechanical areas leading to the year over year headcount increases that you see on this slide again all of this is to support our service recovery and to be prepared for volume growth we see for the rest of the year and beyond and then finally on slide 11 you can see the impact that some of those moves have resulted in in terms of the additional resources and other initiatives and the impact they re having on our most recent velocity and dwell trends which are very encouraging i called out a number of things on this slide including the monterrey team engagement effort and the sanchez team engagement effort i would encourage someone to ask a question of john orr later about what s behind that and some of the things that we are doing and john and his team are doing to really heighten the focus and accountability on our performance measures a lot of those are built around infrastructure and aligning processes org structures and resources for a more precise service delivery product so with that i will turn the presentation over to mike upchurch michael w upchurch executive vice president chief financial officer thanks pat and good morning everyone i m going to start my comments on the quarter here i ll cover revenue and volumes in a little bit more detail on the next slide but you can see revenue grew 37 on 31 volume growth our reported operating ratio of 157 6 does include 721 million of merger cost we incurred during the second quarter including the break fee of 700 million we paid when we officially terminated the merger agreement with canadian pacific on may 21 as you might remember cn paid us 700 million to reimburse us for this break fee but because there are certain potential repayment obligations we have recorded the cn reimbursement as a liability on the balance sheet once shareholders vote for the merger the break fee received from cn will no longer be reimbursable and accordingly we would record to income the 700 million reimbursement effectively offsetting the break fee that we paid to cp in the second quarter so you have the expense in the second quarter the offsetting income we would expect to be recorded in the third quarter and as pat mentioned our shareholder vote is currently august 19 excluding merger cost adjusted or was 61 4 a 380 basis point improvement over prior year we did incur several headwinds during the quarter which i will discuss in more detail on the expense slide but generally included an approximately 200 basis point headwind from network congestion including higher overtime and recrews car hire increases from elongated cycle times and incremental costs from resources we put in place to improve our service and support our future growth we also recorded 120 basis point one time non recurring contract dispute during the quarter our reported diluted eps was a loss of 4 17 however adjusted for fx and the previously mentioned merger cost our adjusted diluted earnings per share was 2 06 up 79 from a year ago and then finally we had about a 40 basis point headwind from fuel surcharge lag where price increases create a negative lag before we can recover those in our fuel surcharge so turning to the next slide let me cover revenue revenue for the quarter was up 37 on a volume increase of 31 excluding fuel prices and foreign exchange revenue was up 30 all business segments saw a year over year volume and revenue growth and let me address the negative mix you see in the revenue per unit table on the top right of this slide we did see core pricing gains in the quarter however lower revenue per unit segments like energy saw growth rates creating higher growth rates creating some negative mix in the quarter we ve been very pleased with the revenue growth so far this year and our results continue to be on track with our guidance established earlier this year despite what happened with the polar vortex in the first quarter the auto chip shortage that has severely impacted auto production across the entire globe and increased regulations in mexico related to the importation of refined products our franchise has shown remarkable resiliency despite some of these exogenous factors that have suppressed some of our growth potential but again we expect to lead the industry and volume growth during 2q cross border volumes grew 42 and revenues 53 star performers for us in cross border was intermodal growth revenue at 49 and mexican energy reform grew 121 core pricing and contract renewals were essentially in line with the first quarter but we are clearly seeing inflationary pressures that will need to be addressed going forward as we look into the back half of 21 we would expect the auto chip shortage to continue to negatively impact our growth with a strong bounce back late in the year and into 22 as auto demand continues to be extremely high and dealer inventories at all time lows we also began shipping western canadian crude into the new port arthur crude terminal in the second half of july and we would expect that terminal will gradually ramp up whereby we will be moving approximately 15 to 20 trains per month by the end of the third quarter so a fairly rapid acceleration of volumes turning to expenses on the next slide adjusted operating expenses increased 29 some of that s due to comps relating to the pandemic from a year ago as we saw significantly higher volumes but we also saw higher fuel prices foreign exchange impact and significant cost increases as a result of network congestion as pat mentioned we re clearly not operating as well as we expect and saw productivity declined during the quarter as we in service new locomotives and added headcount to stabilize our service and prepare for what we believe to be substantial increases in volume starting here in the third quarter key expense drivers were fuel expense increased 19 13 million from volume and gtm increases 16 million increase to expense from foreign exchange which of course is largely offset in revenue 10 million from higher overtime and higher recrews as we deployed additional transportation resources to stabilize service headcount declined 1 year over year but grew 2 sequentially still well below the 5 sequential volume increase that we saw from 1q to 2q we also had a 9 million expense from one time contract dispute 6 million increase in materials and parts due to a larger locomotive fleet and the gtm growth that we saw year over year 6 million in increased equipment rents which is split roughly equally due to volume and car cycle times 6 million from wage and benefit inflation and 4 million from higher year over year incentive comp due to the fact that we greatly reduced our incentive comp expense during the pandemic in 2q a year ago as we look into the second half we do expect better productivity and we will be extremely focused on better execution of the psr principles sameh has installed at kcs over the past two years as a reminder we have successfully reduced expenses by an annual run rate of approximately 150 million going into 2022 as a result of these psr initiatives and continue to target 250 million run rate now by 2023 one cost increase to inform you about in the second half of 2021 and we ve discussed this at length in prior quarters but we do not expect an approximate 8 million of incremental compensation expense related to the profit sharing from the passage of labor reform in mexico however going into 2022 we would expect any expense increases associated with the new labor law to be negligible so let me wrap up with a little perspective on our outlook for the rest of the year and 2022 we expect the demand environment to hold up quite well as key macroeconomic factors feedback from our customers and new business opportunities continue to give us confidence in delivering superior growth and that s despite all the challenges around the vortex and chip issues etc that we ve mentioned during the first half of the year we had a couple of challenges but essentially are on plan on guidance with what we ve provided early in the year and we think that that revenue outlook is certainly supportive of some of the supply chain challenges we re seeing across the board and pent up demand that s being built for vehicles appliances household goods and a variety of raw materials as we look at a variety of economic factors going into the rest of the year and into 2022 we really believe we re going to see tremendous top line growth that we think going into 22 will allow us to deliver somewhere in the range of 150 to 200 basis point improvement to the operating ratio and then turning to the cost side we can clearly execute better than we have and consistent with our psr success in 2019 and 2020 we recently deployed some incremental resources namely locomotives and transportation fte to improve our network fluidity and prepare for continued growth in our business this improvement in congestion plus favorable expense comparisons relative to the unplanned cost around the mexican labor reform and the one time contract dispute that i mentioned should allow us to achieve another 150 to 200 basis points of or improvement so collectively you ll see our guide continues to believe we ve got some substantial opportunities to improve operating ratio so with that i will turn the call back to pat for final remarks patrick j ottensmeyer president and chief executive officer okay just a couple of comments before we open the line up for questions we ve got the as i mentioned the entire executive team here happy to answer any questions about our performance our outlook for business our outlook for operating efficiencies and those types of questions ashley advises me that we get a lot of questions about additional details background and other things that we will not be able to answer the proxy statement is available and while we are happy to provide any clarification on certain things in the proxy leading us to the shareholder vote but a lot of questions that i know are out there we re just going to rely on the proxy disclosures that s out there so you might want to steer away from those kinds of questions if you only have limited time and then in that vein as well i know there s a lot of question about the likelihood of various outcomes and responses from the stb we will also not be in a position to answer those questions as i said our expectations are that the stb will reach a decision in the second half of this year but as i also mentioned the stb will take whatever time they deem is necessary to make a full evaluation before making that decision and we re just not going to speculate on timing or outcomes beyond that so with those sort of warnings i suppose we ll happy to answer open the line up for questions questions and answers operator our first question comes from jon chappell from evercore isi please go ahead jonathan chappell evercore isi analyst thank you good morning everybody patrick j ottensmeyer president and chief executive officer good morning jonathan chappell evercore isi analyst maybe this doesn t matter in a month based on what the stb says but if i can focus on the fundamentals in the operations a little bit here and maybe at pat s encouragement i ll go to john orr first there is a lot of optimism about the back half of the year in the guidance i mean to get to the or number for the full year you need about 300 basis points improvement to get to the eps number you need 5 after 4 in the first half of the year yet there is a lot of challenges still out there whether it s the planned outages of the auto plants in mexico the reduction of flows in the mexico the refined products maybe speak to us a little bit about the exit rate of some of your kpis and your service metrics that gives you the confidence that you ll have that fluidity and that service to be able to meet these kinds of lofty financial expectations for the second half of the year john orr executive vice president operations yeah thank you you re absolutely right we have a lot of momentum and we have a lot of challenges but this team is certainly up to those challenges i guess there is a couple of fronts first and foremost is the field activity and the engagement in the field and second is the network structure that and the organizational structure that s better aligned for process improvement and asset management and accountability and that s what supports the effectiveness of our service the use of our plant and the plan itself and so as part of that we have gone through a network reorganization with our network vice president both accountable for the plan development and the plan execution and we ve in that we ve improved our service visibility and awareness at all levels including the new delivery of asset levers that we can now see in order to create more resiliency and more precise fit for both our capacity and our resources so it s sort of the it s the architecture that we ve developed underneath our service plan to support it and create a balance of strategic and tactical deployment of assets the velocity is one of the key drivers that everyone on the team whether it s mike naatz sameh fahmy or myself really focusing on a daily basis and that willingness to get into the weeds and drive performance with the team is showing the results and if you look at where we see network performance improving and the impacts of the initiatives that are taking hold our velocity is improving in fact our velocity today is in line with the three to four year average taking the outlier of the comp of covid the covid year out of the equation u s is recovering at a quicker pace we are very comfortable with where the pace is and the path we re on and i see that returning to close to the challenging number of a covid target through q3 mexico velocity is showing the right trends we still have some headwinds with covid recovery not being as complete as it is in the u s so we still deal with those realities today but with the initiatives that we focused in monterrey and sanchez where we brought our team engagement to bear where it wasn t we take an integrated multi functional team to decongest significant yards like monterrey which is primarily service yard so that we can implement our view implement better customer service and the effectiveness and not only do we roll up our sleeves and work 24 hours a day seven days a week to create a better plan and create better visibility but we re also addressing the skills development of the local teams and the network support to build the organizational structure and create that better asset alignment and service visibility and it comes down to the accountability that we re driving across all of our departments in the case of monterrey and sanchez the heightened focus created more fluidity it created more search resilience and these are again key service areas that really drive how mexico goes and drives our ability to cross border one of the key indices that i really looked at was our grain performance because it is really an end to end market for us so a market segment that has hand offs with other railways it spans most of the length of our network and it has a really good sense of what our end to end supply chain capability looks like and those numbers for grain in the last two months have picked up tremendously and we re closing in on some record performance and even benchmarking against some of the best times from a capacity and fluidity perspective so i would say it s the reorganization and the architecture that supports growth it is the heightened accountability and visibility and leading indicators it is support and education of our frontline and entire management staff and at the same time we are underpinning everything with our safety values and our customer service values so that s what gives me a lot of confidence that we re on the right path and the leading indicators that we look at every day are pointing in that direction patrick j ottensmeyer president and chief executive officer hey jon just real quickly i mean clearly we have an assumption here we re going to work our way out of some of the congestion and lower our operating costs but don t forget that first half of the year was pretty challenging with polar vortex and gip issues and we re still sticking with our guidance for the full year on the top line implying that we re going to have a really terrific back half of the year from a revenue perspective including new business from this port arthur crude terminal so that top line is certainly going to help significantly here jonathan chappell evercore isi analyst right super helpful answer john i almost feel bad asking a follow up but i know anyone else on this call would ask one so mike since i have you you guys have been talking about the refined product opportunity to mexico and the huge numbers you put around it for quarter upon quarter but now we have this new regulatory issue and some of the congestion it s causing is there any way to frame either the lost revenue or the cost impact of this of these regulatory issues in new mexico and also kind of the duration of following you take this loss michael w upchurch executive vice president chief financial officer i think it s a temporary situation jon let me kind of back up to the macro environment here the bottom line is two thirds of mexico s demand has to be imported and most of that s coming from the u s and there is nobody better positioned than kcs to bring that from the u s gulf coast into mexico so that gives us a lot of confidence that this is still a great business for us in fact when we look at the share data third party s share of importation of total demand has actually increased from high teens to 25 this year so there is more product being shipped by companies like kcs and i think what s happening here we ve got kind of half of our business in unit trains half of it in manifest it s the manifest side of this that the government is doing a little more sampling to make sure that products are getting labeled properly and it s created a little bit of a backlog but just here recently we cleared up a lot of that backlog working with the regulators down in mexico and the demand dynamics are such that we think this is going to continue to be a really good business for us so maybe just a short term dislocation versus any kind of permanent impact to that business for us jonathan chappell evercore isi analyst got it thank you mike thanks john operator the next question comes from amit mehrotra from deutsche bank please go ahead amit mehrotra deutsche bank analyst hey thanks operator hi everybody pat i just there s obviously a lot of headlines in the rail sector last couple of weeks around regulatory and the biden executive order wondering what you can talk about that i mean they obviously mentioned consolidation not specifically at least but then also the idea of reciprocal switching you ve obviously had a time to think about it and what the impact is to your business and the industry as a whole wondering if you can comment at all in terms of what you think the implications are if any patrick j ottensmeyer president and chief executive officer i ll do my best but it s really sort of unclear and if you think back last week we had a headline based upon a rumor that came out a day before the executive order which was pretty shocking to everyone and then when we saw the details in the executive order i think people will calmed down quite a bit one thing to remember and i m actually looking at the executive order here as i m answering your question and i ve highlighted a few things here this is literally a guidance to the stb the executive order includes language like the chair of the surface transportation board is encouraged to work with the rest of the board to do the following consider rule making on reciprocal switching consider rule making on other relevant matters of competitive access and then jumping ahead specifically to mergers in the process of determining whether a merger acquisition or other transaction involving rail carriers is consistent with the public interest and to consider fulfillment of other rules that are already existing i think if you look at the path that has been laid out by the canadian national using the current rules of the stb for mergers and the language that s in this executive order one could conclude they are one and the same so i don t think there is any different standard for evaluating a merger in the executive order that s inconsistent with what the current rules the so called new rules of the stb already involved but as is always the case in situations like this we really won t know the full impact on some of these things until time plays out but we also know that the stb has a very full backlog and docket of activities including rules on reciprocal switching that i think are going to be priorities of the stb in the near future in addition to the merger activity that they have on their plate including ours amit mehrotra deutsche bank analyst okay i appreciate you answering that question the follow up for me i guess for mike i think you guys have done a phenomenal job over the last couple of years i mean you ve knocked the cover off the ball operationally quarter after quarter so i don t want to extrapolate too much from a one quarter blip if you will especially in the backdrop of the congestion that we re in but mike the incremental margin assumed by your guidance next year is like north of 80 which is a huge number i understand some of the cost items in the first half particularly in the first quarter but a lot of these things that you re expecting to revert is a little bit difficult to have a lot of visibility on and so why is 85 incrementals next year the right number given all that s going on today and especially all the resources you re throwing at trying to fix a lot of the issues if you can just help us get some comfort and confidence around how you re thinking about the framework for next year as implied by the guidance thank you michael w upchurch executive vice president chief financial officer sure sure i ll take a stab and as i said in my prepared comments we think we can get roughly half of this from the revenue line and roughly half of it from the cost side but if you think about just really incredibly strong demand environment and all the macroeconomic indicators whether it s gdp or pmi or corporate investment industrial production inventories being at all time lows give us a lot of confidence around the top line and at two thirds the 70 kind of incremental margins you get a couple of hundred basis points out of that so i think we feel pretty good about where we re at with demand and being able to deliver that and then clearly we need to improve in the operating side of the house that s costing us combined with fuel and congestion and a couple of these one time costs couple of hundred basis points and you get rid of that and you see your way i think some really nice improvement in operating ratio year over year so yeah i realize we it s bit of a show me story how we re missouri the show me state and we ve got some credibility here from having delivered as you acknowledged over last few years and we ll give the swing back on track amit mehrotra deutsche bank analyst got it okay very good thank you very much have a great weekend everybody i appreciate it michael w upchurch executive vice president chief financial officer you too patrick j ottensmeyer president and chief executive officer thank you operator the next question comes from jason seidl from cowen please go ahead jason seidl cowen and company analyst thank you operator pat mike team good morning everybody two quick questions here one in terms of pricing it sounds like there were some clearly some pressures on the cost side that are going to cause you to be more aggressive in the back half of the year should we expect higher contract renewals and how should we think about the spread of those contract renewals in relationship to the rail cost inflation that you re going to see michael w upchurch executive vice president chief financial officer well i think generally it s no surprise inflation is ticking up and as contracts come up for renewal we re going to have to take that into consideration as we reprice that business the good news is we ve seen an environment where over the last few quarters price increases have roughly been the same we ve now got to step up in inflation so we need to kind of deal with that going forward because our long term strategy has always been to price above the cost of inflation but an interesting dynamic and even the fed looking at their long term projections around inflation would suggest inflation is going to come back down in 2022 so there are interesting discussions with customers to have and we re going to do our best to continue to make sure we cover cost increases in our business there jason seidl cowen and company analyst but in terms of the spread mike do you think that that s going to change that much between your price increases and your cost michael w upchurch executive vice president chief financial officer well we ve kind of moved away over the last year from giving specific numbers there but clearly in the quarter you would have seen a negative spread but that doesn t mean over the course of the year as you go through contract renewals that we can t keep that at a positive level jason seidl cowen and company analyst okay fair enough my follow up question is going to be looking at sort of the margins on some of the types of business that sort of may have been deferred or may be coming online in the back half of the year because you guys are obviously looking for a strong rebound going forward how should we think about the margins and some of those businesses that have been delayed from either chip shortages or on plants coming online in relationship to your overall business michael w upchurch executive vice president chief financial officer jason you ve been doing this for 25 years right we never talk about segment profitability jason seidl cowen and company analyst i keep trying though you can t blame a girl michael w upchurch executive vice president chief financial officer but no i would tell you this it probably wouldn t be surprising to see us miss our auto plan by 50 million because of this chip issue solved out we re going to deliver jason seidl cowen and company analyst guys operator pardon me ladies and gentlemen it appears the speaker line has dropped please standby while we reconnect thank you for your patience ladies and gentlemen we have reconnected with the speakers please go ahead michael w upchurch executive vice president chief financial officer all right jason i think your question was around segment profitability and i m not exactly sure we got dropped there but i was just commenting as we look into the back half of the year and going into 2022 segments like auto where we re probably going to be 50 million short of our original plans because of this chip issue you re going to have the opportunity to make that up and we re not going to go through segment by segment giving you the profitability there and whether that s accretive or not to our overall business but i think you should generally just assume continued strong demand that generates great incremental margins and that s really our focus is to continue to deliver that top line growth jason seidl cowen and company analyst and so mike that assumption is that that 50 million that was lost that s just being pushed out that you re going to make up most of that in 22 michael w upchurch executive vice president chief financial officer yeah listen i don t think anybody knows exactly when this chip shortage is going to be fully resolved it s kind of an amazing issue i read an article the other day that the total value of the chips for these cars are less than 1 but we can t get any so you can t complete the production process of putting a vehicle together you d like to think this gets resolved fairly soon and we re being told by the oems despite some incremental shutdowns here in the third quarter that that issue will begin to subside in the fourth quarter and going into 2022 we re going to see really strong auto production second third shift demand is incredibly high right now driven by a dealer lot lately but you ll see more bear asphalt than you will cars it s pretty tough to order a car these days long long wait times and so the demand environment is pretty strong we think this is going to begin to really deliver some outsized growth for us late in the year and into 2022 jason seidl cowen and company analyst i appreciate the updates and i m knocking on wood that the supply chains get fixed there appreciate the time guys michael w upchurch executive vice president chief financial officer you bet operator our next question comes from justin long from stephens please go ahead justin long stephens inc analyst thanks and good morning just circling back to the service challenges that were faced in the quarter how much of this would you say is related to issues that are specific to your network so refined products and some of the regulation there the plant outages lazaro versus a kind of broader rail network issue with some of your interchange traffic michael w upchurch executive vice president chief financial officer i yeah go ahead john john orr executive vice president operations yeah well some of the descriptions you had in your question justin i think answer that question where a number of issues that are on our network particularly but the conditions that exist outside of that i think are more global issues where we have been very successful in for example finding new employees and hiring new employees we ve been very successful in recalling our furloughed employees that were furloughed in 2020 and 2021 where we see difficulty in some of the execution that creep into some of our performance like recrews and other things like that are problematic across the entire employment base in the united states taxis and fuel trucks and other services that are happening across a lot of industries but the performance issues that we re finding that are isolated on to our own network we re addressing very well oscar and the team for example on refined fuel products combined with mike and the rest of the operating team worked tirelessly for 40 plus days to work with the officials in mexico to resolve that and as mike said earlier in the call we re breaking through that we re doing as much as we can to support the customers in the auto business to be ready to service them as soon as those chips come or as they re moving equipment around in order to be prepared for that so i would say there are a number of issues that are localized on our network that are condition of the broader global issues on supply chain and for those that are really isolated to us we re working as a team to resolve them as efficiently as possible and in fact some of our recoveries are disproportionately quicker than others if you look at even some of the improvements we re making on our intermodal velocity in our intermodal supply chains in the u s we are order of magnitude some of our chip plants are in the plus six hours and the 95 range over the last two weeks trending very well in recovery so i think where we have network performance challenges that are isolated to our network we re addressing them very aggressively and based on service and how the customer sees our service capacity and capability where it s an upside influence we re doing our best to mitigate those things and in some cases as we ve said we ve gone a little long on our locomotives pre purchasing them in anticipation of problems in that supply chain for locomotive availability as we see the growth across the whole of transportation systems and pre positioning employees in our critical areas so that we know that the employment basis are going to be tough and going as aggressively as we can to hire a little bit long on that so that we re ready for that growth that s coming i would say that s my take on how we have kind of both a macro and a micro challenge and we re addressing both justin long stephens inc analyst okay that s helpful thanks and as my follow up i wanted to ask about the guidance so despite the change to the or outlook the eps outlook was only tweaked this year the outlook for 2022 wasn t changed so is the right read here that your revenue guidance has actually gotten a little bit better and that s offsetting a weaker margin outlook or is there anything out mike below the line that s influencing this michael w upchurch executive vice president chief financial officer you got it exactly right we re looking at revenues at the high end of our guide that we ve provided back in january so that s certainly helping the flow through the net income and eps and just as a reminder for everyone we ve talked about this before we have stopped our share repurchases which was in our original guidance but has kind of a limited impact on 2021 and so as we kind of reset things at the end of the year for 2022 going forward that could potentially be a changing variable depending on where we re at with the merger but you re spot on it s better revenue justin long stephens inc analyst helpful thanks for the time michael w upchurch executive vice president chief financial officer you bet operator the next question comes from tom wadewitz from ubs please go ahead tom wadewitz ubs analyst yeah good morning pat i know you gave us some kind of parameters about not asking certain things i m not sure if it fits into it or not but i think it s more factual can you explain to us what happens if stb says no to the voting trust and the merger deal doesn t expire till february so what s your obligation if they say no and what happens if they say no and your shareholders still vote in favor of the deal patrick j ottensmeyer president and chief executive officer what happens if they say no and the shareholders the shareholder vote is going to whether it occurs before or after the stb decision is going to be conditioned on and a closing into a voting trust so the shareholder vote will assume that there will be a closing into the voting trust and then your other question really is it s hard to answer because it will really it will be a decision on our part our board s part on cn s part and including and taking into consideration all of the information that will be available at that time including any color or explanation from the stb as to what s behind their decision including the possibility that there would be technical reasons so remember that the cn original cn voting trust application was turned down and or sent back on a technical matter because of the fact that there wasn t a merger application associated with the voting trust application i remind everyone of that just to make sure you remember there are any number of reasons and factors that we cannot begin to anticipate at this point as to what might be included in a vote in an stb decision and all of that would have to be taken into consideration by our board and certainly by cn that forward tom wadewitz ubs analyst okay what about with respect to break fees and other obligations do you get out of some of the break fees if your shareholders approve the deal i m just trying to think about that obviously there is a chance you can end up going down a different path and break fees would be a consideration so i just want to make sure i fully understand your obligations if you continue the deal doesn t expire till february but it s possible stb could say no so could you give a thought on that just how break fees would change in your obligations during that period patrick j ottensmeyer president and chief executive officer well again i m not going to speculate on the conditions and circumstances around stb decision i think the break fees the mechanics of the break fees are pretty thoroughly detailed in the merger agreement which is part of the proxy so i will fall back on my statement that i ll just refer to those documents tom wadewitz ubs analyst okay so it sounds like it s just pretty unclear what happens in that if that voting trust is rejected okay thanks for entertaining the questions patrick j ottensmeyer president and chief executive officer okay operator the next question comes from chris wetherbee from citigroup please go ahead chris wetherbee citi investment research analyst yeah hey thanks good morning guys maybe just following along a little bit on that last line of questions i don t know if the board or you pat had contemplated the prospects of potentially pursuing a merger without a voting trust is that simply just a no go as it stands right now is that something that would there could be circumstances that could lead to that being a potential option for you patrick j ottensmeyer president and chief executive officer chris i m going to probably disappoint you with my answer that we are totally focused on getting voting trust approval and i think that we have a very strong case and application and then beyond that it really is not it wouldn t be appropriate for me to comment on what the stb is going to say and what our board s response would be chris wetherbee citi investment research analyst okay that s fair and then when you think about the executive order one of the things that we ve been getting questions on is maybe how some of this potential scrutiny relates to the relative service that the industry at large is sort of providing to customers and obviously you guys had some struggles in some service here in the short term as you ve acknowledged how much of a remedy is service improvement you seem to the potential for the regulatory scrutiny or maybe if there is any incremental regulatory scrutiny coming from the executive order i guess is there something that is a little bit more controllable from your perspective in terms of improving service in a shorter term has the potential to put you on a stronger footing in terms of this regulatory dynamic patrick j ottensmeyer president and chief executive officer i don t necessarily see them as being tied together i know the stb before the executive order has been very focused on service they hold hearings there is an advisory group of the stb that s called rstac we have an employee of kcs who is on that committee over time they have gone from probably monthly meetings to quarterly meetings when service levels were improved to weekly meeting and i think just recently they have scaled that back a little bit i believe from weekly to monthly but that is an organization that is intended to be sort of a clearinghouse of information and feedback from shippers and railroads and stb so there is a very high level of interest in scrutiny from the stb on service levels we have all received i know you ve seen this all of the ceos all of the railroads have received requests from the stb for comment some detail about what we are doing to prepare for service recovery normally these things these letters come to us just prior to the seasonal peak but this time they came to us a little bit early so i see the stb s interest in service level and recovery and resource commitment as certainly predating the executive order and i know from just interactions that we ve had with the stb including comments that chairman oberman has made publicly that that will continue to be a very heightened focus so we are taking those requests and that interest level very seriously as you can see from the materials that we presented we have proactively brought back resources we ve brought back crews we ve got crews in training we think we are on a good path to make sure that we have adequate resources to complete our service recovery and handle our growth both in the u s and mexico so i would say we re taking those inquiries and the concern that the stb has over service very seriously and responding in ways that we think are necessary and appropriate and don t see the executive order is necessarily changing any of that chris wetherbee citi investment research analyst okay okay that s helpful color thanks for the time appreciate it operator the next question comes from ken hoexter from bank of america please go ahead ken hoexter bank of america merrill lynch analyst hey great good morning so pat or maybe a question for sameh but union pacific suspended international intermodal traffic for a week last night i guess we ve seen this before in el paso phoenix maybe the west coast ports in the early to mid 2000 after the mega mergers of the late 90s what s your thought on the ability for contagion on some of these supply chain shortages is there any impact to your network given the interaction with up from mexico and then just my follow on question i ll throw them both at you but maybe can you provide any details on that contract dispute patrick j ottensmeyer president and chief executive officer well i ll take the first one and i ll and just to comment on the first part obviously we can t comment on what s going on specifically at up but there is no doubt you ve used the word contagion and there is the north american rail network is a network and particularly given our interdependence with other carriers and obviously elevated in cross border traffic when other railroads have difficulty on their network we feel it and in a lot of cases we help them if there are detour options and other things that we can do to serve our joint customers and that s very much the way we think of it is particularly given the fact that we interchange so much traffic at the border with other carriers these are joint customers we re not we have no nothing to gain from fully cooperating with the other carriers to make sure that our customers sees an adequate level of service but yes it is a interconnected network i think the level of coordination and communication with the other carriers is very high so on a very daily basis we try to find ways to help each other to relieve congestion to improve the utilization efficiency of assets and different gateways and different routes but particularly being among the smallest it s hard for when the rest of the industry is tight and struggling with service and capacity issues we are definitely going to notice this sameh fahmy executive vice president precision scheduled railroading and ken this is sameh a lot of the supply chain issues have been across the rail industry the trucking industry a lot of industries and a lot of it is bringing people back and like we have been talking about congestion and all the rest here the roller coaster of volume drops and increases you go down about 30 40 this time last year then you go up about 30 40 after and you have to bring people back it s not a trivial exercise trying to bring back also the assets like a lot of locomotives were stored we have to activate them and when you look at the numbers the gtms as an example in q2 compared to q2 last year they went up by 30 the headcount in transportation went up by 8 so 8 against 30 volume increase the mechanical headcount went up by 3 so bringing people back is not a trivial exercise and it did contribute for sure to some of this congestion but at the same time it does provide a nice productivity thing because if you recall when we said in psr phase 2 which was last year we re very much oriented obviously toward making up for the lost revenue and we said that in phase 3 which is 2021 we don t want to lose all the gains that we made so we did conserve a lot of the gains because the headcounts are not going up at the same level as the volume increases and the train lengths did not go down very much it went down by about 2 which means that the train starts and all the rest we have conserved a lot of what we did last year so the game really is how can you absorb the volumes how can you improve the service which was the thrust of phase 1 of 2019 and we have done a lot of work in that area we have really pushed the envelope on the local service and the industry jobs and the spotting and pulling percentages which went up from like 70 to 87 so the game is how can you improve the service absorb the volumes and still maintain some of the efficiency gains that we have done we re talking about locomotives actually 69 locomotives are going to leave our network in the next three weeks leave the network not go in storage they are leaving the network there s a lot of other locomotives that are actually demo locomotives that were working on with a vendor so the efficiency is still there but at the same time the service is primordial and this is really the balancing act that we are trying to do and this is a challenge to the supply chain to your question ken hoexter bank of america merrill lynch analyst sameh just to wrap up on that is it hard to get the employees in terms of the labor market right now for the rail network for your network sameh fahmy executive vice president precision scheduled railroading i would say that initially it was ken a couple of months ago when we started the training classes it was tough to get people back and actually approach even people that we had that we wanted to bring back and they said they are no longer interested obviously a lot of the payments they have been receiving became hindrance why come back when they were getting checks at home so initially it was now recently we have had much more success and we have i think we have about 140 people in classes 40 of them now have marked up meaning we can actually use them so there is still 100 that are in the pipeline and when you talk about productivity and cost well you have 100 people here that have not gone into productive service yet but they are counted in the headcount so we say that the headcount is 8 higher but it includes people who are still in training one measure we use i look at a lot is compared to pre pandemic not compared to q2 last year because q2 last year everything was not really where it is where it needs to be but the crews right now are still 5 lower than pre pandemic and the volumes are 3 higher the carloads are 3 higher so there is productivity happening and we are facing the challenges but we are finding people now and we expect that in two to three months it will be a completely back on track and you know what john talked about the velocity and the dwell we have very very clear plans now and we expect our velocity to go back up to 16 17 miles per hour in the next i would say months or two ken hoexter bank of america merrill lynch analyst wonderful thanks appreciate sameh pat and team thanks operator the next question comes from allison landry from credit suisse please go ahead allison landry credit suisse analyst thanks good morning appreciate squeezing me in i ll just ask one but i just wanted to go back to the topic of reciprocal switching but sort of asking the question in a different way obviously it s difficult to estimate the potential impact for the industry never mind what actions the stb might take down the path if any but pat i just is there an argument to be made that kcs would be less impacted on a relative basis versus some of your peers i m just sort of thinking about the fact that you probably have lessened the way of captive traffic more interchanges etc so just do you think that this is a fair way to think about it patrick j ottensmeyer president and chief executive officer a fair way to think that kcs would be less impacted allison landry credit suisse analyst yeah right patrick j ottensmeyer president and chief executive officer it just really depends on what the rules are and without knowing kind of specifically how because there are many different proposals many different options for how reciprocal switching would be actually implemented it s just impossible to know how it would impact us michael w upchurch executive vice president chief financial officer allison this is mike obviously half of our business is in mexico which wouldn t be impacted so i think it s safe for you to conclude that but what the impact is in the u s relative to the others would be difficult to answer and so we really understood what specific proposal is allison landry credit suisse analyst okay understood i ll leave with that one thank you patrick j ottensmeyer president and chief executive officer okay thanks allison operator the next question comes from brian ossenbeck from j p morgan please go ahead brian ossenbeck j p morgan analyst hey good morning thanks for getting me on the call here at the end i appreciate it two quick ones one on the network performance john if you could just give us an update on the four hour border window change going from six to four how does that work any was there any benefit improvement when you made that switch and what s the visibility to going to maybe two or no more fluid border crossings and then again back on the executive order if you can just comment briefly on i think sameh just mentioned it on spotting and pulling if we do get more data on first mile last mile how do you think we should interpret that is it going to be sort of hard to put in the context because every network is different are customers are really asking for this level of disclosure so maybe since i think we can hear more about that potentially in the future pat or someone can give us some thoughts on first and final mile that would be helpful thanks a lot sameh fahmy executive vice president precision scheduled railroading as far as the first mile last mile i don t see any issue in giving numbers like i just gave some numbers but the numbers went from the 74 to 87 john and the team have been unbelievably focused that exercise in monterrey that john talked about was very intense and we have a lot of customers around the monterrey area and you can have the trip as fast as you can from origin to destination but if you don t get it to the industry when they need it then it doesn t make any difference so now we provide about 550 cars on a regular basis reliable basis every single day in the monterrey area we spot 550 cars and the other thing is supplying the mts also which is another thing that is important when a customer orders 50 mts and you give them the right type of car so that aspect has really really improved and it s not mentioned in any of the slides here so to your point we should make that more public as far as the window four hour window that has been a great success and we worked actually hand in hand with union pacific on that because our trains that go to up from the bridge and now a train instead of waiting six hours if you miss the window you have to wait six hours for the next one now you wait only four hours if you miss now obviously we don t want to miss at all if we can help it but there has been a nice improvement but that improvement is all chained with the rest because it s a network so john and the team did a lot of work in the laredo yard which has to receive the trains to plan ahead when the train arrives so everything is ready but the fact that now you send four hours worth of trains to laredo coming from mexico northbound is much better than sending to laredo in one shot six hours worth of trains you don t flood the yard so these are benefits and they are all coordinated with the rest of the yards on the other side of the border on the south side nuevo laredo sanchez and monterrey and it all goes hand in hand and there is a wide boarding exercise that we don t even talk about here that just took place john was the new structure that he talked about the new organizational structure and there is a lot of good things that are going to happen a lot of work was being done in yards that are not the best yards like nuevo laredo is a very small yard it was doing work for sanchez which is a very big yard but sanchez was affected by the refined products which grew by 100 from q2 last year to q2 this year so all these things are connected but to answer your main question the bridge now the windows went from six hours to four hours and then the intention eventually is to go down to zero our windows and to build the second bridge in which case there are no windows at all and you go directional northbound goals and southbound goes at the same time without having any sequencing between trains and that will do magic to the velocity of the kcs network which is our cross border is what s growing the most our cross border grew by 50 from q2 last year to q2 this year and i think refined product across that is 100 increase right mike michael w upchurch executive vice president chief financial officer yes over that brian ossenbeck j p morgan analyst all right thank you sameh operator the next question comes from scott group from wolfe research please go ahead scott group wolfe research analyst hey thanks good morning guys so quickly can i just clarify if for whatever reason the voting trust is blocked before august 19 does the shareholder vote still happen and then the executive order focused a bunch on passenger service and amtrak can you just talk about like how much passenger service exposure do you guys have and what you guys are planning there patrick j ottensmeyer president and chief executive officer first answer first question yes shareholder vote will take place on august 19 if there is a decision prior to scott group wolfe research analyst regardless of the decision patrick j ottensmeyer president and chief executive officer we kcs does not actually host any amtrak we have i think a couple of one location around st louis technically amtrak runs over our tracks but we don t control it we don t dispatch it so we really have no relationship with amtrak there has been talk obviously from time to time with amtrak and with other passenger and commuter metro type organizations to bring passenger service on to our network but that s really the extent of our relationship with amtrak so we don t have a history with amtrak and if you are familiar with the amtrak response i think they talked about the baton rouge to new orleans route that has been identified as a divestiture candidate but there is no passenger service on that route today michael w upchurch executive vice president chief financial officer and by the way scott there hasn t been passenger service on that in over 50 years scott group wolfe research analyst okay so amtrak shouldn t be a big issue there just real quick follow up if for whatever reason we don t get a voting trust decision by august 19 does the shareholder vote get delayed until there is a decision patrick j ottensmeyer president and chief executive officer no again as i mentioned earlier the intention is that the shareholder vote would be subject to shareholder approval will be subject to stb approval for a voting trust so if there is no decision it would be our intention to proceed with the shareholder vote scott group wolfe research analyst okay thank you guys appreciate the time operator the next question comes from david zazula from barclays please go ahead david zazula barclays capital analyst thanks for taking my question just maybe for mike as you ve had the opportunity to review some additional data with respect to potential additional traffic that you can convert that s along cn line ksu line has that changed your opinion on the potential benefits of converted traffic due to the merger michael w upchurch executive vice president chief financial officer is that a question specific to the synergies david zazula barclays capital analyst i guess i m thinking more broadly on how much long term do you think is convertible just as you michael w upchurch executive vice president chief financial officer yeah well i think cn has done a really good job of evaluating the various market opportunities that present themselves to combined company here and we ve done a terrific job growing our business over the years i often use the cross border intermodal business at laredo depending on how you measure that we think we have somewhere around 5 to 6 share that s interesting but that s far short of the possibilities and the challenge that we ve always had is we don t go to any interesting places in single line service not to say kansas city is an interesting place it is but it s not a market like chicago or detroit or toronto which is the attraction of combining with cn and we think we can dramatically increase the share of that cross border business that has been moved by truck and move that business off the highway systems more environmentally friendly we can establish premium intermodal service that we think will compete very effectively with other modes of opportunities that are out there for shippers and provide a new services that bottom line doesn t exist in the market today so i think that s a great example and beyond that we ve looked at it segment by segment and think there are tremendous opportunities for the two companies to provide new single line service that s pro competitive and offer shippers more options david zazula barclays capital analyst noting your capital plan at least the level has not changed i guess have you changed any composition of the capital plan in response to kind of preparing for the potential merger and maybe some additional growth or terminal facilities that you might want to put in place or is that kind of planning not kind of in plan yet michael w upchurch executive vice president chief financial officer no not really i d say we re executing against our plan i mean you always have some pluses and minuses and john was recently out on the railroad with his team and a few projects here and there so you add a few you take a few away but generally we re still on plan we don t see any reason why we would scale that back we ve got to continue to operate as a independent company obviously both before voting trust closing and after voting trust closing and cn s offered us the opportunity in the merger agreement to spend more than what we ve guided externally in the event that there are additional growth opportunities or projects that john s team needs to execute on so yeah our plans have really not changed and we ve got lots of flexibility going forward under the merger agreement david zazula barclays capital analyst thanks a lot michael w upchurch executive vice president chief financial officer you bet operator this concludes our question and answer session i would like to turn the conference back over to mr ottensmeyer for any closing remarks patrick j ottensmeyer president and chief executive officer okay thank you all thank you for your questions obviously a challenging environment for us as well as for supply chains across north america and beyond hopefully one of the things that you heard today is that we are very focused on improving our service and operational performance we feel very confident about the growth opportunities that are in front of us and working very hard to realize those opportunities so thanks again for your attention and look forward to seeing you all again soon operator duration 89 minutes call participants ashley thorne vice president investor relations patrick j

to speculation that firms planning to go public would have to wait until 2021 but the market picked up around the middle of the year turning 2020 into a banner year for us tech ipos we look back at the three biggest ones and check how they ve fared since with zomato having whetted investors appetites india is gearing up for a tech ipo bonanza in the second half of 2021 featuring the likes of delhivery policybazaar freshworks flipkart and nykaa the latter half of 2020 was similarly huge for american tech firms with three companies doordash airbnb and snowflake making the list of the top 10 us tech ipos of all time not adjusted for inflation source visualcapitalist comimage source snowflake snowflake is a data warehousing software company that provides cloud based data storage its clients include capitalone and logitech historically companies have stored data on servers they manage themselves using software from oracle and ibm which have dominated the space rather than help companies store data on their own servers snowflake helps them warehouse it in the cloud crucially its software makes it easier for businesses to pull insights from the data the company was a pioneer in this space offering this service before google amazon and microsoft came up with their own versions snowflake s ipo one of the largest of 2020 is also the largest ipo ever by a software company the company was initially expected to sell 28 million class a shares for between 75 and 85 each but ended up raising 3 4 billion at 120 a share this shot up to 300 on the first day of trading making snowflake the largest company ever to double in value on its opening day after closing day 1 at just under 254 it continued to climb hitting a high of 390 on december 8 but by the end of 2020 it had

delivery platform similar to zomato and swiggy like its indian counterparts the company saw its business boom last year with people stuck at home none of the three companies on this list have yet turned a full year profit but doordash s ipo came in for the most severe criticism it was named the most ridiculous ipo of 2020 by market research firm new constructs the reasons it s lack of profitability stiff competition a possible pandemic boost that may subside once more people start dining out again and because they do not have a way to make money long term no different from their desi counterparts then despite this doordash raised 3 4 billion in its ipo by selling about 33 million class a shares at 102 each its stock rose 85 on its first day of trading to close at 189 51 a share but by the end of the year it had fallen to 142 75 the new year brought renewed optimism but also increased volatility the share price briefly crossed 200 in mid january and mid february before crashing to 113 in mid may it has since recovered to 167 just a few dollars above its first day closing price it s also worth noting that the company s stock price wasn t affected too much when its lock in period expired on june 7 airbnb as you probably know is an online vacation marketplace that connects vacationers with property owners founded in 2008 its business model has upended the hotel industry in 2019 airbnb said it would go public the following year and though the pandemic decimated the travel industry in 2020 the company kept its word and launched what would prove to be the largest us ipo tech or otherwise of the year on december 10 a day after doordash s debut the company raised 3 5 billion in its ipo by selling 51 5 million class a shares at 68 each its share price rose 112 to close at just under 145 on the first day of trading after analysts downgraded the stock it crashed to a low of 124 80 on december 15 but rallied to 163 19 by december 22 but by the end of the year it was back at day 1 levels 146 80 it saw another rally at the start of 2021 and crossed 200 a few times in february and march before hitting a 2021 low of 133 99 in may after another dip

the new president of peru pedro castillo seems to have overcome the multiple obstacles posed by keiko fujimori defeated in the second round of the june 6 elections once declared the winner by the electorate after a narrow victory of just forty thousand votes out of around 19 million voters castillo is expected to take office on july 28 when the country celebrates the bicentenary of its independence therefore the new president will have to face the considerable challenges that await him for his five year term yet three weeks after her defeat the opponent the daughter of dictator alberto fujimori sentenced to 25 years in prison for corruption and human rights violations has not acknowledged castillo s victory keiko fujimori maintains that a fraud has harmed her continues to organize protest marches which have already claimed one death among her opponents and has presented multiple unsubstantiated appeals that have had no effect the united states the european union and international observers stressed the transparency of the elections the challenges of castillo castillo must however prepare for a much more difficult phase where several fronts are opening up in a social context where requests for solutions are multiplying currently several social conflicts affect different sectors of society but mainly the extractive industries in may of this year the office of the ombudsman identified 191 conflicts which could increase with the arrival of the new government first castillo s tenure is legitimate but the support of 50 1 of the electorate is insufficient to undertake a major transformation second the party that presented him as a candidate adheres to conservative marxism leninism on issues such as family and gender and maintains an anachronistic program and third the first round of elections determined that there are ten parties occupying seats in congress in this context leading the executive will not be enough to effect radical change pedro castillo knows it he is a man of humble origin professor and evangelical who comes from a small andean village where he has worked until now in 200 years of independent life the country has never seen a man with this profile ascend to the presidency castillo was trained as a union leader within the teachers union and when he decided to go into politics he intended to form a party based on the country s teachers who number more half a million the task of collecting signatures in order to register the party with electoral authorities was halted in 2020 by restrictions imposed by the pandemic it was then that the leaders of free peru a regional party in the center of the country which has an electoral register nominated him as the party s founder and candidate for the post had just been convicted by the courts for his mismanagement of public funds the phantom of communism to the radical ideology of peru libre has been added the participation of professors linked to movadef a group which seeks by legal means what the communist party of peru sendero luminoso has proposed to achieve with weapons which led the mainstream media to identify castillo with communism this planted the idea that if elected the country would become a venezuela although the campaign for keiko fujimori was fueled by fear of communism and contempt for the peasant teacher most ended up choosing the candidate who most resembled them the teacher does not hide his limits and takes refuge in plentiful speeches in general this is why some commentators agree that we do not know what he will do in office however in may he presented a government plan for the first 100 days that eschews radicalism but maintains the need to review contracts that accord overly favorable treatment to mineral and gas exploration what will the government bench look like the recent approach of educated left advisers outside peru libre has refined definitions of future government and has given rise to some struggles with party leaders which brings another front to the internal affairs of government the crack will probably be reproduced in the parliamentary representation of peru libre which has 37 members of congress out of 130 apparently part of them was selected by castillo himself and another by the management of peru libre so in in the coming weeks it will be possible to find out whether the government has its own caucus or whether divisions will arise if the 37 members of congress acted united they would likely be joined by 13 others from the left and center who together would not achieve a majority the right however is said to have at least three forces totaling 44 members of congress three other groups with 36 parliamentarians are likely to divide or agree on the right or the left at their convenience castillo will have to be very careful on the one hand to keep the peru libre caucus together and on the other hand to have the flexibility necessary to conclude agreements with forces that demonstrate openness to circumstantial agreements if he fails to cross that narrow ledge congress could take advantage of any misstep to step down from the presidency the entrepreneur is another big challenge another front is the corporate sector while there was financial support for this sector out of fear of communist campaigns realism prevailed on sunday 27 when an editorial in the conservative daily el comercio declared enough of fujimori s baseless fraud allegations castillo s announcement on the eve of asking current central bank president julio velarde to stay in office appears to have been decisive the president elect also said we are not chavistas we are not communists we are not going to keep anyone s property that is wrong we are democrats we will respect governability peruvian institutionality the value of the dollar fell and the lima stock exchange recovered this week there appears to have been a divorce between the business interests and the political ambitions of those who claimed to represent them the first more realistic seem to have accepted castillo s victory and are preparing to live with the new government but of course it will be conditional acceptance in particular businessmen will be attentive to the government s management of social conflicts and to the search for solutions acceptable to the plaintiffs and at the same time which do not alarm the great economic interests it will be another narrow ledge for a government fraught with challenges translation from spanish by maria isabel santos lima
from the rise of delivery to changing dining habits see how remote is impacting restaurants remote work boomed during the pandemic and it s had a diverse range of effects on the economy the restaurant industry has been affected in a number of ways including the surge in demand for digital ordering and delivery which has also made third party apps like doordash dash 0 30 even more vital at the same time remote work has favored restaurant chains with drive thrus a strong digital infrastructure and those located near where people live as opposed to chains in downtown locations or travel destinations in this fool live segment recorded july 2 fool com contributors jeremy bowman and jon quast and bureau chief corinne cardina discuss the many implications of remote work s rise on the restaurant industry 10 stocks we like better than doordash inc when our award winning analyst team has a stock tip it can pay to listen after all the newsletter they have run for over a decade motley fool stock advisor has tripled the market they just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now and doordash inc wasn t one of them that s right they think these 10 stocks are even better buys see the 10 stocks stock advisor returns as of june 7 2021 corinne cardina yeah another i guess it would be a headwind for the restaurant sector is remote work in a lot of ways people are going back to work maybe you see that business lunch hour pick back up but there are plenty of people remote working that it s here to stay a lot of companies have fully pivoted jon what can you tell us about what categories are really going to be hurt by the trend of remote work sticking around jon quast yeah one of the things that i think that we can tease out of darden s results darden restaurants dri 1 52 that is olive garden longhorn steakhouse what s the other big one escapes me at the moment but any case they have a whole portfolio of restaurants that they operate one of them is capital grille and this is in their fine dining category when you look at where capital grille is located it s in a lot of big cities and downtowns and those comparable sales are still very much down that was the worst performing part of darden s business in 2020 when you think about when people are using this restaurant it s oftentimes as a business lunch you go to the office you grab lunch with coworkers at a place like this that is still struggling very much fortunately for darden they re not a pure play on this so it gets absorbed into their overall business results a company that was public a few years ago named del frisco s they were more of a pure play i would imagine that they are having a very rough time as remote work is at least here in a hybrid fashion it seems like some of us are going back to the office but maybe not as much as we were pre pandemic cardina yeah definitely that ll be one to keep an eye on definitely not seeing that immediate bounce back in the finer lunch dining type of eating let s briefly talk about delivery the pandemic was a tailwind for delivery some of the delivery stocks are better than others the big names doordash grubhub uber uber 1 05 eats postmates is i believe private correct me if i m wrong jeremy is there any of these delivery stocks that you think are the most attractive today in terms of the traditional delivery stocks jeremy bowman sure i think going into the pandemic i was pretty bearish on this whole sector i think the unit economics really looked pretty ugly in a lot of ways they re squeezing customers on one end and then squeezing restaurants as well some cities even implemented a cap on commissions to the delivery apps during the pandemic i think i saw san francisco even voted to make theirs permanent but i think what happened is the pandemic has just transformed the industry delivery s not going away now i think we know that these companies have gotten millions of people signed up to use these services over the last year we ve become habituated to them as well restaurants have added the infrastructure as well and they are used to doing things this way i think the three major companies here and postmates you mentioned uber actually acquired postmates cardina ok bowman yeah there s been a lot of consolidation in the industry over the years and grubhub is getting bought out by just eat takeaway jtkwy 2 24 which is a european company i think that each company brings something different to the table grubhub was the early disruptor early with the online ordering interface but then got disrupted by uber and doordash who had their own armies of drivers that work for them then doordash now has a majority market share in the industry with about 57 last i checked i think they ve been able to have so much success because they pitched themselves in suburban locations and got a lot of restaurant chains that you might not think of as being delivery friendly like cheesecake factory those casual dining places and i think they work more with the restaurant side to build those sales you think of uber has a reputation for being more aggressive and just grabbing market share i think they might have lost some restaurant customers that they otherwise would ve gotten doordash has a bigger idea of just being a delivery app for everything whether it s your order from walgreens or your supermarket or something from a hardware store i think of these companies right now i like doordash the most that s the most interesting and to me it s the interesting one to watch in the space cardina awesome let s talk about the side you don t think about with delivery who s making these apps jeremy has a really interesting stock that is new to me that we re going to talk about bowman yeah i was going to talk about this a little later as well olo olo 3 99 they re sort of like the restaurant facing counterpart to delivery apps they just had their ipo in march olo stands for online ordering that s basically what they do for restaurants they were founded in 2005 but they really exploded in growth during the pandemic and in recent years as online ordering delivery is taking off they work for the restaurants you think of uber and doordash and they stuff they re really pitching the end customer to order through them and then they obviously have to get food from the restaurants but they re more customer facing olo is also interesting it s really a tech stock they use the saas model software as a service which has been a great model for a lot of the cloud stocks we ve seen recently i think they re maybe a better option than doordash because restaurants want to work with them restaurants are hiring them directly as opposed to there s a lot of tension with the doordashes and the uber eats of the world i think maybe olo is a better place to look

covid 19 has been rapidly spreading across the globe taking thousands of lives and bringing hundreds of economies to a standstill its initial impact on china s economy and china s consequent slowdown may have adverse economic impacts on the rest of the world as well this article examines the impact of covid 19 on the sri lankan economy focusing on the sectors such as national output and employment tourism exchange rate and financial market and social and welfare the outbreak of critical diseases and pandemics cannot be predicted or controlled as yet severe acute respiratory syndrome sars in 2003 and the middle east respiratory syndrome mers in 2012 are recognised as epidemics in recent history together with the most recent outbreak of the coronavirus covid 19 it was first identified in wuhan people s republic of china in early january 2020 as confirmed by scientists covid 19 also belongs to the same family of coronaviruses which caused sars and mers in 2003 and 2012 respectively however the mortality rate of covid 19 is approximately 4 3 as of 24 march 2020 which is significantly lower than that of sars 10 and mers 34 abiad et al 2020 nevertheless the infection rate of covid 19 between 1 5 to 3 5 outnumbered that of sars and mers and also ebola abiad et al 2020 the total number of confirmed cases of covid 19 rapidly increased in china initially and then the rest of the world in fact the confirmed number of cases had surpassed the total of sars by the end of february 2020 and currently there are 170 444 706 as of 30 may 2021 confirmed cases across 220 countries with a death toll of 3 544 083 as of 30 may 2021 the outbreak spread to a vast number of countries in record time and the world health organization had announced a global emergency apart from the health consequences of covid 19 there are many economic and social impacts of the pandemic which should be addressed sufficiently recalling history sars in 2003 cost 50 billion of the world s output raga 2020 and the asian development bank adb has now estimated that global output may drop from 77 billion to 347 billion or by 0 1 to 0 4 of the global gross domestic product gdp abiad et al 2020 no doubt that china is the most adversely affected economy approximately accounting for two thirds of global gdp drop down and the rest of the impact on the global economy is shared equally by developing countries in asia and the rest of the world the impact on china s economy is more substantial through their stock markets paused production and cancelled flights and international travels currently china is the second largest economy in the world and therefore china s slowdown will adversely affect other countries as well impact on sri lanka s gdp and employment sri lanka has been maintaining strong economic and diplomatic ties with china since its independence in particular the bilateral economic relations between sri lanka and china have strengthened significantly during the last decade bilateral trade and investments agreements and tourism relations between the two countries are stronger than ever before in fact china is not a major export destination for sri lanka but china is the second largest source market for sri lanka in terms of imports and tourist arrivals therefore china s slowdown due to covid 19 may have a significant impact on the sri lanka economy the adb recently estimated the economic impact of covid 19 on selected economies considering the best case moderate case and worse case scenarios abiad et al 2020 table 1 impact of covid 19 on gdp and employment of sri lanka sector best case moderate case worse case as a of sector gdp as a of sector employment as a of sector gdp as a of sector employment as a of sector gdp as a of sector employment agriculture

0 164 source asian development bank as table 1 indicates the gdp of sri lanka may drop by 0 119 0 179 and 0 358 under best moderate and worst hypothetical scenarios respectively similarly the shrinking of employment may vary from 0 205 to 0 617 under the same scenarios adverse effects on hotels restaurants and other personal services are more substantial followed by transport services however these figures have been estimated only considering china s domestic demand and travel bans and therefore the estimates may increase after incorporating the current situation in sri lanka especially island wide curfew due to covid 19 completely disrupted economic activities while shutting down of airports and seaports interrupted export and import mechanisms extensively apart from that covid 19 has now outreached the united states us united kingdom uk and other european countries as well in fact the european union uk and us are the main export destinations of sri lanka and therefore the demand for sri lanka exports is going to be severely affected it is estimated that the export revenue from tea may drop by 520 million while a 10 million reduction in the apparel sector gunadasa 2020 hence an overall drop of 750 million is expected during the second and third quarters of 2020 gunadasa 2020 therefore covid 19 may have a larger impact on sri lanka s gdp and employment than adb forecasted impact on the tourism sector the tourism sector which is the third largest foreign income generator for sri lanka has been severely affected by covid 19 in fact major tourist destinations in sri lanka have been suffering due to the travel bans which apply to domestic tourists also china which contributed the second largest number of tourists till january 2020 will most likely not be part of the top 10 countries with the most tourist arrivals in sri lanka in 2021 specifically 54 452 chinese tourists had visited sri lanka during january february of 2019 and chinese tourist arrivals dropped down to 24 459 during the same period in 2020 reporting a 55 1 drop in chinese tourist arrivals and which has drastically dropped down to 144 during the same period in 2021 sltda 2020 21 table

development authority table 2 highlights the tourist arrivals from the top 10 tourist markets in february 2019 and february 2020 along with a comparison with april 2020 with the declining trend of chinese tourist arrivals due to covid 19 the uk russia and germany have become the topmost countries providing tourists to sri lanka after india nevertheless the majority of european countries are suffering from covid 19 and therefore the tourism sector of sri lanka has been dramatically affected especially after losing tourists from european countries in the immediate aftermath of the pandemic that is in april 2020 tourist arrivals saw a significant decline further tourist arrivals from all the top markets dropped from 84 to 100 by 2021 when compared with the 2019 figures for the same as a result sri lanka s total tourist arrivals during the period between january to april 2021 have dropped by 97 3 compared to the same period in 2020 consequently the contribution of the tourism sector to sri lanka s economy declined sharply in 2020 pressure on exchange rate and financial market decreased tourism receipts reduced export earnings and outstanding foreign debt payments essentially increase the pressure on the foreign exchange rate apart from that a considerable number of sri lankans employed in the middle east south korea and italy are severely affected by the pandemic thus it is expected that foreign remittances to sri lanka will drop by 2 7 billion during this year gunadasa 2020 thus the sri lankan rupee started to depreciate against major currencies from the first week of march 2020 in particular it depreciated against the us dollar and reached rs 198 46 as of 30 may 2021 reporting one of the highest depreciation in its history the current depreciation of the rupee essentially increases the country s expenditure on imports and burden on foreign debt hence the central bank of sri lanka has immediately taken a few measures1 such as suspension of the import of motor vehicles non essential goods and purchasing of sri lankan international sovereign bonds by licenced banks in sri lanka however no immediate response can be seen as yet in the exchange rate covid 19 has now caused global financial unrest as well and it is more apparent through the collapse of stock markets in many countries around the world in fact sri lanka has no escape from the crisis and colombo stock exchange cse in sri lanka has also been affected severely on 10 march cse fell to an eight year low and it was one of the largest one day falls due to an outflow of foreign funds news first 2020a a considerable volume of treasury bills and treasury bonds held by foreign investors has declined by 9 03 that is rs 8 236 billion bringing the total to rs 19 6 billion in foreign outflows during the first two weeks of march 2020 news first 2020b consequently cse closed on a negative note during the first two weeks of march with a 4 47 decrease in the all share price index aspi and a 5 79 decrease in the s p sri lanka 20 index compared to the end of february 2020 news first 2020b moreover cse fell by 16 since january 2020 and 8 4 out of 16 fall was in february itself news first 2020a there is a greater possibility of further weakening the stock market damaging the financial stability of the country with rapid outreach of the coronavirus globally and also in sri lanka welfare measures implemented by the sri lankan government the sri lankan government has implemented a variety of strategies to control covid 19 by allocating financial and non financial resources extensively sri lanka continues to maintain a large number of quarantine centres with many hotels and a few public places converted as quarantine centres maintaining such quarantine centres and facilitating suspected patients in the centres requires huge additional funding which ultimately affects the budget deficit through increased welfare expenditure however the additional funding requirements cannot be compensated in the current situation and therefore will have adverse economic impacts in the long run in particular the president has allocated rs 100 million to a special bank account opened by the bank of ceylon in order to help covid 19 patients moreover the president has pledged to donate 5 million to saarc covid 19 emergency fund to lend a helping hand to the regional counterparts news lk 2020a apart from that the government of china agreed to provide a concessionary loan of 500 million with a term of 10 years in order to strengthen sri lanka s financial position to battle with covid 19 news lk 2020b however the long term impact of such welfare measures should be addressed appropriately to avoid a possible economic downturn in the near future lastly the government s decision to impose an island wide curfew helped in controlling the pandemic however the livelihoods of low income groups were adversely affected due to the imposition of this curfew particularly casual workers and workers who are employed in the informal sector are temporarily unemployed and are struggling to make ends meet government policy should potentially help in providing a safety net to these groups

washington d c the u s consumer product safety commission said on wednesday that it had filed suit against amazon com due to the hazardous products that it had distributed on its platform stating that the e commerce giant was legally responsible to recall the products as they posed a serious risk of injury or death to consumers the products included 24 000 carbon monoxide detectors that failed to operate some 400 000 hair dryers that re missing protection against shock and electrocution and children s sleepwear garments that could catch fire according to the consumer product safety commission the commission said amazon had taken unspecified actions for some of the products but it was not enough we must grapple with how to deal with these massive third party platforms more efficiently and how best to protect the american consumers who rely on them consumer product safety commission acting chairman robert adler said the seattle based e commerce giant said it was unclear why the consumer product safety commission rejected its offer to expand its recall program including for products sold by third parties or sued to force actions almost entirely duplicative of what it had taken the company said it had removed the vast majority of the products in question from its online store and provided full customer refunds

esg investing the esg in esg investing stands for environmental social and governance it s a form of socially responsible investing that takes into account the aforementioned three factors when you select an investment product to help investors make a decision firms like msci sustainalytics and s p global ratings assign esg scores to publicly listed companies here s what each of the three factors mean but keep in mind that they occasionally overlap environmental the most clear cut of all three factors refers to how eco friendly a company is for example how well is it managing its waste products to what extent is it contributing to deforestation how severe are its greenhouse gas emissions social this refers to a company s internal and external relationships for example how committed is it to customer satisfaction on the flip side does it engage its own employees well how about ensuring diversity when hiring governance this factor judges how impartially a company is run for

the risks of esg investing esg investing has had its fair share of detractors over the years and it s hard to fault them firstly each firm listed above has a different methodology when it comes to granting esg scores to companies or funds as shown this can create discrepancies and cause investors to spend even more time to determine whether a product is truly aligned with their beliefs secondly zeroing in on investment products with stellar esg ratings will cause you to miss out on opportunities to grow your wealth at a quicker pace although you can compromise by simply integrating esg investment products into your existing portfolio some would say that defeats the purpose of this strategy entirely finally research has shown that companies and funds being esg advocates might not necessarily translate into better returns however the paper also conceded that firms with poor esg scores do tend to perform poorer than the market furthermore it also stated that there is not enough data to work with right now since esg investing is a recent trend conclusion there s no denying that esg investing is popular given how much money has been poured into sustainable funds and companies in recent years investors are voting with their dollars as they aim to align their portfolios with their ethics and morals and given the spate of incidents revolving around each esg factor in the past year why wouldn t they want to do so fortunately esg investing does not require a separate platform or set of tools your existing online brokerage account and even robo advisor will do it just takes

part 1 of a series on social justice research part 2 here the push to create equity and more social justice in public schools in america s largest state rests on this basic premise we reject ideas of natural gifts and talents declares the current draft of the california math framework which also states that it rejects the cult of genius informed by that fundamental idea the 800 page framework calls for the elimination of accelerated classes and gifted programs for high achieving students until at least the 11th grade it s a major departure for the framework commissioned every seven years by the department of education to provide guidance to the state s 10 315 public schools serving 6 million students some california teachers describe it as a misguided one size fits all approach to reversing long standing discrimination against girls and students of color in math instruction but the framework which could be adopted next year claims its recommendations are based on the latest seemingly unimpeachable findings of advanced social science research phrases such as researchers found the research shows and the research is clear are sprinkled through the framework which states unequivocally the research is clear that all students are capable of becoming powerful mathematics learners and users if true this evidence would provide a powerful rationale for adopting the framework s proposals which given california s size and prestige is commonly seen as a model for other states a review of much of the research cited however reveals that what the framework describes as clear is often actually pretty murky hotly disputed or contradicted by other research misleadingly stretched to cover situations for which it was not intended or in some instances just plain wrong consider how the framework supports one of its overarching principles namely its rejection of the ideas of natural gifts and talents the text refers to a paper by a new york university psychologist andrei cimpian in 2015 to support that proposition but the only work of cimpian listed in the footnotes is a paper written with a princeton university psychologist sarah jane leslie that paper found that women and girls are commonly discouraged from going into fields that are deemed to require special ability to be successful which can certainly include math but it says nothing at all about whether some people are born with an aptitude for math or not or that all students are capable of high level math performance this isn t a question that my own research was designed to address leslie said in an emailed response to questions about the framework s citation of her work the california math framework is not the only document claiming that research supports woke reforms or arguments providing a sheen of objectivity and authoritativeness to what might otherwise seem just a radical opinion a wide range of controversial claims on subjects ranging from police shootings and school discipline policies to public health cite research that doesn t quite prove what advocates claim see part 2 of the series in general the framework follows a point of view long advocated by jo boaler a professor of math education at stanford university the document s most visible public advocate and reportedly its main author boaler who is white has long argued that as the framework puts it the subject and community of math has a history of exclusion and filtering rather than inclusion and welcoming it continues girls and black and brown children notably receive messages that they are not capable of high level mathematics compared to their white and male counterparts in other words the basic premise of the framework is the same as the larger woke movement namely that the white male power structure systematically keeps women and non whites down math operates as whiteness is the way this has been put by some specialists in math education one must acknowledge that mathematics is part of a societal system that is inherently racist reads a typical sort of blog post among math educators proposing what they call anti racist math it is true that women and more so african americans and latinos are underrepresented in university math departments and in science technology engineering and math stem fields more generally but in math the claim of pervasive discrimination runs more conspicuously than in other fields into a contrary testable reality while bemoaning the underrepresentation of people of color or black and brown children in math the framework almost entirely ignores the very substantial presence of both men and women who have immigrated from asia or are of asian ancestry korean chinese indian pakistani japanese and others the framework also ignores the fact that the major math departments at american colleges and universities include conspicuously large numbers of asian immigrants and people of asian ancestry and only a relatively small number of american born members the princeton math department for example is roughly four fifths foreign born with many of its faculty and graduate students coming from several of the countries of east and south asia as well as from the former soviet union and eastern europe this alone would seem a powerful indication that math like other scientific fields does not operate as whiteness but asians are only minimally mentioned in the framework s many chapters including those about teaching equity and engagement in mathematics though the document does glancingly mention data challenging its assertion that gifted programs favor whites and males it reports that only 8 percent of white students are enrolled in california s math classes for gifted students while this is higher than the percentage of african americans 4 percent and latinos 3 percent it is dwarfed by the percentage of asian americans 32 percent these numbers show that if gifted programs are phased out the students most affected will be overwhelmingly asian i e people of color not whites despite this evidence the framework s central idea is that differences in outcome in math stem entirely from the messages that empower whites and males and undermine girls and people of color it suggests these biased messages are then legitimated by the assertion that the resulting differences in performance are due to talent and ability challenging this paradigm boaler has written that the notion that people are born with different abilities in math has been resoundingly disproved by study after study to support this claim the framework relies heavily on the work of the stanford psychologist carol dweck who has developed a distinction between what she calls a fixed mindset and a growth mindset citing dweck s theory the framework says that many math students especially girls and children of color somehow acquire a fixed mindset the idea that they re not good at math if they could instead acquire a growth mindset namely a belief that they can learn and change and get better they will it s common sense that children who believe they are poor at something are less likely to do well than students who believe they are good at that same thing whether it s math or music or baseball to that point the framework s citation of dweck s theories seems fair but dweck herself has never gone so far as to reject the ideas of innate differences or that some students are better in some subjects than other students or even that acquiring a growth mindset will enable all students to achieve high levels in math or anything else growth mindset is about the idea that abilities are not fixed but rather can be developed and developed not just by hard work but by good strategies and mentoring dweck said in a zoom interview that s it it s not the idea that people are all the same that they have the same abilities or that with application they can necessarily reach the same point sergiu klainerman a professor of mathematics at princeton went further it s very clear that there is talent in math just like there is talent in music he said in a zoom interview you can clearly see when you teach math that there are certain kids that pick it up extremely fast some do reasonably well but have to work hard and there are some for whom it is difficult the differentiation is very clear nevertheless the framework uses its rejection of giftedness as a basis for its chief and most disputed recommendation that accelerated classes and tracking the groupings of students in separate classes according to ability should be eliminated for all california students until the 11th grade until then it proposes that students take the same math courses in the same classrooms with the same teacher this recommendation alone would seem to be based on a remarkably counter intuitive proposition namely that by eliminating fast classes and putting all students into slower ones everybody will in the end somehow achieve more advanced results in support of this idea the framework cites a 2005 study on an experiment in rockville centre new york that tracked math achievement when all students learned together the california framework says summing up the rockville centre experience the students achieved more but rockville centre a small well to do town a few miles outside new york city is hardly comparable to california or any large urban district its population of around 25 000 is 85 percent white and 6 percent black while its mean household income is 166 000 california by contrast is 37 percent white 6 5 percent black 15 5 percent asian and nearly 40 percent hispanic and has some 40 million residents california s mean household income is less than half of rockville centre s the town s wealth enabled it to give a great deal of individualized after school help to lower performing students a fact that led the authors of the study of its experience to ask would the reform work in a district with fewer resources and larger numbers of struggling students more research they said would be needed to answer that question a stock photo shows a classroom fred dufour afp gettyimages moreover what rockville centre did was actually the inverse of what is being proposed in california as the rockville centre report puts it the superintendent of schools there decided that all students would study the accelerated curriculum formerly reserved to the district s highest achievers the curriculum was also algebra based and the measure of student achievement was based on their results on algebra based tests what the framework proposes by contrast is to eliminate the very accelerated program that was the basis for rockville centre s reported success one of the most controversial of the framework s recommendations has precisely to do with algebra far from following the rockville centre model the framework would slow down the math curriculum specifically by moving algebra from 8th grade where many students take it now to 9th grade the rationale for this is that it will eliminate the the rush to calculus which the framework asserts leaves many students getting only a shallow understanding of the basics that they ll need later as evidence the framework cites an article by boaler herself how one city got math right about how the san francisco unified school district delayed its basic algebra 1 course from 8th to 9th grade when it did that boaler reports students getting ds and fs in math dropped by a third and the number of students that had to repeat algebra fell from 40 percent to 8 percent this is progress we can t risk undoing by returning to the failed policies of tracking and early acceleration boaler wrote in 2013 for mathematicians however algebra is the essential building block for all higher math especially advanced placement calculus which many elite colleges expect applicants to have taken in high school and stopping the more gifted students from taking it in 8th grade will mean fewer students doing ap calculus in 12th grade they want to hobble the strong so that everybody will be on an equal footing michael malione a former math teacher in california who has campaigned against adopting the framework said in a zoom conversation malione and others point out that one consequence of the experiment in san francisco was fewer students doing calculus in 12th grade instead more of them pursued a course in ap statistics less challenging than calculus although it could lead to careers in data science moreover as brian conrad a stanford math professor put it the proposed data science pathway would not develop the full range of math skills needed to study data science further data science at the college level uses the very calculus that many students will be ill prepared for if the framework is adopted in its current form this is the shiny new thing conrad said of the framework idea in a zoom conversation adding that at a professional level data science rests on solving massive optimization problems and that is one of the crucial things that calculus does you can t get a non automatable data science degree if you don t know calculus he continued and you need linear algebra too which builds on the skills of high school algebra they think they ve found this treasure trove of math that doesn t require the later traditional stuff some of the framework s findings directly contradict what other experts in math education have found examining california s history of algebra instruction in 2013 according to a paper by scholars williamson evers and ze ev wurman some two thirds of students were taking algebra in the 8th grade fifty five percent of them tested proficient or advanced on the california standards test up from 40 percent in 2002 when most students waited until 9th grade to learn algebra between 2006 and 2012 as algebra was moved to 8th grade from 9th the number of college ready math students rose from 16 000 to 31 000 they found let s say it s a good idea for 40 percent of kids to wait klainerman said but imagine a class in which you have three or four levels maybe that will work out for that 40 percent of the class but the 30 percent who are the top kids will be bored to death you re going to sacrifice 30 percent of the kids for what
