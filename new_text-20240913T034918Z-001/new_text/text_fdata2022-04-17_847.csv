in jackson workers camp out in cars and tents in cheyenne hundreds commute from neighboring towns meanwhile laramie is struggling to attract new businesses wyoming public media reported last year all because of an affordable housing shortage lawmakers will look for solutions during this year s interim legislative session the interim session is the legislature s brainstorming period lawmakers meet to research dozens of issues affecting the state and blueprint bills to address them earlier this month the joint corporations elections and political subdivisions committee named workforce housing as its second highest priority for the interim it ll be new territory for lawmakers said rep dan zwonitzer r cheyenne co chair of the committee housing reform has had a fringe following in the wyoming legislature for years especially among teton county lawmakers for the most part though the state s left the matter to local governments and housing groups to sort out and they tried said brenda birkle head of cheyenne s affordable housing task force and executive director of my front door a nonprofit that helps first time home buyers it wasn t enough attempts to manage it elsewhere outside of the legislature have failed she said meanwhile the affordable housing shortage is only getting worse advocates and officials told the star tribune especially since the start of the coronavirus pandemic the committee s aim is two fold zwonitzer said figure out why and what can be done about it i don t think there s a clear end point of where we want to get to zwonitzer said it s really a survey of the field and what possibilities are before us the first task is nailing down the problem the committee will consult a variety of groups for help including housing advocates realtors and construction companies zwonitzer said what is workforce housing anyway housing organizations often use the term to mean housing for low or middle income workers especially those employed in major industries and essential services in teton county that d be housing for those tourism and hospitality jobs for instance some housing groups define workforce housing by income level instead in those cases the term usually refers to housing for people making around 50 to 120 of their community s area median income in teton county that s roughly 43 500 to 104 500 that same bracket in laramie county would be 33 500 to 80 400 according to data from the u s department of housing and urban development hud birkle s organization my front door primarily serves people who make a little less than that between 30 and 80 of the area median income that s around 26 100 to 69 600 in teton county and 20 073 to 53 528 in laramie county according to hud data while quality housing is often woefully out of reach for households in this bracket they make up a huge portion of the population birkle said helping them could have an enormous impact on stabilizing the workforce she said really if you want to break the poverty cycle permanently it s in that group she said so what about solutions birkle urged the committee to lean on nonprofits that work in workforce housing for help finding some direction dan dorsch special projects coordinator for habitat for humanity of laramie county recommended housing trust funds as a potential starting point dorsch also sits on cheyenne s affordable housing task force housing trust funds set aside pools of money for affordable housing programs there are a few different ways the state could pay for one dorsch explained federal programs are available through the national housing trust fund but they can be difficult to navigate and have a lot of red tape that smaller organizations don t have the capacity to access he said in an email local housing trust funds make it easier to access funds and can be used in conjunction with federal dollars he added dorsch pointed to iowa s state housing trust fund program as a potential model wyoming lawmakers have no shortage of their own ideas for addressing the housing shortage teton county delegates have long floated the so called mcmansion tax bill for example to prop up jackon s housing programs that legislation would let counties pull in extra cash by taxing high end real estate transfers the latest version of the bill which was sponsored by the joint revenue committee failed its introductory vote on the house floor in february shelly duncan r lingle spoke against the mcmansion tax during the 2022 legislative session duncan works in real estate and said the tax unfairly burdens commercial property owners and home buyers duncan who is a member of the corporations committee is in favor of creating a state agency to keep stock of housing needs and coordinate relief efforts in times of crisis we need to take a holistic look across the entire state she said it could also serve as wyoming s fair housing office duncan said wyoming is one of just a handful of states without an agency to enforce housing discrimination law housing and zoning codes could also go under the microscope during the interim session the laws are there to keep our communities orderly but they often make it harder to build new homes especially high density housing duncan said photos getting a second chance with erap hide and seek at the sohl s kassandra shelley leclere kassandra kassandra kassandra

this photo illustration shows japanese 1 000 yen and 1 us dollar banknotes in tokyo on wednesday afp photo washington twitter moved on friday to defend itself against elon musk s 43 billion hostile takeover bid announcing a poison pill plan that would make it harder for the billionaire to get a controlling stake musk s proposed buyout faces several hazards including possible rejection and the challenge of assembling the money but could have significant impacts on the key social media service if consummated twitter said its board unanimously adopted a so called shareholder rights plan also known as a poison pill which kicks in if an investor buys more than 15 per cent in shares without the directors agreement musk holds 9 per cent the maneuver makes it harder for a buyer to build too big of a stake without board approval by triggering an option that allows other investors to buy more of a company s shares at a discount twitter said the plan which experts consider a potent tool against corporate raiders does not prevent discussing or even agreeing to an acquisition musk sent shockwaves through the tech world on thursday with an unsolicited bid to buy the company stating the promotion of freedom of speech on twitter as a key motive for what he called his best and final offer the world s richest person offered 54 20 a share which values the social media firm at some 43 billion in a filing with the securities and exchange commission he has not directly addressed the poison pill but tweeted after his bid was announced that the board would face titanic legal liability if it goes against the interests of shareholders in rejecting his offer analyst dan ives predicted that the board s move would not be viewed positively by shareholders given both the potential dilution of stock and the signal it sends of hostility towards being bought he foresaw a likely court challenge musk has already acknowledged he was not sure he would succeed and refused to elaborate on a plan b though in the filing he noted a rejection would make him consider selling his existing shares he also said he could technically afford the buyout while offering no information on financing though he would likely need to borrow money or part with some of his mountain of tesla or spacex shares some investors had already spoken against the proposal including businessman and saudi prince alwaleed bin talal morningstar research analysts echoed that perspective saying while the board will take the tesla ceo s offer into consideration we believe the probability of twitter accepting it is likely below 50 per cent twitter stock closed down nearly 2 per cent thursday musk s move throws another curve into the roller coaster ride of his volatile relationship with the global social media service and raises many questions about what comes next he was offered a seat on the board but turned it down over the weekend musk s shock offer to buy twitter drew worries and some cheers over putting the platform in the hands of a mercurial billionaire who advocates generally for few limits on what users can post he provided some detail on thursday on his vision saying he would like to lift the veil on the algorithm that runs on the platform even allowing people to look through it and suggest changes he also reiterated his support for a more hands off approach to policing the platform a thorny matter particularly in high profile cases such as donald trump who was banned after the assault on the us capitol last year critics argued that free speech absolutism on social media can be very messy in the real world i am frightened by the impact on society and politics if elon musk acquires twitter tweeted max boot a washington post columnist on thursday he seems to believe that on social media anything goes for democracy to survive we need more content moderation not less boot added still musk was rallying support on twitter where he has over 81 million followers for the fight ahead thanks for the support he tweeted in reply to a poll that overwhelming backed his bid

even for the richest person on the planet buying twitter was always going to be a challenge a highly complex financial transaction now made even trickier by a defensive poison pill move from the platform s board musk s 43b offer lays out the myriad potential pitfalls possible government approvals legal as well as regulatory due diligence negotiations of a final agreement and of course how to pay for it all then twitter s board on friday showed it wouldn t go quietly saying any acquisition of over 15pc of the firm s stock without its ok would trigger a plan to flood the market with shares and thus make a buyout much harder your move elonmusk tweeted silicon valley journalist kara swisher the offer itself which musk said was final values twitter at 54 20 per share above the closing price ahead of his bid but below a high of 77 06 hit in february of last year even with a moderate and inflexible proposal which could help the board argue for rejection it is a fraught moment that could end in lawsuits from just about everyone involved to succeed in repelling musk s offer the twitter board will need to be on solid ground making an argument that the company is worth more said wharton school finance professor kevin kaiser shareholders who feel that the board is rejecting a profitable deal will be free to file lawsuits against twitter musk has the option of sidestepping the board and trying to buy shares directly from shareholders on the market but that could lead to tedious negotiations with some stockowners holding out for more money the twitter board has limited ability under delaware law to stop a tender offer made directly to the shareholders which elon musk hasn t done but which he could do if he chose to kaiser said if he does this and if the shareholders elect to tender their shares then he can succeed without needing board support or approval while the serial entrepreneur s net worth is estimated at 265b by forbes his fortune is not sitting in a bank account waiting to be spent musk said at a ted conference that he had sufficient funds to consummate the deal but financial analysts describe the situation as more complicated much of musk s wealth comes from shares of electric carmaker tesla which he runs musk would need to turn a chunk of his tesla holding into cash either by selling shares or by taking out loans with stock as collateral the specifics of how musk would finance the deal will determine the ramifications for twitter moody s said in a note to investors moody s estimated it would cost musk 39b to buy all the outstanding twitter shares and that there would be a strong chance he would have to repay or refinance the san francisco based company s billions of dollars of existing debt that was before the poison pill move by twitter that ramps up the cost for musk musk tweeted a poll that hinted he might be thinking of taking his bid directly to shareholders he asked whether taking the company private for his offered price should be up to shareholders and not the board as the poll neared its close on friday more than 2 7mn votes had been cast with nearly 84pc of them in favour of the idea selling a massive amount of shares in tesla to buy twitter would come with a large tax bill based on capital gains and could cause shares in the electric car company to sink as the market is flooded with stock for sale musk could keep hold of his shares and get a loan absorbing the interest payments on the other hand he could team up with a deep pocketed partner but that could come with the strong willed executive having someone to answer to regarding his decisions at twitter

in a surprising move tesla has suddenly discontinued its longstanding practice of including charging equipment with its vehicles tesla ceo elon musk replied to comments on twitter about the new policy by saying usage statistics were super low so seemed wasteful every electric vehicle produced up until 2022 has included as standard equipment some sort of charging equipment in the early days of evs most vehicles came with a simple 120 v portable charging cord more recently though many manufacturers are including dual voltage portable charging equipment that allows the user to toggle between 120 volt and 240 v charging by switching an adapter on the unit however the kia ev6 that was just recently launched does not come with any charging equipment either making it the first ev sold in north america that didn t come with any form of charging equipment tesla has always provided a dual voltage mobile connector and as they are in many ways has been a leader in providing exceptional portable charging equipment as standard equipment with all of its vehicles however that practice is over tesla no longer includes charging equipment with its cars new owners will need to purchase charging equipment before they take delivery of their vehicle or they won t have a way to charge it when they get it home they could of course use tesla superchargers but one of the best aspects of electric vehicles is the ability to plug in at home and charge the car up overnight while you re sleeping quite often first time ev buyers will use the 120 v charging cord when they first take delivery of their ev until they figure out what equipment they want to buy and install in their garage since the 120 v charging equipment can plug into a simple household outlet the owners have a way to charge their evs right from day one albeit in a slow way that s because while charging on a 120 v source the vehicles will only replenish about 3 5 miles of range for every hour of charging but that will work for most people in the short term until they decide on a permanent solution many tesla owners chose to install a nema 14 50 outlet and use the mobile connector with the nema 14 50 adapter for all of their daily charging needs they did however need to purchase the nema 14 50 adapter from the tesla website for 35 00 tesla used to include the nema 14 50 adapter with the mobile connector but discontinued that practice in 2019 since then only the 120 v nema 5 15 adapter came standard with eh mobile connector besides using the portable charging equipment for daily charging many ev owners like to have some kind of portable evse in the vehicle at all times just in case they find themselves in need of a boost somewhere even if they never use it which is most likely what elon was referring to when he said usage statistics were very low having it there just in case provided peace of mind for many in concert with discontinuing the practice of including the mobile connector with its vehicles tesla now offers two versions of the unit customers can purchase a 120 v version with a nema 5 15 plug for 275 00 or a higher powered 240 v unit with nema 14 50 plug for 400 both versions of the tesla mobile connector are out of stock can t even currently buy one but here s the kicker both units are currently out of stock therefore you cannot even buy one now if you re about to take delivery of your new tesla we re also not sure if customers that ordered their tesla s when the policy was to include the mobile connector with the vehicle will still receive it when their order is filled we d love to ask the automaker for clarification but tesla doesn t respond to questions from journalists therefore we re left to speculate i ve started a poll on my twitter account for tesla owners to chime in on whether or not they currently use their mobile connector the fact that these units are out of stock leads us to assume tesla is experiencing supply chain issues regarding parts for the mobile connector that may have actually been the impetus behind the decision to discontinue including it with the vehicle perhaps tesla simply cannot keep up with the supply and decided it would be easier and cost effective at the same time to just drop it from the standard equipment whatever the reason could this be a sign of things to come for the entire industry we mentioned earlier that kia isn t including charging equipment with the ev6 maybe that s going to be the trend moving forward we do believe that there will come a time when it won t be necessary to include charging equipment with every vehicle perhaps once the majority of the population is on their 2nd or 3rd ev but that s probably more than a decade away for now we believe it s still good policy to supply new owners with a way to recharge their vehicles on day one of ownership without requiring them to have purchased and installed charging equipment beforehand update 4 17 22 last night musk tweeted that based on feedback tesla will reduce the price of the mobile connector to 200 we checked the tesla website and the price was still listed as 275 00 however it is easter sunday today so we wouldn t expect the new price to be updated until tomorrow anyway he also recommended installing a tesla wall connector before customers take delivery

hollywood still hasn t come to grip with winston churchill and his plan to exterminate german civilians in the recent movie darkest hour they portray churchill as a man of the people church did everything he could to avoid a bloody war with germany darkest hour tells us and he even asked the average person about their opinions on how to avoid the looming war with hitler as we shall see this is complete baloney but that s not all gary oldman who stars as winston churchill in the biopic made even more stupid statements when he declared that churchill was the man who saved the world that s what i hope people will take away to see the film and realize oh boy we came very close to a different way of living when oldman was asked the question what do you want audiences to talk away from the film he responded it highlights the fortitude and resilience and the humanity of its leader winston churchill we screened the movie and i could forgive the americans for not knowing the history but i was amazed that britons didn t really know it either if you like a good laugh then consider this when oldman was again asked what did you learn about churchill while shooting the film he said his stock rose considerably i realize that this was a man he was incomparable i don t know if you could equate him or contrast him with other leaders i think perhaps he s there up with washington and lincoln the achievements he was a superman an indispensable figure the humanity of winston churchill did oldman have a different churchill in mind when he said this did he actually know churchill s track record even during world war i what darkest hour teaches us is simply this gone is the true history of winston churchill all that is left is hollywood s deliberately distorted and dubious account of the man who did not hesitate to kill multiplied thousands of civilians to please his bosses even the irish independent had this to say back in 2012 everything people believed about hitler s intentions toward britain was a myth created by churchill for example churchill perpetuated the categorical lie that hitler desired to invade britain in 1940 but it was a total fabrication on the contrary hitler admired the british empire and that he offered terms that did not involve german control of britain churchill refused to allow these terms to be read to the cabinet and they remain prudently concealed under the 100 year rule the same newspaper rightly reported instead churchill s determination to keep britain at war turned what had been merely a continental defeat of its army into the enduring myth that in 1940 britain faced a war for national survival but the german naval leader raeder had repeatedly forbidden his staff from planning an invasion of britain and far from wanting to continue the war in june 1940 hitler ordered 20pc of his army to be demobilized in order to get the german economy going again the invasion fleet that the nazis began to assemble that summer was no more capable of invading britain than it was hawaii it was war by illusion its purpose was to get the british to the negotiating table perhaps the bigger issue is that churchill concocted deliberate lies about hitler because he was working for the powers that be in fact right after his father s death churchill became ernest cassel s creature one of the most influential jewish moneylenders then once that happened churchill began to hate the germans in the process he starved the german civilians to death and bragged about it this is churchill at his best starve the whole population men women and children old and young wounded and sound into submission churchill got his wish in december 1918 the german board of public health claimed that 763 000 germans had died because of the blockade in april 1919 dr marx rubner claimed that another 100 000 germans who died between april and the signing of the treaty of versailles in july so the number of germans who died from winston churchill s starvation blockade most probably approximates the number of irish who died during the great famine gary oldman should have told his interviewer that churchill ended up joining the greatest mass murderer stalin in the twentieth century in order to defeat hitler in 2013 popular historian max hastings wrote in the daily mail that churchill did summon bold lies to wage war but those lies were good because churchill did it to save britain churchill the mass murdering clown churchill was an avowed social darwinist and flaming zionist at the same time churchill became prime minister in 1940 during his speech he unequivocally declared you ask what is our policy i will say it is to wage war by sea land and air with all our might here once again we see the incestuous relationship or competition between the darwinian ideology and jewish subversive movements both zionism and darwinism support the promiscuous idea that wars will bring about the greatest good at the expense of the weak and needy wars according to darwin is inevitable because the higher animals need to wipe out the lower ones the malthusian doctrine said darwin could be applied with manifold force to the whole animal and vegetable kingdoms in that sense the preservation of favoured races in the struggle for life which incidentally is the subtitle of darwin s on the origin of species is of primary importance darwin in a covert and pernicious way subverted the moral order and replaced it with the favoured races it was no coincidence that colonial empires were viewed in a darwinian terminology as one historian puts it contemporaries explained this rush for land in terms of darwin s evolutionary theories the fittest and most adaptable of the great powers would survive and grow stronger at the expense of the enfeebled as churchill observed in 1899 the position of england among the nations is the position of a dog with a bone in the midst of a hungry pack at one point churchill said i hate indians they are a beastly people with a beastly religion toye writes that churchill gave his views on the indian famine of 1873 4 claiming that viceroy had been right to refuse demands that he prohibit grain exports another observer writes that churchill had corroborated malthus s perspective writing of an 1898 indian plague a philosopher may watch unmoved the destruction of some of those superfluous millions whose life must of necessity be destitute of pleasure churchill said elsewhere i am strongly in favour of using poisoned gas against uncivilized tribes the moral effect should be so good that the loss of life should be reduced to a minimum darwin used similar words to describe uncivilized men in fact darwin constantly used phrases such as higher animals to describe how the powerful would eliminate the weak following darwin s ideology churchill declared i do not admit for instance that a great wrong has been done to the red indians of america or the black people of australia i do not admit a wrong has been to those people by the fact that a stronger race a higher grade race or a more worldly wise race has come in and taken their place when people were objecting to his views about poisoned gas churchill said that they were being too squeamish adding that the objections of the india office to the use of gas against natives are unreasonable gas is a merciful weapon than high explosive shell and compels an enemy to accept a decision with less loss of life than any other agency of war why is it not fair for a british artilleryman to fire a shell which makes the said native sneeze it is really too silly it got even better when an aide pointed out that tito intended to transform yugoslavia into a communist dictatorship on the soviet model churchill responded by saying do you intend to live there churchill as should be evident by now has a history of liquidating civilians mercilessly he said way back in 1915 right after world war i broke out i know this war is smashing and shattering the lives of thousands every moment and yet i cannot help it i love every second i live churchill continued the twin roots of all our evils nazi germany and prussian militarism must be extirpated until this is achieved there are no sacrifices we will not make and no lengths in violence to which we will not go when stalin was sending people by the millions to the bolshevik slaughter house churchill thought it was a great idea he said why are we making a fuss about the russian deportations in rumania of saxons and others i cannot see the russians are wrong in making 100 or 150 thousand of these people work their passage i cannot myself consider that it is wrong of the russians to take rumanians of any origin they like to work in the russian coal fields again after the destruction of dresden churchill tried very hard to wash his hands off he said i cannot recall anything about it i thought the americans did it when all is said and done it was pretty clear to perceptive observers and historians that churchill and roosevelt intended to destroy germany by 1919 churchill already had blood all over his hands we are enforcing the blockade with rigour he said and germany is very near starvation when the dust settled churchill ended up slaughtering almost 90 000 german civilians he also was responsible for the deaths of more than a million indians britain s wartime prime minister did not discuss in his six volume account the 1943 famine in the eastern indian province of bengal which killed 1 5 million people by the official estimate and 3 million by most others one primary cause of the famine was the extent to which churchill and his advisers chose to use resources of india to wage a war against germany and japan causing scarcity and inflation within the colony this is the man that hollywood the entire holocaust establishment the neoconservative movement and outlets like the rolling stone revere the rolling stone the bbc and the guardian actually hope that oldman will receive an oscar for his performance as churchill in the darkest hour in a review of the film a o scott of the new york times declares that churchill enjoys the push and pull of politics the intellectual labor of problem solving and the daily adventure of being himself we are also told that darkest hour is proud of its hero proud of itself and proud to have come down on the right side of history nearly 80 years after the fact it wants you to share that pride and to claim a share of it what is missing in these flattering and sweeping pronouncements is that the average person never gets to know who churchill really was was a mass murdering clown whose god was mammon and whose diabolical enterprise left germany and india in ruin churchill was willing to steal kill and destroy the people who actually put him in power hollywood and the neoconservatives have been deliberately ignoring or dismissing the historical accounts on churchill in order to maintain the historically incoherent view that churchill was fighting against international terrorism and tyranny what these people end up saying is that german civilians and indians were incontrovertibly terrorists first published on january 5 2018

washington d c due to strong consumer demand pandemic related supply chain issues and russia s invasion of ukraine which are continuing to fuel the highest inflation in decades wholesale prices in the u s surged again in march this week the labor department said its producer price index which measures wholesale inflation at pre consumer levels surged 11 2 percent in march from a year ago with prices rising by 1 4 percent per month an increase from february when this figure rose by just 0 9 percent economists who took part in a refinitiv survey predict producer inflation to rise by 10 6 percent per year and 1 1 percent from the previous month core inflation at the wholesale level which excludes the more volatile food and energy sectors increased 0 9 percent in march after a 0 2 percent increase in february also in march diesel fuel prices led cost increases surging 20 4 percent during the month over half of the broad based increase in march can be traced to a 5 7 percent jump in prices for energy costs according to the labor department last month the overall prices of goods jumped 2 3 percent while prices for services rose 0 9 percent meanwhile a separate labor department showed consumer prices climbed 8 5 percent in march from the previous year the largest increase since december 1981 the federal reserve which has been more proactive fighting inflation in recent months will also be concerned about the data in march policymakers raised rates by a 0 25 percentage points and have indicated further support for a faster half point increase at their may meeting the minutes from the fed s march meeting stated many participants noted that one or more increases in the target range could be appropriate at future meetings particularly if inflation pressures remained elevated or intensified fed chairman jerome powell has pushed back against concerns that further fiscal tightening will trigger a recession remaining optimistic that the fed can achieve a delicate balance between controlling inflation and supporting the economy
agnormark istock via getty images the q1 earnings season for the gold miners index gdx is just around the corner and one of the first companies to report its preliminary results was barrick gold nyse gold overall barrick had a decent start to 2022 with production at 22 5 of its guidance mid point with q1 expected to be the weakest quarter of the year fortunately higher metals prices picked up some of this slack and this tailwind will remain in place for q2 with barrick s technical picture improving and the company potentially shifting to growth later this decade i continue to see barrick as a solid buy the dip candidate nevada gold mines llc operations company presentation barrick gold released its preliminary q1 results last week reporting quarterly production of 990 000 ounces of gold and 101 million pounds of copper this translated to a 10 decline in gold production and an 8 increase in copper production year over year while this might appear disappointing at first glance on the gold side of the business it s important to note that the weak q1 production was largely expected besides even with the softer results barrick is well on its way to meeting its guidance mid point of 4 4 million ounces of gold let s take a closer look at the quarter below as shown in the chart below barrick saw its lowest gold production in more than two years with production coming in at just 990 000 ounces down from 1 10 million ounces in q1 2021 and 1 25 million ounces in q1 2020 however it is essential to note that there have been changes in the portfolio since then with barrick seeing a 60 000 ounce headwind from porgera relative to the 1 25 million ounces produced in q1 2020 given that the operation remains offline currently following a revised framework with the papua new guinea government adjusting for porgera which will come back into the portfolio production is not down nearly as much on a two year basis barrick gold quarterly gold production company filings author s chart if we dig into the chart a little closer we can see that it was a solid quarter for loulu gounkoto with 138 000 ounces produced but this still led to a decline year over year due to tough comps q1 2021 154 000 ounces meanwhile veladero had a better quarter with production up over 40 to 46 000 ounces unfortunately at nearly every other asset production was lower the largest decliners were pueblo viejo at 104 000 ounces vs 137 000 ounces in q1 2021 tongon at 35 000 ounces vs 48 000 ounces and hemlo at 31 000 ounces vs 47 000 ounces the lower production at tongon was related to mine sequencing while kibali s production was more than 10 lower due to planned maintenance elsewhere in canada hemlo has continued to struggle with the company working on getting that mine back on track this was partially out of barrick s control due to covid 19 restrictions making it difficult to get australian teams to canada slowing down the ramp up of underground development in its q3 2021 results the company noted that it could take up to 18 months to pick up momentum at this asset which fortunately is a very small contributor to barrick s production profile barrick gold nevada attributable gold production company filings author s chart finally moving over to barrick s shared nevada operations it was a much weaker quarter with just 459 000 ounces from its share of nevada gold mines llc down from 485 000 ounces in q1 2021 the lower production in the period was mostly related to turquoise ridge which saw a decline in production due to planned maintenance with just 67 000 ounces produced in q1 q1 2021 92 000 ounces meanwhile phoenix and long canyon contributed a combined 48 000 ounces in q1 2022 down from 64 000 ounces in q1 2021 the two largest contributors cortez and carlin saw flat production on a year over year basis this was related to the depletion of stockpiled high grade underground ore processed in q4 following the mechanical mill failure at the goldstrike roaster in q2 of last year the good news is that while gold production was much lower year over year barrick will see much of this slack picked up by the higher gold price the reason is that barrick s average realized gold price came in at 1 877 oz in q1 2022 up from 1 777 oz in q1 2021 offsetting most of the 10 decline in year over year production gold futures price tc2000 com copper production moving to barrick s copper business which has been a solid contributor thanks to higher copper prices we saw an 8 increase in copper production to 101 million pounds this was helped by higher production at all three of its assets with zalvidar and jabal sayid combining for 44 million pounds vs 42 million pounds last year meanwhile although lumwana saw a sequential decline in production to 57 million pounds this figure was up year over year and will continue to improve as the year progresses as throughput increases the combination of higher production and a 10 higher realized copper price will lead to another very strong quarter for the copper business in q1 barrick gold quarterly copper production company filings author s chart margins looking at barrick s aisc margins below we can see that margins have declined since q3 2020 this is due to barrick being up against difficult comps related to reduced impacts from inflationary pressures in the q3 2020 period relative to more recent periods and a record gold price logged in q3 2020 based on barrick guiding for much higher costs in q1 2022 vs q4 2021 due to the lower production and sales i would expect further margin compression in q1 2022 with aisc margins likely to come in below 725 oz the good news though is that this trend should begin to reverse in q2 2022 barrick gold quarterly aisc aisc margins company filings author s chart estimates this is because barrick should enjoy an average realized gold price above 1 910 oz in q2 2022 while its all in sustaining costs will decline sharply on a sequential basis helped by higher sales this should push aisc margins back above the 800 oz mark in line with or better than q4 2021 levels meanwhile with a strong second half planned and assuming the gold price can hold above the 1 875 oz level we should see slight margin expansion in h2 2022 so while i expect weaker margins in q1 i don t see any reason to get hung on this short term margin compression reko diq while barrick has invested heavily in the past couple of years to maintain visibility into its long term production profile the one missing piece was growth which can be quite difficult for a company of its size similar to newmont nem however the surprise positive development at reko diq with a new framework in place could fix this issue this is because barrick has noted that it could begin production at reko diq by 2027 with this massive copper gold porphyry project potentially adding up to 200 000 ounces of gold and 350 million pounds of copper per annum to its production profile over a 40 year mine life reko diq project pakistan company presentation while this wouldn t move the needle materially from a gold production standpoint based on its 2026 outlook of just over 4 5 million ounces of gold it would certainly move the needle from a copper standpoint this is because barrick s fy2026 production under its 5 year outlook was expected to come in at 500 million pounds but could grow to 850 million pounds of copper within ten years once phase 2 is in production a parallel circuit producing copper gold concentrate at current copper prices which could be much higher post 2030 this would provide a significant boost to revenue with the potential for revenue of more than 1 50 billion per annum from reko diq s copper contribution alone given that there s no recent study completed on the project and production is at least five years away 10 years away for full production in phase 2 i believe it s premature to assign more than 850 million in attributable net asset value to the project when factoring in a higher discount rate however even at this figure this increases barrick s net asset value by nearly 0 50 per share placing its total net asset value near 20 00 per share based on what i believe to be a fair multiple of 1 40x p nav i see a fair value for the stock of just over 28 00 per share of course the other bonus outside of a minor increase in net asset value is that barrick appears like it could have some growth in the copper department even if its gold production profile may remain relatively flat looking out to 2030 at least under its current assumptions for novagold ng this recent discussion on reko diq and what appears to be a strong commitment towards the project could be a negative pushing out potential production at its donlin creek project number of primary gold discoveries minex consulting q4 2019 average grade of gold mined in the world minex consulting mudd 2010 while this growth profile still pales compared to other large producers like agnico aem which could grow production by 30 by 2030 this is an upgrade for barrick which has been otherwise thought of as a no growth company this is not a knock against it given that it is extremely difficult to grow production long term for a 5 million ounce producer the reason is that it s very challenging to maintain grades at existing operations and major new gold discoveries are becoming less significant each year with much of the low hanging fruit already discovered this is despite increased exploration spending since 2016 so any potential growth for a company of barrick s size would be an impressive feat and reko diq may be the answer technical picture looking at barrick s monthly chart below the best time to own the stock has been when it s been trending higher above its monthly moving averages highlighted by the green shaded area these periods have in some cases led to power trends 1986 1994 with a 51 annualized return and in other cases they ve provided respectable returns 10 annualized from q2 1995 to q4 1996 meanwhile while not all breaks below the monthly moving averages red shaded areas have been disastrous some have been very turbulent with a negative 40 annualized return in the 1997 1998 period and a similar return in the 2012 2015 bear market barrick gold monthly chart 1986 2003 tc2000 com fortunately as of march s close barrick has moved back into this favorable zone reclaiming its key moving averages on march s close while this certainly doesn t guarantee another power trend like the 1986 1994 period it does increase the probability of sharp pullbacks being bought we saw this in late 2016 and q1 2020 with dips to this moving average being bought up immediately barrick s monthly moving average is currently sitting near 21 20 suggesting that this is the likely floor for the stock medium term if we do see a sharp pullback barrick gold monthly chart tc2000 com overall barrick had a satisfactory start to the year from a production standpoint and while margins will decline sharply on a sequential basis in q1 i would ignore the weak q1 results this is because output will steadily increase post q1 the stock has reclaimed upside momentum and it may be able to move back to growth later this decade with the addition of reko diq given this favorable outlook combined with a more generous dividend framework i see barrick as a hold if we were to see a sharp pullback as we head into a weaker seasonal period for gdx in the summer i would view this as a buying opportunity

pakistan has had its fair share of men with a saviour complex and it has been seen always as a damsel that needs rescuing from above by those to whom ordinary rules need not apply here s ayub telling us that parliamentary democracy does not suit the genius of the people of pakistan here s zia telling us through his cheshire grin that his conscience is 200 percent clear while also reminding us that he gets to decide what is best for the people because i m a martial law administrator you are forgetting and on the constitution memorably he had this to say what is the constitution it is a booklet with ten or twelve pages i can tear them up and say that from tomorrow we shall live under a different system is there anybody to stop me the constitution of course is much longer than ten or twelve pages but general zia is hardly much of an authority on the topic but now here s general musharraf cutting it down further still i think a constitution is just a piece of paper to be thrown in the dustbin and now here s imran khan having advised the president to dissolve the national assembly after the speaker s unlawful dismissal of a vote of no confidence and having attempted to obstruct the supreme court s directions right down to the last minute he now plaintively asks what he ever did that was so unlawful the pti has long considered itself to be an outsider to politics even as it has packed its ranks with insiders it has continued to believe in its own purity of purpose and higher calling and with that has come the sense of exceptionalism that the only path to tabdeeli is through a two third supermajority with no room for dissent that otherwise ordinances can cut past the rest of parliament that it is preferable to effectively hand such numbers over to the new government than honour the peoples mandate as members of the opposition if the pti s last few weeks made one thing clear it s that imran khan is more interested in constitution avenue than he is in the constitution the constitution matters only when it matters and followers have followed suit at times they turn back to the constitution relying on half baked hand me down interpretations of parliamentary privilege under article 69 and loyalty to the state under article 5 1 at others they decide the constitution does not matter at all declaring it to be a means for the elite to remain the elite upon imran khan s election as prime minister in a heartfelt congratulatory message jemima added that the challenge now is to remember why he entered politics in the place it s hard to argue that he spent his time in office with anything close to perfect recall but now out of office and back on the containers where he is most comfortable it seems to be coming back to imran khan and his resolute followers not too long ago the stock response to journalist abductions was where there s smoke there s fire not too long ago peca s teeth were being sharpened against political dissent not too long ago speech critical of the government led to charges of sedition not too long ago baloch students were beaten up and left in the rain in the federal capital for demanding the release of hafeez baloch today imran khan s supporters call the military high command by name as they hold up placards in defiance of one way vigo rides as twitter trends run into uncharted territory pti supporters conduct headcounts in hyde park her majesty s voluntary subjects assure pakistanis that they will be free one day huddled around a barbecue grill somewhere in the united states of suburbia a group of revolutionaries burn expired pakistani passports to protest a now practically debunked conspiracy by the other country whose passports they hold today even the reference against justice isa was a misguided mistake journalists being silenced is once again condemnable arbitrary additions to no fly lists are again reprehensible political raids on homes are again unconscionable it s good to have imran khan back but as with everyone else he won t be here long because all of these things are as bad today as they were yesterday and as they will be tomorrow regardless of who is in government but that would be a position driven by principle not power these recent revelations rather transparently have less to do with the rediscovery of principle and more to do with the rude realization that so many have had after taking a bite of the hand that feeds not too long ago imran khan praised the military for non interference in politics a month ago asking for interference he declared neutrality to be a trait of animals but even as the pti calls out intervention in politics they don t call out the act of interference they call out a specific interferer this is no heroic stand against intervention it is an outburst against the denial of an intervention of the pti s choosing the former prime minister s complaint now is only that he wasn t thrown a lifejacket imran khan at the end of the day is a believer in saviours who are above the law even as the pti has decided to leave with a bang as opposed to fizzling out with a whimper the reverberations won t shake the real columns of power not too long ago it was the pml n that had the same name on their tongues not too long ago it was they who complained about censorship of speech but when it came to legislation that demanded the same page it bore unanimous approval as it sailed through parliament politicians will fight and bicker amongst one another they will lay a minefield one year and walk all over it the next and they will rinse and repeat consider article 62 1 f the constitutional litmus test for sadaaqat and amaanat first introduced by zia parliament has had ample time to amend the provision as late as the 18th amendment parliament considered its removal from the constitution but of course the move was opposed by the pml n seven years after the 18th amendment the pml n became the first political party to have a pm removed under article 62 1 f a year later the supreme court declared that the disqualification would be for life or take the law of sedition that rotten relic of the british crown that we decided to keep and wield against one another in 2014 imran khan found himself on the receiving end of sedition charges in 2020 imran khan was prime minister as the ict administration charged peaceful protesters of the awp with sedition the same year police filed sedition charges against nawaz sharif and now in 2022 the sharifs are back and suggesting that imran khan be charged with sedition commenting before the turn of the new century on the effect of propaganda on the us elections chomsky wrote the public is not to see where power lies how it shapes policy and for what ends rather people are to hate and fear one another it s safe to say that as things stand hate is in abundance even as they converge upon common grievances there are no bridges on the horizon and this suits the hand that feeds just fine in netflix s narcos pablo escobar says the men of always aren t interested in the children of never that is just as true in pakistan as it was in medellin the children will come and go but the men of

in a court filing out late friday shareholders who are suing tesla and ceo elon musk over alleged securities fraud said they won part of a critical ruling in their class action lawsuit the shareholders are suing tesla over money they lost after musk tweeted in 2018 that he was considering taking his electric vehicle company private at 420 per share and said he had funding secured to do so tesla s stock trading initially halted then shares were highly volatile for weeks after the tweets musk later said that he had been in discussions with saudi arabia s sovereign wealth fund and felt confident that funding would come through at his proposed price a deal never materialized the securities and exchange commission investigated and charged musk with civil securities fraud as a result of those tweets tesla and musk struck a revised settlement agreement in 2019 over those charges but musk is trying to terminate that agreement now damages from the shareholders class action lawsuit could amount to billions of dollars that would be paid by musk and tesla to those who are members of the class the shareholders attorneys said in the filing out friday that judge edward m chen who is presiding in this matter had concluded that musk acted with scienter in other words that he knowingly made false statements about having funding secured when he tweeted this information was revealed in a request the shareholders lawyers made for a temporary restraining order against musk to stop him from making further public remarks about aspects of this case as he did during a widely viewed appearance at the ted 2022 conference on april 14 the request for the temporary restraining order alludes to an earlier ruling by judge chen that is currently under seal because it refers to evidence that musk s team regarded as confidential we anticipate the order will be published soon adam apton of levi korsinsky lead counsel for the class of tesla shareholders told cnbc by email at the ted conference on thursday musk called financial regulators in the sec s san francisco office bastards musk also said the sec knew that funding was secured but they pursued an active public investigation nonetheless at the time tesla was in a precarious financial situation and i was told by the banks that if i did not agree to settle with the sec that they would the banks would cease providing working capital and tesla would go bankrupt immediately so that s like having a gun to your child s head i was forced to concede to the sec unlawfully it s not clear why musk felt he may have been unable to obtain working capital for tesla but confident he could muster the billions required to take the company private at the same time musk is currently the richest person in the world on paper and is trying to acquire twitter his social media platform of choice and take it private for around 43 billion musk s attorney alex spiro a partner at quinn emanuel urquhart sullivan said in a statement emailed to cnbc nothing will ever change the truth which is that elon musk was considering taking tesla private and could have all that s left some half decade later is random plaintiffs lawyers trying to make a buck and others trying to block that truth from coming to light all to the detriment of free speech spiro gave the same statement to bloomberg which first reported on new developments in the shareholders class action a trial date is currently set for may 31 2022 in a san francisco federal court but that could change levi korsinsky s apton told cnbc we look forward to proving the rest of our case at trial and recovering damages on behalf of the class
april 17 2022 12 57 am updated 06 59 pm ist the story so far on april 12 sri lanka announced its decision to default on its foreign debt of 51 billion tarnishing its track record of promptly servicing past loans citing the international monetary fund s assessment that the country s debt stock was unsustainable the finance ministry said its policy of repaying foreign debt on time was no longer tenable it described the default move as its last resort to prevent a further deterioration of the country s financial position and to ensure fair and equitable treatment of all creditors in the coming week sri lanka will hold talks with the international monetary fund imf in washington dc on a comprehensive debt restructuring programme what is the background to the default sri lanka is experiencing one of its worst economic crises for months now households and businesses have had to cope with severe food and fuel shortages while the government scrambles for dollars to pay for essential imports emergency financial support coming in including from india is barely enough to sustain the country for a month with authorities sharing no roadmap or plan fears of hunger and starvation are growing and thousands of people have been voicing their anger against the government amid mounting protests the government took two major decisions recently to default on the country s debt and to seek imf support to restructure outstanding loans and rescue its teetering economy does a debt default help no middle income country other than sri lanka has resorted to a debt default in recent years usually creditors and investors see a defaulting country as less favourable for business this makes it harder for the country to borrow from external sources if domestic production is low as is in sri lanka s case it is even harder to cope all the same sri lanka s pre emptive default takes away the pressure of having to repay some 7 billion in debt this year giving the country some time to stabilise further the default move came just ahead of colombo s scheduled talks with the imf on the sidelines of the spring meetings of the fund and world bank beginning in washington dc on april 18 the imf is expected to come up with a package that will allow sri lanka to restructure its external debt over time such a programme including immediate relief of a couple of billion dollars will also make sri lanka more credit worthy in the international money market how is sri lanka coping meanwhile citizens are finding it very difficult to source essentials including cooking gas and kerosene fuel is in short supply and is now being rationed to customers after long periods of waiting in queues costs of all basic commodities have risen sharply making them unaffordable for most colombo is sourcing fuel and food supplies for the month using external help including credit lines from india what is the political fallout of this crisis for the rajapaksas from the time sri lanka s economic meltdown intensified this year president gotabaya rajapaksa s government has been facing considerable pressure from citizens who have been unrelenting in their call for the resignation of president gotabaya rajapaksa and prime minister mahinda rajapaksa although the cabinet resigned en masse neither of the ruling brothers who the public hold chiefly responsible for their suffering appear inclined to step down meanwhile shortages persist and prices soar putting people through enormous hardships even after the government announced its decision to suspend debt servicing and seek imf aid with an accompanying structural reform package it is yet to restore any confidence among the general public going by the large demonstrations that continue how could an imf programme bail out the country the way forward is neither easy nor straightforward for sri lanka even with imf assistance senior sri lankan economists have observed that the situation would likely get worse before getting better and that there could be no gain without pain much would depend on the conditions imposed by the imf and how sri lanka responds to them given the government s political compulsion to regain lost ground it is widely predicted that the fund s recommended reforms would include greater taxation and a reduction in state spending what this could mean to the average citizen reeling under the shock of this economic calamity remains to be seen it would be especially challenging for the rajapaksa regime which has lost significant political capital in the wake of this crisis to make and implement tough policy decisions that would be inevitable at this time
to hear liberals talk about our founding fathers you d think they were nothing but a bunch of racist sexist neanderthals who only stopped raping and murdering anyone not white long enough to write some words conservatives revere for their awfulness these evil monsters existed to oppress trans people and stole everything they had from black people somehow change just a few of a adjectives and you re got yourself a pretty accurate description of the modern democrat party advertisement democrats have always been what they accuse us of being which party contains the sexists who used the full power of their party s machine and eventually the white house and presidency to quell bimbo eruptions which party consists for people who call clarence thomas and tim scott uncle toms which party when not smearing him ignores the existence of ric grenell the first openly gay member of any presidential cabinet you know the answers to those questions and all the rest like them now we see the left once again exposing themselves for what they really are when elon musk offered almost 10 percent more than the company is worth to buy twitter any normal person who owned stock would have been ecstatic at the prospect the stock had already surged since it was reported he d been gobbling up shares so another 10 percent is like an unexpected christmas bonus especially if you d been holding the stock for a while instead this news was greeted like a loud fart in an elevator how could that be it s because musk has threatened to institute what the left fears more than almost anything actual free speech on a public platform if you re terrified by the prospect of free speech for everyone you re probably a fascist it doesn t really matter how much fair trade coffee you drink or how many pictures of yourself holding up a haloed cartoon drawing of george floyd you have in your facebook profile photos you are everything your virtue signaling pretends to be against you are those mini nazis screaming this is what democracy looks like endlessly to prevent someone they don t agree with from speaking without irony or self awareness people with confidence in their beliefs and facts on their side don t do everything possible to prevent contrary opinions from being heard democrats are terrified that elon musk has publicly stated his belief that people even and especially people with unpopular opinions or thoughts contrary to the establishment should be free to express them online this terrifies the left progressives have never embraced free speech as anything more than a shield to protect themselves from responsibility for what they inspire see james hodgekinson because the very idea is a threat to their hold on power they don t debate they re ill equipped to they just insist and threaten others into silence if people were allowed to spread ideas to contradict progressive dogma openly who knows where that might lead would some bad ideas spread too of course progressivism is popular again among self proclaimed academics the way it was in the early 20th century until hitler exposed the horrors of it especially its embrace of eugenics but bad ideas will always exist which is why the united states has traditionally embraced the idea of allowing anyone with an idea to express it democrats are learning the hard way that their message isn t selling to hispanic voters in particular they d hoped to capture the hispanic vote the way they have the black vote with empty promises to address problems they ve created met with blind loyalty put all the polling data shows it s been a failure for democrats playing identity and race politics to garner their support advertisement the reason why is pretty simple whether they just immigrated here legally yesterday or 3 generations ago they know they came to the united states to get away from what democrats are promising to impose here socialism fascism communism are what either they or their parents or grandparents fled why would they want that here they ve heard all these promises of equality and equity before and it ended up in terror why would they replace what they ran to with what they were running from democrats can t have this and other truths spread freely they can t have jokes told that belittle sacred cows on the left they can t be seen as anything other than magnanimous which they decidedly are not anyone who dares rock that boat is a threat to what they insist the world must be they aren t in the business of convincing people they are in the business of silencing dissent elon musk threatens that so much so that media outlets are applauding saudi arabia s government a stakeholder in twitter for objecting to musk s offer after years of attacking saudi arabia for the murder of jamal khashoggi and with a history of homophobia try being gay there they re now heroes to the left because they believe in nothing but their own power and us being able to express ourselves freely is a threat to that power that kind of tells you everything you need to know about democrats today doesn t it advertisement derek hunter is the host of a free daily podcast subscribe host of a daily radio show on wcbm in maryland and author of the book outrage inc which exposes how liberals use fear and hatred to manipulate the masses follow him on twitter at derekahunter

on january 1 2021 the single intra trade market for goods and services connecting nearly 1 3 billion people across the 54 countries in africa with a combined gross domestic product gdp of approximately 3 4 trillion came into effect with the african continental free trade area afcfta since establishing the world trade organization wto this free trade area has had the world s most significant number of participating countries designed to strengthen the economic integration among the african people by reducing tariffs and technical trade barriers for intra continental trade and export it s estimated that by 2035 the afcfta will expand africa s income by us 450 billion and its exports by us 560 billion furthermore with the standardised policies and uniformed regulations african businesses will find integrating into global supply chains more accessible thereby creating new opportunities for manufacturers and workers according to the world bank this continent wide market for business and investment will reshape african economies it could lift 30 million africans out of extreme poverty and 68 million people from moderate poverty with a total gdp of 432 3 billion and a population of 200 million nigeria has become the biggest economy on the african continent over the last 30 years it has developed the production capacity to compete with anyone globally with construction agricultural products oil gas and food its expanding financial sector grew from 1 per cent of the total gdp in 2001 to 10 per cent in 2018 along with its role as one of the global leaders in petroleum exports mrs holdings for example owned and operated by a nigerian is a conglomerate of companies focused on capturing the entire value chain in oil trading shipping storage distribution construction aviation logistics and retailing of petroleum products mrsholdings com i had the opportunity to tour one of mrs s modern production plants during my last visit to lagos with less than 60 employees this facility produced four million bottles of engine oil per day to fill 70 terminal containers for export the firm recently constructed the largest jetty a terminal which can berth vessels of 80 000 to 120 000 metric tons capacity at the tin can island port in lagos the facility is unique in africa as it can monitor the loading of petroleum down to the last drop with computer technologies this jetty port is forecasted to save nigeria us 200 million in annual expenses incurred in ship to ship sts transfer as well as demurrage similarly ghana has structurally transformed its economy focusing on production where it has identified sustained competitive advantages globally instead of exporting raw materials like cocoa for chocolate in europe ghana is producing the value added goods towards a new era of industrialisation for the country growing at a rate of 7 per cent per annum since 2017 additionally south africa is a middle income emerging market with developed financial legal communications energy and transport sectors leading in the global production of gold platinum and chromium its stock exchange is africa s most prominent and ranked in the top 20 stock exchanges globally twenty years ago many people used north america and europe as the standards for global leadership today people no longer hold this isolated view as asia has asserted their dominance in trade and africa is coming looking to the future last september the first africa caricom summit was held with countries from the african union and caricom resulting in commitments for increased trade and investment through specific agreements and the enhancement of transportation links between the two regions the leaders at the summit indicated their support for establishing a caricom africa public private partnership towards raising resources for renewable energy the creative industries and digital technology caricom org jamaica has traditionally looked to north america as our major trading partner however we only represent niche markets in these countries whereas our culture and taste profile are more aligned with africa where we would benefit from much larger markets the top exports of jamaica are aluminium oxide us 496 million refined petroleum us 210 million aluminium ore us 87 8 million hard liquor us 80 6 million and processed foods and nuts us 58 3 million mainly exported to the united states us 547 million canada us 110 million netherlands us 91 7 million iceland us 86 7 million and russia us 68 8 million oec com it s time jamaica deepens our reciprocal trade partnership with africa and here are the reasons 1 africa has developed a modern production capacity with economies of scale in manufacturing 2 africa s taste profile is similar to ours 3 africa has a deep respect for jamaica because of our leadership in music sports and the principled political stance we adopted for the non aligned movement and pan africanist in the 1970s 4 the per capita of several african nations is more aligned with ours 5 africa has the population base to offer our manufacturers a mass market 6 we have a common identity through a shared history nigeria continues to be a strategic trading partner for jamaica in petroleum gas in 2020 we imported over us 99 1 million jamaica has been regarded as one of the world s best trans shipment ports directly across from the panama canal connecting asia and a straight path between europe and south america our focus must now turn to developing jamaica as the trans shipment link between africa and our region nigeria s population is 30 times the size of caricom excluding haiti however we have not commercially positioned our trade economy to leverage the benefits effectively jamaica should be proactive in encouraging direct shipping from lagos to kingston which would be transformative opening this route would give us a mass market for jamaican products that we are already producing that would be more readily acceptable in africa versus north america similarly nigerian manufacturers produce for a market with a per capita income more aligned with jamaica therefore their price points would be more competitive and aligned with our people s purchasing power from egypt s historical majestic wisdom in the north to the spirituality of ethiopia in the east the industriousness of nigeria in the west and the tenacity of zimbabwe in the south this continent is creating an entirely new development path harnessing the potential of its resources and people let us build new bridges of collaboration partnership and solidarity between ourselves and africa as we look to improving the lives of all our people cont

these 3 s p stocks could be bargains one of the most common pieces of advice when it comes to investing is to buy low and sell high while this definitely sounds good on paper finding the right opportunities in the market at the right time is easier said than done that s particularly true with all of the volatility and market moving headlines that have been occurring thus far in 2022 with many companies being completely re priced thanks to factors like rising interest rates finding undervalued stocks that you can feel comfortable holding over the long term can be a real challenge with that said there are always some attractive deals to be found in the market if you know where to look a good starting place is the index which tracks the performance of 500 large companies listed on stock exchanges in the united states and contains some of the biggest businesses in the world while not all companies in the index are worthy of your hard earned capital a few names stand out as potentially great buys at this time that s why we ve put together the following list of 3 undervalued s p 500 stocks to buy now let s take a further look below 1 qualcomm after several quarters of outperformance semiconductor stocks like qualcomm nasdaq have fallen from grace in recent months seeing semi stocks get hammered is certainly not a good look for the overall market as many investors consider this group to be the heartbeat of the tech sector with that said long term investors that are interested in high quality s p 500 stocks at reasonable valuations should be very interested in qualcomm at this time it s a company that develops and licenses wireless technology and designs chips for smartphones which means investors get exposure to some of the most exciting trends in tech whether it s the internet of things smartphones or cloud connected automotive platforms it s safe to say that this company is a true innovator qualcomm also stands out given how it receives royalty revenue on most of the 3g 4g and 5g handsets that are sold today which means its earnings could continue to grow as more people use smartphones around the world the company q1 sales of 10 7 billion up 30 year over year and trades at a reasonable 15 51 p e ratio at this time making it a great option for investors that are interested in exposure to tech 2 goldman sachs another potentially undervalued area of the s p 500 index to look at is the financial sector which has been facing heavy selling pressure in recent weeks goldman sachs nyse is without a doubt one of the strongest companies to consider in the sector and with a p e ratio of 5 4 at this time shares could be a bargain it s a leading investment banking securities and investment management firm that offers a variety of services to corporations financial institutions governments and high net worth individuals the company a big year in 2021 which included record net revenues of 59 34 billion record net earnings of 21 64 billion and record diluted eps of 59 45 these numbers speak volumes about the quality of the goldman sachs brand and how strong its business model is and the market share gains the company made last year should lead to continued success there s also a lot to like about the 2 49 dividend yield here which is perfect for income investors keep an eye out on how investors react to the company s q1 earnings report when it is announced on april 14th 3 home depot investors might have gotten a bit ahead of themselves in bidding up shares of home depot nyse to the 400 s at the end of 2021 but with the stock pulling back over 26 year to date it could be a great buy the dip candidate shares are now trading at a discount to the s p 500 with a 19 77 p e ratio and investors that have been interested in adding exposure to the world s largest home improvement might want to start building a position home depot stands out as a great company for several reasons including its massive scale that makes it easier to bargain with vendors a firm commitment to returning capital to shareholders and loyal customers thanks to low prices there s also a lot to like about how home improvement retailers don t have to worry about a lot of competition in the e commerce space as most homeowners want to buy their goods in person and be able to ask specific questions to employees home depot also q4 eps of 3 21 up 21 year over year and boosted its dividend by 15 which are both additional reasons to consider adding shares keep in mind that the company faces tough comparisons to last year s earnings but that shouldn t hold you back from owning shares of this fantastic blue chip stock after the recent selloff original post

belarus not only served as a staging ground for russian troops as they prepared to invade ukraine but allowed russian missiles to be fired from its soil and opened its hospitals to russian soldiers injured in combat now there are signs that belarus could become directly involved in the war belarusian troops appear to be readying for deployment and u s and nato officials have warned that they could cross into ukraine in a matter of days having failed to deter russia from attacking ukraine the united states and its allies must urgently consider how to prevent belarus from becoming a full belligerent in the war a belarusian invasion is not a foregone conclusion russia claims that it is now focused on gaining control of the donbas in the east of ukraine and far from the border with belarus but it is unclear if that is really true or if moscow is simply regrouping for future operations unless western nations impose harsher sanctions on belarus position additional nato troops along the country s western border as a deterrent and offer minsk a diplomatic off ramp belarusian troops may soon be fighting alongside their russian counterparts in ukraine too little too late in response to russia s aggression in ukraine western nations imposed a harsh suite of sanctions on moscow freezing the assets of its central bank barring many of its biggest banks from transacting in dollars and banning or restricting imports of russian oil and gas but these measures came too late only after russia had launched its invasion the west cannot afford to be as reactive with belarus as it was with russia hoping for restraint where none has been demonstrated the united states has already sanctioned belarusian president alexander lukashenko and members of his family over human rights abuses related to the war adding to sanctions imposed last year over lukashenko s crackdown on peaceful protests and restricted the export of luxury goods to belarus the united states and the european union have also restricted the ability of some belarusian banks to use the swift network which serves as the backbone of the international payments system but western nations have so far refrained from imposing the much harsher sanctions they have imposed on russia to deter belarus from becoming directly involved in the war they must strengthen and expand the punitive measures against minsk additional targeted sanctions against belarusian officials full blocking sanctions on numerous belarusian financial institutions more export controls and sanctions on trade would send a much stronger deterrent signal in addition to imposing tougher sanctions the united states and its allies must communicate clearly that belarus will face even harsher consequences if it proceeds with an invasion belarus deserves condemnation for its role in the war so far but it may not yet have breached the united nations charter or other international legal prohibitions against the use of force there is therefore room for the country to redeem itself belarus is not russia it has no nuclear weapons and its conventional forces are weak fighting alongside the russian military however belarusian troops have the ability to inflict additional pain on the ukrainian people belarus deserves condemnation for its role in the war but there is room for the country to redeem itself in calibrating its threats against belarus the west should not treat the country as an extension of russia rather it should consider the commitments that russia and belarus have made to each other and use them to divide the two allies to the extent possible belarus is a member of the collective security treaty organization russia s version of nato like nato members ctso members are obliged to consider an attack against one an attack against all but it remains unclear how much stock to put in ctso commitments for mutual defense during the recent nagorno karabakh war for instance russia did not defend armenia its ctso partner against azerbaijan whether russia would defend belarus is even less certain especially now that it is stretched thin as a result of its assault on ukraine moscow has limited conventional capability to engage nato and while it would almost certainly defend itself against a direct attack by u s or nato forces it may not be willing to defend belarus or belarusian forces and risk a broader escalation of the conflict the united states and its allies should use this uncertainty to their advantage nato should increase its presence on belarus s western border conducting televised military maneuvers unit training and live fires such a show of force may make lukashenko think twice about provoking a nato attack that he would be on his own to defend against after all he does not have the forces to defend his nato frontier quell domestic dissent and invade ukraine such a course of action would not be without risks but nato members can mitigate the risk of inviting further russian escalation by clearly communicating that they will target belarusian forces only if force becomes necessary this would likely allow them to thread the needle between deterring belarus and provoking moscow the united states and other nato countries could legally justify such assertive military steps under article 51 of the un charter which allows member states to defend themselves or other members from attack so long as the un security council does not take action to the contrary and of course the security council will not take action for the same reason it took no meaningful action after russia invaded ukraine nato countries could also seek a symbolic non binding resolution from the un general assembly that condemns belarusian aggression and supports their defensive actions finally the united states and its allies must provide lukashenko with a diplomatic off ramp as long as belarus remains on the sidelines nato should assure belarusian leaders both publicly and privately that their country will not be attacked if belarus is willing to go further and end its support for russia s invasion the west could offer to eventually lift some of the newly imposed sanctions second time s the charm the united states and its allies failed to deter russia s invasion of ukraine but now they have an opportunity for a do over with belarus using economic military and diplomatic means they can raise the costs of belarusian aggression while minimizing the risk of a dangerous escalation but they must act swiftly the longer the conflict continues and the more countries become embroiled in it the greater the risk that the united states and nato will be drawn in as well

roaf has grounded its fleet of mig 21 lancer military aircraft due to their high accident rate now as per reports the romanian air force roaf will only fly the 17 second hand lockheed martin f 16 fighters acquired from portugal meanwhile the romanian ministry of defense also intends to speed up the process to buy additional f 16 jets from surplus norwegian stocks at the same time measures have been taken to speed up the procedures for the purchase of norway s 32 f 16 aircraft the ministry said in a statement in the past 26 years more than twenty mig 21s of the romanian air force have made an emergency landing or crashed the last accident involving the mig 21 occurred in early march when a patrol plane crashed killing the pilot seven soldiers sent to locate the soviet era fighter and the pilot during search and rescue operations were also killed in the helicopter crash therefore romania has been modernizing its air force by replacing its warsaw pact era mig 21 fighters with the f 16s and has plans to eventually acquire f 35 joint strike fighter as well romania bought its first 17 f 16s in 2016 from portugal out of the total f 16 am bm block 15 purchased by the romanian air force 12 were modernized to the mlu 5 2r standard the modernization package included an upgrade to avionics software communication equipment navigational aids and cockpit more specifically the upgrade process featured a cockpit compatible with night vision systems two multi function displays a modular mission computer a modernized fire control radar a hybrid navigation system an advanced friend enemy identification system and electronic warfare management system and a link 16 data transmission system additionally the package also included the integration of other devices such as the sniper advanced targeting pod as well as the jhmcs helmet for the use with the aim 120c 7 amraam aim 9m and aim 9x sidewinder missiles the romanian air force is also supported in its airspace surveillance missions by allied nations as part of nato s enhanced air policing over romania since the beginning of russia s invasion of ukraine in late february 2022 additional fighter jets have been deployed to romania romania surrounded by pro russia governments before the russian invasion the u s air force in europe usafe moved an unspecified number of f 16s from germany to the romanian air base of fetesti less than 60 miles approx 100 km from the black sea to protect nato airspace in the region close to crimea now with the invasion of russian armed forces in ukraine and the capture of snake island on february 24 russia has come close within 30 miles approx 50 km of romania s coastline thus increasing worries for the country they won t stop a romanian government official told air force magazine speaking on condition of anonymity either you stop russia in ukraine or you re going to fight it on the nato soil on the eu soil romania is surrounded by pro russia governments in hungary and serbia and a weak unaligned moldova while bulgaria its neighbor to the south is also a nato member the country has huge investment and energy ties with russia the romanian government reportedly views russia in a historical context with aspirations to re establish its historic empire with a population prepared to sacrifice losses for russian greatness the country plans to increase its defense spending in the wake of russia s long term threat to its and nato s national security and part of that investment has been allocated to the base infrastructure used by american troops and aircraft at fetesti campia turzii and mihail kogălniceanu european deterrence initiative edi funds have also invested in the airbase infrastructure and pre positioning used by americans meanwhile the grounding of mig 21 lancer has spurred discussions of the possibility that these planes can be provided to the ukrainian air force which is in dire need of combat aircraft and has also started a crowdfunding program to acquire fighter planes as recently reported by eurasian times the romanian mig 21 lancers are the upgraded versions of the original soviet made mig 21 fishbeds the israeli elbit systems company won the contract to integrate modern systems into fishbeds to increase their operational lifetime by 10 years from 1995 and that resulted in three different variants the lancer a features a multi functional color display screen mfcd hybrid navigation system hns type lisa 4000eb and a hotas hands on throttle and stick system and is equipped with the elta el m 2001b rr range radar radar the pilot is equipped with an elbit display and sight helmet dash a helmet mounted display of primary flight information and also information on targeting and using weapons while the lancer b was reportedly a trainer version that was pretty much identical to lancer a the lancer c aircraft is equipped with an elta el m 2032 radar that can be used for air to ground attacks but also to detect and engage multiple air to air targets up to 35 miles it can also fire western weapons which makes it a very versatile fighter bomber it can fire smart bombs like the laser and infrared guided bombs using rafael lightening laser designator pod the aircraft can also be equipped with the elbit aerostar airborne reconnaissance pod and for electronic countermeasures ecm the elta el l 8222r ecm pod can be used the mig 21s can be very easy to maintain and sustain over time also with the right set of avionics and armaments coupled with the famed innovative tactics of the ukrainian pilots they can prove to be a formidable force even against the world s best 4th generation fighters
it s the instinct of the people of this country bellowed boris johnson at a recent tory party conference in blackpool like the people of ukraine to choose freedom when the british people voted for brexit it s because they wanted to be free his inconsiderate preposterous comparison drew anger from all political climes including many of his party faithful to compare the ukrainians who are fighting for survival in their home country bombed to smithereens by invaders with the moody lifestyle choice of middle england was not only obnoxious but absurdly wrong the ukrainians are after all braving destruction because they wanted to take part in the european project not because they wanted to desert it in search of an empire the psychology of brexit if anything has parallels with putin s dream of resurrecting imperial russia his contempt for minorities his delusion of greatness his repudiation of 21st century values i do of course not wish to compare the thoughtless clownery of basil fawlty boris with the murderous thuggery of vladimir stalin putin but let s not forget how much disregard there is for the rule of law and constitutional procedures in boris johnson s political world how much loathing for opinionated curators critical media independent parliamentarians and civil servants the bbc as the world s pre eminent news purveyor has to fear for its survival brexit has demonstrated the precedence of emotions over economic rationality many european amenities are oozing away there are fewer wines to choose from large sized sea bass from france does not make it over the channel anymore groceries are not so fresh nowadays and last hardly more than a day in the fridge european cheeses bread and pasta became rarer and restaurants have to do without chefs from the continent in the grand scheme of things nothing to get agitated about yet life has become a bit greyer in the uk as a consequence such was the result of britain s uncoupling from the european customs union in all its aspects goods and people could not move freely anymore small businesses on both sides of the new border were struggling with paper protocols from health and safety certificates to norm compliance from re export limitations to vat handling many have given up we can check this on amazon marketplace not delivered to the uk workers in labour intensive sectors fruit and vegetable pickers nurses builders and truck drivers went missing augmenting unnecessary deficits this not only showed in shops and the hospitality industry brits had difficulties to fill up their cars last year because there were not enough road tankers around to stock up gas stations in the uk this picture of deteriorating affluence which began with brexit intensified in the aftermath of the pandemic and not only in britain when the pandemic subsided and we all started to consume with gusto again supply struggled to keep up with our abruptly resurging demand deficits started to crop up everywhere from transport to spares with labour quickly to become a deficit good too the resulting relentless price rises experienced since the beginning of last year began to corrode our joyous consumption of stuff and entertainment for the first time in generations inflation became a serious worry exacerbating inequality less well off households and many developing countries started to feel the pinch with food and energy poverty threatening the living standards of millions of people our thirst for a return to free consumption and travel became ever more expensive as a result we were forced to restrain our abandon and to consume more selectively for the first time in generations inflation became a serious worry exacerbating inequality andreas weitzer first brexit and then much more dramatically the reopening of the economy in the aftermath of the pandemic have demonstrated the cost of insufficient supply the inflationary effects of disrupted transport and production inflation tamed by decades of outsourcing and cheap labour in south east asia came roaring back rapidly rising fuel and gas prices inflated the cost of food heating and housing infecting in its wake pretty much everything we can buy for money the prices of even the most ordinary things went up like stainless steel nails which rose 40 per cent in a year and then putin invaded ukraine hell bent to destroy it this unexpected act of military adventurism was answered by western sanctions of unheard of severity exacerbated by ukraine s destruction and russia s embargo responses these will create supply deficits not experienced since wwii the effects are already severe russia and ukraine are both key exporters of metals crops and basic raw materials for the production of microchips twenty five per cent of the world s wheat comes from ukraine and russia fifty per cent of the world s sunflower oil comes from the ukraine ninety per cent of the world s neon is exported by russia an essential ingredient for integrated circuits the list goes on fertilisers platinum nickel copper titanium palladium maize rapeseed oil it s not just russian gas which goes missing in the coming months we will learn how the absence of russian raw materials and energy will creep into the most unexpected corners of the economy fertilisers not shipped from russia and belarus for instance cannot be by easily compensated for by norway s yara globally the biggest producer of nitrates they need natural gas to do so which became prohibitively expensive even before the ukraine war as a result farming everywhere will suffer no matter how high food prices may soar transport costs which have already increased tenfold since the pandemic will further rise the trans siberian rail connection is now out of reach numerous containers are stranded in russia russian vessels are idling seventeen per cent of the world s sailors are either russian or ukrainian hence difficult to deploy post pandemic price rises have been countered with monetary tightening fiscal interventions vat reductions windfall taxes transfer payments and the imposition of price caps the shortages we are facing now make all these measures ineffective if there s not enough food or fuel around it will not multiply all of a sudden with the help of subsidies or regulated prices or just by making credit dearer sky high commodity prices are already lowering the financial ceiling for commodity traders who are running out of credit lines irrespective of interest rate levels this too is limiting trade volumes beyond sanctions already broadened by voluntary acts since february 24 the day putin invaded ukraine my neighbours in lija began to hoard flour pasta vegetable oils and gas bottles thereby involuntarily contributing to empty shelves and soaring prices this is not a maltese phenomenon it happens right now all over europe people anticipate worse to come and rightly so the commodity deficits now imminent will be large and disruptive enough for us to expect government mandated rationing those of us old enough to remember the opec oil embargo in the 1970s will recall how we were told by our governments to leave our cars at home to save electricity to stop heating and air conditioning deglobalisation the retreat from a wealth bestowing global division of labour began with brexit and trump s america first it intensified during the covid induced lockdowns the war with putin has made it irreversible what we can expect now are not price caps but consumption caps germany and austria have started to ration natural gas we will soon have to make do with further curbs substitutes and more limited choices but we will endure these deprivations with a light heart when we see the lives of millions of ukrainians shattered
drop in life expectancy speaks volumes about how us handled covid jessica corbett for common dreams just over a month into year three of the covid 19 pandemic research revealed thursday that life expectancy in the united states declined again in 2021 which followed a well documented drop in 2020 and contrasted a recovery trend in other high income countries the paper which has not yet been peer reviewed shows that u s life expectancy fell from 78 86 years in 2019 to 76 99 years in 2020 and 76 60 years in 2021 a net loss of 2 26 years the study comes as progressives in congress continue to fight for medicare for all legislation to replace the u s for profit healthcare system one in which 112 million adults struggle to afford care according to gallup and west health the research also comes just days after a poor people s campaign analysis exposed how the public health crisis was twice as deadly in poor counties as in wealthy ones and exacerbated preexisting social and economic disparities that have long festered in the u s johns hopkins university s case tracker reported that as of thursday afternoon covid 19 had claimed 984 571 lives across the united states or nearly 16 of the more than six million deaths globally dr steven woolf co author of the new study and director emeritus of the center on society and health at virginia commonwealth university said in a statement that we already knew that the u s experienced historic losses in life expectancy in 2020 due to the covid 19 pandemic what wasn t clear is what happened in 2021 early in 2021 knowing an excellent vaccine was being distributed i was hopeful that the u s could recover some of its historic losses said woolf but i began to worry more when i saw what happened as the year unfolded even so as a scientist until i saw the data it remained an open question how u s life expectancy for that year would be affected he added it was shocking to see that u s life expectancy rather than having rebounded had dropped even further in addition to examining the united states the researchers looked at life expectancy over the past two years in 19 peer countries and found a smaller drop between 2019 and 2020 an average of 0 57 years followed by an average 0 28 year increase from 2020 to 2021 while other high income countries saw their life expectancy increase in 2021 recovering about half of their losses u s life expectancy continued to fall woolf said this speaks volumes about the life consequences of how the u s handled the pandemic taking aim at policymakers who opposed efforts to curb the spread of the virus the expert added that in a country where the u s constitution and 10th amendment grant public health authority to the states i believe the u s catastrophe speaks volumes about the policies and behaviors of u s governors at least some of them a highly effective vaccine was available in 2021 that made covid 19 deaths almost completely preventable woolf highlighted that while the delta and omicron variants significantly contributed to the death toll in the united states those mutations also impacted other countries that saw life expectancy rates rebound last year deaths from these variants occurred almost entirely among unvaccinated people he said what happened in the u s is less about the variants than the levels of resistance to vaccination and the public s rejection of practices such as masking and mandates to reduce viral transmission noting high rates of heart disease and obesity as well as inequities in access to healthcare in the united states lead author and university of colorado boulder sociology professor ryan masters said that those same factors made the u s more vulnerable than other countries to the mortality consequences of covid 19 the study states that over the two year period between 2019 and 2021 u s hispanic and non hispanic black populations experienced the largest losses in life expectancy reflecting the legacy of systemic racism and inadequacies in the u s handling of the pandemic woolf said that sadly it was not a surprise to see the disproportionate impact on people of color our research had shown that previously but there was an interesting plot twist in 2021 the only decrease in life expectancy occurred in white people life expectancy in the black population even increased despite that increase he pointed out life expectancy in the black population remains far lower than in other groups but the disproportionate impact on white people holds clues to what happened in 2021 co author laudan aron a senior fellow at the urban institute told the washington post it s hard to imagine that willingness to be vaccinated is not a piece of that puzzle the life expectancy gap between the united states and its peer income countries is now over five years which is an incredible gap she said death and life expectancy that s the ultimate marker of what it means to live in a country some members of congress believe that the pandemic demonstrates the necessity of establishing a national program that treats healthcare as a basic human right and reaches communities that have been disproportionately excluded from and mistreated under the existing profit driven system last month during the u s house committee on oversight and reform s first medicare for all hearing since the pandemic began rep cori bush d mo declared that this policy will save lives i want to make that clear i hope this hearing will be one more step forward in our commitment to ensuring everyone in this country and particularly our black brown and indigenous communities have the medical care they need to thrive she said the day after the house event senate budget committee chair bernie sanders i vt a longtime medicare for all advocate announced that his panel will hold a similar hearing in early may on social media friday warren gunnels sanders staff director noted the new paper and said that he can t stop thinking about how many lives could have been saved if congress passed bernie s bill to require medicare to pay all of the healthcare bills of the uninsured and under insured during the pandemic which was fully paid for by a one time 60 wealth tax on 700 billionaires the new research comes after a march study published in the journal population and development review which found that global life expectancy appears to have declined by 0 92 years between 2019 and 2020 and by another 0 72 years between 2020 and 2021 that paper by patrick heuveline of the california center for population research at the university of california los angeles concludes changes in life expectancy between 2019 and 2020 in america europe and a few other countries have received copious attention results presented here confirm several key takeaways from previous analyses such as the large mortality impact of the pandemic 1 in the united states relative to other high income nations in western europe 2 in russia relative to the rest of europe and foremost 3 in some central and south american nations using end of 2021 reports of deaths attributed to covid 19 and modeling their relationship to excess deaths preliminary estimates were also presented for changes in life expectancy in 2021 these results suggest a growing gap between on the one hand western european nations and on the other hand the united states where life expectancy continued to decline and even more so russia where it is expected to decline more in 2021 than in 2020 writing about heuveline s findings thursday for world socialist web site evan blake and benjamin mateus made the case that unlike previous pandemics every aspect of the covid 19 pandemic was both foreseeable and preventable as documented by dozens of scholarly papers books and even films released just since the start of the 21st century at every step of the way the financial oligarchy and its political representatives ensured that profits were prioritized over human lives and well being they added to put it succinctly the decline in life expectancy is a concrete health measurement of the policies of social murder whose monetary values can be appraised by the coinciding rise in stock market indices

last month a reddit member posted on the popular forum am i the asshole to report a falling out with her 14 year old niece whom she was refusing to ever see again and had told to burn in hell the niece s crime plant theft the redditor had gone away for a fortnight and asked her niece to plant sit her prized collection of 35 tropical indoor plants as payment she d give the niece some cuttings to grow her own she returned to the scene of a botanical bloodbath everything in a pot had been given a drastic haircut some were half the plants they used to be her cebu blue pothos her string of pearls her ruby necklace her silver stripe philodendron the golden pothos she d trained up her stairwell all decimated the niece had taken her cuttings in advance and hadn t spared the secateurs worse though were the jewels of her collection a pink princess philodendron that had been reduced to two leaves and a monstera albo which now had just three the redditor broke down wept raged and screamed at her niece who had already sold most of the cuttings to an outside observer the answer was obvious of course the redditor was the asshole her niece was 14 it was an honest mistake they were just plants but the green fingered commentators knew something different the niece had been caught red handed several of those plants were worth hundreds of pounds in the case of the monstera albo an instagram friendly it plant that has skyrocketed in value over the past two years as much as any cryptocurrency a cutting alone can go for thousands this was no mix up this was a heist consult a lawyer the commentators said press charges hell would be too good a place wrote one they voted not the asshole people have been pilfering plants as long as they ve been growing victorian botanist adventurers fuelled a 19th century plant race across the globe as exotic gardens became high society status symbols back home but now brexit the pandemic and social media have combined for a perfect storm as garden centres closed in 2020 dutch growers who produce indoor plants in vast hi tech greenhouses shut down production causing a worldwide shortage at the same time demand for indoor plants went through the roof brexit has pushed prices up while the energy crisis looks set to send them higher still i ve heard from growers i really respect that they were asking upwards of 40 000 for some of their varieties it ll likely only add to the allure on instagram showing off a rare or prized species has a name plant flexing rare plants that sold for under 100 two or three years ago now sell in online auctions for thousands last summer a new zealand seller made headlines when a small eight leaf pot plant a rhaphidophora tetrasperma also known as mini monstera sold for 14 000 newspapers described the sale as record breaking but several in the plant world told me they ve witnessed sales for double that i ve heard from growers i really respect that they were asking upwards of 40 000 for some of their varieties says tyler thrasher a us plant propagator who is the host of the popular podcast greenhouse rants it s usually because those plants will end up in a tissue culture lab where they can be turned into millions in a couple of years like most precious objects the value of any given plant is derived from its scarcity in the case of one of the most prized the monstera albo it s down to unique white markings on the leaves known as its variegation the odds of a regular monstera also known as the swiss cheese plant which you can pick up in ikea for 19 developing variegation from seed are roughly 100 000 to 1 this doesn t stop people from selling variegated monstera seeds however aka the magic beans of the plant world the most instagram friendly plants those boasting half moon leaves split between pure green and snow white regularly sell for 10 000 or more on ebay etsy and facebook marketplace while their cuttings the only reliable way to grow a monstera albo of your own sell for hundreds or even thousands there s still risk here even cuttings from a variegated mother plant will sometimes revert to the all green leaves that nature intended it s a houseplant bubble that has seen the growth of those most human of off shoots plant speculation plant swindling and outright plant crime pot plant collections have been raided at gunpoint botanical gardens have been trimmed at scissor point some unscrupulous sellers have even taken to painting the leaves white thrasher first noticed the shift when he saw that people had taken to selling nodes just an inch or so of stem with a growth point rather than full cuttings in order to maximise profits these wet sticks as he dismissively coined them in a podcast now sell for anything from 50 to a few hundred pounds yet the odds of growing a plant from them are significantly reduced compared to full cuttings regardless the practice has become so popular it s even spawned a t shirt line send nodes view image in fullscreen lock it away pot plant collections have been raided by criminals at gunpoint photograph aaron tilley the observer you re selling a piece that could potentially form a new plant says thrasher with a lot of emphasis on potentially but people can t afford a fully grown plant when it costs 3 000 so if someone s like hey i ve got a node for 200 people are willing to take the gamble thrasher s podcast rant backfired the term wet sticks became the brand name for nodes and are now proudly sold as such talk to online plant sellers and they ll tell you the sale of nodes was just the start some sellers advertise pieces of stem without even a growth point a true wet stick which has no potential to be a plant but they photograph them in a way that looks like it has says grace morris who runs the etsy store graceshouseofplants most buyers it is pointed out to me will assume it was their fault the plant didn t grow or only realise long after paypal s 20 day dispute window they ve been scammed the perfect crime i speak to jimmy rideout of etsy store jimlovesplants who gives me a list of scams wanton plant mislabelling when it s obvious the plant in the picture is not the one they re saying size scamming where the scale isn t in the picture and you get it and it s a lot smaller than it should be cutting fraud i ve seen someone selling a golden pothos cutting for 400 saying it was taken from a rare variegated monstera but you can get a pothos for 5 from b q even ebay listings that say they re not selling the expensive looking full variegated monstera in the picture hold on i say what are they selling then that s just it they re selling nothing the listing says i m not actually selling this plant i don t have this plant and it s like 450 they re just hoping someone will click buy without reading the description most brazen though was the facebook seller who claimed to have a calathea makoyana pink diamond a new variation of a standard peacock plant without a registered name and which boasted never before seen white variegation around its leaves it didn t take long for retired amateur plant sleuth robert mccracken to get to the bottom of it i have never seen nature produce a margin like that he wrote in the comments but i have seen a house painter leave that exact dabbling on window panes in a frenzied market where the right instagram shot can see a species go viral and become the new it plant overnight there s money to be made if you can convincingly claim to have made a new discovery the philodendron pink congo which took the world of plantfluencers by storm in 2019 was not a thing of nature case in point the philodendron pink congo which briefly took the world of plantfluencers by storm in 2019 it was claimed to be a variant of the philodendron pink princess itself a highly sought after plant that boasts patches of pink variegation on its leaves the new plant didn t just have patches though half of its leaves were pure millennial pink it was precision tooled for instagram and became an instant sensation selling online for hundreds at least until owners started noticing something odd the bright pink leaves started fading to a softer shade then to yellow then horror green what was happening mccracken rapidly establishing himself as the batman of everything potted was on the case as soon as i saw it he tells me i knew it was not a thing of nature his research led him to an indonesian webpage mccracken speaks some of the language that detailed the process of artificially pinkening the leaves of philodendrons by gassing them with a chemical that stimulates ethylene production the hormone that ripens bananas and turns green tomatoes red it wasn t a scam exactly the technique was used for weddings and events but it certainly wasn t a new species mccracken s facebook post on the subject went viral and demand tanked almost instantly a friend told me that on the day of my post she lost 200 orders for indonesia it was a multimillion dollar collapse still it proved one thing for the right plant enthusiasts would buy first and ask questions later just last year budding plant entrepreneurs claimed to have successfully crossed a spiritus sancti an incredibly rare and valuable aroid from brazil of which more now exist in cultivation than the wild with a jose buono a philodendron with stable white variegation ie it could be grown from seed if true it was a revelation the holy grail of houseplants would now boast variegated leaves the dream pictures of saplings were posted in a facebook plant group and people handed over 1 200 for each one yet as each grew with owners posting online updates they simply looked like jose buonos not a spiritus sancti hybrid at all and the prices kept dropping as they got larger kristina st claire a florida plant enthusiast who watched it unfold told me when she noticed a florida etsy seller aaron gibbs of urban leaf shop begin to sell them she voiced her concerns and gibbs got the plant dna tested the results came back it was a jose buono it was like the jerry springer show says thrasher and you had all these people posting saying i spent 1 200 on this but everyone had just been like i want this hybrid people thought they could grow it cut it sell it in their plant shop it s like whenever you hear about cryptocurrency and there s a new coin everyone s trying to get in early for thrasher cryptocurrency is the most apt analogy of the current plant bubble he s known people to take out loans of up to 45 000 buying up one of everything with the hope of making a fortune it s speculation but i can t tell you how many people i ve seen a year later selling scraps of plants saying i got in over my head and like crypto lack of regulation is key for serious collectors trades take place not through ebay or etsy but via members only tropical plant groups on facebook while writing this story i tried to join several of them to be accepted each required me to approve a long list of terms and conditions the most common was no price shaming meaning no expressing incredulity at a plant s astronomical cost this includes laughing emotes read one there are even groups st claire tells me dedicated to proplifting the practice of stealing cuttings from nurseries and botanical gardens it s a huge problem for botanical gardens she says people steal all the time and these people are really proud of it they don t see it as stealing but it can be thousands of dollars she refuses she says to let people purchasing plants from her pick them up in person living in florida many of her tropical plants grow outdoors and she worries they might be casing the joint i later speak to dr carly cowell from the royal botanic gardens at kew has she noticed any proplifting yes we get pots taken people take plants out of the displays and it s really hard to track cuttings after all plants now worth fortunes are on open display in previous years growers haven t been able to sell all of their stock now they re retiring on one plant yet cowell worries more about the unchecked international plant trade the current frenzy is encouraging at kew they have strict phyto sanitary controls and quarantine procedures to ensure harmful diseases aren t spread through our horticultural or agricultural industries that s a big problem with internet trade it could be coming from anywhere and it can decimate nurseries i ve seen diseases where the plants are fine in the morning but by the evening they re all dead in the case of the much prized monstera albo several sellers told me they had seen regular monsteras sold as albos with patches of light colour on the leaves but which were actually plants infected with the mosaic virus last year working with uk border force kew set up floraguard which aims to track illegal plant trade by using ai algorithms to search the internet for chatter it would search for words like wetstick but also specific species yet facebook she says wouldn t allow the algorithm to penetrate their private groups meaning for now at least those traders remain shielded from kew s prying eyes finally i spoke to kaylee ellen a plant youtuber who has been at the vanguard of the fight against all manner of botanical deception with videos exposing the pink congo scandal and others attracting hundreds of thousands of views and there has been a price to pay her email has been signed to all manner of mailing lists presumably by disgruntled sellers signing me up for the rspca abortion clinics suicide prevention religious groups drug related stuff places that sell fake plants like ha very funny someone has even been posting comments posing as her on various forums meaning she ll get regular emails from upset people and will have to reply you re gonna have to believe that it wasn t me still she s not about to back down not while plant crime still stalks the sills even the infamous pink congo she s noticed is making a comeback directly after mccracken s exposé most sellers still selling them did so with a disclaimer that the pink colouring wouldn t last but now the disclaimers have kind of vanished as she said in one of her videos talking for the plant community as much as herself we just need to look out for each other

rising cost of living disappointment with political leaders and crushing loneliness are souring moods in the land of the free from a sputtering economy and high inflation to a lack of trust in political leadership americans are expressing displeasure with many facets of their daily lives in the annual world happiness report the united states plunged eight places to 23rd a historic low for the land famous for its pearly white smiles it s the first time since the report launched back in 2012 that the us did not feature among the world s 20 happiest countries so what s dragging americans down perhaps the best place to start is with the economy which has left many people in the dust as the rich just keep getting richer consumer prices for basic grocery items remain above what they were in january 2021 when president joe biden assumed office prices for chicken 26 bread 30 sugar 44 and butter 27 are enough to trigger many shoppers while a simple trip to a restaurant has become a rare luxury for many financially strapped consumers meanwhile rent costs have surged by 20 over the same period amid this sticker shock at the checkout line americans have also expressed a heavy amount of skepticism with the political system a comprehensive pew research center survey reveals high levels of dissatisfaction with the three branches of government the democratic and republican parties as well as the candidates for office among the findings just 4 of us adults say the political system is working extremely or very well another 23 report it is working somewhat well about six in ten 63 express not too much or no confidence at all in the future of the us political system a growing proportion of americans are expressing contempt for both political parties nearly three in ten 28 express unfavorable opinions of both parties the highest share in three decades of polling and a comparable share of respondents 25 do not feel well represented by either party while trust in government has remained near historic lows for much of the last two decades today it stands among the lowest levels dating back nearly seven decades and now three years after the january 6 protests at the capitol building more americans believe their country is heading for a political smash up according to a cbs yougov poll released in january 49 of respondents expect some sort of violence in future political contests like the upcoming showdown between donald trump and joe biden on november 4 meanwhile a full 70 agreed with the statement that american democracy is threatened not since the civil war period have the american people witnessed such stark political divisions and it seems to be just a matter of time before the blue and gray battle fatigues are back in style albeit over entirely different issues the democrats and republicans are trapped inside of their own iron clad echo chambers where they are prevented from hearing their political opponents just across the aisle this lack of a national dialogue worsened by an overtly pro liberal media is what spawned the so called insurrection on january 6 and could easily trigger a new bout of violence sometime down the road feelings of loneliness is another thing dragging americans down in may 2023 us surgeon general vivek murthy called loneliness a public health epidemic the latest healthy minds monthly poll from the american psychiatric association apa reveals that early in 2024 30 of adults said they have experienced feelings of loneliness at least once a week over the past year while 10 say they are lonely every day somewhat surprisingly younger people were more likely to experience these feelings with 30 of americans aged 18 34 reporting they are lonely every day or several times a week and single adults are nearly twice as likely as married adults to say they have been lonely on a weekly basis over the past year 39 vs 22 meanwhile the centers for disease control and prevention reports that approximately one in ten americans aged 12 and over takes antidepressant medication more than 60 of americans taking antidepressant medication have taken it for two years or longer with 14 having taken the medication for ten years or more so what is it that has put the american people in a grand funk needless to say runaway inflation has prompted a deep distrust of politicians and corporations which by the look of things are only in business to fleece the powerless consumers this alienation from the powers that be together with feelings of loneliness triggered by a disconnected society that increasingly meets only online has prompted a mental health emergency how can the american people begin to fix their broken society it seems that the only answer is to begin breaking down the walls that separate the various segments of society so that a national conversation can truly begin so where are the world s happiest places to live according to the world happiness report the majority of the top ten happiest places are primarily northern countries that just happen to have the least amount of sunshine finland denmark iceland sweden israel the netherlands norway luxembourg switzerland

illustration chen xia global times there are clearer signs now that persistently high inflation linger in large swaths of the world and may stretch to the end of this year or even longer eroding the living standards of billions of middle and low income families people often fret and agonize over the surging prices of many commodities groceries and services but they seldom seek answers as to what causes the hefty price rises in most cases inflation is self correcting meaning price swings in one segment such as crude oil or grain won t spill over to impact other sectors and form broader inflation trends but the current round of global inflation is something different it started in the us in the first half of 2021 triggered by the biden administration s profligate 1 7 trillion fiscal spending plan aggravated by the federal reserve s quantitative easing monetary policy and being brought to and infected the world s other economies via the dollar dominated global trade and financial settlement regime if economists look back at this century they would find out a precedence of this type of global level financial distress about 14 years ago the highly irresponsible low interest policy of former fed chairman alan greenspan ignited the us subprime loans meltdown and led to the 2008 09 global financial crisis which imploded capital markets across continents destroyed trillions in family savings and drove many major economies into the abyss however policy makers in the us seldom draw bloodshed lessons from the past as they are always fond of indulging themselves in exuberance creating financial market bubbles with ultra low interest rates together with trillions of dollars of printed money as the world s most important central bank the federal reserve should have adopted a set of very prudent policy guidelines to manage the viability of the dollar so that it won t cause financial quakes and send shockwaves to or trigger tsunamis to inundate other economies that are closely connected to the us the fact is the fed has kept pressing down the gas pedal over the past several years by sticking to the near zero rates policy hoping to achieve a quick economic recovery in the us from the covid19 pandemic the central bank also purchased a wide range of treasury bonds and other securities backed assets pumping extraordinarily volumes of liquidity into financial markets which has left a large imprint on the fed s balance sheet which has exploded to 9 trillion from less than 5 trillion five years ago as a result inflation in the us started to raise its ugly head in early 2021 while biden pushed congress to approve his giant fiscal stimulus plans one after another since then the price hike has been inflamed by his administration last month the us inflation surged to a fresh four decade high of 8 5 percent from the same month a year ago and the country s rising prices have been unrelenting with six straight months of inflation above 6 percent well above the fed s average two percent target to make things worse the producer price index or ppi which measures the prices of material supplies at factory gates soared 11 2 percent last month the fastest pace in 12 years according to the us department of labor skyrocketing ppi has dented hopes that the inflation peaked in march because ppi inflation will transmit to broader consumer market inflation one to two months later exactly like the financial tsunami in 2008 the surge of inflation also began in the us and then spread to other parts of the globe with the us dollar the world s premium reserve currency acting as the major medium european union member states average inflation hit 7 5 percent in march up from 5 9 percent in february now nearly all the world s developed economies and emerging markets are facing the assault of severe and protracted inflation from mexico and brazil in latin america to south korea singapore and australia in asia pacific inflation is now over 5 percent in about 58 percent of all advanced economies an incomplete statistics showed that up to 70 percent of the countries and regions in the world are now experiencing inflation with the price of food energy house rent used cars airplane flights hotel rooms and other services all cranking up wildly as a result the livelihood of billions of people has become more difficult and there are other man made factors that have contributed to the global inflation and they are originated in the us too the us government s bid to contain china s economic growth by imposing high tariffs on 360 billion chinese goods and washington s strict restrictions to curb semiconductors production in china has led to rising commodity prices while at the same time caused a serious disruption of the world s supply chain bottlenecks in the supply of semiconductors have rippled far and wide as they occurred in items at the start of production chains as the industrial microchips are needed to produce many other consumer goods and ironically the current cycle of high and rising inflation readings have ramped up pressure on the us federal reserve to keep lifting interest rates in 2022 to dampen persistent price rises the fed is anticipated to raise rates by half a percentage point in may the prospect of 200 or more basis point rates hike in the us has already frightened other economies because the fed s sudden financial policy tightening will inevitably lure global capital back to the us as a result many developing economies will be severely battered but many governments cannot do anything because of the dollar s predominance in global financial system many countries will have to follow the paradigm of the us with their economies always swinging between a boom bust
