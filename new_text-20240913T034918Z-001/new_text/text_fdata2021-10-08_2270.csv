senate majority leader chuck schumer announced that lawmakers have reached a deal to raise the debt ceiling i have some good news schumer said from the senate floor we have reached an agreement to extend the debt ceiling through early december and it s our hope that we can get this done as soon as today according to cnbc the deal will raise the debt ceiling by 480 billion which would be enough money to pay the nation s bills until december 3 the senate is expected to take up the bill on thursday october 7 if the bill passes the senate it will then move the house before heading to president joe biden s desk for his signature the senate is moving toward the plan i laid out last night to spare the american people from an unprecedented crisis senate minority leader mitch mcconnell said on the senate floor he said that republicans will not block the measure but added that democrats will have to work alone to raise the debt ceiling again we will also allow democrats to use normal procedures to pass an emergency debt limit extension at a fixed dollar amount to cover current spending levels into december mcconnell said this will moot democrats excuses about the time crunch they created and give the unified democratic government more than enough time to pass standalone debt limit legislation through reconciliation the short term deal will only give lawmakers a brief reprieve from the battle over the debt ceiling if congress fails to act before december 3 the u s will default on its debt for the first time in history that would send shockwaves through the financial markets and likely cause a global recession

the wsws urges metal workers to contact us for assistance in establishing a rank and file committee huntington west virginia area metal workers at two separate facilities walked out october 1 after their contracts expired without new agreements in place at their respective companies four hundred fifty workers at the huntington special metals corporation plant and approximately 50 workers at sulzer pumps in nearby barboursville are picketing around the clock outside their factories to prevent the entry of scab crews special metals workers are organized under the united steelworkers local 40 sulzer pumps workers are members of the industriall global union an affiliate of the international association of machinists and aerospace workers sulzer pumps workers are striking over company demands for changes to seniority rights health care wages and layoff policy at issue in the special metals dispute are a large increase in out of pocket health insurance costs and a pay raise offer from the company that does not come close to what workers are asking the company is reportedly demanding employees pay 1 000 per month for a family health plan about 750 per month more than the current cost special metals workers have received an outpouring of public support on facebook for their strike one worker explained that the company was throwing money away on useless projects but not investing back into the machines that run the place this on top of wanting to cut our wages raise our insurance and take more of our time that we actually do get off while everything around us has risen 30 percent in the past year it s more than just a small cut in pay another worker added ppe and safety policies come to mind more than anything else for me they re only enforced when it s beneficial to the company from what i ve witnessed one supporter of the strike in the local community expressed the growing recognition that the fight of the west virginia workers is part of a broader social conflict it s all about to blow up across the country new york is begging for train operators before they have to shut down the subways people are sick and tired of being treated like disposable assets i see half the country walking off the job people are paying higher taxes food prices have skyrocketed and people s salaries are staying the same said another commenter they are overworked and underpaid although the two plants are only six miles apart there is no indication that the two unions are in communication with one another let alone coordinating the work stoppage reports from multiple media outlets suggest the unions are discouraging workers including those at the picket lines from speaking to the press or the public outside of directing attention to the sparse official statements from the union headquarters the unions acting as little more than spokesmen for corporate management are fearful of the movement of workers in west virginia linking up with the broader opposition developing nationally and internationally across the us and throughout industries like manufacturing health care and education workers are walking out over oppressive conditions and attacks on their living standards as the covid 19 pandemic continues to rage around the world the capitalists are demanding workers stay on the job at the risk of their lives the cost of the pandemic is being forced onto workers backs through unbearable work hours cuts to compensation or layoffs beyond the shop floor the assault on living conditions is felt in massive consumer price hikes in basic goods ongoing supply chain disruptions the ever present risk to the health of the elderly in care settings unvaccinated children required to attend in person schools and the refusal of governments to implement lifesaving policies on masking vaccinations and closure of nonessential businesses in huntington the situation is ripe for a broader strike wave to develop a contract covering 1 000 of cabell huntington hospital s nurses and support staff is set to expire november 2 the town s two hospitals cabell huntington and st mary s medical center both reached record levels of covid 19 hospitalizations in september as the state recorded the highest rate of acceleration of new cases in the country the icus are full and all non emergency surgeries have been canceled meanwhile the schools are rippling with outbreaks with no plans to return to remote learning this is the direct result of the policies of democratic president joe biden and republican west virginia governor jim justice both parties at all levels of government are in lockstep on keeping the economy running full steam ahead no matter the cost to public health the strikes at huntington s two metal processing facilities have an objectively strategic significance the sprawling special metals plant is the largest nickel alloy production facility in the world when special metals parent company precision castparts was acquired by berkshire hathaway in 2016 the 37 billion deal was characterized as the largest ever made by billionaire ceo warren buffett it is a fortune 500 company and ranks among the top in the aerospace and defense industry suppliers the oregonian describes portland oregon based precision castparts head mark donegan as having long been among the northwest s best paid ceos with average annual compensation at 12 3 million not including at least 50 million in stock the alloys produced in huntington are used in military jet engines commercial aircraft deep sea oil rig drilling equipment energy processing facilities and deep sea oil rigs on the 130 acre huntington facility are operated two 35 ton electric arc furnaces a 24 ton vacuum induction melting furnace and rolling mills capable of producing metal coils up to 60 feet wide and weighing 15 tons special metals produces superalloys capable of withstanding temperatures of 760 degrees celsius or 1 400 degrees fahrenheit consider venus the hottest planet in the solar system is about 475 degrees celsius these are massive dangerous operations that require a high degree of skill from the workforce to operate safely according to social media comments by friends and family of striking workers the company has been working its employees 16 hours a day sulzer pumps likewise integral to the global economy requires a highly skilled workforce for its precision machines and foundry sulzer is a switzerland based company with manufacturing and service facilities in 180 locations globally the barboursville parts manufacturing center produces parts for pumps required for oil refineries barges and critical water energy and chemical infrastructure both companies are imposing the impact of global economic slowdown onto the shoulders of their workforces on top of the plummeting demand in the airline industry due to pandemic travel restrictions precision castparts special metals also lost a huge chunk of revenue after the boeing 737 max fleet was grounded sulzer pumps chairs peter löscher and greg pox guillaume bragged in a letter to shareholders that the company rebounded with good momentum after countries lifted lockdowns and they implemented an aggressive ramp down to cut their workforce in order to fight back workers must recognize what they are up against they face not just individual corporate bosses but a powerful ruling class of capitalists their political representatives and the global capitalist system organized in the interest of their corporate profits as the pandemic has revealed the republicans and democrats alike along with the unions who align with the faction presently in power are united in maintaining this system no matter the cost to the working class over 708 000 americans have died from covid in the past 18 months worldwide the official toll has reached over 4 5 million and the reality is likely many times higher if the pandemic is to be stopped the working class must stop it this requires as a start the building of rank and file safety committees in every workplace independent of the capitalist parties and the trade unions on october 24 the world socialist web site and the international workers alliance of rank and file committees iwa rfc are holding an online webinar to explain the urgent necessity for an eradication policy for covid 19 a panel of scientists and epidemiologists will provide the critical knowledge necessary to develop a broad based and international political movement to finally put an end to the pandemic we urge all workers to attend share and help build for this critical event contact us to begin setting up rank and file committees at your workplace

woke world designer stella mccartney is the green queen of british fashion stella mccartney is the green queen of british fashion a designer who sells her corporate brand and her expensive clothes on the alluring concept of glamour with a conscience father sir paul was on the front row at her label s fashion show in paris this week sitting next to french actress isabelle huppert hollywood star demi moore was also among the guests who cooed with delight over bags made from mushroom skin grown in a lab in eco friendly conditions a passion for the environment is exactly what one might expect from the vegetarian daughter of the former beatle and his late animal rights activist wife linda stella has had some less welcome publicity however as the company that bears her name has been embroiled in a dispute with stanley gibbons the world famous coin and stamps company has been left out of pocket after a rent dispute with mccartney s business which had been sub letting a shop from stanley gibbons on manhattan s swanky madison avenue under an agreement in the summer mccartney s firm paid part of the bill nonetheless stanley gibbons said last month that the shortfall had pushed one of its subsidiaries in the us into administration each of the two businesses bear the names of their founders but they have little else in common this is a clash between two very distinct commercial cultures stella a 50 year old mother of four whose friends include gwyneth paltrow madonna and kate moss is the archetypal celebrity entrepreneur her image and her famous name are key selling points for her high priced wares at her flagship store on london s old bond street the atmosphere is literally rarefied a special ventilation system developed by a team of atmospheric chemists airflow engineers and sensor developers from london and copenhagen has been installed lest customers inhale any noxious fumes such eco pampering does not come cheap and neither do the outfits this season s offerings include small shoulder bags costing more than 1 200 trainers for just under 500 and the magnolia dress a cobalt blue and black creation in sustainable viscose with a cut out in the midriff area then there are the 950 over the knee duck city glitter boots which with their round toes and flared high heels resemble something slade would have worn in their 1970s pomp this exquisitely cool woke world could not be further from the rather fusty aura of stamp collecting that permeates stanley gibbons though what that company lacks in modernity and gloss it makes up for in affection its much loved store on the strand in central london opposite the savoy hotel has been a site of pilgrimage for generations of collectors from schoolboys to serious philatelists first class feud stamp dealer edward stanley gibbons above left and a penny red stamp one of only five in existence stella as an individual is separate from the business and cannot be held personally responsible for paying its bills but a settlement was reached between stanley gibbons and the fashion house in the summer over the unpaid rent on the sublet manhattan store the terms are not known the stamp company executives however might well be wondering why the mccartney firm did not simply pay its bill after all it is backed by the multi billion pound luxury conglomerate lvmh which has a stake of just under 50 per cent back in april before the settlement stanley gibbons said acidly in a statement to the stock exchange that despite being backed by one of the largest and most profitable businesses in the world the stella mccartney company was attempting to walk away from their lease commitments without making any form of restitution stella mccartney declined to comment her camp however would no doubt take issue with the idea her company simply walked away they could justifiably point out that they in fact engaged in negotiations that led a deal to settle part of the lease obligations mccartney s company was certainly not the only one to be entangled in rent wrangles many businesses found themselves in a similar situation due to covid 19 she opened her first new york store in manhattan s then super cool meatpacking district in 2002 and subsequently moved to nearby soho in 2016 she took on the lease of the store at the centre of the row on madison avenue from malletts an antique dealer owned by stanley gibbons that ran until 2027 this upper east side branch was supposed to showcase her clothes to new york s moneyed and conservative uptown girls the property sits just north of an elegant shopping corridor between 57th and 72nd streets that estate agents call manhattan s gold coast a stella mccartney model with a mushroom skin bag stella s company took over 4 340 sq ft of space comprising the ground and first floors of a five storey victorian terraced building and lost no time in embarking on a lavish refit inevitably the focus was on sustainability with decor in handmade and organic materials including fluted ceramic tiles and reclaimed farmhouse timber but when covid 19 struck last year and the store was forced to close her business stopped paying the rent the settlement with stanley gibbons is understood to have been significantly less than the full liabilities over the lifetime of the lease which runs to 2027 and not enough to satisfy the stamp company s liability to the ultimate landlord the wealthy goldman family as a result stanley gibbons had to put its american offshoot into a bankruptcy protection arrangement known as chapter 11 to the relief of its loyal devotees it is only the us subsidiary malletts that has been hit the main uk business of stanley gibbons is not going under that firm is listed on the london stock market and is backed by asset manager phoenix which owns a controlling stake but the rent affair has raised some tricky questions for mccartney what price her business s ambitions to create an ethical brand if the company does not abide by the most basic of commercial principles namely to pay its bills it like many fashion retailers has suffered in the pandemic her company was making a loss prior to covid in 2019 the red ink at stella mccartney ltd hit nearly 32million despite this she still paid herself just over 2 4million though in fairness that was less than the 3 6million she received the previous year and she did not take a dividend of 531 000 that had been awarded in 2018 in a very unusual move its auditor has raised a red flag over the most recent accounts accountants mazars who were appointed in june last year slapped a qualification on the figures basically the bean counters issued a warning that they were unable to verify that the accounts gave a true and fair view of the financial position qualifications are rare and only happen when auditors have very serious concerns these centred around stock which the company said was worth nearly 4million mazars said they could not vouch for the valuation as they had not been present at the stock checking which took place before they were hired the qualifications appear to relate to the transition to lvmh but it would certainly be very concerning if they were repeated in the next accounts however lvmh which bought a sizeable minority stake in 2019 is a french behemoth valued at more than 270billion the accounts of parent company anin star which was set up in july 2019 when mccartney embarked on her partnership with lvmh were also qualified the auditors said they were unable to determine whether adequate accounting records had been kept previously stella s business was in a joint venture with rival luxury group kering which owns the gucci and yves st laurent brands stanley gibbons with a heritage dating back to 1856 has survived bigger threats than wayward tenants philately has not been immune from the pandemic and the company made a 4 1million pre tax loss in the year to the end of march but having traded through innumerable recessions not to mention a bomb blast in the second world war it has survived worse to some the decision to stop paying rent will seem a sound though hard nosed commercial judgment for britain s most famous green fashionista however it s not the best look

most days newly arrived afghans fill the lobby of a church basement in fairfax county va a suburb of washington d c families with young kids young couples older adults they re all here for help with their resettlement cases and to stock up on donated toiletries and housewares that are piled everywhere in the fairfax office of lutheran social services of the national capital area since august the organization has helped as many people as it did all of last year for us that feels like a surge already said ceo kristyn peck in an interview northern virginia is home to one of the largest afghan communities in the u s that makes it a prime destination for new arrivals and peck expects her office to get even busier people are coming with really pressing immediate needs sometimes it s just as basic as clothing showers food she said and then trying to make sure that they have a place to stay that night and then move them into permanent housing as quickly as possible the hallways are lined with boxes of toothbrushes deodorant shampoo and diapers as well as household items like plates mugs and drinking glasses office cubicles serve as storage for pillows and bedding so many donations have poured in since august that the organization needed a storage trailer in the parking lot to handle the overflow joel rose npr npr shelves of donated supplies at a refugee resettlement office in northern virginia today i come here because i need some stuff like the sheets said a man who asked us to simply call him khan he worked in the afghan government and requested that we not use his full name because his wife and family are still in danger in kabul for now khan is living with one of his sons who s going to college in virginia and says he feels welcome here the people is very good they are very honest and they help us a lot he said in an interview resettlement organizations like this one are rebuilding on the fly after deep cuts during the trump administration last year the u s accepted the lowest number of refugees since the modern resettlement program began now congress has authorized more than 6 billion to support afghan resettlement the roughly 200 field offices that do this work are scrambling to prepare they re trying to find more affordable housing and hiring as fast as they can the numbers are daunting roughly 53 000 afghans are living on military bases in the u s and 14 000 more will soon be on their way from military bases overseas the vast majority are not technically refugees they re entering the u s under what s known as humanitarian parole and they have lots of questions about how it works it s a new country said david mutombo the head of virginia operations for lutheran social services of the national capital area so most of the time when they arrive they don t have a clue about their next step joel rose npr npr handmade signs decorate the hallway at a refugee resettlement office in fairfax county va that s the case for one newlywed couple who stopped by the office this week she s a u s citizen he s afghan they escaped together from kabul in august along with the man s brother they asked that we not use their full names because his parents are still in afghanistan where they ve been threatened by the taliban the woman who asked to be identified only by her initials n t says they spent a few weeks on military bases in italy and new jersey before coming back to her home in virginia right now the hardest thing is basically just not knowing what their status is n t said we don t have any of their documents back yet we don t have any of their work permits we don t have anything yet his main struggle is he doesn t know where to start and what to start she said about her husband what s next for afghans with humanitarian parole will look in some ways like what refugees typically get they re eligible for housing assistance and help finding a job but that all depends on resettlement agencies like this one doing more and doing it faster than they ever have before copyright 2021 npr to see more visit
by visualcapitalist in 2020 the stock market and the economy had a very public break up the wall street vs main street divide the gap between america s financial markets and the economy was growing by the end of the year the s p 500 index closed at a record high in contrast 20 million americans remained unemployed up from 2 million at the start of the year was 2020 an outlier or does the performance of the stock market typically diverge from the economy in this markets in a minute chart from new york life investments we show u s economic growth and stock market performance over the last four decades to see how closely the two relate gdp growth and s p 500 returns here s how annual gdp growth and s p 500 index returns stack up from 1980 to the second quarter of 2021 both metrics are net of inflation note for q1 and q2 2021 real gdp growth and inflation rates are quarterly rates and are seasonally adjusted more often than not gdp growth and s p 500 index returns have both been positive the late 90s saw particularly strong economic activity and stock performance according to the white house economic growth was bolstered by cutting the deficit modernizing job training and increasing exports meanwhile increasing investor confidence and the growing tech bubble led to annual stock market returns that exceeded 20 in the selected timeframe only 2008 saw a decline in both the stock market and the economy this was of course caused by the global financial crisis banks lent out subprime mortgages or mortgages to people with impaired credit ratings these mortgages were then pooled together and repackaged into investments such as mortgage backed securities mbs when interest rates rose and home prices collapsed this led to mortgage defaults and financial institution bankruptcies as many mbs investments became worthless moving in opposite directions what about when the wall street vs main street divide grows we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us historically it has been more common to see positive gdp growth and negative stock performance for example real gdp grew by a whopping 7 in 1984 due to reaganomics such as tax cuts and anti inflation monetary policy however the stock market declined as rising treasury yields of up to 14 made fixed income investments more attractive than equities on the other hand in five of the six years with negative gdp growth there have been positive stock returns the most recent example of this is 2020 real gdp declined by 3 5 while the s p 500 returned almost 15 net of inflation the stock market is not the economy there are a number of reasons why the stock market may not necessarily reflect what is happening in the economy the stock market reflects long term views a stock s price factors in what investors think a company will earn in the future if investors are confident in the likelihood of an economic recovery stock prices will likely rise in contrast gdp growth is a hard measure of current activity a stock s price factors in what investors think a company will earn in the future if investors are confident in the likelihood of an economic recovery stock prices will likely rise in contrast gdp growth is a hard measure of current activity sector weightings in the stock market do not reflect their contributions to gdp the stock market remained resilient in 2020 largely because technology media and telecom tmt stocks performed well despite making up 35 of the market cap of the largest 1 000 u s stocks these companies only account for 8 of u s gdp in

provided large scale economic stimulus through the cares act in march 2020 but further relief packages were stalled due to political disagreements while many factors are at play the above can help explain the wall street vs main street divide wall street vs main street together and apart over the last 41 years the economy and the stock market have moved in opposite directions almost as often as

blockchain in supply chain article 6 the advent of new technology brings along with it the murkiness of how the american legal system will treat such technology before the rise of blockchain for instance businesses were uncertain how courts would treat electronic records and signatures until the federal legislature enacted the e sign act on june 30 2000 1 to provide even more clarity to businesses the national conference of commissioners on uniform state laws drafted the uniform electronic transactions act the ueta 2 to provide states with a framework to enact laws governing the enforceability of electronic records and signatures now almost every state in the u s has adopted some form of the ueta 3 and industry heavily relies on electronic contracting the legislative process has already begun for blockchain technology arizona and tennessee both enacted laws stating that 1 a blockchain technology signature is considered an electronic signature and 2 a blockchain technology record is considered an electronic record further these laws say that courts may not deny a contract legal validity because the contract contains a smart contract term 4 other states are also attempting to adapt their current commercial laws to blockchain technologies wyoming for example is breaking ground by addressing blockchain s impact on the attachment perfection and priority rules of article 9 of the uniform commercial code 5 similarly delaware and maryland have amended their general corporation and limited liability company laws to permit the use of blockchain technologies for creating and maintaining company records with respect to equity interests 6 beyond when and how legislatures and courts will solidify blockchain technology as a valid platform for contracting there are other possible legal questions and ramifications for the use of blockchain in the supply chain some possible areas of legal considerations follow below potential modifications to contract terms in supply agreements as companies begin to implement blockchain solutions drafters should give thought as to what contract terms to adjust in supply agreements and other commercial contracts related to the use of blockchain in the supply chain some potential modifications to consider follow blockchain governance parties to a supply agreement will need to decide whether a supply agreement should detail which transactions can or must occur on the blockchain or whether the parties should set forth which transactions should occur on the blockchain in a separate agreement governing the implementation governance funding and maintenance of the supply chain blockchain flexibility will be important as blockchain technology continues to evolve and becomes more prevalent so it may be most practical for both parties to execute an addendum listing transactions that the parties can agree to update requirements on suppliers and sub suppliers a buyer may consider whether it would be beneficial to contractually require its suppliers to join the buyer s supply chain blockchain a buyer could take this approach a step further and extend it to sub suppliers as well a contract could require both the supplier and its suppliers to join the buyer s supply chain blockchain which would provide the buyer a deeper visibility into its supply chain for smaller suppliers and sub suppliers the ability to keep up and participate in this evolving area may present a challenge that impacts their ability to compete for certain business confidentiality with multiple member blockchains the parties may want to explicitly state whether or not a receiving party adding certain confidential information of a disclosing party to the blockchain would be considered a permitted disclosure by the receiving party the parties must also consider the contract s provisions on removal and return of confidential information at the end of a contract with the immutability of blockchain in mind purchase orders and payment terms if a buyer must place purchase orders or releases through the blockchain system the parties will need to revise the ordering mechanism of the contract to reflect this process additionally if the parties plan to handle payment by blockchain smart contracts the parties will need to revise the traditional approach of invoicing after shipment and paying within a certain period to account for the terms of any smart contract product acceptance if the buyer will make payment automatically via smart contract at the time of product acceptance the supply agreement should be very precise as to when product acceptance occurs indexing and shipping costs many supply chain contracts use some form of indexing for raw materials or other cost inputs to adjust pricing periodically blockchain has the potential to significantly streamline this process by allowing parties to modify contract pricing that is linked to an index faster and easier by using a smart contract to rewrite the new price to the ledger and automatically update payments via blockchain based on the new contract pricing although traditionally raw materials have been the focus of indexing provisions given the recent massive fluctuations in freight and container costs contracting parties can share risk for fluctuating shipping costs by indexing through blockchain technology as well force majeure when drafting force majeure provisions the parties may want to explicitly define whether issues with the blockchain such as smart contract malfunction or compromise of a party s access to the blockchain would be considered a force majeure event that can be relied upon by a party to excuse from performance under the contract in most cases parties may want to align this issue with whether existing language covers it system issues if such issues are included as force majeure events the parties should consider adding a threshold requirement that a party cannot claim force majeure for issues resulting from the party s own failure to maintain industry appropriate protective measures effect of termination in the event of termination of a supply agreement the parties will want to explicitly set forth any requirements to unwind the blockchain or terminate the related smart contracts alternatively the effect of termination provisions could point to a separately executed agreement specifically dedicated to blockchain governance which would cover the rights and responsibilities of the parties if the supply agreement dictates the parties must unwind the blockchain conflicts in the resolving conflicts section of the supply agreement which provides the order of precedence of contract terms in the event of conflicting language the parties should detail how to resolve a conflict between a coded smart contract or other blockchain terms and conditions and the text of the supply agreement entire agreement when drafting the entire agreement section of a supply agreement the parties will want to identify what if any terms and conditions set forth in the applicable blockchain network are part of the agreement between the parties and then provide that all other terms are not part of the agreement service level credits for logistics agreements the parties may want to define key performance indicators kpis or service level agreements slas based on data from the blockchain because that data is considered trusted for instance the parties could define processing time to receive inventory to a warehouse i e dock to stock time as the difference between the date and time of receipt of product at the warehouse and the date and time of stock of product in the warehouse in each case based on the data uploaded by any applicable iot device to the supply chain blockchain data privacy considerations for blockchain while blockchain is considered a highly secure means of data storage paradoxically some of blockchain s other attributes being decentralized and immutable pose a compliance barrier with many data privacy regulations such as the california consumer privacy act of 2018 cal civ code 1798 105 ccpa and the eu s general data protection regulation gdpr blockchain s decentralized platform makes it tricky to determine which privacy laws apply the nature of a decentralized platform permits processing of an individual s information in any number of locations around the world because an individual s personal data such as a person s full name social security number or email address could be located on different nodes each of which could exist in a different jurisdiction as each jurisdiction regulates the processing of personal data differently attempting to manage the plethora of privacy laws some of which may conflict with others could be a daunting if not impossible and cost prohibitive effort the immutable nature of blockchain also poses a potential issue for data privacy for instance article 17 of the gdpr as well as the ccpa set forth the right to be forgotten the gdpr and ccpa require that processors of personal data erase the personal data of a person under certain circumstances including if the person withdraws consent for the processing of their personal data 7 because of the decentralized and immutable nature of blockchains some potential approaches to handling personal data related to transactions on the blockchain are to store the personal data completely off the blockchain or store only a hash of the personal data a one way mathematic function that represents the personal data but from which the personal data cannot be determined on the blockchain while storing the actual data on a private encrypted database taking another approach programmers could write smart contracts to allow for the revocation of access rights or deletion of information on the blockchain 8 companies would have to customize any supply chain blockchain solution for data privacy compliance issues based on what personal data will be stored what jurisdictions the data will be stored in and the nature of the related blockchain concept smart contracts smart contracts are not necessarily contracts in the traditional sense rather a smart contract is a computer program stored on a blockchain that performs an action when triggered by an event smart contracts take the agreement of two adverse parties to the next level when two parties execute a traditional written agreement they are promising to act in accordance in that agreement when two parties implement a smart contract it is not a mere promise they have already effected an outcome as previously discussed certain states such as arizona and tennessee have laid the groundwork for courts to enforce smart contracts if blockchain continues to become more prevalent in business the need for decisive regulations will pressure other states to follow suit and address smart contracts through legislation see article 5 of this blockchain in supply chain series for more information on smart contracts antitrust considerations for blockchain blockchain provides an avenue for competitors to cooperate particularly in a consortium or other permissioned structure as with any collaboration or joint venture among competitors such collaboration raises potential antitrust risks and can create a slippery slope to claims of collusion and anticompetitive exclusionary conduct among other anticompetitive practices for most blockchain collaborations among actual or potential competitors the greatest practical antitrust risk involves collusion and implicates section 1 of the sherman act 9 section 1 prohibits agreements that unreasonably restrain trade such as agreements among competitors to fix prices rig bids or allocate customers or markets oftentimes courts can infer such anticompetitive agreements based on the exchange of competitively sensitive information among the participants blockchain participants therefore must be mindful of the heightened antitrust risks that come into play should the blockchain arrangement involve the sharing of competitively sensitive information such as pricing costs output or customer specific information to minimize this antitrust risk particularly in a blockchain consortium involving competitors participants should either avoid the exchange of competitively sensitive information altogether or narrowly tailor the information exchanged and adopt other appropriate safeguards where reasonable safeguards to consider include setting up permissions so that only intended recipients of data have access to a block of information and adopting read permission restrictions to prevent employees who have responsibility over pricing marketing strategy and competitively important strategic decisions from accessing competitively sensitive information shared on the blockchain aggregating or anonymizing sensitive data or limiting the information exchange to historical information only instead of current or future data could also minimize the antitrust risks associated with any information exchange that is necessary to the blockchain arrangement in any event participants in a blockchain arrangement should be prepared to articulate why the participants need to exchange the specified type or level of information to achieve pro competitive benefits of the blockchain arrangement consortium blockchain participants may also face antitrust liability under section 1 if they reach an agreement to exclude competitors from the blockchain collaboration where accessing a blockchain has become essential to doing business in a particular market or industry participants should document and consistently enforce well defined and reasonable criteria for membership participants should also exercise additional caution in restricting membership if development of the blockchain technology or any related applications involve standard setting or the adoption of standard essential patents both of which present unique antitrust risks relatedly antitrust scrutiny may also extend to the way in which consortium members approve transactions nodes or members of the supply chain validate transactions to be added to a blockchain in accordance with certain pre determined validation rules then nodes only add transactions to a blockchain if the rules for adding a block to the blockchain are satisfied consensus antitrust risk can increase where these consensus mechanisms prioritize clearance of transactions by certain members or decline to validate transactions by particular parties without a legitimate and objective basis for doing so participants should ensure the validation and consensus mechanisms use objective criteria and that no single participant controls these processes in addition to the most prevalent antitrust risks highlighted above participants should consider other potential antitrust complications when forming or participating in a collaboration with competitors to develop blockchain technology and related applications participants should be mindful of these risks and consult antitrust counsel early in the process as they harness the benefits of blockchain technology to meet their supply chain needs 1the electronic signatures in global and national commerce act e sign act fdic consumer compliance examination manual january 2014 2 final act with comments uniform electronic

u s senate majority leader chuck schumer set up thursday night votes on a short term debt ceiling increase that would leave the battle to be rejoined less than two months from now in the middle of an already packed congressional agenda schumer and gop counterpart mitch mcconnell struck a deal would raise the statutory debt ceiling by us 480 billion according to a senate aide the amount would allow the treasury to meet obligations through dec 3 the same day that the current stopgap government spending bill runs out schumer set up a procedural vote and another for final passage after republicans agreed to expedite the process however mcconnell was still working on gathering enough republican votes to move the debt ceiling bill forward the white house said in a statement that president joe biden looks forward to signing the bill once it is passed news of the deal early thursday added fuel to a rally in stocks the s p 500 index headed for a third day of gains as the risk of an economically devastating tightening in fiscal policy receded for now mcconnell was still working to get at least nine other republicans to vote for schumer s procedural motion called cloture which needs 60 yes votes in order to advance the debt ceiling legislation to the floor democrats could then use their 50 votes plus a tie breaker cast if necessary by vice president kamala harris to pass the bill north dakota republican kevin cramer said he would vote against cloture and against passing the legislation he said mcconnell had not yet rounded up the votes he needs south dakota s john thune the no 2 senate republican said gop leaders were still trying to gauge support we re having conversations with our members and kind of figuring out where people are thune said in the end we ll be there but it s a painful birthing process but schumer s scheduling of votes thursday was a positive sign that the legislation was headed toward passage yellen s deadline the bill would also have to be passed in the house which like the senate is scheduled to be out of session next week however house members could be called back to washington on 72 hours notice the announced deal comes after weeks of partisan brinkmanship over how to raise the debt ceiling which treasury secretary janet yellen has warned would be breached around oct 18 without congressional action while the agreement averts an immediate crisis it means the partisan battle over the debt will again be on the calendar just as congress confronts the deadline to keep the government open with regular fiscal year funding running out democrats are also likely at that time to be trying to get an infrastructure bill and a massive tax and spending plan through the house and senate with their slim majorities that could be politically perilous for democratic lawmakers still sharply divided over biden s us 4 trillion worth of economic plans particularly for moderates in swing states who worry about the overall cost by synchronizing the next debt ceiling date and the shutdown cliff congress is more likely to address them both in a single piece of legislation such a bill could include a top line spending level agreement for fiscal 2022 that addresses gop demands for higher defense spending thereby allowing full year appropriations bills to be included mcconnell first offered the deal on wednesday and leaders negotiated the details into thursday on the senate floor thursday he said republicans still want to force democrats to raise the debt ceiling in december using a process known as reconciliation which would leave republicans entirely removed from the process and from any political fallout schumer has rejected that idea instead trying unsuccessfully to clear it with only democratic votes on a swifter path he had argued that there wasn t enough time before the mid october deadline the process would take about two weeks according to budget experts mcconnell s short term debt limit move was designed to call the democrats bluff while showing republicans were willing to be flexible according to a person familiar with this thinking now there will be no question they will have plenty of time mcconnell said thursday another concern among mcconnell and republicans was that continuing the standoff might push democrats to alter the filibuster rule which gives the minority significant power to bottle up legislation democratic senator joe manchin of west virginia has repeatedly said he won t jettison the filibuster republicans worried that a potential default would change his mind during discussions about the deal on wednesday cramer said some republicans said let s not tempt fate and push joe manchin to wreck the senate and end the filibuster

many investors don t even realize they re in a key stock index investors were upbeat about the prospects for stocks on thursday and the market roared higher to open the session as of 10 a m edt the nasdaq composite ixic 1 68 was up more than 1 continuing its upward momentum from a nice bounce the previous day it s natural for u s investors to think of the nasdaq composite and its more selective peer the nasdaq 100 index as being composed of american companies yet unlike some other indexes the methodology for the nasdaq 100 doesn t discriminate against overseas companies merely looking at market capitalization as a result you ll find several chinese stocks inside the nasdaq 100 and it was those stocks that helped lead the way for the overall market on thursday morning big gains from china chinese stocks have seen their share of turbulence lately but the sentiment among investors this morning was unquestionably positive shares of chinese companies saw some of the biggest gains among nasdaq listed stocks e commerce company jd com jd 1 20 was up more than 5 just after the open internet search giant baidu bidu 0 70 posted a gain of almost 4 while pinduoduo pdd 1 20 followed suit with a nearly 5 rise video game leader netease ntes 2 36 was also sharply higher gaining 4 5 and the online travel website provider trip com tcom 2 77 was up more than 2 probably the biggest news out of china on thursday however came from new york stock exchange listed chinese e commerce giant alibaba group holding baba 0 35 alibaba s stock gained almost 7 on word that berkshire hathaway vice chair charlie munger had boosted the investment that his own company daily journal djco 0 54 had made in the chinese company by more than 80 at this point alibaba now makes up roughly a fifth of daily journal s entire investment portfolio marking a vote of confidence from munger is china a good value or a value trap investing in china has always been somewhat challenging but recently the obstacles have grown even tougher after decades of fostering growth in china s high tech arena government officials have recently done an about face and have looked to impose new regulatory requirements and restrictions on successful businesses alibaba in particular has faced the brunt of animosity with founder jack ma having made comments that didn t make the chinese government particularly happy about his stance trade tensions have hurt u s china relations and legislators in washington have looked at measures that could have removed chinese companies from u s stock exchanges like the nasdaq concerns about potential delisting legislation led to dramatic declines in chinese stock prices arguably creating a value investing opportunity given the fact that legislation wouldn t have had any impact on the fundamentals of their underlying businesses however chinese government actions can and do have a fundamental impact on businesses within the nation and that s why shares that look like a good value right now could prove to be a value trap if china continues along the course it has followed lately it might not make much sense from an economic standpoint to hurt high growth companies but ideological factors could have greater weight among chinese officials than financial ones for now it s important for investors to understand that the nasdaq includes a small but notable holding of chinese stocks that could be a positive if their growth continues or a negative if something happens to hurt their prospects going forward
senate leaders announced an agreement thursday to extend the government s borrowing authority into december temporarily averting an unprecedented federal default that experts say would have devastated the economy our hope is to get this done as soon as today senate majority leader chuck schumer declared as he opened the senate in their agreement republican and democratic leaders edged back from a perilous standoff over lifting the nation s borrowing cap with democratic senators accepting an offer from senate gop leader mitch mcconnell mcconnell made the offer a day earlier just before republicans were prepared to block longer term legislation to suspend the debt limit and as president joe biden and business leaders ramped up their concerns that a default would disrupt government payments to millions of people and throw the nation into recession the senate leaders had worked into the night hammering out the details the senate is moving forward mcconnell said thursday wall street continued to rally on the news the s p 500 rose 1 5 by midday and the nasdaq composite with a heavy weighting of technology stocks rose 1 8 senate majority leader chuck schumer d ny arrives at the u s capitol on oct 7 2021 in washington d c photo by drew angerer getty images sen chris murphy d conn added that assuming final details in the emergency legislation are in order for the next three months we ll continue to make it clear that we are ready to continue to vote to pay our bills and republicans aren t unsurprisingly mcconnell portrayed it very differently this will moot democrats excuses about the time crunch they created and give the unified democratic government more than enough time to pass standalone debt limit legislation through reconciliation he said congress has just days to act before the oct 18 deadline when the treasury department has warned it would quickly run short of funds to handle the nation s already accrued debt load mcconnell and senate republicans have insisted that democrats would have to go it alone to raise the debt ceiling and allow the treasury to renew its borrowing so that the country could meet its financial obligations further mcconnell has insisted that democrats use the same cumbersome legislative process called reconciliation that they used to pass a 1 9 trillion covid 19 relief bill and have been employing to try to pass biden s 3 5 trillion measure to boost safety net health and environmental programs mcconnell said in his offer wednesday that republicans would still insist that democrats use the reconciliation process for a long term debt limit extension however he said republicans are willing to assist in expediting that process and in the meantime democrats may use the normal legislative process to pass a short term debt limit extension with a fixed dollar amount to cover current spending levels into december the agreement sets the stage for a sequel of sorts in december when congress will again face pressing deadlines to fund the government and raise the debt limit before heading home for the holidays the agreement will allow for raising the debt ceiling by about 480 billion according to a senate aide familiar with the negotiations who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss them that is the level that the treasury department has said is needed to get to dec 3 basically i m glad that mitch mcconnell finally saw the light bernie sanders the independent senator from vermont said late wednesday the republicans have finally done the right thing and at least we now have another couple months in order to get a permanent solution sen chris murphy d conn added that assuming final details in the emergency legislation are in order for the next three months we ll continue to make it clear that we are ready to continue to vote to pay our bills and republicans aren t unsurprisingly mcconnell portrayed it differently the pathway our democratic colleagues have accepted will spare the american people any near term crisis while definitively resolving the majority s excuse that they lacked time to address the debt limit through reconciliation mcconnell said thursday now there will be no question they ll have plenty of time congress has just days to act before the oct 18 deadline when the treasury department has warned it would quickly run short of funds to handle the nation s already accrued debt load mcconnell and senate republicans have insisted that democrats would have to go it alone to raise the debt ceiling and allow the treasury to renew its borrowing so that the country could meet its financial obligations further mcconnell has insisted that democrats use the same cumbersome legislative process called reconciliation that they used to pass a 1 9 trillion covid 19 relief bill and have been employing to try to pass biden s 3 5 trillion measure to boost safety net health and environmental programs mcconnell said in his offer wednesday that republicans would still insist that democrats use the reconciliation process for a long term debt limit extension however he said republicans are willing to assist in expediting that process and in the meantime democrats may use the normal legislative process to pass a short term debt limit extension with a fixed dollar amount to cover current spending levels into december while he continued to blame democrats his offer will also allow republicans to avoid the condemnation they would have gotten from some quarters if a financial crisis were to occur earlier wednesday biden enlisted top business leaders to push for immediately suspending the debt limit saying the approaching deadline created the risk of a historic default that would be like a meteor that could crush the economy and financial markets related biden calls gop s refusal to raise debt ceiling hypocritical at a white house event the president shamed republican senators for threatening to filibuster any suspension of the 28 4 trillion cap on the government s borrowing authority he leaned into the credibility of corporate america a group that has traditionally been aligned with the gop on tax and regulatory issues to drive home his point as the heads of citi jp morgan chase and nasdaq gathered in person and virtually to say the debt limit must be lifted it s not right and it s dangerous biden said of the resistance by senate republicans his moves came amid talk that democrats might try to change senate filibuster rules to get around republicans but sen joe manchin d w va reiterated his opposition to such a change wednesday likely taking it off the table for democrats the business leaders echoed biden s points about needing to end the stalemate as soon as possible though they sidestepped the partisan tensions in doing so each portrayed the debt limit as an avoidable crisis we just can t wait to the last minute to resolve this said jane fraser ceo of the bank citi we are simply put playing with fire right now and our country has suffered so greatly over the last few years the human and the economic cost of the pandemic has been wrenching and we don t need a catastrophe of our own making related biden to meet with ceos to discuss consequences of failing to raise debt ceiling ahead of the white house meeting the administration warned that if the borrowing limit isn t extended it could set off an international financial crisis the united states might not be able to manage a default would send shock waves through global financial markets and would likely cause credit markets worldwide to freeze up and stock markets to plunge the white house council of economic advisers said in a new report employers around the world would likely have to begin laying off workers the recession that could be triggered could be worse than the 2008 financial crisis because it would come as many nations are still struggling with the covid 19 pandemic the report said once a routine matter raising the debt limit has become politically treacherous over the past decade or more used by republicans in particular to rail against government spending and the rising debt load ___ ap

i just looked at that and laughed i said in my head that s rich says tilman fertitta who hosted handler that weekend on his yacht anchored off the bahamas just because you are a banker doesn t mean you have to be stiff fertitta s empire spans casinos restaurants and ownership of the houston rockets and the yacht was the setting to plot another deal he calls handler one of his closest friends and credits the banker with building a juggernaut that can go toe to toe with more established rivals when we re sitting around at night and talking and i think rich is getting too big for his britches just because he s worth a billion dollars now i pull out my financial statements and put him back in his place fertitta says with a chuckle handler declined to discuss his wealth and points out the gomez video in which he pretends to be after her job was for a wolf conservation charity the archegos losses were described by people with knowledge of the matter and handler declined to disclose the figure milken acolyte early in his career the new jersey native became one of michael milken s most devoted disciples after the junk bond king s empire collapsed handler rebuffed big banks guaranteeing lucrative paychecks and instead jumped to new york based jefferies the lure handler could keep a portion of the profits from his group he s parlayed that deal into building up more than 7 per cent ownership of jefferies stock over three decades that s now the biggest chunk of his fortune top that up with cash bonuses real estate interests and private partnership stakes and his wealth now exceeds us1 billion according to the bloomberg billionaires index clad in his typical polo shirt and khakis and with an eli manning bobblehead nodding along on his desk handler ticks off wins and grievances he offers a vigorous defence when reminded how jefferies has long been ignored or treated as a nuisance by larger competitors we ve constantly been the firm that they wish would disappear handler says i d love for them to keep saying we ll never be them in their minds we are firm no 497 keep underestimating us keep being pejorative we ll keep performing for our clients some numbers he holds dear the jump in advisory and capital markets revenue from us90 million when he took over to us4 billion now another about 69 per cent of its banking business is repeat revenue proof that it can build lasting ties advertisement if i texted rich handler and if he doesn t call me back in 10 minutes i ll be floored says doug cifu the ceo of virtu financial challenged to prove it he taps out a call me text to handler who rings 30 seconds later cifu tells him it was just a test and you can get back to work springsteen s lasagna handler doesn t tire of casting himself as a regular guy from jersey and takes umbrage to the notion that he s a merchant of high finance there s no world of high finance that s all a friggin myth he says i sold vacuum cleaners door to door and life insurance in college i came to the office today from downtown in the subway i had to convince a guy next to me to wear a mask that s my real world of high finance he gets wide eyed talking about the lasagna bruce springsteen once served when he was invited to the boss place the two photos on his desk one with his family and another with springsteen and then there s the signed guitar from the singer that says from one new jersey guy to another a ticked off building manager in jefferies old connecticut office once sent a note to all the tenants asking them to stop wearing flip flops and shorts around the office handler was the guilty party but he s hardly bashful of his burgeoning wealth i pay a boatload of taxes audit me 27 times every time they audit me i get money back handler says i wish my accountants weren t so conservative he points to his firm s charity record and the role it plays in helping companies grow and hire more people it s reminiscent of the lines preached by milken in the 1980s rival firms relish in pointing out that jefferies wades into risky deals that others might spurn the flip side of that reputation is that when premier companies need help jefferies is less likely to be their first call those prejudices make handler bristle advertisement when our same people were at our competing firms they were prestigious investment bankers doing quality deals handler says somehow when they walk through our doors they became scrappy the edge in handler s tone has been sculpted over 30 years as he s cajoled sceptics to take jefferies more seriously given his all consuming style it s easy to see how everything involving the firm is personal for handler his approach means nudging clients along to his trampoline class or a karaoke session or that one time when handler brought his mother along to a business event in florida because she lived there the first thing you need to know is you never leave a jewish mother behind virtu s cifu says but there s not another ceo on wall street that would have brought his mother to the event being hosted by an important client where jefferies has made some of its most visible gains is in banking the so called middle market when regulators ratcheted up pressure on big banks to ease off on highly leveraged financing to companies jefferies gained market share and has kept it knife fight there have been harrowing moments while memories of investment banks collapsing in 2008 were still fresh credit ratings firm egan jones questioned whether jefferies was overleveraged alarming the sharemarket handler who still fumes about the episode turned around and merged jefferies with investing conglomerate leucadia national which had holdings in everything from wineries and beef to real estate shoring up his capital base handler has spent recent years peeling off those non financial assets now the risk for jefferies is what s proved to be its biggest edge through the pandemic how does a pure play investment bank sustain growth once the boom times roll off it lacks the adjacent divisions of its bigger rivals like a giant wealth operation a trillion dollar asset management arm or a consumer facing business those less volatile businesses help banking giants keep their profits up when there s less to do on wall street handler casts his firm s simplicity as an advantage avoiding the self destructive infighting that conglomerate banks experience we don t have a culture where the fixed income team hates the equities team and they both hate investment banking he says with the typical wall street dysfunctional culture when there s a bad year there s a knife fight over the bonus pool it s not a one man show we have a team that s worked their butts off but for a man who ascended to the ceo seat when he was 39 and is now in his 21st year there what about succession handoffs can be hard to execute and disruptive jpmorgan morgan stanley and bank of america are all on slow paths to testing and grooming eventual successors to their ceos who already have spent more than a decade at the top handler points out that he only just turned 60 the age when many bosses first take over if i ever felt i was sticking around too long people would tell me i would probably know before they do handler says that being said do i sound like a guy who wants to leave bloomberg wealth

most days newly arrived afghans fill the lobby of a church basement in fairfax county va a suburb of washington d c families with young kids young couples older adults they re all here for help with their resettlement cases and to stock up on donated toiletries and housewares that are piled everywhere in the fairfax office of lutheran social services of the national capital area since august the organization has helped as many people as it did all of last year for us that feels like a surge already said ceo kristyn peck in an interview northern virginia is home to one of the largest afghan communities in the u s that makes it a prime destination for new arrivals and peck expects her office to get even busier people are coming with really pressing immediate needs sometimes it s just as basic as clothing showers food she said and then trying to make sure that they have a place to stay that night and then move them into permanent housing as quickly as possible the hallways are lined with boxes of toothbrushes deodorant shampoo and diapers as well as household items like plates mugs and drinking glasses office cubicles serve as storage for pillows and bedding so many donations have poured in since august that the organization needed a storage trailer in the parking lot to handle the overflow today i come here because i need some stuff like the sheets said a man who asked us to simply call him khan he worked in the afghan government and requested that we not use his full name because his wife and family are still in danger in kabul for now khan is living with one of his sons who s going to college in virginia and says he feels welcome here the people is very good they are very honest and they help us a lot he said in an interview resettlement organizations like this one are rebuilding on the fly after deep cuts during the trump administration last year the u s accepted the lowest number of refugees since the modern resettlement program began now congress has authorized more than 6 billion to support afghan resettlement the roughly 200 field offices that do this work are scrambling to prepare they re trying to find more affordable housing and hiring as fast as they can the numbers are daunting roughly 53 000 afghans are living on military bases in the u s and 14 000 more will soon be on their way from military bases overseas the vast majority are not technically refugees they re entering the u s under what s known as humanitarian parole and they have lots of questions about how it works it s a new country said david mutombo the head of virginia operations for lutheran social services of the national capital area so most of the time when they arrive they don t have a clue about their next step that s the case for one newlywed couple who stopped by the office this week she s a u s citizen he s afghan they escaped together from kabul in august along with the man s brother they asked that we not use their full names because his parents are still in afghanistan where they ve been threatened by the taliban the woman who asked to be identified only by her initials n t says they spent a few weeks on military bases in italy and new jersey before coming back to her home in virginia right now the hardest thing is basically just not knowing what their status is n t said we don t have any of their documents back yet we don t have any of their work permits we don t have anything yet his main struggle is he doesn t know where to start and what to start she said about her husband what s next for afghans with humanitarian parole will look in some ways like what refugees typically get they re eligible for housing assistance and help finding a job but that all depends on resettlement agencies like this one doing more and doing it faster than they ever have before
by asit k biswas and cecelia tortajada china daily updated 2021 10 08 07 12 jin ding china daily china has proven all the doomsayers wrong it has not slid into stagnation like japan or the republic of korea as the doomsayers had predicted because of two key factors first is the intense competition in the private sector which now accounts for 90 percent of urban employment in fact the growth of the private sector in china has been phenomenal with some 248 chinese companies with a combined worth of 2 1 trillion had listed on the us stock exchange by the end of may 2021 that not a single chinese company was listed in the us when china launched reform and opening up more than four decades ago shows the extent of the chinese private sector s success similarly when us angel investor aileen lee coined the term unicorn in 2013 only 39 start ups were valued at 1 billion or more and not even one of them was from china but today china accounts for more than half of the over 200 unicorns in the world the second factor is the quest of hundreds of millions of chinese people to improve their standard of living through hard work dominant economic force in the world china will continue to remain a dominant economic force irrespective of what the united states or other western economies do china is expected to become the largest economy in real gdp terms in the next 10 15 years and it is already the largest trading partner of almost twice as many countries as the us so the race between china and the us to win the hearts and minds of countries both developed and developing is likely to be a dominant theme in the second quarter of the 21st century also china has achieved one of its two centenary goals that of building a moderately prosperous society in all respects and eradicating absolute poverty by 2020 2021 being the 100th year of the founding of the communist party of china and it is on the way to realizing the second centenary goal of building a great modern socialist country by 2050 2049 being the 100th anniversary of the founding of the people s republic the pursuit of the second goal will guide china s future national economic and social policies including economic reform and international relations as well as its approach to pressing global challenges such as climate change and black swan events how the world sees china and how china sees the world are seldom the same in many instances where the west sees risks china often sees opportunities for example when china proposed the belt and road initiative many western countries opposed it tooth and nail some still do yet in 2021 us president joe biden proposed a somewhat similar concept build back better albeit its extent and implementation unlike the belt and road initiative s are not known similarly while the west wants to maintain the existing global financing and development infrastructure china added to it by helping establish the asian infrastructure investment bank and wants reform in the bretton woods institutions to make them more representational and increase the say of developing countries challenges need to be addressed however china faces several challenges in achieving the second centenary goal including the demographic challenge especially because the birth rate has not increased despite the easing of the family planning policy all couples are now allowed to have three children for example about 12 million new births were recorded in 2020 significantly fewer than 14 65 million in 2019 at the current fertility rate of 1 3 china s population will start declining by the end of this decade this will further reduce the working age population which peaked a decade ago china s policymakers are aware of this conundrum and that s one of the reasons why strict new requirements have been imposed on the private tutoring sector the objective is to reduce the cost of education which is a big burden on parents and a key reason why many couples are reluctant to have more than one child or even one child also china has been trying to meet the shortage of labor by improving productivity through the use of automation and robots china has another important policy option to cope with the reducing working age population problem its average retirement age is among the lowest in the world as normally men retire at 60 and women at 55 this is surprising especially because china s life expectancy is 77 only two years less than oecd countries where the retirement age is 64 years and early retirement has been a drain on china s retirement fund since people have to be financially supported for a much longer period perhaps china should consider increasing the retirement age for all to 65 in order to make better use of human resources and reduce pension costs as for income inequality it started to increase in china in the early 1980s and peaked in 2008 but despite the income inequality the real incomes of most families in china have been increasing for example the income of the bottom 10 percent of the population increased 63 percent between 1980 and 2015 the opportunities china has created for people to improve their livelihoods can be gauged from the fact that four decades ago china didn t have a single billionaire today it is home to the highest number of billionaires in the world 1 058 compared with 696 in the us moreover to reduce the income gap chinese policymakers selected zhejiang one of the most prosperous provinces in the country with per capita income of 52 000 yuan 8 042 85 in 2020 as a pilot zone for realizing the goal of common prosperity the aim is to increase per capita income to 75 000 yuan by 2025 in order to reduce the big gap between the rich and the poor by clamping down on those using illegal means to amass huge amounts of wealth and encouraging the rich to contribute more to charity the government s goal is to realize common prosperity across the country technological headwinds china s development trend including advancement in the science and technology sectors gained pace in the 21st century in the early 2000s china s share of the top 10 percent of most highly cited publications was below world average but today it has already overtaken the european union countries on this metric although china s r d expenditure was 514 8 billion less than the us 612 7 billion in 2019 it was significantly higher than the eu states 390 5 billion and china s elite universities have steadily improved their global rankings issuing 49 500 doctorate degrees in 2018 compared with 42 000 in the us and 45 000 in the eu president xi jinping said that science has no borders but scientists have motherlands while encouraging chinese scientists to merge their own scientific pursuits into the magnificent undertaking of building a modern socialist industry indeed china has become a scientific and technological powerhouse and in some important fields such as robotics artificial intelligence quantum technology and financial technology it may have surpassed the west as such some western countries are viewing china as a potential threat and a formidable economic competitor some western countries have even banned the exports of critical core technologies and high tech equipment to china to slow even reverse its economic and technological progress when and to what extent china can leapfrog the west in terms of technology is uncertain but if it succeeds in doing so the current western embargo may become a blessing in disguise as it would contribute to china s self sufficiency in critical fields if it takes too long or if the breakthroughs are not advanced enough this could significantly affect its future economic development plans strong fight against climate change climate change is another factor that could have a major impact on china s future china is a global leader in renewable energy and the largest producer and exporter of solar photovoltaic panels and wind power plants it also leads the world in terms of electric vehicles but it has to spend trillions of dollars to restructure industrial transportation and other systems in order to realize peak carbon emissions before 2030 and become carbon neutral before 2060 as it has pledged chinese leaders have been cautiously pragmatic about trying new and radical policies nationwide by first carrying out pilot exercises to see how a new policy or plan works and fix the loopholes if any before implementing it nationwide this trial and error approach has helped china in the past and is expected to help it navigate uncharted territories to meet the climate goals judging by the way china has handled pressing and complex problems over the past decades one can be cautiously optimistic that by the middle of the century it will become a strong democratic civilized harmonious and modern socialist country if it does so and there is good reason why it should its economy will be three times that of the us in

posted in collectibles funko tagged funko new york comic con nycc funko wins award for worst new york comic con 2021 experience one year ago funko had one of the worst convention experiences with their 2020 new york comic con event to help combat bots however funko has outdone itself with this year s 2021 nycc event which included no lottery system a new waiting queue and last minute reveals after last year s fiasco it seemed like these virtual cons were starting to get better with a smooth lottery system winner and loser notifications and a nice assortment of reveals these past couple of conventions though have really gone downhill starting with san diego comic con 2021 with their lack of loser notifications silly and pointless fundays event and last minute pops removed from their funkoshop release things only got worse as time went on and it seemed like funko was more worried about pushing out content than having anything to really back it up this time everything kicked off today at 12 pm est where all of this year s nycc 2021 exclusive was releasing and without a lottery system this allowed every collector to enter the shop and test their luck on try to get one of these official stickered pop vinyls funko then implemented a brand new waiting queue and it was included for i quote give as many fans as possible an opportunity to get exclusives however this was not the case at all as entering the site at 12 00 pm est put me to a 20 minute wait which only grew as time went on even though there were no pops i wanted this time i ended this terrible funko shop launch at 12 31 pm est with a total of 55 minutes of wait time left with nearly all exclusives already sold out i was not the only collector who experienced this sad nycc launch which now forces collectors to go through shared retailer exclusive to attempt to get their wanted pops once again i have been collecting funko pops since 2012 so conventions are always a blast to be apart of as it gives us some new limited edition pieces to our pop sets however this is just sad and it was one of the worst conventions i have experienced from not a single pop that piqued interest to the last minute announcements i understand that the bot pandemic has easily destroyed the internet but i feel like the lottery system was a simple fix before the pandemic the only people who would have owned an official sticker nycc pop were attendees of the actual convention and obtained at the funko booth funko is already doing fans a favor by offering these exclusive pops to the public and it could have been done in an easier manner the lottery system was password protected and was at random giving everyone a nice chance to enter i do not know what has changed but funko really rushed this convention and it really shows with last minute announcements and plenty of delays most toy companies have passed on going to the official nycc 2021 event so it would have been perfectly fine to postpone an event like this until they knew all shared retailers had stock for these exclusives no one is marketing a winter convention so funko s 1st winter wonderland con would have been nice to see from lackluster social interaction money first and fans second concept and the lack of fun funko has really let me down these past couple of months they can only learn from this blunder and make sure to update and prepare for their next launch be sure to keep your eyes peeled at each retrospective shared retailer for their nycc 2021 exclusive dropping online possibly tonight and tomorrow good luck enjoyed this please share on social media stay up to date and support the site by following bleeding cool on google news today

viewpoint consumer price inflation in the eurozone accelerated further in september to a 13 year high of 3 4 year on year prompting a wave of alarmed headlines annual inflation in the united states stood at 5 3 in august so how concerned should european and us policymakers be about a possible prolonged inflationary surge in the eurozone at least the current inflation headlines are to be expected experience suggests that an economic crisis leads first to a deflationary scare and then to an inflationary one in the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis deflationary worries at the bottom of the subsequent recession were followed by an uptick in inflation during the ensuing recovery a similar pattern has been evident in the covid 19 crisis for part of last year prices in the eurozone were falling and the talk was of the pandemic s lingering deflationary effects some perspective is thus in order for starters reported inflation is usually the increase in the consumer price index compared to 12 months ago unusually low prices in the preceding year thus distort the figure today this base effect is not merely one factor among many behind the rising inflation numbers it is key to understanding them given the low point in the year earlier period the easiest way to look past the temporary price spike created by the 2020 covid driven base effect is to calculate inflation over the last 24 months instead of 12 on this basis the latest eurozone numbers do not suggest strong inflation dynamics the headline inflation rate as measured by the harmonised index of consumer prices was 3 4 in september but the index has risen only by 1 5 per year over the last two years likewise german consumer price inflation was 4 1 in september 2021 a 29 year high but the index was up only just above 2 per year when measured over a two year period that bridges the covid 19 effect headline inflation is also influenced by volatile energy prices it should therefore not be a surprise that the eurozone s annual core inflation rate which strips out energy prices has been flat in recent years remaining in a narrow range of around 1 1 5 when measured over two year intervals but there is a clear transatlantic difference with two year based inflation drifting up in the us american consumer prices have increased by over 3 3 per year on average for the last 24 months even the core personal consumption expenditures pce index is now running at over 2 5 during the last two years clearly above the 1 5 2 range that was common in the previous decade another reason why some fear that inflation may accelerate from these relatively modest levels is the rapid increase in many raw material prices but this too was to be expected in the context of a global recovery while crude oil futures prices briefly turned negative at the height of the pandemic induced financial market turbulence in early 2020 oil is now trading at 70 80 per barrel a similar roller coaster pattern occurred after the global financial crisis prices of gas futures have soared recently in europe but this peak can only be temporary with prices in european hubs five times the us level arbitrage with cheaper us shale gas will bring european prices back down over time prices of other raw materials like metals also tend to jump when industry recovers higher commodity prices increase headline inflation in the short run but need not start an inflationary spiral true one did develop following the oil price shocks of the 1970s but that was because workers and consumers in commodity importing regions like europe and to a lesser degree the us refused to accept the loss of purchasing power resulting from more expensive energy and demanded higher wages to compensate such a spiral is much less likely to occur today after all the commodity price boom of the early 2000s was not followed by a sustained increase in inflation this was partly because advanced economies energy and raw material intensity has fallen over time as olivier blanchard and jordi gali have argued today s prices for oil and many other commodities appear high relative to last year but they remain below the peak of 2008 leading central banks today resemble ships pushed dangerously close to deflationary cliffs by the covid 19 shock now the wind is changing and their anti inflation anchors are slipping project syndicate

quarter employers announced 52 560 job cuts the fewest since the second quarter of 1997 and down 23 from the july september period stocks on wall street were trading higher the dollar dipped against a basket of currencies u s treasury prices fell supply woes layoffs last month were led by companies in the healthcare products sector with 2 673 announced cuts since the pfizer vaccine received full fda approval many healthcare facilities have implemented vaccine mandates which have led to the firing of non compliant workers ongoing strains in the supply chain saw industrial goods manufacturers laying off 2 328 workers in september while warehousing businesses reported 1 936 job cuts there were 1 679 job cuts in the services sector but the rise in layoffs was dwarfed by an explosion in planned hiring in part as retailers gear up for the holiday season the challenger report showed companies announced plans to hire 939 790 workers compared to only 94 004 in august with companies eager to hire more people are coming off the state unemployment rolls the claims report showed the number of people continuing to receive benefits after an initial week of aid tumbled 97 000 to 2 714 million in the week ended sept 25 that was the lowest level since mid march 2020 the total number of people collecting unemployment checks under all programs dropped to 4 172 million during the week ended sept 18 from 5 027 million in the prior week that reflected the end of extended benefits last month which economists hope will increase the labor pool the pandemic forced some people to drop out of work to become caregivers others are reluctant to return for fear of contracting the coronavirus while some have either retired or are seeking career changes that has left employers desperate to fill a record 10 9 million job openings as of the end of july the worker shortages have impacted job growth though there is optimism that hiring picked up in september according to a reuters survey of economists nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 500 000 jobs last month estimates range from as high as 700 000 jobs to as low as 250 000 reflecting the mixed labor market indicators in september a survey from the conference board last week showed consumers views of current labor market conditions softened while the institute for supply management s measure of manufacturing employment rebounded last month after contracting in august its measure of services industry employment slipped the economy created 235 000 jobs in august the fewest in seven months the unemployment rate is forecast dipping to 5 1 in september from 5 2 in august going forward the combination of easing labor supply constraints strong labor demand and an improving covid outlook should spur further labor market progress said lydia boussour lead u s economist at oxford economics in new york

lashed out at california government officials calling their temporary covid related health orders fascist in an expletive laced rant in 2020 musk personally relocated to the austin area from los

forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc south florida newsletters however the company plans to increase production in its california plant regardless of the headquarters move to be clear we will be continuing to expand our activities in california musk said our intention is to increase output from fremont and giga nevada by 50 if you go to our fremont factory it s jammed but he added it s tough for people to afford houses and people have to come in from far away there s a limit to how big you can scale in the bay area regarding the plant underway in austin he noted that it would take some time to reach full production even after it s completed it takes tesla less time to build a factory than to reach high volume production musk said for example tesla s shanghai plant was built in 11 months but took a year to reach high volume production he expects tesla s new plant near austin will follow shanghai s example musk s growing dissatisfaction with california has been apparent for some time in april 2020 on a tesla earnings call musk lashed out at california government officials calling their temporary covid related health orders fascist in an expletive laced rant later musk personally relocated to the austin area from los angeles where he had lived for two decades doing so enabled musk who is also ceo of aerospace company spacex to reduce his personal tax burden and be closer to a spacex launch site in boca chica texas tesla s board granted musk an executive compensation package that can earn him massive stock awards based on the automaker s market cap increases and some other financial targets if he sells options set to expire in 2021 he could generate proceeds of more than 20 billion this year according to insiderscore california levies some of the highest personal income taxes in the country on its wealthy residents but texas has no personal income tax tesla is not the first company to move its headquarters out of california to texas oracle and hewlett packard are among the tech giants who decided to make that move last year for example texas has been actively recruiting companies via its texas economic development act offering tax breaks to put new facilities in the state austin with a top tech university and cultural events like south by southwest is a draw for tech employers making such a move is not particularly burdensome explained business attorney domenic romano managing partner of romano law in new york city a delaware business that has operated as a foreign corporation with headquarters in california like tesla has could relocate its domicile by establishing a facility in a new state hiring there and relocating key employees they would not have to shut down operations in other states although they typically do pare them back from a legal perspective there s less of a regulatory burden in texas romano said it s a more business and employer friendly state in many ways you have to jump through far fewer hoops in texas or florida as an employer than you do in california in terms of reporting requirements and more tesla has not been happy with one set of regulations in texas at least the state bans direct sales of cars instead car companies sell their vehicles through independent franchised dealerships there in other states where similar laws apply tesla has fought to change the rules or exploited some loopholes for example by setting up their own store and service center on tribal lands in new mexico texas gov greg abbott said the tesla ceo supported his state s social policies as well however elon musk declined to weigh in on texas restrictive new abortion law after abbott made that claim in general i believe government should rarely impose its will upon the people and when doing so should aspire to maximize their cumulative happiness musk wrote on twitter at that time that said i would prefer to stay out of politics said musk tesla has generally garnered a huge amount of support from the state of california since it was founded there in 2003 it has enjoyed grant funding tax breaks incentives and favorable policies from the likes of the california air resources board california energy commission and california alternative energy and advanced transportation financing authority among others clarification this report has been updated to clarify how long it takes tesla to build a factory versus how long it takes to reach high volume production
u s senator joe manchin r wv faces reporters after it was announced that the u s senate reached a deal to pass a 480 billion increase in treasury department borrowing authority at the u s capitol in washington photo reuters leah millis the u s senate on thursday took a step toward passing a 480 billion increase in treasury department borrowing authority a move that would avert a catastrophic debt default later this month but set up another partisan showdown in early december democratic senate majority leader chuck schumer aimed to hold an important procedural vote on saturday that could clear the way for passing the debt limit increase advertisement that vote could come sooner if all 100 members of the senate which is evenly split between democrats and republicans agreed to speed up the process if the legislation clears the first hurdle to limit debate on the bill as expected the senate would then be poised to vote on raising the debt ceiling to 28 9 trillion from the current 28 4 trillion senate passage could come as late as sunday or monday if any senator insists that all available debate time be used but schumer held out hope for faster action we have reached agreement to extend the debt ceiling through early december and it s our hope we can get this done as soon as today schumer said early on thursday news of the negotiations drove wall street s main indexes up in a broad based rally in a sign of bond market relief the yield on one month treasury bills fell to its lowest point since sept 8 as investors deemed that risk of default had eased nevertheless there were early signs of resistance from some republicans who registered opposition to either the bill itself or the procedures for debating it a closed door lunch to determine whether the legislation could be expedited through the senate possibly on thursday or friday was inconclusive according to several republicans gaining enough republican cooperation to promptly move forward on the bill no 2 senate republican john thune told reporters will be a painful birthing process if the senate approves the bill the democratic led house of representatives would then vote on the measure before it went to president joe biden to sign into law reconciliation washington s debt limit troubles are unlikely to be resolved even with passage of a stop gap increase senate republican leader mitch mcconnell is still expected to insist that the next increase in december be achieved through a complicated budget reconciliation process that is time consuming but will allow for passage without any republican support doing so could bolster republican candidates in the 2022 congressional elections as they try to burnish their credentials as fiscal conservatives even though most of them previously supported an array of measures that jacked up u s budget deficits democrats adamantly rejected such the reconciliation process for dealing with the debt ceiling as too unwieldy and establishing a bad precedent referring to the deal providing a debt limit reprieve until december mcconnell said in a senate speech now there will be no question they ll democrats have plenty of time to pass the next increase using reconciliation democrats had been trying to pass legislation that would have raised the debt limit through the end of 2022 which republicans blocked without congressional action the treasury department has forecast that it will run out of ways to pay all of its bills and meet its debt obligations by oct 18 while the deal relieves debt ceiling pressures for now it adds to the high stakes partisan battles congress will wage through the end of the year democrats want to pass two massive spending bills that make up much of biden s domestic agenda in the coming weeks including a multitrillion dollar social policy package and a 1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill it also faces a deadline for funding the government beyond dec 3 the partisan debt limit fight raised republican fears that democrats might change a rule known as the filibuster that requires a supermajority of 60 votes for most legislation to advance if the debt issue were not resolved the 50 50 split in the senate has allowed republicans to use the filibuster to block several democratic initiatives biden said late on tuesday that democrats would consider making an exception to the filibuster to hike the debt ceiling and defend the economy

most days newly arrived afghans fill the lobby of a church basement in fairfax county va a suburb of washington d c families with young kids young couples older adults they re all here for help with their resettlement cases and to stock up on donated toiletries and housewares that are piled everywhere in the fairfax office of lutheran social services of the national capital area since august the organization has helped as many people as it did all of last year for us that feels like a surge already said ceo kristyn peck in an interview northern virginia is home to one of the largest afghan communities in the u s that makes it a prime destination for new arrivals and peck expects her office to get even busier people are coming with really pressing immediate needs sometimes it s just as basic as clothing showers food she said and then trying to make sure that they have a place to stay that night and then move them into permanent housing as quickly as possible the hallways are lined with boxes of toothbrushes deodorant shampoo and diapers as well as household items like plates mugs and drinking glasses office cubicles serve as storage for pillows and bedding so many donations have poured in since august that the organization needed a storage trailer in the parking lot to handle the overflow joel rose npr npr shelves of donated supplies at a refugee resettlement office in northern virginia today i come here because i need some stuff like the sheets said a man who asked us to simply call him khan he worked in the afghan government and requested that we not use his full name because his wife and family are still in danger in kabul for now khan is living with one of his sons who s going to college in virginia and says he feels welcome here the people is very good they are very honest and they help us a lot he said in an interview resettlement organizations like this one are rebuilding on the fly after deep cuts during the trump administration last year the u s accepted the lowest number of refugees since the modern resettlement program began now congress has authorized more than 6 billion to support afghan resettlement the roughly 200 field offices that do this work are scrambling to prepare they re trying to find more affordable housing and hiring as fast as they can the numbers are daunting roughly 53 000 afghans are living on military bases in the u s and 14 000 more will soon be on their way from military bases overseas the vast majority are not technically refugees they re entering the u s under what s known as humanitarian parole and they have lots of questions about how it works it s a new country said david mutombo the head of virginia operations for lutheran social services of the national capital area so most of the time when they arrive they don t have a clue about their next step joel rose npr npr handmade signs decorate the hallway at a refugee resettlement office in fairfax county va that s the case for one newlywed couple who stopped by the office this week she s a u s citizen he s afghan they escaped together from kabul in august along with the man s brother they asked that we not use their full names because his parents are still in afghanistan where they ve been threatened by the taliban the woman who asked to be identified only by her initials n t says they spent a few weeks on military bases in italy and new jersey before coming back to her home in virginia right now the hardest thing is basically just not knowing what their status is n t said we don t have any of their documents back yet we don t have any of their work permits we don t have anything yet his main struggle is he doesn t know where to start and what to start she said about her husband what s next for afghans with humanitarian parole will look in some ways like what refugees typically get they re eligible for housing assistance and help finding a job but that all depends on resettlement agencies like this one doing more and doing it faster than they ever have before copyright 2021 npr to see more visit

for lgbt history month we asked a level teacher and former education manager nazmia jamal to write us a resource to support teachers exploring the work of lgbt poets in school introduction this is not a resource about where to find a good example of anaphora or caesura in the work of a queer poet nor will it instruct you in which lexical set or semantic field you should ask your students to find in my experience english teachers know precisely how to pick apart unseen poems with their classes and they don t need my help there instead this resource aims to offer you a range of poets and poems that you can celebrate in your classroom and some writing prompts for how you might encourage your students to write poetry of their own particularly in our pandemic ridden times the poems you find via this resource might also be just the thing you have been looking for for a coursework text a mock exam or to use in a tutorial or assembly context i was lucky enough to start my pgce in september 2003 the very same month that section 28 was finally taken off the statute books section 28 or clause 28 for those of you who do not know was a 1988 amendment to the local government act that stated that a local authority shall not intentionally promote homosexuality or publish material with the intention of promoting homosexuality or promote the teaching in any maintained school of the acceptability of homosexuality as a pretended family relationship this law was sometimes used to prosecute people but more than that it frightened schools and libraries into silence about anything lgbt and the effects of this on curriculum and collections can still be felt today there were of course people who flouted the rule i found out about section 28 from my english teacher who explained that legally we shouldn t be learning about oscar wilde but we did anyway and many fabulous protests including lesbian avengers bursting in on a live news broadcast by the time i came to teaching it was pretty easy to slip queer writers into the classroom and often they were already there in the set text lists i ve taught everything from the hours and angels in america to trumpet and surge to teach these texts without talking about their queer context would have been impossible for lgbt teachers it can be a source of fear and shame or indeed pride and principle to highlight the sexuality or gender identity of the writers they are teaching for straight teachers allies or otherwise it can sometimes be a source of discomfort or embarrassment to confront these issues when perhaps all you want to do is get on with discussing enjambment or extended metaphors but in my experience it is always worth it not only are you offering a greater contextual understanding of the texts you are teach you are offering a lifeline to the queer kids in your classrooms and there will be some allow them to see that they have a literary heritage where their experiences are explored and their lives are possible it can make all the difference it did to me read more about section 28 and its legacy here who to read who to teach lgbtq poets are everywhere they are laureates and makars and winners of prizes here is a list of 50 poets to get you started if you already teach one or more of them then maybe you could just insert a bit more queer context into your teaching of them perhaps you were given one of their books for christmas or picked it up because it won a prize but haven t managed to read it yet i m willing to bet that you won t have to go further than your own bookshelf or the school stock cupboard to find something you can teach for lgbt history month a e houseman a k blakemore adrienne rich alice walker allen ginsberg andrew mcmillan audre lorde carol ann duffy caroline

the poetry society website has a wealth of material to explore there are poetry mixtapes by some of the poets listed above so mayer inspired young poets networkers to write poems inspired by bletchley park where alan turning cracked the enigma code and the foyle young poets anthologies offer gems such as steven chung s exception to snow if you are interested in american writers head to the poetry foundation s excellent themed collections of queer love poems and lgbtq pride poems and remember to support your local lgbt bookshop during these difficult times writing about non binary poets your students will probably be able to tell you more about gender neutral pronoun usage than i will but do remember some of the poets you study might use they them pronouns here is a link from teen vogue which i found useful to share with my department and students some exercises a gay poem by keith jarrett listen to keith jarrett perform a gay poem read the poem here discuss with your students what they think makes a poem gay does the poet have to be gay can a straight person write a gay poem can you think of examples of gay poems what do they have in common the window by mary jean chan read the poem here mary jean chan won second prize in the national poetry competition in 2017 for this heartbreakingly on the nose portrayal of the struggle between a mother and daughter she begins once in a lifetime you will gesture at an open window tell the one who detests the queerness in you that dead daughters do not disappoint for teaching context try the poet s essay on queerness and language in a particularly stand out issue of modern poetry in translation i identify as queer in all senses of the word in english in chinese there are other names ones which i seldom use because those words and their specific connotations do not evoke the ways in which i have become and am still becoming queer this discovery takes place within language rooted in the tongues i speak writing prompts for students write a poem describing a difficult conversation write a poem addressed to a person you know who is having a hard time write a poem about something you are glad you did not do a litany for survival by audre lorde i m writing in february 2021 when it is not just lgbt people who are preoccupied with survival we all are i think it is always a good time to introduce your students to the writing of the self styled black lesbian mother warrior poet audre lorde but now really is a particularly good time read her poem a litany for survival here more context about her life here writing prompt for students write your own class version of the poem thinking about your collective experiences of struggle and survival during the pandemic so far or any other shared difficulty poem about my rights by june jordan over the course of preparing this resource i asked a number of people which lgbt poet wish they could have studied at school the overwhelming majority of people responded that they would have wanted to read june jordan you can find out more about the late june jordan by watching pratibha parmar s seminal documentary a place of rage which is also incredibly useful if you are teaching the color purple watch this animation and reading of poem about my rights read the poem here this is a great poem to use when teaching the assessment objective consider the context in which the text was produced and received jordan wrote the poem in 1978 what was the context in which she was writing how might it have been received at the time reading it now what still rings true how might geographical location age political persuasion gender etc change our response to this poem community mourning we are living in a time of deep grief and will probably live the rest of our lives in a legacy of collective mourning the poetry of lgbt writers is a gift in such times read about the history of poetry about the aids crisis here read jay bernard s collection surge which mourns and considers mourning rituals for the victims of the new cross massacre grenfell tower friends family members and naomi hersi a black trans woman from london who was brutally murdered by her partner in 2018 read richard scott s collection soho and mourn queer geographies lost to gentrification and the passing of time in 2016 forty nine people were killed in a mass shooting at a gay nightclub called pulse in orlando florida in the aftermath alexis pauline gumb s poem pulse went viral watch her read it here scroll down to see the text of the poem under the video she writes about the loss of a community of people she had not yet met but was sure to have met maybe just in passing one day i was going to see you in hallways and be too shy to say hello you were going to come to the workshop you were going to sign up for the workshop and not come writing prompt for students write a poem addressed to someone who has died who you never met this could a person in your family a person from long ago or perhaps an imagined victim of the pandemic who you imagine you might have run into one day if they had survived wild nights wild nights by emily dickinson wild nights wild nights were i with thee wild nights should be our luxury futile the winds to a heart in port done with the compass done with the chart rowing in eden ah the sea might i but moor tonight in thee there has been much speculation in recent years about whether exam board favourite emily dickinson was queer whether she was or not she certainly had some passionate attachments to the women in her life and as someone who lived in self imposed lockdown ruminating about death for most of her adult life she does seem to be a poet for our times not all dickinson s poems were doom and gloom though the rush of longing and excitement dashed out here is full of joy and promise wild nights wild nights were i with thee wild nights should be our luxury read about dickinson s lockdown activities like writing intense lesbian processing letters and baking giant cakes here writing prompts for students write a poem with abandon and full of expectation write about a night out you want to have after the pandemic write about the life you want after school and maybe after you leave home write about a holiday you want to go on remember to consider who are you writing your poem to is it a friend you haven t seen for a while a crush a family member or is it addressed to a whole community maybe you are writing to strangers you want to meet whatever you write about and whoever you are writing to try to channel dickinson s excitement may wild times come again for all of us soon happy lgbt history month 2021 nazmia jamal has been the education manager at the poetry society and a programmer at bfi flare the

meaningful dialogue with the company or provision of information he said evergrande which faces nearly 150 million in offshore payment obligations next week did not respond to a reuters request for comment neil mcdonald a restructuring partner in the hong kong office of kirkland ellis said the bondholders would like more transparency and hoped evergrande would meet disclosure obligations under

the senate dodged a u s debt disaster thursday night voting to extend the government s borrowing authority into december and temporarily avert an unprecedented federal default that experts warned would devastate the economy and harm millions of americans the vote of 50 48 in support of the bill to raise the government s debt ceiling by nearly a half trillion dollars brought instant relief in washington and far beyond however it provides only a reprieve assuming the house goes along which it will republican and democratic lawmakers will still have to tackle their deep differences on the issue once more before yearend that debate will take place as lawmakers also work to fund the federal government for the new fiscal year and as they keep up their bitter battling over president joe biden s top domestic priorities a bipartisan infrastructure plan with nearly 550 billion in new spending as well as a much more expansive 3 5 trillion effort focused on health safety net programs and the environment senate majority leader chuck schumer d ny arrives at the u s capitol on oct 7 2021 in washington d c photo by drew angerer getty images easing the crisis at hand a disastrous default looming in just weeks the republican senate leader mitch mcconnell of kentucky offered his support for a short term extension of the government s borrowing authority after leading solid gop opposition to a longer extension he acted as biden and business leaders ramped up their concerns that a default would disrupt government payments to millions of americans and throw the nation into recession the gop concession was not popular with some members of mcconnell s republican caucus who complained that the nation s debt levels are unsustainable i can t vote to raise this debt ceiling not right now especially given the plans at play to increase spending immediately by another 3 5 trillion sen mike lee of utah shortly before the vote earlier debt ceiling deal reached with gop on short term fix schumer says and sen ted cruz of texas said the democrats had been on a path to surrender on the process used to lift the debt cap and then unfortunately yesterday republicans blinked but sen lisa murkowski of alaska was among those voting to advance the bill i m not willing to let this train go off the cliff she said congress has just days to act before the oct 18 deadline after which the treasury department has warned it will quickly run short of funds to handle the nation s already accrued debt load the house is likely to return to approve the measure next week republican leaders worked through the day to find the 10 votes they needed from their party to advance the debt limit extension to a final vote holding a private huddle late in the afternoon it was a long and spirited discussion in the room said sen josh hawley of missouri mcconnell allowed for an airing of all views and ultimately told the senators he would be voting yes the white house signaled biden s support with principal deputy press secretary karine jean pierre saying the president would sign a bill to raise the debt limit when it passed congress jabbing the republicans she also said it gives us some breathing room from the catastrophic default we were approaching because of sen mcconnell s decision to play politics with our economy wall street rallied modestly thursday on news of the agreement the accord sets the stage for a sequel of sorts in december when congress will again face pressing deadlines to fund the government and raise the debt limit before heading home for the holidays the 480 billion increase in the debt ceiling is the level that the treasury department has said is needed to get safely to dec 3 i thank my democratic colleagues for showing unity in solving this republican manufactured crisis said senate majority leader chuck schumer of new york despite immense opposition from leader mcconnell and members of his conference our caucus held together and we have pulled our country back from the cliff s edge that republicans tried to push us over mcconnell saw it quite differently the pathway our democratic colleagues have accepted will spare the american people any near term crisis while definitively resolving the majority s excuse that they lacked time to address the debt limit through reconciliation mcconnell said thursday now there will be no question they ll have plenty of time mcconnell and fellow senate republicans still insist that the democrats go it alone to raise the debt ceiling longer term further mcconnell has insisted that democrats use the same cumbersome legislative process called reconciliation that they used to pass a 1 9 trillion covid 19 relief bill and have been employing to try to pass biden s 3 5 trillion measure to boost safety net health and environmental programs on wednesday biden had enlisted top business leaders to push for immediately suspending the debt limit saying the approaching deadline created the risk of a historic default that would be like a meteor that could crush the u s economy and send waves of damage worldwide at a white house event the president shamed republican senators for threatening to filibuster any suspension of the 28 4 trillion cap he leaned into the credibility of corporate america a group that has traditionally been aligned with the gop on tax and regulatory issues to drive home his point as the heads of citi jp morgan chase and nasdaq gathered in person and virtually to say the debt limit must be lifted it s not right and it s dangerous biden said of the resistance by senate republicans once a routine matter raising the debt limit has become politically treacherous over the past decade or more used by republicans in particular to rail against government spending and the rising debt load ___ ap writers lisa mascaro and josh boak in washington and ap business writer damian j troise in new york contributed to this report

treasury secretary janet yellen said thursday night it s become increasingly damaging for the united states to set a debt ceiling the senate is expected to take up a vote to raise the debt ceiling until december an agreement reached by democratic and republican leaders senate gop whip john thune said they have the votes but earlier thursday night former president donald trump attacked mitch mcconnell and said republicans shouldn t vote for this terrible deal even ted cruz and lindsey graham harshly criticized mcconnell for folding as of this posting the senate is voting to advance the deal cnn s erin burnett noted how congress is going to have to do this all over again in december yellen said she breathed a sigh of relief that the senate was able to reach a deal before the october 18th deadline burnett asked about potential consequences if the senate doesn t get it done they need to get this done by the deadline that i set yellen said this would be the first time in the country s history that we would be unable to pay our bills and it would be enormously damaging to the economy to financial markets i ve said and continue to think it would be utterly catastrophic it should be unthinkable she even remarked i think it s become increasingly damaging to america to have a debt ceiling it s led to a series of politically dangerous conflicts that have caused americans and global markets to question whether or not america s serious about paying its bills it s flirting with a self inflicted crisis you can watch above via cnn have a tip we should know tips mediaite com
daily meat consumption in the uk is down 17 in the last decade but that s still not enough to meet climate targets daily uk meat consumption has fallen by 17g per person per day in last decade the study revealed less people are eating red meat than they were ten years ago consumption isn t dropping quick enough to meet national food strategy s goal the goal recommends that meat consumption should fall by 30 per cent by 2031 daily meat consumption in the uk has fallen by 17 per cent across the last ten years a study has found but is still not dropping quickly enough to meet a national target a study published in the journal the lancet planetary health revealed that most people are eating less red meat and processed meat than a decade ago despite the promising drop the data from the national diet and nutrition survey which looks at 15 000 people s eating habits found people are eating more white meat than they were ten years ago the bbc reported the oxford based team found that while there was a 17g daily drop in nationwide daily meat consumption per person it is not happening quickly enough to meet the national food strategy s goal a study published in the journal the lancet planetary health revealed that most people are eating less red meat and processed meat than a decade ago stock image the goal which is based on a review of the uk s food system including farming and sustainability recommended that meat consumption should fall by 30 per cent across the next ten years commenting on the findings lead researcher cristina stewart from the university of oxford said we now know we need a more substantial reduction dr stewart said any reduction in meat consumption will reduce the environmental impact of a person s diet but was quick to add that people don t have to be vegetarians she added if you re someone that eats meat every day reducing your meat consumption by 30 per cent just looks like having two meat free days per week meat production produces more planet warming greenhouse gas emissions than other types of food production but the research did not reveal whether people were changing their diet for environmental factors or other reasons dr stewart who has helped to design environmental labels scoring food products also said eating locally produced meat will have a lower impact on the environment than meat that has been imported but data from the national diet and nutrition survey which looks at 15 000 people s eating habits found people are eating more white meat than they were ten years ago stock image it comes after a new computer modelling study revealed last month that meat and dairy accounts for 57 per cent of food based greenhouse gas emissions taking into account farmland livestock and land use changes global food production is responsible for 17 318billion metric tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions per year the authors said in all 57 per cent of that figure or 9 8billion metric tonnes comes from animal based production and 29 per cent or 5 1billion metric tonnes comes from plant based foods beef and rice are the largest contributing animal based and plant based commodities contributing 12 per cent and 25 per cent respectively of all food production related emissions the fact global emissions from animal based food production are nearly double that from plant based food production further suggest the environmental benefits of switching to a meat free diet meat heavy diets not only risk our health but that of the planet as livestock farming on a massive scale destroys habitats and generates greenhouse gases the study was carried out by a team of international experts led by university of illinois urbana champaign atmospheric sciences professor atul jain it is the first to account for net carbon dioxide co2 methane and nitrous oxide emissions from all sub sectors related to food production and consumption although co2 is the most important and most frequently discussed ghg emissions methane generated by rice cultivation and animals and nitrous oxide from fertilisers are 34 and 298 times more powerful than co2 respectively when it comes to trapping heat in the atmosphere said lead author xiaoming xu it comes after a new computer modelling study revealed last month that meat and dairy accounts for 57 per cent of food based greenhouse gas emissions the study found that food based agriculture accounts for 35 per cent of all human made greenhouse gas emissions of that plant based foods emissions contribute 29 per cent consisting of 19 per cent co2 6 per cent methane and 4 per cent nitrous oxide emissions animal based food emissions contribute 57 per cent consisting of 32 per cent co2 20 per cent methane and 6 per cent nitrous oxide emissions beef was by far responsible for the most greenhouse gas emissions out of all the meat and dairy products more than 4 000 teragrams 4 billion metric tonnes followed by cow milk pork chicken meat sheep meat buffalo meat chicken egg buffalo milk coat meat and horse meat as for plant based foods rice accounted for the most emissions more than 2 000 teragrams followed by wheat sugarcane maize and cassava a starchy root vegetable native to south america advertisement also among the top 10 most greenhouse gas emitting plants were potato soybean bean rape and mustard and sunflower

senate leaders announced an agreement thursday to extend the government s borrowing authority into december temporarily averting an unprecedented federal default that experts say would have devastated the economy our hope is to get this done as soon as today senate majority leader chuck schumer declared as he opened the senate in their agreement republican and democratic leaders edged back from a perilous standoff over lifting the nation s borrowing cap with democratic senators accepting an offer from senate gop leader mitch mcconnell mcconnell made the offer a day earlier just before republicans were prepared to block longer term legislation to suspend the debt limit and as president joe biden and business leaders ramped up their concerns that a default would disrupt government payments to millions of people and throw the nation into recession the senate leaders had worked into the night hammering out the details the senate is moving forward mcconnell said thursday wall street continued to rally on the news the s p 500 rose 1 5 by midday and the nasdaq composite with a heavy weighting of technology stocks rose 1 8 senate majority leader chuck schumer d ny arrives at the u s capitol on oct 7 2021 in washington d c photo by drew angerer getty images sen chris murphy d conn added that assuming final details in the emergency legislation are in order for the next three months we ll continue to make it clear that we are ready to continue to vote to pay our bills and republicans aren t unsurprisingly mcconnell portrayed it very differently this will moot democrats excuses about the time crunch they created and give the unified democratic government more than enough time to pass standalone debt limit legislation through reconciliation he said congress has just days to act before the oct 18 deadline when the treasury department has warned it would quickly run short of funds to handle the nation s already accrued debt load mcconnell and senate republicans have insisted that democrats would have to go it alone to raise the debt ceiling and allow the treasury to renew its borrowing so that the country could meet its financial obligations further mcconnell has insisted that democrats use the same cumbersome legislative process called reconciliation that they used to pass a 1 9 trillion covid 19 relief bill and have been employing to try to pass biden s 3 5 trillion measure to boost safety net health and environmental programs mcconnell said in his offer wednesday that republicans would still insist that democrats use the reconciliation process for a long term debt limit extension however he said republicans are willing to assist in expediting that process and in the meantime democrats may use the normal legislative process to pass a short term debt limit extension with a fixed dollar amount to cover current spending levels into december the agreement sets the stage for a sequel of sorts in december when congress will again face pressing deadlines to fund the government and raise the debt limit before heading home for the holidays the agreement will allow for raising the debt ceiling by about 480 billion according to a senate aide familiar with the negotiations who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss them that is the level that the treasury department has said is needed to get to dec 3 basically i m glad that mitch mcconnell finally saw the light bernie sanders the independent senator from vermont said late wednesday the republicans have finally done the right thing and at least we now have another couple months in order to get a permanent solution sen chris murphy d conn added that assuming final details in the emergency legislation are in order for the next three months we ll continue to make it clear that we are ready to continue to vote to pay our bills and republicans aren t unsurprisingly mcconnell portrayed it differently the pathway our democratic colleagues have accepted will spare the american people any near term crisis while definitively resolving the majority s excuse that they lacked time to address the debt limit through reconciliation mcconnell said thursday now there will be no question they ll have plenty of time congress has just days to act before the oct 18 deadline when the treasury department has warned it would quickly run short of funds to handle the nation s already accrued debt load mcconnell and senate republicans have insisted that democrats would have to go it alone to raise the debt ceiling and allow the treasury to renew its borrowing so that the country could meet its financial obligations further mcconnell has insisted that democrats use the same cumbersome legislative process called reconciliation that they used to pass a 1 9 trillion covid 19 relief bill and have been employing to try to pass biden s 3 5 trillion measure to boost safety net health and environmental programs mcconnell said in his offer wednesday

in the meantime democrats may use the normal legislative process to pass a short term debt limit extension with a fixed dollar amount to cover current spending levels into december while he continued to blame democrats his offer will also allow republicans to avoid the condemnation they would have gotten from some quarters if a financial crisis were to occur earlier wednesday biden enlisted top business leaders to push for immediately suspending the debt limit saying the approaching deadline created the risk of a historic default that would be like a meteor that could crush the economy and financial markets related biden calls gop s refusal to raise debt ceiling hypocritical at a white house event the president shamed republican senators for threatening to filibuster any suspension of the 28 4 trillion cap on the government s borrowing authority he leaned into the credibility of corporate america a group that has traditionally been aligned with the gop on tax and regulatory issues to drive home his point as the heads of citi jp morgan chase and nasdaq gathered in person and virtually to say the debt limit must be lifted it s not right and it s dangerous biden said of the resistance by senate republicans his moves came amid talk that democrats might try to change senate filibuster rules to get around republicans but sen joe manchin d w va reiterated his opposition to such a change wednesday likely taking it off the table for democrats the business leaders echoed biden s points about needing to end the stalemate as soon as possible though they sidestepped the partisan tensions in doing so each portrayed the debt limit as an avoidable crisis we just can t wait to the last minute to resolve this said jane fraser ceo of the bank citi we are simply put playing with fire right now and our country has suffered so greatly over the last few years the human and the economic cost of the pandemic has been wrenching and we don t need a catastrophe of our own making related biden to meet with ceos to discuss consequences of failing to raise debt ceiling ahead of the white house meeting the administration warned that if the borrowing limit isn t extended it could set off an international financial crisis the united states might not be able to manage a default would send shock waves through global financial markets and would likely cause credit markets worldwide to freeze up and stock markets to plunge the white house council of economic advisers said in a new report employers around the world would likely have to begin laying off workers the recession that could be triggered could be worse than the 2008 financial crisis because it would come as many nations are still struggling with the covid 19 pandemic the report said once a routine

i have to admit that i am currently on an avengers binge after the family and i went and saw scarlett johansson s spectacular performance in black widow my wife and i have convinced the children that we need to watch each movie in the series from start to finish the problem is the children like many children have already watched said movies a few times so they have no interest in explaining to mom and dad how the causal connections all work attendees wait in line in front of a marvel studios avengers endgame poster during the d23 expo 2019 in anaheim california u s on friday aug 23 2019 walt disney co is turning the d23 expo the biennial fan conclave into a big push for its new streaming services photographer patrick t fallon bloomberg 2019 bloomberg finance lp what they don t know is that i have been watching the same movie following central banks over the last decade and have a decent picture of how it all ends not well the avengers slogan according to my kids is earth s mightiest heroes must come together and learn to fight as a team if they are going to stop the mischievous loki and his alien army from enslaving humanity in my version the mighty hero wannabes are the non elected heads of the world s largest central banks who have come together based on increasingly fragile economic logic with suits of cash to stop deflation from enslaving human economic activity unfortunately there is an endgame to this story as well although i have not watched that avengers movie yet i don t really know who survives and who doesn t except the one leak that ironman does not survive one thing is sure between here and the monetary policy endgame there is likely to be some spectacular mayhem that we will just have gotten used to no it is not a real city being blown up but the foundations of finance that have been smashed up good for now stock markets are high money is raining down on the public so no one is complaining but what happens when the next correction is met by a lukewarm it s not my problem response from the avengers after watching the recent senate banking committee drama on september 28th where senator elizabeth warren called fed chair powell a dangerous man i feel like i am in another real life avengers movie and we need to figure out what the world looks like when the heroes are done with their battle here the bad guys are not aliens but covid 19 weakening economies deflation inflation supply chain disruptions increasing inequality central bank ethics issues bank regulation etc dangerous transitory man dtm does not worry about inflation that is in everyone s face and in their wallet he believes in the transitory nature of inflation here is a quote from him at a conference hosted at the ecb on september 29th under the auspices of dtw ecb president christine lagarde for some time we and others have been forecasting that the current inflation spike will not lead to a new inflation regime in which inflation remains high year after year the hidden forecast is that inflation is not a problem for dtm so the money spigots will remain open though the impending taper of asset purchases will moderate it by a small trickle starting next month in an old paper by two berkeley economists the point was made that the fed and other central banks just like the rest of us make mistakes of forecasting repeatedly but this is not the main problem the problem as they point out is that the fed has the power to act on its frequently erroneous forecasts and actually acts on its forecasts here is the quote from this paper that is probably more true today than it was before by the way it was written just a couple years before the financial crisis we compare these staff and policymaker forecasts for the period 1979 2001 with actual data to see if the fomc forecasts contain useful information we find that for the most part they do not we also investigate the possible consequences of the fomc s misguided information in particular we examine whether differences between the fomc and staff forecasts help predict monetary shocks we find suggestive statistical and narrative evidence that they do this may indicate that the fomc s attempts to add information to the staff forecast are not just unsuccessful but may lead to inappropriate actions a new paper by federal reserve economist jeremy rudd recently threw cold water on the fed s long held but not proven theory that inflation expectations are what determine inflation the best market based metric of inflation expectations is the forward inflation breakeven rate i e the difference in the forward rate as implied by the difference in nominal and inflation linked bonds tips since the fed can buy and sell as many tips and nominal bonds as they want they can make this breakeven rate whatever they want it to be the proof is in the fed s own data it owns a huge chunk almost 25 of all tips and there are certain maturities where it owns almost all of the tips source federal reserve regarding inflation being transitory ben hunt of the epsilon theory has called the current table pounding on transitory inflation fiat news the proclamation of opinion as fact with all due respect to my wife lawyers very aptly are trained to paint opinion and viewpoints as facts just a reminder all three major central bankers are lawyers however as inflation shows no sign of abating and supply chains are stretched to levels not seen for a very long time the word transitory is rarely being used by powell any more in a piece from arbor research textual analysis of the words employment inflation and financial stability showed that the frequency of the words financial stability relative to the other words has dropped to extremely low levels source arbor research report october 7 2021 in other words with their focus on employment and inflation central banks are less worried about a stock or bond market crash since financial stability concerns are on the back burner at the same time that the current fed chair is in a game of political musical chairs with other fed officials there is a good chance that their ability to aggressively defend financial markets will be hampered crossing red lines to defend the markets as the fed had to do last spring might become harder will dtm even survive to serve for another term for stock and bond markets that have relied on the generosity of the fed and other global central banks a lame duck fed chair could be a problem the fact that stocks are selling off more on days when bond yields rise should be a major concern for those who have been conditioned to both stocks and bonds rising over the last decade this increased positive correlation between stock market prices and bond prices is reminiscent of inflation in the 1970s and in such an environment diversification cannot be trusted much for portfolio protection an essentially unlimited amount of money has been put into the global economy by central banks and a good portion of government checks has arguably been the main cause of stock market rallies and also the cause of the supply bottlenecks as well as good times in las vegas demand has exceeded the ability of manufacturers and shippers to keep up with this demand if supply chains do not return to normal in the course of the next few months there are only two possible paths for the central banks either let prices rise further i e inflation or to sharply slow down the demand i e raise rates in either case holding low yielding global bonds and assets that benefit from low rates is likely to be very painful the sooner investors realize that low rates and money printing not the threat of deflation and economic slowdown has been behind the massive increase in bond prices in particular and asset prices broadly the sooner they will see the threat of inflation not being transitory any sharp rise in bond yields can pop asset price bubbles in this scenario dangerous transitory man or woman might not be able to keep asset prices high if non transitory inflation requires tighter monetary and fiscal policy the house of cards built on weak economic and theoretical foundations could quickly expose the delicate nature of global bond markets today we could soon be repeating the quote from one character from black widow the most recent avengers movie the best part of my life insert investment gains for my life here was fake and none of you told me well now we have been told
washington ap the senate dodged a u s debt disaster thursday night voting to extend the government s borrowing authority into december and temporarily avert an unprecedented federal default that experts warned would devastate the economy and harm millions of americans the vote of 50 48 in support of the bill to raise the government s debt ceiling by nearly a half trillion dollars brought instant relief in washington and far beyond however it provides only a reprieve assuming the house goes along which it will republican and democratic lawmakers will still have to tackle their deep differences on the issue once more before yearend that debate will take place as lawmakers also work to fund the federal government for the new fiscal year and as they keep up their bitter battling over president joe biden s top domestic priorities a bipartisan infrastructure plan with nearly 550 billion in new spending as well as a much more expansive 3 5 trillion effort focused on health safety net programs and the environment easing the crisis at hand a disastrous default looming in just weeks the republican senate leader mitch mcconnell of kentucky offered his support for a short term extension of the government s borrowing authority after leading solid gop opposition to a longer extension he acted as biden and business leaders ramped up their concerns that a default would disrupt government payments to millions of americans and throw the nation into recession the gop concession was not popular with some members of mcconnell s republican caucus who complained that the nation s debt levels are unsustainable i can t vote to raise this debt ceiling not right now especially given the plans at play to increase spending immediately by another 3 5 trillion sen mike lee of utah shortly before the vote and sen ted cruz of texas said the democrats had been on a path to surrender on the process used to lift the debt cap and then unfortunately yesterday republicans blinked but sen lisa murkowski of alaska was among those voting to advance the bill i m not willing to let this train go off the cliff she said congress has just days to act before the oct 18 deadline after which the treasury department has warned it will quickly run short of funds to handle the nation s already accrued debt load the house is likely to return to approve the measure next week republican leaders worked through the day to find the 10 votes they needed from their party to advance the debt limit extension to a final vote holding a private huddle late in the afternoon it was a long and spirited discussion in the room said sen josh hawley of missouri mcconnell allowed for an airing of all views and ultimately told the senators he would be voting yes the white house signaled biden s support with principal deputy press secretary karine jean pierre saying the president would sign a bill to raise the debt limit when it passed congress jabbing the republicans she also said it gives us some breathing room from the catastrophic default we were approaching because of sen mcconnell s decision to play politics with our economy wall street rallied modestly thursday on news of the agreement the accord sets the stage for a sequel of sorts in december when congress will again face pressing deadlines to fund the government and raise the debt limit before heading home for the holidays the 480 billion increase in the debt ceiling is the level that the treasury department has said is needed to get safely to dec 3 i thank my democratic colleagues for showing unity in solving this republican manufactured crisis said senate majority leader chuck schumer of new york despite immense opposition from leader mcconnell and members of his conference our caucus held together and we have pulled our country back from the cliff s edge that republicans tried to push us over mcconnell saw it quite differently the pathway our democratic colleagues have accepted will spare the american people any near term crisis while definitively resolving the majority s excuse that they lacked time to address the debt limit through reconciliation mcconnell said thursday now there will be no question they ll have plenty of time mcconnell and fellow senate republicans still insist that the democrats go it alone to raise the debt ceiling longer term further mcconnell has insisted that democrats use the same cumbersome legislative process called reconciliation that they used to pass a 1 9 trillion covid 19 relief bill and have been employing to try to pass biden s 3 5 trillion measure to boost safety net health and environmental programs on wednesday biden had enlisted top business leaders to push for immediately suspending the debt limit saying the approaching deadline created the risk of a historic default that would be like a meteor that could crush the u s economy and send waves of damage worldwide at a white house event the president shamed republican senators for threatening to filibuster any suspension of the 28 4 trillion cap he leaned into the credibility of corporate america a group that has traditionally been aligned with the gop on tax and regulatory issues to drive home his point as the heads of citi jp morgan chase and nasdaq gathered in person and virtually to say the debt limit must be lifted it s not right and it s dangerous biden said of the resistance by senate republicans once a routine matter raising the debt limit has become politically treacherous over the past decade or more used by republicans in particular to rail against government spending and the rising debt load ap writers lisa mascaro and josh boak in washington and ap business writer damian j troise in new york contributed to this report today in history oct 7

jin ding china daily china has proven all the doomsayers wrong it has not slid into stagnation like japan or the republic of korea as the doomsayers had predicted because of two key factors first is the intense competition in the private sector which now accounts for 90 percent of urban employment in fact the growth of the private sector in china has been phenomenal with some 248 chinese companies with a combined worth of 2 1 trillion had listed on the us stock exchange by the end of may 2021 that not a single chinese company was listed in the us when china launched reform and opening up more than four decades ago shows the extent of the chinese private sector s success similarly when us angel investor aileen lee coined the term unicorn in 2013 only 39 start ups were valued at 1 billion or more and not even one of them was from china but today china accounts for more than half of the over 200 unicorns in the world the second factor is the quest of hundreds of millions of chinese people to improve their standard of living through hard work dominant economic force in the world china will continue to remain a dominant economic force irrespective of what the united states or other western economies do china is expected to become the largest economy in real gdp terms in the next 10 15 years and it is already the largest trading partner of almost twice as many countries as the us so the race between china and the us to win the hearts and minds of countries both developed and developing is likely to be a dominant theme in the second quarter of the 21st century also china has achieved one of its two centenary goals that of building a moderately prosperous society in all respects and eradicating absolute poverty by 2020 2021 being the 100th year of the founding of the communist party of china and it is on the way to realizing the second centenary goal of building a great modern socialist country by 2050 2049 being the 100th anniversary of the founding of the people s republic the pursuit of the second goal will guide china s future national economic and social policies including economic reform and international relations as well as its approach to pressing global challenges such as climate change and black swan events how the world sees china and how china sees the world are seldom the same in many instances where the west sees risks china often sees opportunities for example when china proposed the belt and road initiative many western countries opposed it tooth and nail some still do yet in 2021 us president joe biden proposed a somewhat similar concept build back better albeit its extent and implementation unlike the belt and road initiative s are not known similarly while the west wants to maintain the existing global financing and development infrastructure china added to it by helping establish the asian infrastructure investment bank and wants reform in the bretton woods institutions to make them more representational and increase the say of developing countries challenges need to be addressed however china faces several challenges in achieving the second centenary goal including the demographic challenge especially because the birth rate has not increased despite the easing of the family planning policy all couples are now allowed to have three children for example about 12 million new births were recorded in 2020 significantly fewer than 14 65 million in 2019 at the current fertility rate of 1 3 china s population will start declining by the end of this decade this will further reduce the working age population which peaked a decade ago china s policymakers are aware of this conundrum and that s one of the reasons why strict new requirements have been imposed on the private tutoring sector the objective is to reduce the cost of education which is a big burden on parents and a key reason why many couples are reluctant to have more than one child or even one child also china has been trying to meet the shortage of labor by improving productivity through the use of automation and robots china has another important policy option to cope with the reducing working age population problem its average retirement age is among the lowest in the world as normally men retire at 60 and women at 55 this is surprising especially because china s life expectancy is 77 only two years less than oecd countries where the retirement age is 64 years and early retirement has been a drain on china s retirement fund since people have to be financially supported for a much longer period perhaps china should consider increasing the retirement age for all to 65 in order to make better use of human resources and reduce pension costs as for income inequality it started to increase in china in the early 1980s and peaked in 2008 but despite the income inequality the real incomes of most families in china have been increasing for example the income of the bottom 10 percent of the population increased 63 percent between 1980 and 2015 the opportunities china has created for people to improve their livelihoods can be gauged from the fact that four decades ago china didn t have a single billionaire today it is home to the highest number of billionaires in the world 1 058 compared with 696 in the us moreover to reduce the income gap chinese policymakers selected zhejiang one of the most prosperous provinces in the country with per capita income of 52 000 yuan 8 042 85 in 2020 as a pilot zone for realizing the goal of common prosperity the aim is to increase per capita income to 75 000 yuan by 2025 in order to reduce the big gap between the rich and the poor by clamping down on those using illegal means to amass huge amounts of wealth and encouraging the rich to contribute more to charity the government s goal is to realize common prosperity across the country technological headwinds china s development trend including advancement in the science and technology sectors gained pace in the 21st century in the early 2000s china s share of the top 10 percent of most highly cited publications was below world average but today it has already overtaken the european union countries on this metric although china s r d expenditure was 514 8 billion less than the us 612 7 billion in 2019 it was significantly higher than the eu states 390 5 billion and china s elite universities have steadily improved their global rankings issuing 49 500 doctorate degrees in 2018 compared with 42 000 in the us and 45 000 in the eu president xi jinping said that science has no borders but scientists have motherlands while encouraging chinese scientists to merge their own scientific pursuits into the magnificent undertaking of building a modern socialist industry indeed china has become a scientific and technological powerhouse and in some important fields such as robotics artificial intelligence quantum technology and financial technology it may have surpassed the west as such some western countries are viewing china as a potential threat and a formidable economic competitor some western countries have even banned the exports of critical core technologies and high tech equipment to china to slow even reverse its economic and technological progress when and to what extent china can leapfrog the west in terms of technology is uncertain but if it succeeds in doing so the current western embargo may become a blessing in disguise as it would contribute to china s self sufficiency in critical fields if it takes too long or if the breakthroughs are not advanced enough this could significantly affect its future economic development plans strong fight against climate change climate change is another factor that could have a major impact on china s future china is a global leader in renewable energy and the largest producer and exporter of solar photovoltaic panels and wind power plants it also leads the world in terms of electric vehicles but it has to spend trillions of dollars to restructure industrial transportation and other systems in order to realize peak carbon emissions before 2030 and become carbon neutral before 2060 as it has

loopholes if any before implementing it nationwide this trial and error approach has helped china in the past and is expected to help it navigate uncharted territories to meet the climate goals
