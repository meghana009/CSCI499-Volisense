south korea s defense minister lee jong sup said in remarks to lawmakers on monday that pop superstars bts should come to the military for their mandatory service and in turn the military should allow them to hold concerts abroad and otherwise maintain their careers while serving bts is south korea s most popular musical act and one of the most beloved and lucrative groups in the world holding multiple world records and topping international pop charts bts band members are especially popular in america where they became the first korean act to debut at the top of the billboard 200 charts and the first to be nominated for a grammy award their international profile has greatly benefitted the south korean economy and boosted the country s international profile one of the world s most successful examples of soft power or the use by a country of cultural influence or other non government means to generate clout bts s ongoing success has long been in jeopardy under the looming need for its seven members to fulfill their military obligations as south korean men the nation technically at war with communist north korea since 1950 though the two sides ended active hostilities in 1953 mandates that all able bodied men serve two years in the country s military most must meet the obligation between the ages of 18 and 28 seoul granted bts a deferment to age 30 the oldest member of the group jin will turn 30 this year triggering the military service requirement defense minister lee jong sup did not appear to consider the possibility of lowering the two year service requirement or exempting bts from serving in the military during his remarks to the national assembly on monday he did however argue that having the artists serve could be a tremendous publicity boon to the armed forces and that given the tangible benefits that bts s success has brought to the country the military should find ways to ensure that the band can continue to perform they should come to the military and i believe there will be a way for us to give them the opportunity to practice as well as allow them to leave the country and perform anytime if they have overseas concerts scheduled lee said according to the korea herald many people do think highly of military service itself and i think bts members enlisting can actually help them with their popularity he reportedly added the national assembly s national defense committee was addressing the ongoing debate over offering men particularly popular artists who fit exceptional criteria a form of alternative service to the military mandate lee suggested allowing bts members to perform abroad while serving as soldiers as a potential compromise we are reviewing the matter within the overall framework of alternative service he was quoted as saying the issue of alternative service appears to be a separate debate from one that began in the legislature last month about the possibility of limiting the amount of time served to three weeks rather than two years in the military yoon sang hyun the lawmaker proposing shortening the amount of service time told reuters last month that bts had done a job that would take more than 1 000 diplomats to do and thus deserved the government to acknowledge that their artistry was a form of service to the nation a gallup opinion study in april showed nearly 60 percent of south koreans supported the bill exempting internationally successful k pop stars from full military service thirty three percent of south koreans opposed the bill voice of america noted in july the administration of conservative president yoon suk yeol won this year s election in a contentious campaign in which mandatory military service became an issue his opponent leftist democratic party candidate lee jae myung said last year that he was hesitant to consider granting the group an exemption to the service even while acknowledging that their success was beneficial to south korea as a whole mandatory military service is a public duty set by the constitution and we must be prudent about granting exceptions we can t deny bts contribution to the nation but we must be careful because it will be hard to draw the line if we expand the scope of exceptions like this lee said during a forum in december in perspective of fairness i think it is more desirable to allow military service deferment for bts and exemptions should be refrained from as much as possible the military service requirement has doomed popular korean boy bands for decades though none had experienced the level of success internationally that bts currently has among the bands to have come closest to doing so however is the bts predecessor big bang which at its peak was the first korean pop k pop band listed on the forbes celebrity 100 list and sold over 140 million albums worldwide the band began to unravel as its members began reporting for military duty in 2017 member t o p reportedly suffered a drug overdose and was demoted to a public service office for another drug scandal member seungri is now in prison and a registered sex offender after being convicted of organizing prostitution services and illegal gambling while his bandmates were in the military g dragon the most popular member was not similarly engaged in scandal but elicited criticism for not reaching the typical promotion levels that recruits reach by the end of their two years the band without seungri released a single for the first time in four years this spring but has not yet returned to the levels of success it experienced before temporarily disbanding for military service the strain of upcoming military service or perhaps an exemption for bts bandmates appeared to partially trigger a conversation broadcast live between the seven members of the band in which they described themselves as exhausted and ready to pause their careers in june shortly after meeting president joe biden for a summit on ending hate crimes doing group activities for so long just like you guys mentioned earlier i started to feel like i ve become a machine i have my own hobbies and things i want to do on my own jin the oldest member whose exemption from military service ends this year said on the livestream celebrating the anniversary of the band s debut we re going through a rough patch right now another bandmate jimin said we re trying to find our identity and that s an exhausting and long process our fans know us and we know us suga a third bandmate said the band was entering an off season a comment translated on the livestream as entering a hiatus given the timing of jin s upcoming military service entertainment news outlets took the remark to mean that the band was temporarily breaking up prompting a catastrophic collapse for stocks of hybe its record label which dropped nearly 2 billion in value in one day the incident occurred less than a week after the debut of the band s latest album proof bts is responsible for nearly 90 percent of hybe s profits hybe representatives desperately tried to claim that the use of the word hiatus was a mistranslation and the ban would continue to perform the team never said it was taking a break a hybe spokesperson told south korea s joongang ilbo they made the announcement because bts had always released albums as a group and they didn t want to worry or startle the fans when individual releases start coming out follow frances martel on facebook and twitter

chief executive officer thank you maya and good morning everyone to kick things off as you may recall from earlier discussions we outlined three strategic pillars to propel our business forward our first strategic pillar relates to our core business which is the best in class all outdoor microwave and millimeter wave market segment our second strategic pillar involves the expansion of our business into open network architecture domains our flagship product in this domain is our new virtual indoor unit a first in the market that can also be used as a cell site router and our third strategic pillar focuses on strengthening our managed services offering to deepen our relationship with our customers in the second quarter of 2022 we experienced gains in market share particularly at the high end of the market according to our estimates ceragon makes up approximately 25 of the market for best of breed solutions the largest and fastest growing market segment driven by increasing demands of networks as they transition to 5g this is the result of the execution of our strategic priorities starting with our first pillar we witnessed the strength of our core business in wireless backhaul a leading tier 1 global operator serving multiple countries in asia africa and latin america selected our wireless backhaul solutions to expand their coverage to remote islands and strengthen their transport network we also signed a new frame agreement with the pan african tier 1 operators for the first time in our history and we have already run a poc with them on our unique advanced space diversity feature having true global operators choose ceragon is a testament to the reputation and performance of our core business our new virtual indoor unit will increase our market potential in our core domain as well as in our second pillar which is disaggregated cell site routing this is a rapidly growing market segment expected to reach 400 million over the next few years the total value of the overall disaggregated cell site market will reach approximately 1 6 billion and signals even bigger potential we see an opening to disrupt the market with our new ip 50fx product which helps us leverage the fast growing open network trend while the market has just begun to take off we already have 216 units booked with average gross margins exceeding our overall margin profile finally in terms of our third pillar we have strengthened our managed services offering and deepened our relationships with our customers this offering is garnering increasing attention from operators private networks and carriers around the world and has become an important group of networks and carriers around the world and has become an important growth area for us managed services bookings for the first half of 2022 where roughly 8 million which is already around 40 higher than our managed services bookings for the full year 2021 we also expect our software tools business to achieve continued growth with direct sales or as tools for our managed services business we expect these new software tools to drive enhanced margins and recurring revenue as we take market share when it comes to our overall addressable market it is growing demand for microwave transmission equipment is expected to increase over the coming years thanks to 5g deployments which rely more on wireless backhaul than fiber 5g spectrum auctions and launches around the world drive further demand we believe we will see more 5g deployments in india latin america parts of asia and middle east and africa on the delivery front in q2 component shortages and the shipment costs were still a headwind across the industry that said we have begun to witness positive results from different initiatives we took to improve our operational and financial performance which we will address later in this discussion as a result of our actions our q2 gross margin rose to 30 5 compared to 27 7 in q1 2022 while still lower than our 31 5 in q2 2021 we expect to drive further revenue growth and margin expansion going forward we experienced healthy bookings across different regions and enjoy a very strong backlog we expect that these backlog when converted to revenue will translate to a gross margin that s higher than in q2 also thanks to the many gross margin enhancing initiatives we re taking we re excited about the momentum that we re seeing across our business that is because we know that our technology development capabilities are a key competitive differentiator our ability to develop cutting edge products in house is rooted in our strong innovative culture and continuous investment in innovation for example as i mentioned earlier we are the first to bring a virtual indoor unit to market that can also serve as a cell site router this unit has demonstrated all elements of an open network including radio units software operating system and networking units fully aggregated and integrated as part of the true open transport and open networks we just launched these products in february and have already begun seeing strong customer traction with orders received as well as numerous trials and pocs during the first half of the year we re also enhancing our suite of revolutionary ip 50 products using our new radio chip developed in house these products are expected to be launched in 2023 and are expected to reduce bill of material costs by approximately 40 allowing us to gain market share and drive higher margins further we believe that our system on a chip or soc our 5th generation chipset is three years ahead of competing technologies in the market we expect our soc to generate significant cost savings and deliver enhanced performance because it is developed in house it will be a key competitive advantage for the years to come being first to market with new chip technology is extremely important to our customers we are in the productization phase of our next chipset while we estimate that our competitors and merchant chip manufacturers are only now introducing high level concepts of their next generation chips we strongly believe that our strategy of developing chips in house allows us to create better products with superior technology and lower costs while remaining ahead of competition we expect this trend to continue i d now like to give you an overview per region for the first time in our history north america now represents the largest region for us tied with india in the second quarter our bookings in north america represented 26 of our total bookings and grew by 38 over the first quarter when we compare this with our full year projections we see that we are on track to achieve bookings of at least 15 above our internal projections q2 was to say the least a record quarter 5g building and rollouts are in full swing in north america in q2 we capitalize on this momentum a leading tier 1 mobile operator who is looking to maintain its position as the largest and fastest national 5g network is now utilizing our comprehensive portfolio of solutions as well as installation services as part of their ambitious 5g network expansion projects in q2 we also made solid progress with new potential customers we began to see signals of success in our new strategy to capitalize on the growth of private networks and rural broadband demonstrated by recent wins in q2 we continue to expand our activities with tier 1 and tier 2 operators as well as expand services activities we onboarded new employees across the board to strengthen our presence and relationships with our customers when we look at the future we expect to continue to grow and add market share in north america which will contribute enhanced overall margins we have become the no 1 wireless transport vendor in this region for tier 1 operators and we expect to accelerate our growth among tier 1 operators as part of broader 5g adoption and also increase our services portion in this domain in addition increased investment in rural broadband infrastructure is expected to drive our growth among small carriers private networks and wireless broadband providers in multiple domains in india there is a highly dynamic regulatory technological and competitive environment the market is gearing up for the rollout of 5g services countrywide the 5g spectrum auction started at the end of july 72 gigahertz spectrum in many different bands are on sale e band frequencies are part of the 5g auctions which presents a significant opportunity for us we expect demand for e band products to start ramping up in q4 2022 our q2 bookings were strong and we see great potential in india in europe we had another strong quarter like in other regions here too 5g private networks deployment are gaining traction especially in western europe we re making progress across the board with nationwide q1 operators as well as infrastructure companies that operate in rural environments our revenues exceeded our internal projections and we have strong backlog that said we continue to experience ongoing delivery issues in apac the market is being ultra competitive in q2 we focused on securing and growing existing accounts and to transform business to our new product portfolio to include solutions such as ip 50fx we also showcased our disaggregated wireless transport solution in the 2022 tip open network event in indonesia the response was phenomenal as the value delivered to operators is the utmost flexibility to achieve total cost of ownership savings in latin america the impact of the pandemic has finally subsided despite some political instability we see rising investments in different countries we have made progress in pushing our managed services offering now discussing potential new arrangements with customers we see very strong interest 5g rollouts are starting in some countries while in other expansion projects are underway here we are working hard to increase the traction of our market leading ip 50fx product in africa we had a slow start to the year that said as modernizations upgrades and new routes are beginning to take place we see many long term opportunities as i mentioned earlier we signed with a pan african operator and have already run a poc before turning over to our financial results i d like to comment briefly about the current business climate the recent disruption to the supply chain has adversely impacted our financial performance while these seem to be temporary headwinds and are industrywide they have resulted in a significant slowdown in our backlog conversion into revenue and adversely impacted our gross margins as i mentioned we have been implementing a series of initiatives aimed at improving our backlog conversion into revenue and enhancing margins including adding surcharges improving contractual terms with our partners redesigning our products and subsystems to improve the pace of backlog conversion and reduce production costs replacing one of our contract manufacturers and streamlining the shipment process with the addition of new vendors we are also increasing our focus on software and software upgrades as well as maintenance contract sales it will of course take time until we start seeing more significant results but i am confident that all these actions will contribute to more robust financial performance lastly i d also like to share that we are close to hiring a strong candidate for our cfo role with recent experience in our industry we hope to be in a position to announce our new cfo in the next few weeks now the financials to help you understand the results i will be referring mainly to non gaap numbers for more information regarding our use of non gaap financial measures including reconciliations of these measures we refer you to today s press release let me now review the actual numbers with you revenues for the second quarter were 70 7 million up by 3 1 compared to 68 6 million in q2 last year as i mentioned earlier even though demand continues to be high we are still experiencing component shortages and supply chain disruptions which impact our ability to convert our backlog to revenue our strongest region in terms of revenues for the quarter was india with 21 7 million reflecting ongoing deliveries for our main customers and in line with the strong demand we see in this region our second strongest region in terms of revenues was north america with revenues of 15 million followed by latin america with 11 4 million europe was fourth with 10 9 million we had two above 10 customers in the second quarter gross profit for the second quarter on a non gaap basis was 21 5 million giving us a non gaap gross margin of 30 5 compared to 31 5 in q2 2021 and 27 7 in q1 2022 our improved gross margin in q2 as compared to q1 for this year was primarily due to the increased software portion and certain reduction in our shipment costs as well as other measures taken to reduce our bom costs operating expenses on a non gaap basis for the second quarter were 21 2 million in line with our expectations research and development expenses for the second quarter on a non gaap basis were 7 5million the same as in q2 2021 and up from 6 8 million q1 2022 as we projected we expect our r d expenses to remain relatively consistent for the remainder of the year sales and marketing expenses for the second quarter on a non gaap basis were 9 1 million compared to 8 3 million in q2 2021 and 8 5 million q1 2022 the year over year increase is primarily due to a boost in sales commissions intensified face to face travel expenses as well as investments in our salespeople in north america and latin america general and administrative expenses for the second quarter on a non gaap basis were 4 6 million as compared to 5 2 million in q2 2021 and 4 8 million in q1 2022 financial and other expenses for the second quarter on a non gaap basis were 2 5 million significantly higher than our expectations the forex expenses came approximately 1 million higher than our expectations this is primarily due to our cash balances and accounts receivable in local currencies related to services and sales of local equipment primarily in india apac and latin america that have eroded due to the strengthening trend of the u s dollar during this quarter going forward subject to a stabilized forex environment we expect our finance expenses to be in the range of 1 5 million to 2 million our tax expenses for the second quarter on a non gaap basis were 0 3 million net loss on a non gaap basis for the quarter was 2 5 million or 0 03 loss per diluted share as for our balance sheet our inventory at the end of q2 2022 was 60 7 million up from 58 1 million at the end of q1 2022 the level of inventory still reflects our need to stock long lead time and strategic items as a combined result of increased customer orders and the ongoing component shortages in addition our decision to replace one of our contract manufacturers with minimum disruption to deliveries also resulted in temporary inventory increase and impacted our cash flow and working capital we expect this impact to gradually decline in the coming quarters as we finish the transition period and the new contract manufacturer is fully up to speed we strive to keep our inventory levels lower and expect an inventory reduction as the components industry improves our trade receivables are at 122 7 million up from 120 7 million at the end of q1 2022 our dsos now stand at 152 days our cash flow from operations and investing activities was higher than q1 2022 and it was primarily driven by the changes we have been making to the composition of our contract manufacturers we have 23 6 million of cash and we have available unused credit facility of 18 1 million net cash used in operating and investing activities for the second quarter was 6 3 million net cash provided by financing activities for the second quarter was 5 0 million looking forward we are reaffirming our 2022 revenue guidance of 300 million to 315 million and our 2023 revenue guidance of 325 million to 345 million our guidance is of course subject to potential downsides and upsides as we continue to address supply chain challenges facing the industry our five year revenue target is approximately 500 million and we also target increasing our gross margins to at least 34 to 36 over the same period finally before turning to q a i want to take a moment regarding aviat s purported offer as you have seen we have issued several communications reviewing our record of engagement with them and our commitment to serving the best interest of all ceragon shareholders our position remains the same and we do not have more to share on aviat today with that i now open the call for your questions operator questions answers operator our first question today comes from the line of alex henderson from needham please go ahead alex henderson needham and company analyst great can you hear me doron arazi chief executive officer hey alex i can hear you very clearly alex henderson needham and company analyst great i got a couple of questions i just wanted to get some general gauge of on the first is the book to bill in the quarter and really i m more interested in the half as opposed to the quarter because it s a better gauge if you could how much were the orders up year over year and what was the book to bill relative to sales in the quarter can you give us some sense of what where your backlog on product stands doron arazi chief executive officer yeah so first of all on the first half our booking were up approximately 15 higher than the second the first half of 2021 in terms of backlog we have a very strong backlog i will give you an approximate number we are talking about over 170 million of backlog and the more important piece is that we analyze the gross margin of this backlog and it is higher than the current gross margins of 30 5 which is obviously very important and that s even before some of the initiatives and actions we are taking to improve our gross margin further alex henderson needham and company analyst well going back to that go ahead doron arazi chief executive officer just in terms of book to bill ratio it s significantly above one alex henderson needham and company analyst just going back to that question on the margin obviously you re absorbing cost components and logistics components that are abnormal can you quantify give us some gauge of the drag on revenues and opex associated with you know the supply chain challenge doron arazi chief executive officer i can give you some sort of high level magnitude i think that we are more or less i think that we are more or less 10 lower in terms of revenue achievement versus more normal condition even a bit higher than that i think we could be at the range of 80 million per quarter if not having all these challenges of the supply chain in terms of gross margin as i said more than once we re talking about 3 to 4 sometimes even 5 gap depends on the mix of the revenue by region and also the software element that is always added to our product revenue alex henderson needham and company analyst so if you re talking about the margin on the backlog being higher than the current margin would it be reasonable to think that as the component costs come back in that it s actually equivalent to somewhere in the 33 to 35 range given that doron arazi chief executive officer yeah i think it s a reasonable assumption subject to the success of all of our initiatives alex henderson needham and company analyst ok going back to the shekel for a second you guys hedged the shekel i believe coming into the new year around the january timeframe you re fully protected against the shekel through the calendar year if you were to look at the shekel where it is today which is where you will reset on you know december 31st looking out into 2023 what would be the impact of the shekel relative to your cost structure and doron arazi chief executive officer i think it would easily hedged between 0 01 to 0 02 to our eps alex henderson needham and company analyst it seems like a small number given the 15 to 20 swing in the exchange rate can you explain why that wouldn t be larger impact on your opex doron arazi chief executive officer first of all let s not forget i was talking about eps and obviously you have also the impact of the financial expenses that are actually also being hedged in our balance sheet so all in all i think 0 01 to 0 02 on our eps is reasonable yes it could be higher alex henderson needham and company analyst just going back to the point though aren t your financial balance sheet exposure constructed in a period that would be paid out before year end given the dso timeline i would think that you would be paid out by year end therefore that shouldn t impact 2023 right doron arazi chief executive officer yes that s correct but you know i m looking at q3 sorry q2 numbers and we actually had an opportunity to enjoy the weakening shekel against the u s dollar but the fact that we are also hedging our balance sheet has actually negatively impacted our numbers all in all the hedge on our expenses primarily salary and other fixed expenses in shekel is indeed hedged for a full year and the balance sheet is basically hedged on between monthly to quarterly basis alex henderson needham and company analyst but again that s a headwind to 2022 it falls out in 2023 because you pay out all of those you get paid that stuff before year end therefore assuming your future at the current level that shouldn t be a factor right i mean doron arazi chief executive officer correct correct alex henderson needham and company analyst it sounds like that should be a positive year eps in 2023 not a negative can you deferring the doron arazi chief executive officer correct 2023 alex henderson needham and company analyst hold on hold on hold on just ignore the financial services side of it ignore the balance sheet what is the impact on just the opex if we use this exchange rate versus what you re experiencing in 22 in 23 how big a positive is it because it s a should be a pretty material positive to your expenses right doron arazi chief executive officer yes if you re talking only on the operating numbers indeed it s going to be a couple of millions for the whole year alex henderson needham and company analyst great that s what i was looking for thank you very much doron arazi chief executive officer yeah alex henderson needham and company analyst i ll cede the floor doron arazi chief executive officer thank you alex operator thank you our next question comes from the line of george iwanyc from oppenheimer please go ahead doron arazi chief executive officer hi george george iwanyc oppenheimer and company analyst thank you for taking my questions doron when you look at your 2023 and your five year targets can you give us a sense of how you know that s made up like how much of that is coming from existing business how much is coming from market share gains and how much is coming from your new initiatives doron arazi chief executive officer so in terms of a five year horizon in terms of our core business we expect a growth of a mid single digit percentage which is slightly above the expectations of the industry growth and on top of that we expect a very significant growth in managed services and in the cell site router domain that will bring us to a cagr of approximately 10 or a little shy of 10 george iwanyc oppenheimer and company analyst ok when you look at the competitive environment can you give us a sense of like the momentum you re seeing in north america what s driving that how do you feel about competition on a global basis doron arazi chief executive officer so let s start with north america we are very very satisfied with our performance in north america and not only by the recent orders we ve been receiving from one of the three tier 1 operators in this region we are actually making additional steps in gaining more business from other operators with our unique solutions that can also fit into the concept of open run and therefore we believe that this trajectory of taking very nice business in the tier 1 operators in north america will continue we are also taking market share in tier 2 and tier 3 part of it is on account of existing competitors and actually beyond the growth that is reflected in this market due to the 5g rollout when looking at the worldwide i think that we see a very similar trajectory but i would say that it is a bit still behind in terms of turning into orders just to give you an example with our ip 50fx this virtual indoor unit we re getting a lot of traction in europe but also in other regions such as apac it doesn t turn into solid orders yet but we are in a very advanced phases where we are showing different architectures and concepts of deployment that can save for the big operators a lot of money and improve their tco dramatically obviously in india the spectrum bid was just finished and we are in multiple discussions with all of our existing customers of starting to provide with e band solutions in accordance with their need so all in all we see a very strong traction to our products obviously the competition is there it s not that it is evaporated but i think once again our superior technology and the mindset of serving the customer s needs is giving us many opportunities sometimes ahead of the competition george iwanyc oppenheimer and company analyst right and doron how do you feel about pricing are you able to pass through any of the costs from either a one time basis on the shipping side or you know having constructive discussions on the overall supply chain challenges you re having with your customers doron arazi chief executive officer so it eventually it s a combination first of all we issued a letter of surcharge toward the end of q2 to all of our customers and obviously as good partners we are in dialogue with them so far the initial signs are very positive customers are receptive to the situation understand that this is a strategic partnership that should last long and the fact that they are very satisfied with our products and with our innovation gives us some sort of a benefit to discuss this situation calmly in addition obviously in new rfps as well as in specific deals we are discussing higher prices based on the current macro environment especially looking into the increase in the shipping costs and obviously the component price increase that increased our bom so all in all it s not an easy process our customers are usually very very big and their buying power is by far stronger than our selling power but i think that due to our success in demonstrating time and again that our products are in most cases better with higher technology and higher capabilities is giving us some sort of a tailwind to discuss this situation calmly with the customers that tend to understand and to accommodate at least part of our requests george iwanyc oppenheimer and company analyst ok and my last question just on the opex side do you feel you ve made all the hiring that you have to on the sales side and you re at a headcount level that you re comfortable with right now or do you need to add any more people in any areas doron arazi chief executive officer at this point based on our plans for 2022 i think we re in good shape i would just mention in north america once again seeing the huge demand and trying to basically capitalize on it we have even slightly increased our salesforce there beyond our budget plan because we see the very strong demand and a very positive trend in this north america region george iwanyc oppenheimer and company analyst thank you doron arazi chief executive officer thanks operator thank you our next question comes from the line of alex henderson from needham please go ahead alex henderson needham and company analyst great thanks i actually have two different tangents of questions i wanted to ask about the first one is as you ve been talking to your customers given the macro conditions have you seen any hesitancy have you seen any pullback have you seen any change in the number of signatures needed for closing deals have you seen any stretching of duration any impact on the macro front that s showing up in your pipeline doron arazi chief executive officer the short answer is no not at this time obviously we are watching this thing very carefully because obviously things might change it looks to me that the digitization and the 5g rollout especially in those places and customers that decided to start moving forward is continuing and at this point it s even beyond so to speak the initial recession signals we have seen in many parts of the world but we are very cautious and watching that carefully george iwanyc oppenheimer and company analyst the second one is really on the aviat situation obviously it s fluid obviously there s been a lot of tit tat on the pr side of the equation how should we characterize the ongoing negotiations and discussions with them is it just in the public press or are you actually still having a back channel conversation with them is it something that is predicated only on getting the sale the shareholder vote done on the board seats at this point or is there more ongoing conversation that we should be anticipating that is showing some progress and how would you describe their willingness to contemplate that 3 25 plus kind of a category on price that they had put out earlier obviously if they were comfortable with 3 25 in november one would think they would be even more so given how strong your backlog is built doron arazi chief executive officer alex first of all that was a very long question and i m trying to adopt the very good you know culture and dna of the americans not to interrupt it but i do need to apologize as i mentioned in my proposal prepared remarks we are here to discuss our business and earning results and we ask that you keep your questions focused on these topics we will not be commenting further on aviat at this time i apologize alex alex henderson needham and company analyst that s fine thanks for listening thanks operator you have no further questions please proceed doron arazi chief executive officer thank you in closing i d like to reiterate that we are effectively executing our growth strategy the initiatives we have taken and the tough decisions we have been making to improve our financial performance have begun to bear positive signs we will continue to implement measures aiming to mitigate the impact of the ongoing supply chain disruptions and component shortages like with any large well established company this was not the first storm we have faced and i doubt that it will be the last with strong market and technology drivers skillful people and a robust growth strategy we remain confident about our short and long term business potential i look forward to updating you further on our next call have a good day everyone duration 0 minutes call participants maya lustig investor relations doron

a fresh price target cut slams the canadian pot company s shares what happened another day another price target cut for struggling canadian cannabis company tilray brands tlry 2 20 in the wake of quarterly results reported by the company late last week one more analyst reduced his expectations for its prospects as a result the frequently battered stock took another hit on monday falling by more than 6 across the day so what monday s tilray downgrader was stifel prognosticator andrew carter who took an axe to his price target by slicing it down to 3 30 per share from his previous 5 50 nevertheless he obviously has at least a bit of hope in the company as he s maintaining his hold recommendation on the stock this should sound very familiar to tilray shareholders their company has been hit by a series of similar cuts and even recommendation downgrades in recent days on friday benchmark s mike hickey change his outlook on the stock from hold to sell due to understandable concerns about the tough canadian weed market and the still dim prospects for pot legalization in countries outside north america now what these and other analyst adjustments came in the wake of tilray s fiscal fourth quarter earnings report which for a canadian marijuana company wasn t actually all that bad the company posted double digit growth in revenue on a year over year basis and stripping out a noncash impairment charge basically an accounting adjustment reveals a bottom line loss that isn t as deep as it appears at first glance but all of this is relative and tilray remains a struggling company in a challenging market investors might do well to heed the latest moves by analysts on their coverage of the stock
the fed s solution to record inflation is based on flawed logic and us government policy is only compounding supply issues the us economy shrank by an estimated 0 9 percent in the second quarter of this year the second quarter in a row that saw a contraction which is according to the oxford english dictionary the definition of a recession in response to these worrying figures the white house has sought to downplay fears by calling the decline no surprise as the economy slows down in response to federal reserve interest rate hikes but make no mistake the economic situation in the us is indeed worrying that s because even if the recession in the country is artificially induced by the fed it is still a recession and not only does that pose very real risks but the solution sought by the fed also looks incomplete and obsolete at best first we need to understand why the fed is raising interest rates put simply this is done to tame inflation which is at its highest since 1981 primarily driven by rising fuel and food prices according to the fed s line inflation is being spurred by out of control consumer spending in what they see as a red hot economy thus raising interest rates and in doing so making loans more expensive for both businesses and consumers the fed believes should help cool down the economy keep down spending and rein in inflation but this line is evidently flawed it is believed that increased spending on the back of rising wages and pent up demand from the ongoing covid 19 pandemic that was compounded by government stimulus is driving inflation in real terms however neither of these things are true wages have actually gone down in real terms and demand seems to be just re attuning to pre pandemic levels with many sectors never recovering from pandemic induced demand shortages on the contrary corporations taking advantage of the ongoing crises to hike prices seems to be a major factor and one that even the white house can acknowledge that is lack of competition is one of the primary drivers of inflation this is quite evident in the energy sector with companies like bp exxon chevron and shell posting record profits on the back of surging fuel prices and unregulated stock buybacks that means this is a supply side issue rather than a demand side issue which is what current monetary policy is trying to address another issue on the supply side is the fact that the covid 19 pandemic is not over resurging cases driven by the ba 4 and ba 5 omicron subvariants can and are knocking out significant portions of the workforce at any time these successive waves are major constraints on supply chains it s also important to point out that climate change is another supply constraint each and every industry on the planet is affected by the changing climate and last year saw weather events that disrupted key industries such as lumber semiconductors and basic food items these issues have of course persisted because the deleterious effects of climate change are getting worse at the same time government response to climate change has not been enough to alleviate the problems without offering sufficient alternatives lack of investment in new oil and gas projects only drives energy prices up leading to record profits for fossil fuel giants so rather than congress passing legislation or formulating some plan to end the pandemic address climate change or break up monopolies the fed is stepping in to address what it sees as insane consumer spending but it s not actually consumers frivolously spending more money it s just people spending more money for the same things because our supply chains are being disrupted by a mixture of disease extreme weather and corporate greed what s even more worrying about the current economic outlook is that there is no comparable historical scenario to look to for guidance in the late 1970s and through the 1980s when the world was wrestling with a similar mixture of recession and inflation dubbed stagflation globalization that is the integration of the world economy helped create economic growth and open up new markets for american multinationals perhaps nothing was more consequential in this period than normalized trade relations between the us and china as well as china s reforming and opening up policies that began under deng xiaoping but now the ongoing tensions and trade war between china and the us with us led efforts to decouple western economies from china are orienting the global economy in a de growth direction that is attempts to de globalize which i would argue are being tested right now as the western world attempts to cut russia off from the global economy will create a reverse of the successful globalization period it will only compound the economic hurdles faced by the american and western supply chains despite cheery statements from the white house the us economy is very much in a recession and the tools the fed is using to solve its compounding economic stagnation and runaway inflation are not sufficient if anything us government policy at every level is going to make things worse rt com

washington reuters u s senate democrats on monday were awaiting a ruling from the a chamber referee this week on whether they can override the legislature s normal rules to pass a 430 billion drugs energy and tax bill despite republican objections the decision by the referee officially known as the parliamentarian will have a profound impact on president joe biden s domestic agenda heading into the nov 8 midterm elections when republicans are favored to win back control of the house of representatives and perhaps the senate amid voter discontent over inflation senate majority leader chuck schumer on monday confirmed that he planned to begin debate this week under the reconciliation procedure democrats are hoping to use to pass the bill only a simple majority of votes in the 100 member chamber would be needed to steer the bill towards passage instead of the 60 needed for most legislation with the senate split 50 50 among democrats and republicans the process would allow for passage as democratic vice president kamala harris could break any tie vote and secure a victory for biden the bill being reviewed by the senate parliamentarian was crafted by democratic senator joe manchin who has often stood in the way of key biden priorities and with the blessing of senate majority leader chuck schumer still unknown however is whether democratic senator krysten sinema like manchin a maverick in the caucus will lend her support a sinema spokesperson said she was still reviewing the bill and would also wait to see which provisions if any the parliamentarian allows to stay in the bill without sinema s vote the entire effort could be doomed as no republicans were expected to vote yes on what democrats are calling the inflation reduction act of 2022 it would provide new federal funding for a significant reduction in u s carbon dioxide emissions that contribute to climate change and allow medicare the federal health insurance program for the elderly and disabled to negotiate lower pharmaceutical prices tax increases aimed at the wealthy would partially offset the costs with lower drug prices also saving the government money the bill s backers say but republicans have been attacking the measure arguing it will violate a biden pledge to not raise taxes on those earning less than 400 000 annually senator mike crapo top republican on the senate finance committee criticized the bill as he released an analysis he requested from the joint committee on taxation jct a nonpartisan congressional panel the jct report said the bill s tax provisions would indirectly raise the effective tax burden on americans with incomes of 200 000 or less by 16 7 billion in 2023 the tax burden effect in the jct analysis is due to small estimated reductions of incomes from potential wage cuts that could result from companies higher tax bills or lower stock values said kimberly clausing a tax law professor at the university of california los angeles and a former u s treasury tax official the legislation would raise the tax burden by another 14 1 billion on taxpayers with annual incomes of between 200 000 and 500 000 according to the jct analysis democrats on the finance committee which oversees tax policy say the analysis is incomplete a family making less than 400 000 will not pay one penny in additional taxes ashley schapitl spokeswoman for the senate finance committee democrats said in a statement it doesn t include the benefits to middle class families of making health insurance premiums and prescription drugs more affordable the same goes for clean energy incentives for families reporting by richard cowan david morgan and david lawder editing by scott malone and aurora ellis

glen arbor mich concealed behind trees near lake michigan two scientists remotely manipulated a robotic owl on the forest floor as the intruder flapped its wings and hooted a merlin guarding its nest in a nearby pine darted overhead sounding high pitched rapid fire distress calls the small falcon dove toward the enemy and into a net that smithsonian interns tim baerwald and zachary bordner had stretched between steel poles they gently disentangled the brownish speckled merlin then attached a leg band and a backpack transmission unit so researchers could trace the mother bird s movements as long as it s fitted correctly she ll have a long and happy life baerwald said before bordner released the merlin which zipped back to its nesting tree the mission will enhance knowledge of a species still recovering from a significant drop off caused by pesticides including ddt banned in 1972 after harming many birds of prey it also is helping sleeping bear dunes national lakeshore managers protect the piping plover an endangered shorebird that merlins kill and eat merlins are a big threat to their recovery said nathan cooper a research ecologist with smithsonian s national zoo and conservation biology institute the situation is ironic a troubled species rebounds thanks to restoration efforts only to make things worse for others in peril by preying on them or outcompeting them for food and living space similar circumstances have turned up elsewhere challenging wildlife experts who want them all to thrive in balanced healthy environments advertisement for instance the iconic bald eagle s comeback has pressured rare water birds resurgent peregrine falcons menace endangered california least terns and western snowy plovers that take refuge at naval bases near san diego and off the california coast attacks from protected white sharks hinder recovery of threatened sea otters gray seals previously on the brink of extirpation in waters of new england now occupy some massachusetts beaches by the hundreds the 800 pound mammal s return has raised worries about vulnerable fish stocks such unintended consequences don t necessarily reveal flaws in the u s endangered species act or conservation programs experts say rather they illustrate nature s complexity and the importance of protecting biological communities not just individual species clearly there are occasions when we get these conflicts between species that we re trying to protect said stuart pimm a duke university extinction specialist but is it a major worry in conservation no species recoveries can produce tradeoffs since some animals are more adaptable than others to changes in the climate or landscape said bruce stein chief scientist with the national wildlife federation a lot of ecosystems where these things are occurring are a little out of whack to begin with because we ve altered them in some way stein said with climate change there are going to be winners and losers the losers will tend to have specific habitat requirements narrow ecological niches and often will be the ones already declining advertisement the great lakes region has an estimated 65 to 70 pairs of sandy backed ring necked piping plovers which skitter along beaches nibbling tiny marine animals and eggs they re among three remaining north american populations their decline caused primarily by habitat loss and predation meanwhile merlin numbers in the region have jumped in the past 10 to 15 years they re suspected of killing at least 57 adult plovers cooper said while officials have shot some merlins they re looking for non lethal controls data from the transmitter backpacks might help determine whether capturing and relocating them is worth trying said vince cavalieri a biologist with the national lakeshore eagles threaten rare birds recovery of america s national bird the bald eagle is a triumph but in one area of coastal maine the big raptor poses a problem for the only u s breeding population of great cormorants when they re disturbed by eagles the adult cormorants will flush and leave their nests said don lyons a conservation scientist at the national audubon society s seabird institute advertisement then gulls ravens and crows swoop in to gobble cormorant eggs and chicks if this happens repeatedly an entire colony can fail lyons said his team organizes volunteers to camp near cormorant gatherings to scare away eagles in southern california least terns and snowy plovers are no match for attacking peregrine falcons which like eagles bounced back after the ban on ddt such pesticides are passed up food chains and cause large birds to produce eggs with thin shells which females crush when trying to incubate them the san diego zoo and wildlife alliance tries to protect the endangered birds by hiring a falconer to capture problem peregrines keeping them in a holding facility over winter or releasing them in northern california some find a new territory while others go back said nacho vilchis a conservation ecologist if there s a real problem bird that keeps returning we may ask for permission for lethal removal but that s only rarely done vilchis said hunting and bounties devastated new england s gray seals saved by the marine mammal protection act of 1972 the population has rebounded to tens of thousands advertisement fishing groups contend the seals could threaten cod stocks that regulators are struggling to rebuild after decades of overfishing the coastal ecosystem alliance based in fairhaven massachusetts wants to weaken the protection act to allow hunting and slow the seals population growth said board member peter krogh gray seals are certainly this case where recovery has both been cause for celebration and cause for concern said kristina cammen a university of maine marine mammal scientist who says they re less of a hazard to fish populations than humans are seals cormorants bedevil fishers like the clash over seals and cod there are other cases where reviving species may be more a nuisance to people than a threat to other wildlife fish farmers in the south and anglers in the great lakes region and pacific northwest have long complained about the double crested cormorant a dark feathered diving bird that gorges on catfish perch salmon and other prized species advertisement cormorants have done so well since the ddt ban that agencies have tried limiting them in some locations with egg oiling nest destruction and even shooting drawing lawsuits from environmentalists who say the birds are a scapegoat for human actions that harm fish they re a part of our avian community and our ecosystems and there needs to be a place for them said dave fielder a fisheries research biologist with the michigan department of natural resources but when their numbers are so high that they potentially decimate the recreational fishery that s a problem wild turkeys were spread across north america before european settlement but had dwindled to tens of thousands by the 1930s disappearing from many states now they re hunted in 49 states and are so common in new england that they often cause traffic tie ups some hunters say hungry turkeys are outcompeting ruffed grouse which are decreasing in parts of their range such as the upper midwest but scientists point to habitat loss and climate change the national wild turkey federation is helping move turkeys from states with plenty such as north carolina maine and west virginia to texas and others that could use more said mark hatfield national director of conservation services if you introduce hunting localized wild turkeys you reduce the problem with overabundant turkeys right away hatfield said advertisement nature at work conflicts between recovering species and ones still in trouble don t always mean something is wrong scientists say it could reflect a return to how things were before humans got in the way when a population gets back to where it s having the same interactions with other organisms as before it went down that s nature at work said john fitzpatrick emeritus director of cornell university s laboratory of ornithology the bald eagle is challenging our preconceived notions about what s normal for prey such as great cormorants in new england and common murres on the west coast which might have been less abundant before eagles declined said lyons of the audubon society the eagle s recovery complicates the conservation of certain other species lyons said but their recovery is such a wonderful outcome that s a welcome complication predator prey relationships are complex and intervening can be tricky said stein of the wildlife federation it s often wiser he said to focus on protecting habitat and reconnecting fragmented landscapes to promote natural migration than moving things around willy nilly but environmental scientist ian warkentin a merlin specialist said there can be ways to help struggling species without being heavy handed larger falcons such as peregrines sometimes used to chase birds from airports might be deployed to shoo merlins from plover nesting areas i fall on the side of the fence that says we should do whatever we can to aid the recovery of species for which we ve caused such grief said warkentin from memorial university of newfoundland s grenfell campus send questions comments to the

s is home to thousands of advisors that can meet your specific needs based on the methodology outlined below smartasset identified these financial advisor firms as among the top 5 financial advisor firms in the u s rank financial advisor assets managed 1 714 587 898 072 2 173 418 270 044 3 46 803 858 104 4 94 617 046 882 5 19 851 537 239 methodology to find the top financial advisors in the u s we first identified all firms registered with the sec in the country next we filtered out firms that don t offer financial planning services those that don t primarily serve individual clients and those that have disclosures on their record the qualifying firms were then ranked according to the following criteria aum firms with more total assets under management are ranked higher firms with more total assets under management are ranked higher individual client count firms that serve more individual clients as opposed to institutional clients are ranked higher firms that serve more individual clients as opposed to institutional clients are ranked higher clients per advisor firms with a lower ratio of clients per financial advisor are ranked higher firms with a lower ratio of clients per financial advisor are ranked higher years in business firms that have been in business longer are ranked higher firms that have been in business longer are ranked higher fee structure firms with a fee only as opposed to fee based compensation structure are ranked higher these stats are updated annually and accurate as of may 25 2023 this list may include firms that have a business relationship with smartasset in which smartasset is compensated for lead referrals such relationships have no impact on our rankings and firms are included and ranked based strictly on the above criteria smartasset is not a client of the aforementioned firms smartasset did not receive compensation for including any of the firms on the aforementioned list why work with an advisor we believe it s more important now than ever to review your retirement plan with a fiduciary financial advisor here s why the pandemic has shown us just how quickly decades of planning investing and saving can be completely upended this could mean your current financial plan might leave you without enough money to last your retirement additionally emotionally charged decisions to sell off large quantities of stocks or other investments now lock in your losses removing any chance for future growth research suggests people who work with a financial advisor feel more at ease about their finances and could end up with about 15 more money to spend in retirement 1 consider this example a recent vanguard study found that on average a hypothetical 500k investment would grow to over 3 4 million under the care of an advisor over 25 years whereas the expected value from self management would be 1 69 million or 50 less in other words an advisor managed portfolio would average 8 annualized growth over a 25 year period compared to 5 from a self managed portfolio 2 a 2020 northwestern mutual study found that 71 of u s adults admit their financial planning needs improvement however only 29 of americans work with a financial advisor 3 assuming 5 annualized growth of 500k portfolio vs 8 annualized growth of advisor managed portfolio over 25 years the hypothetical study discussed above assumes a 5 net return and a 3 net annual value add for professional financial advice to performance based on the vanguard whitepaper putting a value on your value quantifying vanguard advisor s alpha please

a house that is under construction by hubble homes in a new subdivision called franklin village in nampa idaho is pictured on may 19 2021 cities like boise idaho and riverside california where home prices soared the highest during the pandemic are most likely to see the effects of a housing downturn amplified and home prices decline if the u s economy hits a recession redfin says cities where home prices soared the highest during the pandemic housing rush are most likely to see the effects of a housing downturn amplified and home prices decline if the u s economy hits a recession that s according to a new report from redfin which scrutinized the areas that are most susceptible to a housing downturn if a recession hits a scenario that some economists believe looks likely amid stubborn inflation and stock market troubles at the top of redfin s list are what the real estate site called popular migration destinations or housing hot spots where many americans set free by remote work relocated the no 1 city most at risk redfin reported is riverside california with an overall risk score of 84 riverside has the highest chance of seeing its housing market cool further if the u s enters a recession more so than any other major u s metro included in redfin s analysis riverside which spans from the eastern suburbs of los angeles like san bernardino and ontario through the palm springs area has highly volatile home prices and it was a hot destination during the pandemic both for people permanently relocating and those buying second homes redfin reported to those paying attention to housing markets in the west a familiar city has been flagged again as a risky area boise idaho boise which exploded during the covid 19 pandemic as americans realized the metro had tempting housing opportunities at relatively lower price points compared to other states is also cooling rapidly it has a risk score of 76 9 here s how the top 10 cities ranked riverside california risk score of 84 boise idaho 76 9 cape coral florida 76 7 north port florida 75 las vegas 74 2 sacramento california 73 1 bakersfield california 72 2 phoenix 72 tampa florida 70 7 tucson arizona 70 1 to determine which areas made the list redfin analyzed 98 major housing markets in the u s the ranking combines 10 indicators to come up with an overall risk score with the highest possible score being 100 and the lowest 0 the indicators redfin considered are home price volatility average debt to income ratio average home loan to value ratio labor market shock percent of homes flipped how much the housing market is cooling compared with other metros year over year change in domestic migration share of homes in the metro that are second homes year over year price growth and elasticity of supply where does utah rank the salt lake city utah metro area did rank in redfin s list in the no 21 slot with a risk score of 57 7 that s a more optimistic ranking than boise but still high compared to other metro areas and that s even though utah ranked no 1 and idaho no 5 in a recent cnbc report on the most stable housing markets in the u s so what gives redfin s report contemplates if the national economic tide turns and if the u s actually enters a recession but this doesn t necessarily mean these markets would see dramatic price declines like those seen after the 2006 housing bubble popped and banks risky lending practices caught up to them sending the global economy into crisis as the u s economy cools we re already seeing home sellers slash their listing prices to adjust to a market that s now shifting to be at least a little more buyer controlled as mortgage rates have risen from their low rates of around 3 during the pandemic buyers have adjusted what they re actually willing to pay for a home and motivated sellers are responding while home prices in places like boise and yes salt lake city have fluctuated to record levels prices are starting to level off and even slightly dip as the market cools in utah however local housing experts say the state s market is more stable and not likely to see dramatic price declines because utah with its rapid population growth and strong job market has a history of a healthy economy in relation to the rest of the nation plus utah has faced a crushing housing shortage for years now which was driving home prices higher even before the pandemic rush accelerated the market housing experts here expect home price growth to decelerate and stabilize but not drop dramatically slight price drops however could be a possibility if the wasatch front continues to see falling sales for at least 18 consecutive months june marked the 13th consecutive month and july is likely on track to be the 14th

august begins a transitionary time for striped bass along the massachusetts coast where the early part of the summer is focused around finding bass on larger bait menhaden mackerel squid herring august ushers in the age of the peanut bunker note on the water is reader supported when you buy through links on our site we may earn an affiliate commission the good news is that if you find stripers on said bait they ll be eating in august only a small percentage of the young of year peanut bunker will have left their nurseries for the open ocean this creates a striper to bait ratio that is in the angler s favor as the late summer and fall progresses small bait will become much more abundant sometimes creating a challenging bite for the angler throwing lures to bass as a boat angler bites can be feast or famine much of your success in august will ride on finding bait concentrations this is where a good pair of binoculars can be a trip saver if you find the birds you ll find the bait and subsequently the bass or blues or bonito in august especially by the middle of the month i throw my list of honey holes out of the window striper fishing in august along the new england coast especially in cape cod bay and areas north can often resemble albie fishing the run and gun technique most often associated with seeking out tunoids will prove to be an invaluable technique for hooking up on fast moving schools of stripers as a result this list of top august lures focuses on offerings that cast well and cover the entirety of the water column the unweighted albie snax softbait is the do it all lure in the arsenal it s so prevalent in my day to day fishing that i have three entire tackle trays on the boat dedicated to these lures where you ll struggle to cast other unweighted soft plastic baits the heavier material used in their heavy duty hooks allows you to cast it almost as far as soft plastics on jigheads the key to getting a good cast with the albie snax is your rod and line setup a medium or medium light rod with a fast action 20 pound braid and 15 pound fluorocarbon leader will turn the albie snax into a missile in the hands of a competent caster the effectiveness of this lure is simple its slow sink rate and wiggle makes it an extremely effective and natural imitator of a dead or wounded baitfish as a result casting into the middle of the feed and letting it sink with the occasional rod twitch will often draw strikes from the larger bass waiting underneath if i don t have a strike on the drop i ll begin a slow retrieve with occasional pauses the albie snax is an incredibly versatile lure you can even fish it topwater in the same way you would fish a spook plug bone amber or bubblegum all find their places on rods on the boat we rig our albie snax with vmc swimbait hooks on the twistlock screw there is just something about the rebel jumpin minnow that drives bass crazy while it s typically seen as a schoolie killer big bass will hit a properly walked jumpin minnow with reckless abandon last august we were throwing jumpin minnows into a shallow rocky cove where the bass had pinned a school of peanut bunker we were picking away at low slot fish when suddenly we saw a big boil and heard the scream of a drag the bass measured 42 inches and had bent out the front inline hook thankfully the back hook held true the jumpin minnow works best on a straight walk the dog style retrieve keep it moving with quick short rod twitches you may have to play around with hook types and sizes if you re changing out the stock hooks if you find that it s going sub surface on the retrieve remove one of the hooks or change out to a smaller set of hooks the jumpin minnow does its best work when it s riding high i prefer the bone color and the stripers do too the bill hurley sand eel is another incredibly versatile lure but it especially shines when bass are holding deep either eating sand eels or resting before their next feeding in these scenarios depending on depth i ll either drop the jig straight down or cast it off the back of the boat vertical jigging only seems to work when bass are holding more than 40 feet down in the water column most often bass will hit the jig on the drop sometimes a slow rod lift will be needed to get them to commit the more traditional fast jig seems to work best when they re actively feeding on sand eels this technique involves rapid raises and twitches of the rod tip while slowly reeling in slack line if you can t get your hands on a bill hurley the next best thing is a joebaggs sand eel an original ronz or tsunami holographic sand eel the hydro dynamic head shape of this lure allows it to sink and get into the feeding zone quickly this means you can use a lighter jig head compared to other similar lures casting the hurley sand eel into a feed and using a straight retrieve can also be deadly the thin rat tail soft bait portion has a subtle built in action without having to twitch the rod while most attribute the guppy pencil poppers to canal fishing they can be extremely effective fished from the boat as well long casting is just as important from the boat as it is on the canal if you re chasing fast moving schools of stripers and bluefish under birds this is especially true when the schools get spooky under grease calm conditions and high sun with the right rod setup you can cast these plugs into the next county the key to getting bit when stripers are on inch long baitfish is either matching the bait exactly or going in the complete opposite direction and a loud thrashing pencil popper is an excellent way of going in the opposite direction i like to work the guppy jobo jr with fast rod twitches and occasional pauses an exceptional casting lure with a subtle swimbait action the 1 ounce pro tail will often catch when other lures won t get a sniff its natural swimming action also makes it an ideal search bait when you find a school of peanut bunker the pro tail s extremely small body in combination with its heavy weight make it a true winner when compared to other lighter swimbaits where other soft plastic swimbaits and shads have a built in exaggerated roll and heavy tail vibration the hogy protail swims well exactly like a peanut bunker a straight retrieve through a school of feeding fish will be your best bet in getting stripers to eat but when they get finicky allowing the lure to drop and using big exaggerated rod lifts and reeling in the slack is a deadly technique the last technique to try is to burn it across the surface and then letting it sink for 5 seconds repeat until a striper eats it related content article the loop fly a peanut bunker pattern article surf fishing with casting eggs article how to catch striped bass

the fed s solution to record inflation is based on flawed logic and us government policy is only compounding supply issues the us economy shrank by an estimated 0 9 percent in the second quarter of this year the second quarter in a row that saw a contraction which is according to the oxford english dictionary the definition of a recession in response to these worrying figures the white house has sought to downplay fears by calling the decline no surprise as the economy slows down in response to federal reserve interest rate hikes but make no mistake the economic situation in the us is indeed worrying that s because even if the recession in the country is artificially induced by the fed it is still a recession and not only does that pose very real risks but the solution sought by the fed also looks incomplete and obsolete at best first we need to understand why the fed is raising interest rates put simply this is done to tame inflation which is at its highest since 1981 primarily driven by rising fuel and food prices according to the fed s line inflation is being spurred by out of control consumer spending in what they see as a red hot economy thus raising interest rates and in doing so making loans more expensive for both businesses and consumers the fed believes should help cool down the economy keep down spending and rein in inflation but this line is evidently flawed it is believed that increased spending on the back of rising wages and pent up demand from the ongoing covid 19 pandemic that was compounded by government stimulus is driving inflation in real terms however neither of these things are true wages have actually gone down in real terms and demand seems to be just re attuning to pre pandemic levels with many sectors never recovering from pandemic induced demand shortages on the contrary corporations taking advantage of the ongoing crises to hike prices seems to be a major factor and one that even the white house can acknowledge that is lack of competition is one of the primary drivers of inflation this is quite evident in the energy sector with companies like bp exxon chevron and shell posting record profits on the back of surging fuel prices and unregulated stock buybacks that means this is a supply side issue rather than a demand side issue which is what current monetary policy is trying to address another issue on the supply side is the fact that the covid 19 pandemic is not over resurging cases driven by the ba 4 and ba 5 omicron subvariants can and are knocking out significant portions of the workforce at any time these successive waves are major constraints on supply chains it s also important to point out that climate change is another supply constraint each and every industry on the planet is affected by the changing climate and last year saw weather events that disrupted key industries such as lumber semiconductors and basic food items these issues have of course persisted because the deleterious effects of climate change are getting worse at the same time government response to climate change has not been enough to alleviate the problems without offering sufficient alternatives lack of investment in new oil and gas projects only drives energy prices up leading to record profits for fossil fuel giants so rather than congress passing legislation or formulating some plan to end the pandemic address climate change or break up monopolies the fed is stepping in to address what it sees as insane consumer spending but it s not actually consumers frivolously spending more money it s just people spending more money for the same things because our supply chains are being disrupted by a mixture of disease extreme weather and corporate greed what s even more worrying about the current economic outlook is that there is no comparable historical scenario to look to for guidance in the late 1970s and through the 1980s when the world was wrestling with a similar mixture of recession and inflation dubbed stagflation globalization that is the integration of the world economy helped create economic growth and open up new markets for american multinationals perhaps nothing was more consequential in this period than normalized trade relations between the us and china as well as china s reforming and opening up policies that began under deng xiaoping but now the ongoing tensions and trade war between china and the us with us led efforts to decouple western economies from china are orienting the global economy in a de growth direction that is attempts to de globalize which i would argue are being tested right now as the western world attempts to cut russia off from the global economy will create a reverse of the successful globalization period it will only compound the economic hurdles faced by the american and western supply chains despite cheery statements from the white house the us economy is very much in a recession and the tools the fed is using to solve its compounding economic stagnation and runaway inflation are not sufficient if anything us government policy at every level is going to make things worse rt com
south korea s defense minister lee jong sup said in remarks to lawmakers on monday that pop superstars bts should come to the military for their mandatory service and in turn the military should allow them to hold concerts abroad and otherwise maintain their careers while serving bts is south korea s most popular musical act and one of the most beloved and lucrative groups in the world holding multiple world records and topping international pop charts bts band members are especially popular in america where they became the first korean act to debut at the top of the billboard 200 charts and the first to be nominated for a grammy award their international profile has greatly benefitted the south korean economy and boosted the country s international profile one of the world s most successful examples of soft power or the use by a country of cultural influence or other non government means to generate clout bts s ongoing success has long been in jeopardy under the looming need for its seven members to fulfill their military obligations as south korean men the nation technically at war with communist north korea since 1950 though the two sides ended active hostilities in 1953 mandates that all able bodied men serve two years in the country s military most must meet the obligation between the ages of 18 and 28 seoul granted bts a deferment to age 30 the oldest member of the group jin will turn 30 this year triggering the military service requirement defense minister lee jong sup did not appear to consider the possibility of lowering the two year service requirement or exempting bts from serving in the military during his remarks to the national assembly on monday he did however argue that having the artists serve could be a tremendous publicity boon to the armed forces and that given the tangible benefits that bts s success has brought to the country the military should find ways to ensure that the band can continue to perform they should come to the military and i believe there will be a way for us to give them the opportunity to practice as well as allow them to leave the country and perform anytime if they have overseas concerts scheduled lee said according to the korea herald many people do think highly of military service itself and i think bts members enlisting can actually help them with their popularity he reportedly added the national assembly s national defense committee was addressing the ongoing debate over offering men particularly popular artists who fit exceptional criteria a form of alternative service to the military mandate lee suggested allowing bts members to perform abroad while serving as soldiers as a potential compromise we are reviewing the matter within the overall framework of alternative service he was quoted as saying the issue of alternative service appears to be a separate debate from one that began in the legislature last month about the possibility of limiting the amount of time served to three weeks rather than two years in the military yoon sang hyun the lawmaker proposing shortening the amount of service time told reuters last month that bts had done a job that would take more than 1 000 diplomats to do and thus deserved the government to acknowledge that their artistry was a form of service to the nation a gallup opinion study in april showed nearly 60 percent of south koreans supported the bill exempting internationally successful k pop stars from full military service thirty three percent of south koreans opposed the bill voice of america noted in july the administration of conservative president yoon suk yeol won this year s election in a contentious campaign in which mandatory military service became an issue his opponent leftist democratic party candidate lee jae myung said last year that he was hesitant to consider granting the group an exemption to the service even while acknowledging that their success was beneficial to south korea as a whole mandatory military service is a public duty set by the constitution and we must be prudent about granting exceptions we can t deny bts contribution to the nation but we must be careful because it will be hard to draw the line if we expand the scope of exceptions like this lee said during a forum in december in perspective of fairness i think it is more desirable to allow military service deferment for bts and exemptions should be refrained from as much as possible the military service requirement has doomed popular korean boy bands for decades though none had experienced the level of success internationally that bts currently has among the bands to have come closest to doing so however is the bts predecessor big bang which at its peak was the first korean pop k pop band listed on the forbes celebrity 100 list and sold over 140 million albums worldwide the band began to unravel as its members began reporting for military duty in 2017 member t o p reportedly suffered a drug overdose and was demoted to a public service office for another drug scandal member seungri is now in prison and a registered sex offender after being convicted of organizing prostitution services and illegal gambling while his bandmates were in the military g dragon the most popular member was not similarly engaged in scandal but elicited criticism for not reaching the typical promotion levels that recruits reach by the end of their two years the band without seungri released a single for the first time in four years this spring but has not yet returned to the levels of success it experienced before temporarily disbanding for military service the strain of upcoming military service or perhaps an exemption for bts bandmates appeared to partially trigger a conversation broadcast live between the seven members of the band in which they described themselves as exhausted and ready to pause their careers in june shortly after meeting president joe biden for a summit on ending hate crimes doing group activities for so long just like you guys mentioned earlier i started to feel like i ve become a machine i have my own hobbies and things i want to do on my own jin the oldest member whose exemption from military service ends this year said on the livestream celebrating the anniversary of the band s debut we re going through a rough patch right now another bandmate jimin said we re trying to find our identity and that s an exhausting and long process our fans know us and we know us suga a third bandmate said the band was entering an off season a comment translated on the livestream as entering a hiatus given the timing of jin s upcoming military service entertainment news outlets took the remark to mean that the band was temporarily breaking up prompting a catastrophic collapse for stocks of hybe its record label which dropped nearly 2 billion in value in one day the incident occurred less than a week after the debut of the band s latest album proof bts is responsible for nearly 90 percent of hybe s profits hybe representatives desperately tried to claim that the use of the word hiatus was a mistranslation and the ban would continue to perform the team never said it was taking a break a hybe spokesperson told south korea s joongang ilbo they made the announcement because bts had always released albums as a group and they didn t want to worry or startle the fans when individual releases start coming out follow frances martel on facebook and twitter

first six months of 2022 and our ability to renew tenants as well as our deleveraging and capital recycling programs we had an excellent start to 2022 by investing 51 4 million in seven industrial assets in our target markets and we intend to continue our capital recycling program whereby we will sell non core assets and use the proceeds to de lever our portfolio as well as acquire properties in our target growth markets thus far in 2022 we successfully exited one non core asset recognizing a capital gain of 8 0 million and we have additional non core assets we anticipate selling in the next one to two years that we believe will result in additional capital gains we will continue to opportunistically sell non core assets and redeploy the proceeds into stronger target growth markets with a focus on industrial investment opportunities while we expect to face challenges due to the continuing covid 19 pandemic significant inflation with a corresponding increase in interest rates and the geo political and economic issues arising from the war in ukraine we feel strongly about the depth of our tenant credit underwriting we have collected 100 of first quarter cash rents and 100 of july cash rents and we anticipate our tenants will successfully navigate the current economic climate and will continue operating successfully when remaining operating restrictions are fully lifted and economic normalcy completely returns despite economic uncertainty so far during 2022 we renewed 263 205 square feet with three tenants and leased 29 505 square feet of vacant space we are in good standing on our credit facility which continues to provide us added financial flexibility and are actively marketing our remaining vacant space and anticipate positive outcomes we expect to continue to have access to the debt and equity markets as necessary for added liquidity and are extremely pleased with our solid performance over the last several years our same store rents which have increased by 2 annually in recent years should be continuing to rise as we grow and we ll continue to primarily focus on investing in our target markets with an emphasis on industrial properties and

relations inquiries related to any of the monthly distribution paying gladstone family of funds please visit www gladstonecompanies com non gaap financial measures ffo the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit developed ffo as a relative non gaap supplemental measure of operating performance of an equity reit in order to recognize that income producing real estate historically has not depreciated on the basis determined under gaap ffo as defined by nareit is net income computed in accordance with gaap excluding gains or losses from sales of property and impairment losses on property plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures ffo does not represent cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap and should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of its performance or to cash flow from operations as a measure of liquidity or ability to make distributions the company believes that ffo per share provides investors with an additional context for evaluating its financial performance and as a supplemental measure to compare it to other reits however comparisons of its ffo to the ffo of other reits may not necessarily be meaningful due to potential differences in the application of the nareit definition used by such other reits core ffo core ffo is ffo adjusted for certain items that are not indicative of the results provided by the company s operating portfolio and affect the comparability of the company s period over period performance these items include the adjustment for acquisition related expenses gains or losses from early extinguishment of debt and any other non recurring expense adjustments although the company s calculation of core ffo differs from nareit s definition of ffo and may not be comparable to that of other reits the company believes it is a meaningful supplemental measure of its operating performance accordingly core ffo should be considered a supplement to net income computed in accordance with gaap as a measure of our performance the company s presentation of ffo as defined by nareit or presentation of core ffo does not represent cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap and should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of its performance or to cash flow from operations as a measure of liquidity or ability to make distributions the statements in this press release regarding the forecasted stability of

intel is searching for cost saving alternatives following a rough second quarter the chip giant s ceo pat gelsinger told investors last week that he has exited six businesses since taking over as ceo in 2021 and that the company has recently exited its drone business this is a time for a bit of austerity gelsinger told yahoo finance we had stuff we created over the last decade that needed to be cleaned up it helps drive a more accelerated pace to the transformation we have under way the ceo added that the six business exits have freed up 1 5 billion for intel to invest elsewhere shares of intel reportedly fell more than eight percent in friday s session with seven wall street firms slashing their ratings on intel s stock gelsinger told yahoo finance that intel was at the bottom with trends standing to improve as product delays ease and seasonal forces pick up and encourage demand looking forward we believe intel s weak report will likely further solidify the company as a show me story until progress on manufacturing technology product competitiveness and financial returns become more apparent to investors deutsche bank analyst ross seymore said in our opinion the first instance for intel to rebuild credibility in its strategy will likely come in 4q22 as the company s updated guidance implies a sizable ramp in revenue and margins that is likely to be viewed as optimistic until delivered seymore added in june intel delayed the groundbreaking ceremony for its planned multibillion dollar chip making facility in ohio referred to by gelsinger as the start of a silicon heartland due to worries over a proposed law designed to support u s semiconductor production the ohio plant has been repeatedly highlighted by president joe biden as an example of a key manufacturing development and an indicator that the u s is taking a larger role in the global semiconductor industry rather than relying on countries like china as it has in the past you can follow alana mastrangelo on facebook and twitter at armastrangelo and on instagram

it s 9 30 on a thursday morning and the students inside room 327 at denver s east high school are supposed to be watching a documentary about world war ii class is almost over though so even when the teacher pauses the video to ask a question about the united states international trade policy during the conflict most of the teenagers in the advanced placement ap u s history class continue preparing for next period s precalculus quiz the clicking of fingers on graphing calculators fills the room when the bell chimes one ap class replaces another inside room 327 harlem porter finds an open desk in the back and opens their laptop like their peers in the ap african diaspora seminar porter is working on a long term research paper that will decide whether they pass or fail the course i m looking at how eurocentrism has affected the sexuality of africans through the cosmology of two separate tribes the igbo and yoruba of west africa porter says with those tribes genders aren t assigned until you re around five porter who is nonbinary explains that christian colonists overrode those beliefs and that the effect is still being felt by the united states black communities today it s a topic that s close to my heart porter says porter would normally stand out in an ap class not just because of their passion for the material but also because of their race according to the education trust black and latino students are underrepresented in ap courses across the country that s certainly the case in east high school s ap u s history class which has a minority enrollment of 17 percent the school s african diaspora seminar however is 52 percent minority nearly mirroring east s student body which is 48 percent nonwhite that level of representation in an ap course is like finding a unicorn says paul markson iii who co teaches the ap african diaspora seminar you just don t see it anywhere markson is all too familiar with the racial achievement gaps in colorado s ap classes black students in the state are roughly 30 percent less likely to enroll in such courses than their white counterparts of those who do take an ap test only 26 percent pass the end of term exam compared to 67 percent of white students for years markson and members of east s faculty had discussed ways to increase minority participation in ap classes but progress was slow basically markson says there was no real interest because the classes hadn t changed the college board a new york city based not for profit known for administering standardized tests such as the sat introduced ap classes to students during the 1950s created to prepare kids for u s universities by replicating the lecture hall experience a stock ap class feeds massive amounts of information to passive learners at the end of the year students are tested on what they ve learned by taking a single exam it s a drill and kill philosophy markson says that s high on stress and low on creative thinking it also favors upper middle class white students says kristin klopfenstein director of the colorado evaluation and action lab at the university of denver since designed to replicate college klopfenstein says all the barriers that exist for attending higher education are the same barriers that exist in advanced placement courses because minority students often attend chronically underfunded and underperforming elementary and middle schools they are ill prepared for the rigors of an ap class meaning they fall behind their peers research shows that ap students perform better academically once they re in college in 2014 however the college board unveiled a new instruction model the seminar offering was intended to be more flexible eschewing rote memorization and a high stakes exam for a research project on a particular theme giving students the agency to take on topics of their choosing we wanted to turn that classic ap model on its head says rushi sheth who used to oversee the seminar offering for the board things that are important to kids they have the freedom to explore in ap seminars although sheth says the seminar model wasn t introduced specifically to boost diversity in ap classes scholars at tuskegee university in alabama teachers college at columbia university in new york and the african diaspora consortium adc a network of academics intent on reimagining how african history can be taught from a global perspective saw an opportunity to do just that in 2017 the triumvirate began designing curriculum that would trace the movement of africans often forced by the slave trade and colonialism across the world a basic framework of material is supplied to teachers but the specific topics students gravitate toward is intentionally left open for example an educator in philadelphia remixed the syllabus into an exploration of crunk feminism and for kids of african ancestry the seminar provides a valuable opportunity to study themselves in 2018 the college board agreed to test the curriculum during a yearlong trial at 11 high schools across the country kassie freeman president and ceo of the adc says 80 percent of students passed the pilot seminar and the next year the board added the course to its menu of offerings that s when michelle rich markson s co teacher at east learned about the class in 2019 denver public schools dps approved the black excellence resolution which required schools to produce a comprehensive plan for prioritizing the achievement of black students east s proposal eliminated weighted grades for ap courses so that they aren t worth more to gpas and mandated that pupils take at least one ethnic studies class still enrollment in east s ap courses remained 70 percent white in 2021 22 rich believed the african diaspora seminar had the potential to balance that number i thought oh this is great rich says the content might increase the diversity since it s a research based class without a high stakes test it could open doors for some students after a bit of wrangling between school administrators and the district the ap african diaspora seminar debuted in east s course catalog for the 2021 22 school year listen up the din in room 327 subsides as rich dispenses instructions for the day s class markson standing beside her with his arms akimbo students rich tells them will be spending the day preparing slides for an upcoming presentation on their research projects thomas bohlen who sits across from porter gets to work putting together citations for a powerpoint on the fashion industry and black culture bohlen used to hate learning about history it was all just like here s some stuff memorize these dates this is one of the only classes i ve taken where there is such an individual focus and you are able to look into the topics you are passionate about now bohlen is thinking of minoring in history in college but the format of the african diaspora seminar isn t the only thing driving increased representation in 2019 a study published in the harvard educational review showed that spanish language instruction and culturally relevant curriculum boosted both enrollment and the pass rate by at least 10 percentage points in less than 10 years at a low income high school with a high latino population in california ap african diaspora seems to be having the same effect at east jayden baumann who is black was assigned this class by his counselor but i stayed in it because it was talking about african culture african history and i wanted to learn a lot about that moreover a 2015 study of three million florida students published in the economics of education review found that matching teachers with students of the same race improved performance across multiple subjects particularly for struggling black students markson who graduated from east in 1989 is one of the district s few black ap instructors i can identify with the students on a different level he says east isn t the only school finding success with the ap african diaspora seminar 100 educators across the united states attended free workshops on the theme in 2021 the growth is moving at a pace that we had not anticipated at this early of a stage says the adc s freeman but east which will once again offer the class in 2022 23 is still the only dps school with the african diaspora seminar or any ap curriculum that is culturally relevant to students of color in its catalog dps the state s most diverse school district boasts relatively strong representation numbers black and latino students account for 70 percent of total enrollment and 61 percent of ap classes still markson is hoping that ap african diaspora being offered at other schools would push that number higher and district administrators have taken notice as we live our value of collaboration dps deputy superintendent tony smith said in a statement we plan to share this resource with schools across the district at press time there were tentative plans to discuss the seminar s expansion during the district s leadership week in july that same month markson and rich received the results of their inaugural ap african diaspora class research projects nearly 60 percent of the students passed markson and rich are already discussing ways to improve the course in the coming years this seminar was a good first step because we ve been talking about this issue with ap classes for the five years i ve been here rich says it seemed like a good way to start taking a little more action
bjdlzx note this article appeared in the newsletter on june 11 2022 and has been updated as needed athabasca oil otcpk athof ath ca has been waiting for a time when management could reduce the debt load made from some acquisitions a few years ago now that opportunity presents itself and not a moment too soon either the latest round of financing cost more than 9 in interest even with a second lien as protection and some warrants as well furthermore the company has a provision to direct three fourths of its free cash flow as defined in the agreement to the repayment of this debt until a certain amount has been redeemed investors have more than average risk just investing in a thermal operation in the first place therefore the reduction of debt will reduce the operating leverage as well as the financial risk associated with that leverage thermal producers usually have fairly high production costs this company is no exception athabasca oil thermal operating results athabasca oil second quarter 2022 management discussion and analysis as shown above the operating expenses are tremendous compared to the unconventional business management often focuses on the wonderful margin but there is not enough of the product produced for decent cash flow given the debt levels unless selling prices are at robust levels that is the main reason for the high interest rate and the warrants furthermore transportation costs are higher and the product needs to be blended with condensate in order to flow through the pipelines to market since the sales price is discounted from the more desirable light oil the breakeven wti price for thermal product is often pretty high it can become higher when as is often the case the discount widens during the periodic industry downturns management is projecting that the company should have a net cash position by yearend that would certainly help the situation tremendously management tends to maintain a large cash position so that there is no need to use the credit line during hostile industry conditions and so there is adequate liquidity to shut in production should that become necessary during those times of weak commodity prices this management also tends to buy and sell projects the cash position lets sellers know that management is able to execute transactions because the cash is available light oil athabasca needs cash flow during the industry downturn part of the business cycle in fiscal year 2020 for example production was shut in when it no longer produced positive cash flow this is what makes it so difficult for thermal producers to survive as standalone upstream companies this company has a joint venture that produces light oil that joint venture offers the promise of decent cash flow during downturns once development is sufficient to provide that cash flow athabasca oil second quarter 2022 update of light oil business athabasca oil corporate presentation second quarter 2022 the costs are much lower for this joint venture project so the profitability shown above is a lot better the production selling price is not discounted as is the case with the thermal product therefore the wti breakeven is lower there is no widening of a discount to worry about and the cash flow during cyclical downturns is reliable compared to thermal both partners are currently working on getting the well costs down before this project goes into production mode therefore production growth will be on the slow side or maybe nonexistent until the partners determine that the well costs are satisfactory the well design has resulted in much better initial flow rates and overall production per well so some cost progress has been made but it is also clear that more work needs to be done partner s view small companies often need some additional credibility in this industry in this case that additional credibility comes from having murphy oil mur as a partner in the light oil project here is murphy s view of the project from the first quarter slide presentation murphy oil report of operated joint venture progress murphy oil corporate slide presentation first quarter 2022 murphy operates some of the acreage and athabasca oil operates the rest having a well established partner like murphy with which to share information helps athabasca oil gain a credibility it might otherwise not have the partnership also speeds the process of finding the most cost efficient method with which to develop this project the current environment is likely to provide both partners with more free cash that they can use to optimize the operations that is important to athabasca oil because the company needs the cash it gets now during industry downturns there is always the risk to a thermal producer of an extended downturn that results in no cash flow from the thermal operation therefore it is essential that a thermal producer that wants to remain independent has a low cost upstream operation clearly athabasca has that operation now it needs to get that joint venture to the correct size to assure no financial stress during cyclical downturns summary athabasca oil is a leveraged thermal producer with an edge that edge consists of a joint venture with a well established industry producer for light oil production management also has the advantage of using the current robust commodity price environment to reduce debt as much as possible so many times thermal oil produces insufficient or even no cash flow during industry downturns therefore it is probably optimal for the company to have no debt at all just in case management appears to recognize this by agreeing to repay debt at a relatively rapid pace still this company is not a low cost producer therefore earnings will probably not be valued as highly as the more profitable competitors the light oil joint venture does provide a future possibility of a more profitable production mix therefore stock valuation related to earnings could improve as the joint venture progresses as long as there is substantial debt this company is probably only for more venturesome investors conservative investors need not consider this company canadian prices tend to be far cheaper than united states prices so there could be a purchase of some existing light oil production in the future costs are improving at the thermal projects but this company has a long way to go to match the thermal costs of industry leaders like cenovus energy cve investors need to view this company as a work in progress with a fair amount of work yet to be done

net sales for the second quarter were 1 981 000 down 42 versus the like period in 2021 the decrease is mostly the result of a slowdown in retail impulse purchases due to inflation across all sectors

women at the helm lynn osmond ceo choose chicago it can be daunting to be the first but for lynn osmond the new president and ceo of choose chicago being the very first woman to helm the city s official destination marketing organization is an exhilarating once in a lifetime opportunity just two and a half months into her new role osmond has hit the ground running laser focused on promoting the u s s third largest city on the national and global stage and she is more than prepared to pull this mission off successfully she possesses an intimate knowledge of the windy city its tourism and hospitality community and dmo following 25 years leading the chicago architecture center cac as president and ceo and serving as a choose chicago board member in fact under osmond s leadership the cac grew from a 2 4 million operation in 1996 with an audience of 150 000 to a 25 million organization in 2019 with an audience of 700 000 making it one of the top cultural attractions in the city and the largest architecture center of its kind in the world with the architecture center i had the opportunity to travel the world and understand firsthand the power of the chicago brand osmond says i also have the unique perspective that i was a partner of choose chicago so i understand the needs and challenges of our members tsnn had a chance to catch up with the dynamic leader to discuss her historic appointment including the opportunities and challenges a post pandemic landscape presents how she plans to bring meeting and trade show business back to chicago and how she and her team are working to create more diversity and equity within the organization how did you find your way into the tourism and events industry and what do you like most about it so far i ve actually been selling chicago for 25 years just focused on one part architecture of what makes chicago an amazing place to work and play now i have so much more to sell with the assets of an entire city i have been overwhelmed by how welcoming the industry has been i have had the chance to attend several industry events spoken with other dmo ceos and connected with people across the country how does it feel to be the first female leader in the history of choose chicago and what have your first few months on the job been like exhilarating is probably the best description of the first two months some people have asked me why join at this time coming out of covid but i actually see that as an opportunity covid has reframed how we look at travel and tourism the old adage absence makes the heart grow fonder is applicable for travel we realized how much we missed that so there is pent up demand people are looking for authentic experiences it s no longer just about getting away but what travelers can learn about the place and themselves with our 77 neighborhoods and rich culture and diversity chicago offers all of that and more for me being able to support chicago s tourism and hospitality community during recovery is an honor coupled with a deep sense of responsibility to make sure we deliver for our partners as the country moves out of the pandemic what are your plans for bringing business travel back to the city specifically trade shows and corporate events chicago is a great city for business we have found that there is a significant pent up demand for trade shows and corporate events for example the american society of clinical oncologists asco was back in chicago for the first time in two years last month this show was almost at 2019 numbers the international manufacturing technology show imts is estimating more than 100 000 people for this september and 45 000 hotel rooms have already been booked our convention center and meeting venues are busy however the early success does not mean we are slowing down from our central location to the diversity of meeting venues the hotel stock two airports plus easy train and car access chicago is in a great position to compete while gender diversity in executive roles within the destination marketing industry has been gradually shifting in a more equitable direction what are you seeing as the biggest challenges of being a female leader in a historically male dominated industry this is not my first time being a woman in a male dominated industry in 2020 only 17 of architects were women and that was an increase from past years the challenges that women face are not new as women we need to be more prepared and ready to advocate more strongly for our position we also need to be resilient and persistent and finally more often than not we have to work harder and be smarter in order to earn the respect of our colleagues what qualities do women bring to executive roles that empower them to excel at their jobs women are in general natural problem solvers we are also very collaborative throw in the ability to multi task and you have an outstanding leader what are your plans to foster more dei within your organization as well as the tourism and events industry throughout the destination chicago is an incredibly diverse city and we need to make sure that diversity is represented within our industry choose chicago has been extremely aggressive in this area and it was one of the things i championed when i was on the board now as the ceo it will continue to be a focus area for our organization we are looking at diversity in a few ways one our partners i m glad to say that nearly a third of our new partners this year were women and minority owned businesses two we need to foster diverse leaders a few months ago we named our first equity diversity inclusion edi fellow this is a new program designed to support diverse talent grown into leadership roles and three within our own organization we have an initiative choose compassion that is working specifically on this effort these are just the start there is much more to do and more opportunities for growth what advice would you give to women following leadership paths in destination marketing be persistent and follow your vision when i first moved to chicago it was to lead the chicago architecture foundation but i knew we could be more than a foundation but as a doorway to illustrate the impact of design today it is the chicago architecture center a stand alone location featuring more than 50 unique walking boat and bus tours with 7 000 departures each year it took 25 years to achieve all of this but i stayed focused on my vision for the organization considering your extensive time at your previous job you must be passionate about architecture what are your top three architectural experiences that event groups should experience when visiting chicago that is a tough question i have to start with the chicago architecture foundation center river cruise aboard chicago s first lady river cruise not only do you have the chance to see chicago from an entirely different perspective from the river you also can see how chicago s architecture evolved over time other great options are the art deco walking tour or experiencing chicago s architecture from above from either the skydeck at willis tower or 360 chicago at

we d like to clear something up while the concept of chicken wings tossed in a spicy sauce may have been born in a bar in buffalo new york in 1964 deep fried wings have been a southern tradition far longer than that so southerners know how to appreciate a well cooked platter whether you prefer them sweet spicy fried or charred on the grill use these chef approved tips and you ll have crispy moist flavorful wings every time choose quality wings and make sure the tips are trimmed if you want great results when cooking chicken wings it all starts at the checkout line says brian jupiter a new orleans native and the executive chef at frontier in chicago investing in quality meat will garner better results so i recommend making a trip to your local butcher shop to get your wings he says an added bonus is that the meat is already trimmed if you trim the wing tips yourself save them to make stock dry brine with an expert twist to retain more moisture and guarantee a crispy skin jupiter rubs the wings with salt and lets them rest in the fridge overnight sticking to my nola roots i often mix my salt with cajun seasoning paprika garlic powder onion powder cayenne pepper oregano thyme celery salt and black pepper he says ed randolph who makes southern style barbecue at handsome devil in newburgh new york suggests adding two tablespoons of baking powder per twenty four wings to any dry rub baking powder increases the ph balance in the chicken which draws moisture to the skin where it can cook off and evaporate he says it accelerates the browning process so your wings will not only be crispy but also have a great color master the pre cook every chef we spoke to said cooking the wings twice is key one of my go to secrets for great chicken wings is mastering the pre cook says matt bolus executive chef at the 404 kitchen in nashville tennessee the meat in wings is dark meat and is loaded with connective tissue that is tough so it takes time to get tender after dry brining bolus cooks the wings in a 225 degree oven grill or smoker until they reach an internal temperature of 168 f then he pulls them out and lets them rest again for at least thirty minutes or for best results in the fridge overnight so they re ready to cook again in the morning pick a sauce the sauce you toss your wings in is really a matter of preference whether you like them sweet or spicy or with an asian inspired umami kick for best results gabriel lopez executive chef at willa s in tampa florida says to make sure the sauce matches the flavor profile of the rub you used for example i love to make a honey orange ginger glaze for my wings at home he says that matches well with a spice rub of coriander orange zest black pepper salt and szechuan pepper glaze them before cooking if you re using a grill or oven and baste while cooking for bonus flavor or afterwards if you re tossing them in a fryer nail the final cook to caramelize wings on the grill or in the oven bolus cooks them at 400 degrees until hot and crisp if you re frying them up make sure your oil is preheated to somewhere between 375 and 400 degrees to ensure a crispy coating cook until golden brown then drain on paper towels no matter how you cook them work in batches so you don t overcrowd the pan or fryer enjoy the results pile on a platter and scatter with chopped scallions and cilantro and flank with the usual favorites ranch blue cheese carrots celery and of course a big stack of napkins

the center square with the state s college savings program seeing most investment funds down for the year one analyst sees a potential cost to taxpayers parents investing in illinois bright start college savings program may have been shocked at their fund balance in recent statements of 17 different individual portfolios the bright start performance statement online shows investments in 13 of them are down over the past 12 months five of the funds are down double digits with the t rowe price large cap growth 529 portfolio down nearly 23 5 independent analysts bill bergman said stock market losses are being felt across all sectors for anyone invested one thing bergman said to watch for with bright start is how taxpayers may come to the rescue as is done with public sector pensions hit by poor investment returns it s not so direct in the case of these college savings plans but there may be indirect forms of pressure from the state to bolster the position of people in these plans that isn t available for people trying to save on their own for education bergman told the center square in april taxpayers covered a one time 230 million payment for the unfunded liability in the now defunct college illinois program that ended enrollment in 2017 a move the state says will save taxpayers 75 million over the long term the program is permanently closed to new enrollments and will continue to operate as usual for the beneficiaries of the nearly 25 000 current contracts with no change in benefit payments customer service or plan administration said a statement on the college illinois website the monthly financial report for college illinois shows a decline in the rate of return of 5 56 since last year for the bright start program illinois treasurer michael frerichs office says individuals choose their risk tolerance ndividuals choose their 529 investments based on their own risk tolerance goals and time horizon said frerichs spokesman greg rivara state rep tom demmer the republican challenging frerichs in the november election said with most funds down and nearly a third down double digits for the year the treasurer needs to communicate more with families about their investments pointing to the poor results of college illinois demmer said illinois doesn t have a stellar record on college savings programs it highlights the need for the state treasurer to be hands on and not to sort of pretend that a recession isn t happening or not to pretend that the biden administration hasn t overseen record inflation said demmer r dixon we need to be frank and upfront in what s happening in our economy and look for ways to try to mitigate the damage from that demmer said the treasurer needs to be evaluating what the costs are look at expense ratios and performance and find lower cost plans to soften the impacts on parents investments there are some really tricket economic times ahead said demmer and we can t ignore that we need to be proactive on how to manage that bergman warned it s possible we have an extended period ahead of us of poor stock market performance which for these plans as well the public pension retirement plans would have significant implications for the participants and perhaps even taxpayers in the state of illinois bergman said

11 59 written by brannon braga joe menosky directed by david livingston season 5 episode 23 production episode 217 original air date may 5 1999 stardate unknown captain s log neelix talks to janeway about the great wall of china apparently he and paris are learning about each others homeworlds and challenging each other to trivia on the subject this leads to janeway asking him about the millennium gate which one of janeway s ancestors worked on janeway recalls the family stories about how shannon o donnel was asked by the governor of indiana to work on the project and flew her in on a private jet we then flash back to december 2000 where we see o donnel driving into portage creek indiana in a beat up old station wagon seeing signs for the millennium gate but not knowing what it is buy the book fugitive telemetry buy book icon close fugitive telemetry buy this book from she s looking for a service station but most of the businesses in town are closed then she rear ends another car and has to admit to not having insurance the guy she rear ended lets it go and drives off o donnel s not so lucky as her station wagon won t start after calling for a tow truck she takes refuge in alexandria books owned and operated by henry janeway assisted by his son jason we soon learn that henry is the lone holdout in town every other business has sold their land to the millennium gate project it s being sold as a planned community that can be the basis of future communities on other worlds which janeway said in the twenty fourth century was one goal the gate accomplished but henry sees it as a fancy shmancy shopping mall and nothing else henry has flyers he s been putting up around town speaking out against the gate o donnel offers to use her laptop to e mail everyone in town which she hopes he ll pay her for as she s flat broke and needs to pay to fix her car how she can afford a laptop which in 2000 cost a lot more than they do now when she can t even afford car insurance is left as an exercise for the viewer gerald moss who represents the company building the gate is interviewed by local news not only is henry the only holdout but if he doesn t capitulate by the time the new year flips to 2001 they ll have to consider an alternate location for the gate henry is thrilled as now he just has to hang on for a few more days back on voyager janeway asks seven to dig up information about the construction of the millennium gate as most of the records are fragmentary janeway credits the family stories about o donnel as being a major influence on her decision to become a starfleet officer at neelix s suggestion seven expands her search to non federation sources and they find a picture of an elderly shannon o donnel janeway with her children and grandchildren in a park they also find a reference to the town of portage creek s resistance to the gate project in 2000 moss comes to o donnel with a job offer he knows that she washed out of the space program another inaccuracy in janeway s family stories as janeway speaks of o donnel as being an astronaut and her work as an engineer wasn t respected moss is willing to make her a consultant on the gate project but only if she convinces henry to sell the bookstore o donnel bonds with jason over videogames and the gate jason unlike his father thinks it s cool while henry is off in bloomington to buy stock as the local suppliers won t work with him because he won t support the gate when henry returns o donnel and he get into an argument about the gate she admits to the job offer saying she doesn t want to keep living out of her car and henry asks her to stay with him but she doesn t want to be stuck in his bookstore either on voyager janeway is disappointed to learn that most of what she thought she knew about her ancestor isn t true she wasn t an astronaut she didn t work on any of the mars missions never even went to mars and it turns out that the only person who was against the gate in portage creek was o donnel s future husband chakotay urges janeway not to be so hard on o donnel as she had no way of knowing she d need to live up to the expectations of her descendant the starship captain o donnel gets into her car to head out of portage creek moss says the job offer is still good even though she didn t get henry to play ball and jason pleads with her to stay but she drives off anyhow but after stopping for chocolate chip cookies she turns around and comes back a news crew and the police are outside alexandria books as the clock is moving toward the midnight deadline that will see the gate officially moved to canton ohio she goes in to tell henry that she realized that she didn t want to continue her life without him and that he needs to stop living in the past and do right by his son and the town and he agrees at 11 59pm and everyone s happy neelix asks a despondent janeway to the mess hall where they re celebrating ancestor s day a solemn and ancient holiday that neelix just made up to make janeway feel better the crew remind her that o donnel is just as much of an inspiration even if she didn t do everything she thought she did the emh takes a holographic picture and neelix presents janeway with a framed version of the picture he dug up we then fade to the taking of that picture with the elderly o donnel and her progeny there s coffee in that nebula janeway gets a hard lesson in the difference between family history and recorded history forever an ensign kim tells the story of an ancestor of his who piloted a sleeper ship to a solar system that turned out not to actually be there so he had to turn around and pilot it back while the rest of the crew was in stasis the crew was awakened and confused as to why they never left orbit the crew of voyager finds this story far funnier than it actually is everybody comes to neelix s neelix and paris trading of historical trivia about earth and talax is what gets janeway started on thinking about o donnel and neelix also is the one who helps seven get on the right search track resistance is futile seven mentions an ancestor of her own that she s found sven buttercup hansen a prize fighter she is skeptical as to neelix s claims that there is significance to her being a descendant of his neelix s mentioning of the similarity between the names sven and seven is met with a stare of dubiousness no sex please we re starfleet o donnel meeting up with a man named henry janeway is some pretty clumsy foreshadowing to their eventual coupling though their conversations are entertaining do it the holographic engineer is having problems with her program neelix the cardassian cook is low on supplies seven of twelve is regenerating and captain chakotay is doing just fine janeway s sarcastic commentary on how history can sometimes distort reality welcome aboard character actor john carroll lynch who was in the midst of his recurring role as the title character s brother on the drew carey show plays moss bradley pierce plays jason kristina hayes plays the reporter and james greene and christopher curry play the townsfolk o donnel encounters upon arrival in portage creek and our robert knepper moment is the great kevin tighe as henry janeway i vaguely knew he was in a trek episode at some point but i was completely gobsmacked to see him here trivial matters the original notion of this episode was to have an ancestor of janeway s in the twentieth century encounter either q or guinan with john delancie or whoopi goldberg guest starring but it mutated into a more straightforward flashback with no science fictional or trek elements to the flashback however the turn of the millennium was always intended to be part of it the episode accurately predicted that the y2k bug would not be as devastating as feared though the real reason for that was because programmers worked their asses off throughout 1999 to keep it from happening your humble rewatcher was married to such a programmer at the time however the episode did not accurately predict that new year s festivities in the 2000 2001 new year would be equally as turn of the millennium focused as those in 1999 2000 instead the 2000 2001 new year was just another new year s another 1999 trek story that dealt with the turn of the millennium was the novel i q by john delancie peter david which had an equally inaccurate prediction for how things would go in this case a terrorist attack on times square o donnel appears in the eugenics wars the rise and fall of khan noonien singh book 2 by greg cox in which we learn she was part of the project that developed the botany bay the ship on which khan and his fellow augments were exiled the model of the apollo lunar module that hangs from o donnel s rear view mirror was borrowed from the desk of trek writer denise okuda portage creek is fictional though there is a portage indiana that is a suburb of chicago portage creek is said to be near bloomington so is much further south than portage the outdoor scenes were filmed on paramount s new york lot with snow brought in to simulate winter set a course for home that station wagon of yours doesn t exactly look like a sailing ship i wanted to like this episode more than i did as its heart is very much in the right place but it ultimately doesn t quite cohere into what it wants to be it reminds me far too much of other episodes that tackled its themes far more successfully living witness did so much more with the notion of history distorting the facts ds9 s far beyond the stars was a significantly more effective twentieth century flashback and ds9 s once more unto the breach provided a far more effective colloquy on the differences between legends and reality i really wish worf could have materialized in the mess hall at the end and delivered a version of his line from the latter episode the only real question is whether you believe in the legend of shannon o donnel or not if you do then there should be no doubt in your mind that she was a great explorer if you do not believe in the legend then she was just a woman and it does not matter how she lived i wish someone had pointed out to janeway that even if o donnel wasn t an astronaut she was still a nasa engineer an occupation that was only about ten percent women in 2000 i wish someone had told henry that if he s the only actual open business in town the town is going to go into economic ruin destroying the lives of everyone in it when o donnel and henry are talking about the pros and cons of living in the past o donnel won the argument at the very beginning by saying there were no antibiotics in the classical period not to mention no decent dental care and oh yeah that women could be property yet henry kept going for some reason apparently completely okay with the notion of dying from a small cut that gets infected at age twenty it s also really easy for an educated white guy to say that the classical period was better that s another problem with the episode it didn t really sell me on the henry shannon pairing at all kevin tighe is fine as henry but i spent most of the episode wanting to punch him in the throat to be fair that s true about a lot of tighe s roles he s really good at playing people whose throat you want to punch the whole chocolate chip cookie thing at the end didn t work because it wasn t seeded anywhere in the episode which wouldn t be so bad except we spent lots of time on things like o donnel dreaming about the moon landing or helping jason with videogames none of which paid off in any way anywhere else in the episode in the end this was a lifetime original movie with a twenty fourth century frame grafted onto it it s still completely watchable mainly because kate mulgrew does superlative work both as a frustrated o donnel and a devastated janeway because tighe inhabits his character perfectly and because both bradley pierce and especially the always reliable john carroll lynch are fantastic in the roles of jason and moss and to be fair i was completely engaged in the lives of the characters in december 2000 as i was watching it i also must confess to getting a kick out of paris and neelix trading trivia about each others homeworlds i also love that they both forgot the seventh wonder of the ancient world leaving it to the ex borg to tell them it was the lighthouse of alexandria but it should ve been so much more than it was warp factor rating 5 keith r a decandido is also reviewing each new

investment in life sciences one of the hottest commercial property sectors during the pandemic has slowed dramatically in recent months but analysts say the slowdown is temporary and that the asset class still has a bright future real estate data firm msci real assets reported that investment sales of life sciences r d assets totaled 7 7 billion during the first half of 2022 down 34 percent year over year from a record breaking first half of 2021 when transaction volume was bolstered by portfolio sales related 10 economists offer their advice for cre investors during the covid 19 pandemic momentum had been strong for the life sciences sector as investment capital migrated away from office properties to property types with a more certain outlook including life sciences there s been a lot of euphoria around this sector and still a lot of interest but maybe a little bit of that bloom has come off the rose says josh king vice chair with the capital markets team at real estate services firm cushman wakefield in the last three to four months commercial real estate as a whole has faced significant headwinds he notes related rising interest rates inflation lead investors to reassess which cre assets to pursue it doesn t mean dead we were going like 120 miles per hour and now we re going to slow down to 50 to 60 mph says frank petz managing director of investment sales at real estate services firm colliers i can tell you there s less product on the market because sellers don t want to sell cheap knowing they re going to be discounted and there s not enough buyers to go to market because everyone s selective and cautious those words selective and cautious burn my eardrums these days the bidding pool has diminished greatly rising interest rates have become an added cost for investors who depend on leverage to finance their acquisitions and as yields increase so do expectations for returns petz notes the slowdown in the economy has reduced tenant demand for space as well because companies are more selective about growth and taking on more real estate commitments according to king the investment sales numbers for the first half of the year might not be fully representative of where the market is now because transactions have a three to six months life cycle any deal that closed in the first half of 2022 probably started in the second half of last year he notes today clients are told to add at least 30 days more to get a deal closed and spend more of their time in the marketing stage with thinner bidder pools between the geopolitical instability stemming from the war in ukraine an energy crisis that increases the possibility of a recession and the stock market dropping the trickle down effect is starting to impact both tenant and investor demand according to king in his view the real gauge of investor sentiment will become clear only in the second half of the year and in particular during the fourth quarter of 2022 and the first quarter of 2024 for the time being i think it will be more of the same choppy and investors waiting to see what happens with inflation and the fed during the worst of the covid 19 pandemic the life sciences sector was hiring at a rapid pace and taking up a lot of space that attracted new interest from investors notes austin barrett executive vice president and head of life sciences with t3 advisors a savills company there was even a doubling down to create new lab space for companies he says but over the past three months the world has changes once again barrett says the public market is down and a lot of these growth stage biotech companies don t have an exit if you have no exit you have a lot of investors who are weary people are slowing down on fundraising and that s going to cause people to slow down on hiring looking on the bright side not all the market statistic are negative sales of individual life sciences assets the bedrock of the investment sales market were up 11 percent year over year in the first half of 2022 msci reports there are a lot of headlines saying there s a massive pullback in investment and that has to be put into the proper framework according to steve golubchik newmark s executive vice chairman and president capital markets western region if you look at venture capital funding for 2021 it s actually pretty healthy in 2022 the difference is there was so much capital raised in 2021 which was so abnormally high that it makes it look like there s a substantial drop off that was more of an anomaly like petz golubchik makes the analogy that life sciences was going 200 mph and now it s going at 80 against the level of investment in some of the other asset classes he views it as still a very healthy place to be buyers also continue to pay premium prices for class a and class b life sciences product in core markets notes barrett there s still a lot of pent up demand and early stage discovery going on in boston san diego san francisco raleigh n c and anywhere with a strong research sector and a dearth of available life sciences space as a result markets that serve as epicenters of life sciences activity in the u s including san francisco san diego and cambridge mass are far less likely to see any price discounting than secondary life sciences markets across the country says petz today there are nearly 21 million sq ft of new life sciences projects under construction in the u s more than double the pre pandemic square footage according to cushman wakefield another 32 million sq ft in projects have been proposed in boston and the bay area alone at the same time life sciences companies are beginning to right size their expansion plans says golubchik a company going out to look at 150 000 to 200 000 square feet might now be going out to look at 75 000 or 80 000 square feet the amount of expansion might have contracted slightly but the amount of demand is still very healthy in the market previously we were sitting on top of rent growth numbers that were anywhere from 10 percent to 30 percent a year depending on where you were says petz those are crazy numbers 120 mph numbers and now we re flat you can t put that into your underwriting and that impacts value up until the last 60 to 90 days valuations for life sciences assets were holding strong but they are now down 5 percent to 25 percent depending on the location quality of product and the risk associated with buying the property petz notes stabilized assets that are fully occupied and cash flowing can see valuations go down by 10 percent to 15 percent according to king assets that are more opportunistic involving new developments or conversions are off by a higher percentage because of the higher cost of debt he says there are early indications that valuations for life sciences properties have moderated from 2021 levels following five years of 19 percent average annualized price growth says craig leibowitz executive director innovation and insight advisory with real estate services firm avision young between 2020 and 2021 cap rates in the sector decreased by 5 1 percent now higher benchmark interest rates are likely to cause yields for life sciences assets to stabilize or increase in the near term leibowitz notes who s buying the life sciences sector has become more institutionalized in recent years as it has gained wider acceptance since 2020 private capital has accounted for 53 percent of property purchases in the sector reits for 36 percent and foreign investors for 6 3 percent according to leibowitz between 2015 and 2019 foreign investors accounted for just 0 4 percent of investment sales in the life sciences space this year groups such as cbre investment management and gi partners have been among the top institutional buyers of life sciences assets says lauro ferroni head of u s capital markets research at real estate services firm jll blackstone through its reit biomed realty remains among the most prolific private equity investors in life sciences assets several other private equity firms have increased their allocations to life sciences in the past 12 months as well ferroni says meanwhile as the availability and pricing of debt has increased this year it is getting harder for leveraged buyers to compete for assets says king institutional pension fund advisors and core funds tend to get by with low leverage he notes higher leveraged are higher return guys closed end funds or offshore capital ties to high net worth capital golubchik says he s seen a lot of sovereign wealth funds and state pensions who are active in the life sciences space after they ve gotten more comfortable with the sector that was previously seen as alternative life sciences remains attractive for commercial real estate investors because of the industry s long term demand runway adds ferroni venture capital investments in pharma and biotech startups in 2022 to date remain elevated already exceeding 2019 levels and on track to beat 2020 levels 2021 was a record year this pipeline of startup capital should continue to drive new company formation and demand for lab space ferroni says even though a potential recession would have some impact on the life sciences sector in the short term investors should be thinking about these properties as an investment over a timeframe of five to 10 years according to king long term there s still tremendous tailwinds that are going to benefit this sector demographic shifts in the country and aging populations and more money directed into the sector over time right now we re experiencing a hiccup after what has been an absolutely meteoric growth of capital flows into biotech and healthcare the last several years there s been double digit growth of capital going into this business which has translated into a lot of demand for new space and building of new space those will slow down and catch breath but long term the trends are positive

washington reuters u s senate democrats on monday were awaiting a ruling from the a chamber referee this week on whether they can override the legislature s normal rules to pass a 430 billion drugs energy and tax bill despite republican objections the decision by the referee officially known as the parliamentarian will have a profound impact on president joe biden s domestic agenda heading into the nov 8 midterm elections when republicans are favored to win back control of the house of representatives and perhaps the senate amid voter discontent over inflation senate majority leader chuck schumer on monday confirmed that he planned to begin debate this week under the reconciliation procedure democrats are hoping to use to pass the bill only a simple majority of votes in the 100 member chamber would be needed to steer the bill towards passage instead of the 60 needed for most legislation with the senate split 50 50 among democrats and republicans the process would allow for passage as democratic vice president kamala harris could break any tie vote and secure a victory for biden the bill being reviewed by the senate parliamentarian was crafted by democratic senator joe manchin who has often stood in the way of key biden priorities and with the blessing of senate majority leader chuck schumer still unknown however is whether democratic senator krysten sinema like manchin a maverick in the caucus will lend her support a sinema spokesperson said she was still reviewing the bill and would also wait to see which provisions if any the parliamentarian allows to stay in the bill without sinema s vote the entire effort could be doomed as no republicans were expected to vote yes on what democrats are calling the inflation reduction act of 2022 it would provide new federal funding for a significant reduction in u s carbon dioxide emissions that contribute to climate change and allow medicare the federal health insurance program for the elderly and disabled to negotiate lower pharmaceutical prices tax increases aimed at the wealthy would partially offset the costs with lower drug prices also saving the government money the bill s backers say but republicans have been attacking the measure arguing it will violate a biden pledge to not raise taxes on those earning less than 400 000 annually senator mike crapo top republican on the senate finance committee criticized the bill as he released an analysis he requested from the joint committee on taxation jct a nonpartisan congressional panel the jct report said the bill s tax provisions would indirectly raise the effective tax burden on americans with incomes of 200 000 or less by 16 7 billion in 2023 the tax burden effect in the jct analysis is due to small estimated reductions of incomes from potential wage cuts that could result from companies higher tax bills or lower stock values said kimberly clausing a tax law professor at the university of california los angeles and a former u s treasury tax official the legislation would raise the tax burden by another 14 1 billion on taxpayers with annual incomes of between 200 000 and 500 000 according to the jct analysis democrats on the finance committee which oversees tax policy say the analysis is incomplete a family making less than 400 000 will not pay one penny in additional taxes ashley schapitl spokeswoman for the senate finance committee democrats said in a statement it doesn t include the benefits to middle class families of making health insurance premiums and prescription drugs more affordable the same goes for clean energy incentives for families reporting by richard cowan david morgan and david lawder editing by scott malone and aurora ellis
glen arbor mich in a forest near lake michigan two scientists attached a backpack tracking device to a merlin they d lured into a net the mission help prevent the predatory species from gobbling up piping plovers highly endangered shorebirds that nest nearby merlins themselves were going downhill decades ago but are recovering thanks to bans on pesticides such as ddt that s good for them but not for plovers in the great lakes region where only 65 to 70 pairs remain the small falcons are are a big threat to their recovery said nathan cooper a research ecologist with smithsonian s national zoo and conservation biology institute the situation is ironic a troubled species rebounds thanks to restoration efforts only to make things worse for others in peril by preying on them or outcompeting them for food and living space similar circumstances have turned up elsewhere challenging wildlife experts who want them all to thrive in balanced healthy environments for instance the iconic bald eagle s comeback has pressured rare water birds resurgent peregrine falcons menace endangered california least terns and western snowy plovers that take refuge at naval bases near san diego and off the california coast attacks from protected white sharks hinder recovery of threatened sea otters gray seals previously on the brink of extirpation in waters of new england now occupy some massachusetts beaches by the hundreds the 800 pound mammal s return has raised worries about vulnerable fish stocks such unintended consequences don t necessarily reveal flaws in the u s endangered species act or conservation programs experts say rather they illustrate nature s complexity and the importance of protecting biological communities not just individual species clearly there are occasions when we get these conflicts between species that we re trying to protect said stuart pimm a duke university extinction specialist but is it a major worry in conservation no species recoveries can produce tradeoffs since some animals are more adaptable than others to changes in the climate or landscape said bruce stein chief scientist with the national wildlife federation a lot of ecosystems where these things are occurring are a little out of whack to begin with because we ve altered them in some way stein said with climate change there are going to be winners and losers the losers will tend to have specific habitat requirements narrow ecological niches and often will be the ones already declining outsmarting a merlin smithsonian interns tim baerwald and zachary bordner snared the merlin at sleeping bear dunes national lakeshore with help from its natural enemy a great horned owl this one was dead but fitted with remote control devices to make it hoot and flap its wings the merlin darted overhead sounding high pitched rapid fire distress calls it dove into a net stretched between steel poles the scientists gently disentangled the brownish speckled female then attached the tracker and a leg band as long as it s fitted correctly she ll have a long and happy life baerwald said before bordner released the merlin which zipped back to its nesting tree merlin numbers in the region have jumped since the ddt ban in 1972 they re suspected of killing at least 57 adult piping plovers in the past 10 to 15 years said cooper of smithsonian the sandy backed ring necked plovers skitter along beaches nibbling tiny marine animals and eggs they re among three remaining north american populations their decline caused primarily by habitat loss and predation while officials have shot some merlins they re looking for non lethal controls data from the transmitter backpacks might help determine whether capturing and relocating them is worth trying said vince cavalieri a biologist with the national lakeshore john flesher ap ap zachary bordner secures a tracking device to a merlin captured near lake michigan and held by fellow smithsonian intern tim baerwald on june 27 near glen arbor mich eagles threaten rare birds recovery of america s national bird the bald eagle is a triumph but in one area of coastal maine the big raptor poses a problem for the only u s breeding population of great cormorants when they re disturbed by eagles the adult cormorants will flush and leave their nests said don lyons a conservation scientist at the national audubon society s seabird institute then gulls ravens and crows swoop in to gobble cormorant eggs and chicks if this happens repeatedly an entire colony can fail lyons said his team organizes volunteers to camp near cormorant gatherings to scare away eagles in southern california least terns and snowy plovers are no match for attacking peregrine falcons which like eagles bounced back after the ban on ddt such pesticides are passed up food chains and cause large birds to produce eggs with thin shells which females crush when trying to incubate them the san diego zoo and wildlife alliance tries to protect the endangered birds by hiring a falconer to capture problem peregrines keeping them in a holding facility over winter or releasing them in northern california some find a new territory while others go back said nacho vilchis a conservation ecologist if there s a real problem bird that keeps returning we may ask for permission for lethal removal but that s only rarely done vilchis said hunting and bounties devastated new england s gray seals saved by the marine mammal protection act of 1972 the population has rebounded to tens of thousands fishing groups contend the seals could threaten cod stocks that regulators are struggling to rebuild after decades of overfishing the coastal ecosystem alliance based in fairhaven massachusetts wants to weaken the protection act to allow hunting and slow the seals population growth said board member peter krogh gray seals are certainly this case where recovery has both been cause for celebration and cause for concern said kristina cammen a university of maine marine mammal scientist who says they re less of a hazard to fish populations than humans are seals and cormorants bedevil fishers like the clash over seals and cod there are other cases where reviving species may be more a nuisance to people than a threat to other wildlife fish farmers in the south and anglers in the great lakes region and pacific northwest have long complained about the double crested cormorant a dark feathered diving bird that gorges on catfish perch salmon and other prized species cormorants have done so well since the ddt ban that agencies have tried limiting them in some locations with egg oiling nest destruction and even shooting drawing lawsuits from environmentalists who say the birds are a scapegoat for human actions that harm fish they re a part of our avian community and our ecosystems and there needs to be a place for them said dave fielder a fisheries research biologist with the michigan department of natural resources but when their numbers are so high that they potentially decimate the recreational fishery that s a problem wild turkeys were spread across north america before european settlement but had dwindled to tens of thousands by the 1930s disappearing from many states now they re hunted in 49 states and are so common in new england that they often cause traffic tie ups some hunters say hungry turkeys are outcompeting ruffed grouse which are decreasing in parts of their range such as the upper midwest but scientists point to habitat loss and climate change the national wild turkey federation is helping move turkeys from states with plenty such as north carolina maine and west virginia to texas and others that could use more said mark hatfield national director of conservation services if you introduce hunting localized wild turkeys you reduce the problem with overabundant turkeys right away hatfield said nature at work conflicts between recovering species and ones still in trouble don t always mean something is wrong scientists say it could reflect a return to how things were before humans got in the way when a population gets back to where it s having the same interactions with other organisms as before it went down that s nature at work said john fitzpatrick emeritus director of cornell university s laboratory of ornithology the bald eagle is challenging our preconceived notions about what s normal for prey such as great cormorants in new england and common murres on the west coast which might have been less abundant before eagles declined said lyons of the audubon society the eagle s recovery complicates the conservation of certain other species lyons said but their recovery is such a wonderful outcome that s a welcome complication predator prey relationships are complex and intervening can be tricky said stein of the wildlife federation it s often wiser he said to focus on protecting habitat and reconnecting fragmented landscapes to promote natural migration than moving things around willy nilly but environmental scientist ian warkentin a merlin specialist said there can be ways to help struggling species without being heavy handed larger falcons such as peregrines sometimes used to chase birds from airports might be deployed to shoo merlins from plover nesting areas i fall on the side of the fence that says we should do whatever we can to aid the recovery of species for which we ve caused such grief said warkentin from memorial university of newfoundland s grenfell campus copyright 2022 npr to see more visit

the california coast attacks from protected white sharks hinder recovery of threatened sea otters gray seals previously on the brink of extirpation in waters of new england now occupy some massachusetts beaches by the hundreds the 800 pound mammal s return has raised worries about vulnerable fish stocks such unintended consequences don t necessarily reveal flaws in the u s endangered species act or conservation programs experts say rather they illustrate nature s complexity and the importance of protecting biological communities not just individual species clearly there are occasions when we get these conflicts between species that we re trying to protect said stuart pimm a duke university extinction specialist but is it a major worry in conservation no species recoveries can produce tradeoffs since some animals are more adaptable than others to changes in the climate or landscape said bruce stein chief scientist with the national wildlife federation a lot of ecosystems where these things are occurring are a little out of whack to begin with because we ve altered them in some way stein said with climate change there are going to be winners and losers the losers will tend to have specific habitat requirements narrow ecological niches and often will be the ones already declining outsmarting a merlin smithsonian interns tim baerwald and zachary bordner snared the merlin at sleeping bear dunes national lakeshore with help from its natural enemy a great horned owl this one was dead but fitted with remote control devices to make it hoot and flap its wings the merlin darted overhead sounding high pitched rapid fire distress calls it dove into a net stretched between steel poles the scientists gently disentangled the brownish speckled female then attached the tracker and a leg band as long as it s fitted correctly she ll have a long and happy life baerwald said before bordner released the merlin which zipped back to its nesting tree merlin numbers in the region have jumped since the ddt ban in 1972 they re suspected of killing at least 57 adult piping plovers in the past 10 to 15 years said cooper of smithsonian the sandy backed ring necked plovers skitter along beaches nibbling tiny marine animals and eggs they re among three remaining north american populations their decline caused primarily by habitat loss and predation while officials have shot some merlins they re looking for non lethal controls data from the transmitter backpacks might help determine whether capturing and relocating them is worth trying said vince cavalieri a biologist with the national lakeshore john flesher ap ap zachary bordner secures a tracking device to a merlin captured near lake michigan and held by fellow smithsonian intern tim baerwald on june 27 near glen arbor mich eagles threaten rare birds recovery of america s national bird the bald eagle is a triumph but in one area of coastal maine the big raptor poses a problem for the only u s breeding population of great cormorants when they re disturbed by eagles the adult cormorants will flush and leave their nests said don lyons a conservation scientist at the national audubon society s seabird institute then gulls ravens and crows swoop in to gobble cormorant eggs and chicks if this happens repeatedly an entire colony can fail lyons said his team organizes volunteers to camp near cormorant gatherings to scare away eagles in southern california least terns and snowy plovers are no match for attacking peregrine falcons which like eagles bounced back after the ban on ddt such pesticides are passed up food chains and cause large birds to produce eggs with thin shells which females crush when trying to incubate them the san diego zoo and wildlife alliance tries to protect the endangered birds by hiring a falconer to capture problem peregrines keeping them in a holding facility over winter or releasing them in northern california some find a new territory while others go back said nacho vilchis a conservation ecologist if there s a real problem bird that keeps returning we may ask for permission for lethal removal but that s only rarely done vilchis said hunting and bounties devastated new england s gray seals saved by the marine mammal protection act of 1972 the population has rebounded to tens of thousands fishing groups contend the seals could threaten cod stocks that regulators are struggling to rebuild after decades of overfishing the coastal ecosystem alliance based in fairhaven massachusetts wants to weaken the protection act to allow hunting and slow the seals population growth said board member peter krogh gray seals are certainly this case where recovery has both been cause for celebration and cause for concern said kristina cammen a university of maine marine mammal scientist who says they re less of a hazard to fish populations than humans are seals and cormorants bedevil fishers like the clash over seals and cod there are other cases where reviving species may be more a nuisance to people than a threat to other wildlife fish farmers in the south and anglers in the great lakes region and pacific northwest have long complained about the double crested cormorant a dark feathered diving bird that gorges on catfish perch salmon and other prized species cormorants have done so well since the ddt ban that agencies have tried limiting them in some locations with egg oiling nest destruction and even shooting drawing lawsuits from environmentalists who say the birds are a scapegoat for human actions that harm fish they re a part of our avian community and our ecosystems and there needs to be a place for them said dave fielder a fisheries research biologist with the michigan department of natural resources but when their numbers are so high that they potentially decimate the recreational fishery that s a problem wild turkeys were spread across north america before european settlement but had dwindled to tens of thousands by the 1930s disappearing from many states now they re hunted in 49 states and are so common in new england that they often cause traffic tie ups some hunters say hungry turkeys are outcompeting ruffed grouse which are decreasing in parts of their range such as the upper midwest but scientists point to habitat loss and climate change the national wild turkey federation is helping move turkeys from states with plenty such as north carolina maine and west virginia to texas and others that could use more said mark hatfield national director of conservation services if you introduce hunting localized wild turkeys you reduce the problem with overabundant turkeys right away hatfield said nature at work conflicts between recovering species and ones still in trouble don t always mean something is wrong scientists say it could reflect a return to how things were before humans got in the way when a population gets back to where it s having the same interactions with other organisms as before it went down that s nature at work said john fitzpatrick emeritus director of cornell university s laboratory of ornithology the bald eagle is challenging our preconceived notions about what s normal for prey such as great cormorants in new england and common murres on the west coast which might have been less abundant before eagles declined said lyons of the audubon society the eagle s recovery complicates the conservation of certain other species lyons said but their recovery is such a wonderful outcome that s a welcome complication predator prey relationships are complex and intervening can be tricky said stein of the wildlife federation it s often wiser he said to focus on protecting habitat and reconnecting fragmented landscapes to promote natural migration than moving things around willy nilly but environmental scientist ian warkentin a merlin specialist said there can be ways to help struggling species without being heavy handed larger falcons such as peregrines sometimes used to chase birds from airports might be deployed to shoo merlins from plover nesting areas i fall on the side of the fence that says we should do whatever we can to aid the recovery of species for which we ve caused such grief said warkentin from memorial university of newfoundland s grenfell campus copyright 2022 npr to see more visit

salmon solutions i found the july 2022 article about the collapse of the cypress island salmon farm salmon in troubled waters to be equal parts fascinating maddening and depressing i was fascinated by the excellent storytelling about the events of august 2017 maddened by the complete lack of responsibility and humility on the part of cooke aquaculture and depressed by the potential and already realized impacts on wild salmon populations what can those of us who love a good salmon dinner do to ensure that we are choosing salmon that are harvested sustainably for the ecosystem wild salmon populations and indigenous peoples ellen tomlinson grand junction colorado hopes for success thank you for the great article on willamette falls fracture at the falls july 2022 i wish the tribes luck on sorting out a solution to gaining public access and restoring fishing rights to the people tim holmen sparks nevada colorado s river genie thank you for ben goldfarb s thoughtful essay on ownership of colorado s rivers who owns colorado s riverbeds july 2022 fifty years ago when i was a kid fly fishing on my beloved gunnison river and its tributaries we thought little of who owned the riverbeds in which we were wading but with the dramatic increase in tourism as well as the cost of land ownership access to those same waters has become exceedingly contentious over the years as i ve purchased the fishing licenses that help fund state stocking of the rivers i fish i have done so knowing that i am supporting private landowners who essentially receive well stocked private waters in the deal i have fished waters across the u s including the fabled trout and salmon streams of michigan in that state s navigable rivers private land ownership is inferior to the public trust right to fish can the courts be persuaded to reverse colorado s long standing rules regarding private ownership of riverbeds i certainly hope so but i doubt that genie can be put back in the bottle barth hague gunnison colorado hydrogen hues big grid blues thanks for another excellent jonathan thompson infographic in the july issue this time a succinct and fair explanation of hydrogen hues this piece is helpful but i find it unfortunate that there is so much hype in media and among public officials around centralized big grid capital intensive energy and not enough about already available local distributed solar storage and microgrids the focus of attention seems to be on serving the interests of investors and corporations over the interests of the people tim schoechle boulder colorado concise powerful dina gilio whitaker s perspective piece on the landback movement environmental justice is only the beginning july 2022 was beautiful in the way she concisely and powerfully articulated history importance and urgency she explains what land return means in a way that directly confronts the fears that arise when we descendants of colonizers imagine turning our homes and properties over to native peoples as gilio whitaker explains this is not the case it reminded me of my reaction when i first learned the specifics of the defundthepolice movement the phrase evokes fear of a lawless crime filled cityscape and like landback seems at first glance completely unfeasible i see now however that both of these describe a set of systemic changes that not only are feasible but are absolutely necessary to protect human rights and our planet truly we all including colonizers would benefit from land return and reallocating funds away from our police michael rowley oakland california the article

the eighth circuit released an opinion tuesday in u s ex rel cairns v d s medical llc that creates a new circuit split on the interpretation of the causation standard for establishing that a claim resulting from a violation of the anti kickback statute aks makes a claim false or fraudulent under the false claims act fca the eighth circuit held that a plaintiff government or relator relying solely on the resulting from language in the aks must show but for causation that but for the kickbacks the claims at issue would not have included the item or service that was the subject of the kickback this contrasts to an earlier third circuit decision on the same question that rejected the but for causation standard and instead required a showing that there was some causal link between the kickback and the submission of claims for payment to the government we will continue to monitor these divergent interpretations of the element of causation for aks based fca cases to see how courts approach the issue in subsequent cases background the statutory provision addressed in cairns was enacted in 2010 to simplify what had become a variety of approaches applied by courts to address the intersection of the aks and the fca through the affordable care act congress amended the aks to specifically provide a claim that includes items or services resulting from a violation of constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the fca 1 thus if a claim results from an aks violation it is per se false the circuit split at issue here arises from differing interpretations of the phrase resulting from as used in this provision cairns but for standard in tuesday s opinion the eighth circuit holds that at least for cases where the plaintiff relies solely on the theory that an aks violation resulted in a false claim the plaintiff must establish that the allegedly false claim would not have included particular items or services absent the illegal kickbacks 2 relators a collection of midwestern neurosurgeons and pain management professionals brought suit under the fca against neurosurgeon sonjay fonn his practice midwest neurosurgeons llc and his fiancée deborah seeger the owner of a spinal implant distribution company the suit alleged that fonn purchased implants from ds medical seeger s company and purchased stock from a manufacturer which supplied ds medical in violation of the aks resulting in the submission of false claims to medicare and medicaid the government intervened and the case went to trial on the element of causation the court instructed the jury that it is enough for the united states to show that the claim failed to disclose the violation 3 the jury returned a verdict for the government on two of three fca claims and the district court then awarded treble damages and statutory penalties in the amount of 5 495 931 22 on appeal the eighth circuit found that the district court erred in not instructing the jury on the question whether the defendant would not have included particular items or services but for the illegal kickbacks the court remanded for a new trial in considering the appropriate interpretation of what it means for a claim to result from a kickback violation the eighth circuit concluded that the phrase resulting from is unambiguous and requires a but for casual relationship the united states had argued 1 that the 2010 fca amendments codified prior holdings that called for a more expansive interpretation of causation in aks based claims and 2 the legislative history supported that view the court acknowledged but ultimately disregarded those arguments on the grounds that they are both contrary to the plain language of the statute and would not adequately prove causation of particular note the court discarded the argument that the taint of a kickback violation necessarily means that all associated claims are false the eighth circuit referred to its ruling as narrow the court did not go so far as to say every case arising under the fca requires a showing of but for causation however where a plaintiff seeks to establish that a claim is false or fraudulent under the fca solely because of an underlying violation of the aks cairns holds that there must be a showing of but for causation cairns acknowledged that the third circuit when faced with the same question in 2018 endorsed a different standard in medco the third circuit held that to show that a false claim resulted from an aks violation the relator did need not prove that federal beneficiaries would not have used the relevant services absent the alleged kickback scheme 4 instead in the third circuit s view a plaintiff must show at a minimum that at least one of the items or services for which the defendant sought reimbursement for medical care was provided in violation of the aks cairns disagreed with that approach relying in significant part on two supreme court decisions in comcast corp v nat l ass n of afr am owned media 5 the supreme court held that causation standards are presumed to be but for unless specified otherwise in a statute and in burrage v united states 6 the supreme court held that the phrase resulting from in the controlled substances act required the government to prove but for causation in light of the clear and unambiguous language of the aks provision and this supreme court precedent the eighth circuit unlike the third circuit declined to accept the government s legislative history based arguments as a reason to deviate from the statute s plain language what this means going forward the third and eighth circuits each have concluded that proving the false or fraudulent nature of a claim based on an alleged aks violation requires more than showing simply a temporal relation between the claim and an alleged kickback the question is how much more is required as medco posed the question t issue therefore is what link is sufficient to connect an alleged kickback scheme to a subsequent claim for reimbursement a direct causal link no link at all or something in between 7 the third circuit answered that question by adopting the middle ground and the eighth circuit has now held that a direct causal link is required both courts agree however that there must be some link beyond a temporal one between the kickback violation and the submission of the claim in order for the kickback to render the claim false this burgeoning circuit split will have implications both within the third and eighth circuits and in the other circuits it will be particularly interesting to see how the divergent approaches to causation impact other active aks based fca cases including in ongoing litigation references 1 42 u s c 1320a 7b g emphasis

underlying losses and lae and underlying combined ratio the following discussion of segment results uses the non gaap financial measures of i underlying losses and lae and ii underlying combined ratio underlying losses and lae also referred to in the discussion as current year non catastrophe losses and lae exclude the impact of catastrophe losses and loss and lae reserve development from prior years from the company s incurred losses and lae which is the most directly comparable gaap financial measure the underlying combined ratio is computed by adding the current year non catastrophe losses and lae ratio with the insurance expense ratio the most directly comparable gaap financial measure is the combined ratio which is computed by adding total incurred losses and lae ratio including the impact of catastrophe losses and loss and lae reserve development from prior years with the insurance expense ratio the company believes underlying losses and lae and the underlying combined ratio are useful to investors and uses these financial measures to reveal the trends in the company s property casualty insurance segment that may be obscured by catastrophe losses and prior year reserve development these catastrophe losses may cause the company s loss trends to vary significantly between periods as a result of their incidence of occurrence and magnitude and can have a significant impact on incurred losses and lae and the combined ratio prior year reserve developments are caused by unexpected loss development on historical reserves because reserve development relates to the re estimation of losses from earlier periods it has no bearing on the performance of the company s insurance products in the current period the company believes it is useful for investors to evaluate these components separately and in the aggregate when reviewing the company s underwriting performance adjusted consolidated net operating income loss adjusted consolidated net operating income loss is an after tax non gaap financial measure and is computed by excluding from net income loss the after tax impact of i income loss from change in fair value of equity and convertible securities ii net realized investment gains losses iii impairment losses iv acquisition related transaction integration and other costs v debt extinguishment pension and other charges and vi significant non recurring or infrequent items that may not be indicative of ongoing operations significant non recurring items are excluded when a the nature of the charge or gain is such that it is reasonably unlikely to recur within two years and b there has been no similar charge or gain within the prior two years the most directly comparable gaap financial measure is net income loss there were no applicable significant non recurring items that the company excluded from the calculation of adjusted consolidated net operating income for the six months ended june 30 2022 or 2021 the company believes that adjusted consolidated net operating income loss provides investors with a valuable measure of its ongoing performance because it reveals underlying operational performance trends that otherwise might be less apparent if the items were not excluded income loss from change in fair value of equity and convertible securities net realized investment gains losses and impairment losses related to investments included in the company s results may vary significantly between periods and are generally driven by business decisions and external economic developments such as capital market conditions that impact the values of the company s investments the timing of which is unrelated to the insurance underwriting process acquisition related transaction and integration costs may vary significantly between periods and are generally driven by the timing of acquisitions and business decisions which are unrelated to the insurance underwriting process debt extinguishment pension and other charges relate to i loss from early extinguishment of debt which is driven by the company s financing and refinancing decisions and capital needs as well as external economic developments such as debt market conditions the timing of which is unrelated to the insurance underwriting process ii settlement of pension plan obligations which are business decisions made by the company the timing of which is unrelated to the underwriting process and iii other charges that are non standard not part of the ordinary course of business and unrelated to the insurance underwriting process significant non recurring items are excluded because by their nature they are not indicative of the company s business or economic trends 44 non gaap financial measures continued the preceding non

senior loans risk the london interbank offered rate libor is the average offered rate for various maturities of short term loans between major international banks who are members of the british bankers association libor is the most common benchmark interest rate index used to make adjustments to variable rate loans it is used throughout global banking and financial industries to determine interest rates for a variety of financial instruments such as debt instruments and derivatives and borrowing arrangements due to manipulation allegations in 2012 and reduced activity in the financial markets that it measures in july 2017 the financial conduct authority the fca the united kingdom financial regulatory body announced a desire to phase out the use of libor by the end of 2021 although the period from the fca announcement until the end of 2021 is generally expected to be enough time for market participants to transition to the use of a different benchmark for new securities and transactions there remains uncertainty regarding the future utilization of libor and the specific replacement rate or rates as such the potential effect of a transition away from libor on the trust or the financial instruments utilized by the trust cannot yet be determined the transition process may involve among other things increased volatility or illiquidity in markets for instruments that currently rely on libor the transition may also result in a change in i the value of certain instruments held by the trust ii the cost of temporary borrowing for the trust or iii the effectiveness of related trust transactions such as hedges as applicable when libor is discontinued the libor replacement rate may be lower than market expectations which could have an adverse impact on the value of preferred and debt securities with floating or fixed to floating rate coupons any such effects of the transition away from libor as well as other unforeseen effects could result in losses to the trust since the usefulness of libor as a benchmark could deteriorate during the transition period these effects could occur prior to the end of 2021 real estate industry risk issuers principally engaged in real estate industry including real estate investment trusts may be subject to risks similar to the risks associated with the direct ownership of real estate including i changes in general economic and market conditions ii changes in the value of real estate properties iii risks related to local economic conditions overbuilding and increased competition iv increases in property taxes and
