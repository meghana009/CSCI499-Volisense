elon musk s twitter profile is seen on a smartphone placed on printed twitter logos in this picture illustration taken april 28 2022 reuters dado ruvic illustration by greg roumeliotis reuters elon musk the chief executive officer of tesla and the world s richest person said on friday he was terminating his 44 billion deal to buy twitter because the social media company had breached multiple provisions of the merger agreement twitter s chairman bret taylor said on the micro blogging platform that the board planned to pursue legal action to enforce the merger agreement the twitter board is committed to closing the transaction on the price and terms agreed upon with mr musk he wrote in a filing musk s lawyers said twitter had failed or refused to respond to multiple requests for information on fake or spam accounts on the platform which is fundamental to the company s business performance twitter is in material breach of multiple provisions of that agreement appears to have made false and misleading representations upon which mr musk relied when entering into the merger agreement the filing said musk also said he was walking away because twitter fired high ranking executives and one third of the talent acquisition team breaching twitter s obligation to preserve substantially intact the material components of its current business organization legal battle musk s decision is likely to result in a protracted legal tussle between the billionaire and the 16 year old san francisco based company disputed mergers and acquisitions that land in delaware courts more often than not end up with the companies re negotiating deals or the acquirer paying the target a settlement to walk away rather than a judge ordering that a transaction be completed that is because target companies are often keen to resolve the uncertainty around their future and move on twitter however is hoping that court proceedings will start in a few weeks and be resolved in a few months according to a person familiar with the matter there is plenty of precedent for a deal renegotiation several companies repriced agreed acquisitions when the covid 19 pandemic broke out in 2020 and delivered a global economic shock in one instance french retailer lvmh threatened to walk away from a deal with tiffany co the u s jewelry retailer agreed to lower the acquisition price by 425 million to 15 8 billion i d say twitter is well positioned legally to argue that it provided him with all the necessary information and this is a pretext to looking for any excuse to get out of the deal said ann lipton associate dean for faculty research at tulane law school shares of twitter were down 6 at 34 58 in extended trading that is 36 below the 54 20 per share musk agreed to buy twitter for in april twitter s shares surged after musk took a stake in the company in early april shielding it from a deep stock market sell off that slammed other social media platforms but after he agreed on april 25 to buy twitter the stock within a matter of days began to fall as investors speculated musk might walk away from the deal with its tumble after the bell on friday twitter was trading at its lowest since march the announcement is another twist in a will he won t he saga after musk clinched the deal to purchase twitter in april but then put the buyout on hold until the social media company proved that spam bots account for less than 5 of its total users the contract calls for musk to pay twitter a 1 billion break up if he cannot complete the deal for reasons such as the acquisition financing falling through or regulators blocking the deal the break up fee would not be applicable however if musk terminates the deal on his own some employees expressed disbelief and exhaustion on friday publicly posting memes on twitter such as of a rollercoaster ride and a baby screaming into a phone in apparent commentary on the breakup employees have worried about the deal will mean for their jobs pay and ability to work remotely and many have expressed skepticism about musk s plans to loosen content moderation digital ad woes musk s abandonment of the deal and twitter s promise to vigorously fight to complete it casts a pall of uncertainty over the company s future and its stock price during a time when worries about rising interest rates and a potential recession have hammered wall street shares of online advertising rivals alphabet meta platforms snap and pinterest have seen their stocks tumble 45 on average in 2022 while twitter s stock has declined just 15 in that time buoyed in recent months by the musk deal daniel ives an analyst at wedbush said musk s filing was bad news for twitter this is a disaster scenario for twitter and its board as now the company will battle musk in an elongated court battle to recoup the deal and or the breakup fee of 1 billion at a minimum he wrote in a note to clients reporting by greg roumeliotis additional reporting by chavi

near roscoe montana austin frank watched his neighbor s house come down the east rosebud river redirecting the rising water toward his house corrals and barns crystal andersen was working horses at her cousin s barn when a neighbor walked in requesting help to get another neighbor s cattle out of the path of the rising yellowstone river denise loyning watched in awe as the stillwater river filled her nursery pasture floating a calf shed off its moorings pushing past irrigation head gates and filling irrigation channels with rock sand and round bales after experiencing significant drought just twelve months ago southwestern montana was devastated by historic flooding june 12 13 2022 it was amazing loyning said there are so many emotions it was devastating and incredibly sad for all the people who lost homes we are facing some significant costs to replace fences our headgates likely losing an irrigation season yet it was truly amazing to see what the river did in such a short time montana s governor greg gianforte has requested a presidential disaster declaration and assistance for those affected by this flood which experts consider a once in a 500 year event ryan newman u s bureau of reclamation area manager described the conditions that developed to bring the deluge down the rivers we had a near average winter he said we did not have a record snowpack but we had a very cool even cold spring so we never saw much runoff materialize the snowpack stayed on the mountains spring moisture events brought welcome rains to ease the drought from last year but also brought more snow to the higher elevations we normally see some runoff earlier but we lost that spring transition because of the cooler than normal weather then as the snow started to ripen melting condensing and becoming slushy temperatures warmed quickly and a heavy rain sent the vast majority of the snow all off the mountain at once rain on ripe snow is something we always worry about newman said this is definitely a record breaking high flow event people build based on where the river is at the time not on where it might be we are definitely looking at significant numbers in regard to damage houses infrastructure roads bridges the larger communities that were affected such as red lodge and of course yellowstone park got a lot more attention than some of the rural areas and smaller communities many farmers and ranchers were severely hit but you don t hear about the individuals on national news newman said the bureau of reclamation made an effort to capture as much water as possible in several dams to help reduce the impact of the flood farther downstream yet they saw high water all the way to sidney on the yellowstone river we were able to manage dams and reservoirs to capture a lot of water in the buffalo bill dam above cody wyoming as well as the yellowtail dam and the fort smith reservoir newman said but there has been a big impact on a lot of farmers and ranchers the yellowstone river clark s fork the stillwater every stream off the north basin of the beartooth and absarokee ranges flooded there is a lot that is not making the headlines the east rosebud river used to make an s curve through austin frank s ranch but on june 12 it carved a new channel plowing straight through and leaving his calving barn and corrals marooned on an island we didn t have any warning frank said the night before we were cleaning corrals fixing fence by morning the water was coming into our horse barn we got the horses out and then tried to move log jams but by one o clock we had to quit we always have high water but no one predicted that it would be a 500 year event frank s calving barn is on one island and his bull development yard is on a separate island his cattle are on the other side of the river and though he can see them it would take a ten mile trek around through various neighbors places just to put out mineral yet even though he s not sure where to start picking up the pieces and rebuilding the registered hereford breeder says that he doesn t have it as bad as people who lost their homes he s thankful that he had moved pairs out the week before and that all his bulls were gone austin frank s calving barn and working corrals are now stranded on an island austin frank courtesy photo neighbor s house going down the river austin frank courtesy photo we lost a lot of infrastructure barns corrals calving yards he said i know we aren t the only ones i saw calving sheds and round bale feeders go by in the river i know there is significant damage to irrigation ditches as well crystal andersen was at her cousin s place riding in his barn when they got called out to help move some pairs that were stranded in a pasture near worden the cows had gone to a dry spot but the river had moved and was surrounding them she said we were told that there was two feet of standing water but when we got there it was definitely not standing and it was more than two feet deep those cows acted pretty goofy they had found a dry spot and didn t want to leave it but it was obviously not going to stay dry for long there were eight of us horseback but the cows ran back on us the first time we tried to get them to cross the water some of the cows were trying to take our horses i have no idea exactly how long we were out there but it felt like forever almost like we were in slow motion with the constant moving of the water and the wind whipping the second time they approached the water parallel to the current and managed to get the cows across then at the bottom of the pasture they had to cross a bar ditch where the water was so deep that when the cows jumped in they went completely under but the cattle were all accounted for when they were done it was a very humbling experience andersen said l bar w cattle company near columbus headquarters are on the stillwater river she showed us what she can do denise loyning said we have chosen to live on the river and we know that comes with inherent risk we have chosen to live in her space and now we have to figure out how to work through what she has handed us and focus on how this will make us better but right now the damage is overwhelming hay ground lost denise loyning courtey photo nursery pasture during high water denise loyning courtesy photo in this industry we have a lot to cover loyning said we are always dealing with the season at hand right now our priority has to be putting up our hay we can t stop everything to figure out how and where to rebuild i don t know how we will be ready for the next season how to get ready to calve by january 1 what our options will be next march when we need breeding pastures that will not be ready but at the end of the day we will figure out how to be better and move forward loyning said that while flood warnings were sent out nobody prepared them for the magnitude of this event yet to her knowledge there was no loss of human life or loss of livestock early on monday morning june 13 she saw the water rise over a foot in thirty minutes and knew that the only thing left to do was wait it out and watch what the river would do at that point i knew it was going to get western loyning said the stock association board met a few days later and it was suggested that we hold a benefit auction to raise money for fencing materials to donate to affected producers we re here to help and we hope that it s something that can make a difference we ve been very humbled by the generous outpouring of support already in donation items meanwhile affected producers are trying to figure out what to tackle first immediate needs to get hay put up may delay rebuilding but not for long austin frank needs to preg test his embryo transfer cows but has no way to get them to his marooned and damaged working facilities the biggest challenge is that nobody knows how to handle this frank said where do we start i don t know how to move a house out of the river or how to get the water diverted back to the old channel i used to love the sound of the river but now i hate the sound of water it was amazing to see the power of the water loyning said standing on the bank hearing trees snap and feeling the boulders moving gave me a whole new respect for the river cattle move through the flooded water to safety on higher ground crystal andersen courtesy photos

updated july 10 2022 at 5 32 pm et elon musk wants to break off his agreement to buy twitter in a letter to the company filed friday with the securities and exchange commission musk accuses twitter of making false and misleading representations about the prevalence of fake accounts on its platform he says the company has not complied with its obligations to share data and information that he says he needs to evaluate its business sometimes twitter has ignored mr musk s requests sometimes it has rejected them for reasons that appear to be unjustified and sometimes it has claimed to comply while giving mr musk incomplete or unusable information musk s lawyer mike ringler wrote legal experts say this may not be sufficient grounds to break off the 44 billion deal without musk being on the hook for a hefty fine in response to musk s letter the chair of twitter s board said it planned to sue the twitter board is committed to closing the transaction on the price and terms agreed upon with mr musk and plans to pursue legal action to enforce the merger agreement we are confident we will prevail in the delaware court of chancery said bret taylor in a tweet referring to a delaware court that handles corporate disputes the billionaire ceo of tesla and space x struck a deal to buy the social media company back in april but almost immediately he started hinting and then saying outright that he had cold feet in may he declared the purchase was on hold while he looked into twitter s accounting of how many users are not real people but automated bots or spam soon after twitter agreed to give him access to its firehose a real time stream of more than 500 million tweets posted every day since then the two sides have been sharing information and working to close the transaction on thursday the washington post reported the deal was in jeopardy because musk doubts that twitter s spam figures are verifiable his team was expected to take potentially drastic action the post reported bots may not be the only factor in musk s change of heart while his offer of 54 20 a share was initially seen as a lowball price for twitter given that it was trading above 70 last year tech stocks and the market as a whole have fallen sharply since he struck the deal as of the closing bell on friday twitter shares were trading around 37 down nearly 30 from the day musk s purchase was announced in may musk even said he might seek to negotiate a lower price on thursday twitter had pointed to a statement the company issued in june saying it has and will continue to cooperatively share information with musk and that we intend to close the transaction and enforce the merger agreement at the agreed price and terms the company was expecting to hold a shareholder vote on the deal by mid august musk signed a merger agreement the two sides signed a legal agreement that musk would buy twitter for 54 20 a share if either side broke off the deal they could be on the hook to pay a 1 billion fee to the other party in his letter on friday musk cites twitter s alleged refusal to turn over more information about bots as grounds to abandon the deal but legal experts say that would be an uphill battle for years twitter has publicly said it estimates less than 5 of daily users who see ads are spam or bots but has also cautioned the number could be higher musk disputes this saying he believes as many as 20 of accounts may be fake while twitter gave musk access to its firehose of public data it told reporters this week its spam estimates are also based on private data such as users ip addresses phone numbers locations and behavior and are therefore difficult for outsiders to verify even if twitter s 5 figure is incorrect that still might not be enough to let musk back out or change the terms of the deal without paying a hefty price merger agreements are drafted to avoid exactly what musk is doing which is try to find some tiny little false thing and then say whoops i get to walk away now said ann lipton a business law professor at tulane university law school they specifically say things like you can t back out unless it s not just false but incredibly false hugely false massively damaging to the company twitter has a strong case against musk say experts the merger agreement includes what s known as a specific performance clause which says twitter can take musk to court to force him to go through with the purchase as long as he still has financing in place while that may sound risky and costly for twitter lipton says the company s case would be very strong and its board has compelling incentives to see the sale through investors are expecting to receive 54 20 a piece for their shares the board s view according to a person familiar with the deal talks is that the sale agreement with musk is the most valuable part of twitter right now they would much rather have the 54 20 without a court fight but it s worth fighting over lipton said given the company s current share price 54 20 seems like an unbelievable deal for twitter so there is a lot that they could sacrifice that would still make it worth it in the end if they got to force musk to close musk

updated july 10 2022 at 5 32 pm et elon musk wants to break off his agreement to buy twitter in a letter to the company filed friday with the securities and exchange commission musk accuses twitter of making false and misleading representations about the prevalence of fake accounts on its platform he says the company has not complied with its obligations to share data and information that he says he needs to evaluate its business sometimes twitter has ignored mr musk s requests sometimes it has rejected them for reasons that appear to be unjustified and sometimes it has claimed to comply while giving mr musk incomplete or unusable information musk s lawyer mike ringler wrote legal experts say this may not be sufficient grounds to break off the 44 billion deal without musk being on the hook for a hefty fine in response to musk s letter the chair of twitter s board said it planned to sue the twitter board is committed to closing the transaction on the price and terms agreed upon with mr musk and plans to pursue legal action to enforce the merger agreement we are confident we will prevail in the delaware court of chancery said bret taylor in a tweet referring to a delaware court that handles corporate disputes the billionaire ceo of tesla and space x struck a deal to buy the social media company back in april but almost immediately he started hinting and then saying outright that he had cold feet in may he declared the purchase was on hold while he looked into twitter s accounting of how many users are not real people but automated bots or spam soon after twitter agreed to give him access to its firehose a real time stream of more than 500 million tweets posted every day since then the two sides have been sharing information and working to close the transaction on thursday the washington post reported the deal was in jeopardy because musk doubts that twitter s spam figures are verifiable his team was expected to take potentially drastic action the post reported bots may not be the only factor in musk s change of heart while his offer of 54 20 a share was initially seen as a lowball price for twitter given that it was trading above 70 last year tech stocks and the market as a whole have fallen sharply since he struck the deal as of the closing bell on friday twitter shares were trading around 37 down nearly 30 from the day musk s purchase was announced in may musk even said he might seek to negotiate a lower price on thursday twitter had pointed to a statement the company issued in june saying it has and will continue to cooperatively share information with musk and that we intend to close the transaction and enforce the merger agreement at the agreed price and terms the company was expecting to hold a shareholder vote on the deal by mid august musk signed a merger agreement the two sides signed a legal agreement that musk would buy twitter for 54 20 a share if either side broke off the deal they could be on the hook to pay a 1 billion fee to the other party in his letter on friday musk cites twitter s alleged refusal to turn over more information about bots as grounds to abandon the deal but legal experts say that would be an uphill battle for years twitter has publicly said it estimates less than 5 of daily users who see ads are spam or bots but has also cautioned the number could be higher musk disputes this saying he believes as many as 20 of accounts may be fake while twitter gave musk access to its firehose of public data it told reporters this week its spam estimates are also based on private data such as users ip addresses phone numbers locations and behavior and are therefore difficult for outsiders to verify even if twitter s 5 figure is incorrect that still might not be enough to let musk back out or change the terms of the deal without paying a hefty price merger agreements are drafted to avoid exactly what musk is doing which is try to find some tiny little false thing and then say whoops i get to walk away now said ann lipton a business law professor at tulane university law school they specifically say things like you can t back out unless it s not just false but incredibly false hugely false massively damaging to the company twitter has a strong case against musk say experts the merger agreement includes what s known as a specific performance clause which says twitter can take musk to court to force him to go through with the purchase as long as he still has financing in place while that may sound risky and costly for twitter lipton says the company s case would be very strong and its board has compelling incentives to see the sale through investors are expecting to receive 54 20 a piece for their shares the board s view according to a person familiar with the deal talks is that the sale agreement with musk is the most valuable part of twitter right now they would much rather have the 54 20 without a court fight but it s worth fighting over lipton said given the company s current share price 54 20 seems like an unbelievable deal for twitter so there is a lot that they could sacrifice that would still make it worth it in the end if they got to force musk to close musk

elon musk was he ever serious about buying twitter hannibal hanschke pool photo via ap elon musk late friday proved that it s a mistake to think of him as unpredictable in a move that everyone from investors to casual observers has been predicting for many weeks he formally bailed out of his 44 billion deal to buy twitter musk s stated rationale for abandoning the deal as set forth in a letter from his lawyers to twitter makes no sense it s all based on his purported supposition that the condition of twitter s business is worse than the company has let on but he presents no evidence to support his claims the word appears is forced to carry the major burden of his assertions twitter he says in the letter appears to have made false and misleading representations somehow designed to coax him into signing a merger agreement on april 25 the merger agreement he contends appears to contain materially inaccurate representations merger agreements are designed to prevent exactly what musk is doing now tulane business professor ann lipton in may on the issue that he began pressing starting in mid may as grounds to either renegotiate or abandon the deal the proportion of twitter accounts that are fake spam or automated bots musk s friday missive says it appears that twitter is dramatically understating the proportion of spam and false accounts represented in its count of daily active users he says twitter s contention that it stops counting fake or spam users once it determines that the users are fakes appears to be false he also asserts that twitter s process for calculating its user numbers appears to be arbitrary and ad hoc musk has made an issue of twitter s disclosures over many years that the proportion of fake accounts included in its user statistics is 5 or less his letter says he has been caused to strongly believe that the proportion of false and spam accounts included in the reported count is wildly higher than 5 to back this up however he cites no evidence over the last two months musk s behavior has made it plain that he would prefer to be out of this deal even though the merger contract he signed left him only the narrowest options to do so he explicitly opted not to perform due diligence on twitter s books before signing the deal but subsequently demanded information about twitter s inner workings even though the term due diligence generally refers to scrutiny a prospective buyer performs before signing a deal not afterward under the terms of the merger agreement either party that bails out of the deal would be subject to a 1 billion penalty payment though twitter could also demand that musk complete the deal on the signed terms the twitter board said friday that it s prepared to sue musk to complete the deal we are confident we will prevail in the delaware court of chancery the board said what has happened to sour musk on buying twitter there are several possibilities one thought is that he was never serious to begin with but hubris led him to convert a public musing about buying one of the world s leading social media platforms into a real transaction then there s the possibility that he came to realize that managing a platform that attracts obstreperous users and an enormous amount of public attention would be an enormous pain in the backside a likely factor if not the major factor is that the value of technology companies has plummeted since april that includes twitter itself and tesla the electric car company that represents most of musk s wealth through his ownership of its shares he initially pledged many of those shares as collateral on financing for the twitter deal since april 25 through friday s trading twitter shares have lost about 30 of their value they never came close to the 54 20 per share he agreed to pay the figure may very well be a marijuana related joke don t ask tesla shares fell about 25 in the same time frame and as of friday s close were about 38 below their peak price of 1 208 59 reached on nov 1 amid the stock downturns musk announced may 13 that the deal was temporarily on hold because of his doubts about fake accounts experts were doubtful from the start of his pettifogging that he had reasonable grounds to bail out for starters there s no such thing in mergers as one side placing a deal temporarily on hold twitter for its part said then that work on closing the deal was proceeding normally merger agreements are designed to prevent exactly what musk is doing now tulane business professor ann m lipton wrote on twitter after musk s may announcement have a buyer get cold feet and then nitpick to find some arguably false rep that they can use as a pretext to avoid their obligations a material adverse change in a company s business is a common escape clause but lipton observed that it s a very high standard that has been met once in the history of the delaware business court with jurisdiction over this deal there s no evidence that it exists here due to spam on twitter s platform musk again didn t provide any evidence on friday the only question today is whether musk can extricate himself or more precisely at what price barring a settlement this whole deal looks like it s destined to turn into one of the business world s longest running courtroom dramas it may look fascinating at this moment but be warned it s almost certain to become very tiresome very soon if you haven t already wearied of musk s clownishness you will eventually that s a sure bet this story originally appeared in los angeles times
elon musk announced friday that he will abandon his tumultuous 44 billion offer to buy twitter after the company failed to provide enough information about the number of fake accounts twitter immediately fired back saying it would sue the tesla ceo to uphold the deal the likely unraveling of the acquisition was just the latest twist in a saga between the world s richest man and one of the most influential social media platforms and it may portend a titanic legal battle ahead twitter could have pushed for a 1 billion breakup fee that musk agreed to pay under these circumstances instead it looks ready to fight to complete the purchase which the company s board has approved and ceo parag agrawal has insisted he wants to consummate in a letter to twitter s board musk lawyer mike ringler complained that his client had for nearly two months sought data to judge the prevalence of fake or spam accounts on the social media platform twitter has failed or refused to provide this information sometimes twitter has ignored mr musk s requests sometimes it has rejected them for reasons that appear to be unjustified and sometimes it has claimed to comply while giving mr musk incomplete or unusable information the letter said musk also said the information is fundamental to twitter s business and financial performance and is needed to finish the merger in response the chair of twitter s board bret taylor tweeted that the board is committed to closing the transaction on the price and terms agreed upon with musk and plans to pursue legal action to enforce the merger agreement we are confident we will prevail in the delaware court of chancery the trial court in delaware frequently handles business disputes among the many corporations including twitter that are incorporated there former president donald trump weighed in on his own social platform truth social the twitter deal is dead long live the truth musk said in may that he would allow trump who was banned from twitter following the jan 6 2021 riot at the u s capitol back onto the platform much of the drama surrounding the deal has played out on twitter with musk who has more than 100 million followers lamenting that the company was failing to live up to its potential as a platform for free speech on friday shares of twitter fell 5 to 36 81 well below the 54 20 that musk agreed to pay shares of tesla meanwhile climbed 2 5 to 752 29 after the market closed and musk s letter was published twitter s stock continued to decline while tesla climbed higher this is a disaster scenario for twitter and its board wedbush analyst dan ives wrote in a note to investors he predicted a long court fight by twitter to either restore the deal or get the 1 billion breakup fee on thursday twitter sought to shed more light on how it counts spam accounts in a briefing with journalists and company executives twitter said it removes 1 million spam accounts each day the accounts represent well below 5 of its active user base each quarter to calculate how many accounts are malicious spam twitter said it reviews thousands of accounts sampled at random using both public and private data such as ip addresses phone numbers location and account behavior when active to determine whether an account is real last month twitter offered musk access to its fire hose of raw data on hundreds of millions of daily tweets according to multiple reports at the time though neither the company nor musk confirmed that one of the chief reasons musk gave for his interest in taking twitter private was his belief he could add value to the business by getting rid of its spam bots the same problem that he s now citing as a reason to end the deal this whole process has been bizarre said christopher bouzy founder of research firm bot sentinel which tracks fake twitter accounts used for disinformation or harassment he knew about this problem it s odd that he would use bots and trolls and inauthentic accounts as a way of getting out of the deal on the other hand bouzy said the letter from musk s legal team makes some valid critiques of twitter s lack of transparency including its apparent refusal to provide musk with the same level of internal data it offers some of its big customers it just seems as if they re hiding something said bouzy who also believes the number of fake or spam twitter accounts is higher than what the company has reported musk s lawyer also alleged that twitter broke the agreement when it fired two top managers and laid off a third of its talent acquisition team the sale agreement he wrote required twitter to seek and obtain consent if it deviated from conducting normal business twitter was required to preserve substantially intact the material components of its current business organization the letter said musk s flirtation with buying twitter appeared to begin in late march that s when twitter said he contacted members of its board including co founder jack dorsey and told them he was buying up shares of the company and was interested in either joining the board taking twitter private or starting a competitor then on april 4 he revealed in a regulatory filing that he had became the company s largest shareholder after acquiring a 9 stake worth about 3 billion at first twitter offered musk a seat on its board but six days later agrawal tweeted that musk would not be joining the board after all his bid to buy the company came together quickly after that when musk agreed to buy twitter for 54 20 per share he inserted a 420 marijuana reference into his price he sold roughly 8 5 billion worth of shares in tesla to help fund the purchase then strengthened his commitments of more than 7 billion from a diverse group of investors including silicon valley heavy hitters like oracle co founder larry ellison inside twitter musk s offer was met with confusion and falling morale especially after musk publicly criticized one of twitter s top lawyers involved in content moderation decisions groups opposing the takeover from the outset including those advocating for women minorities and lgbtq people cheered friday s news despite what musk may claim this deal isn t ending because of twitter bots or spam accounts this deal is collapsing because of elon musk s own erratic behavior embrace of extremists and bad

making false and misleading representations about the prevalence of fake accounts on its platform he says the company has not complied with its obligations to share data and information that he says he needs to evaluate its business sometimes twitter has ignored mr musk s requests sometimes it has rejected them for reasons that appear to be unjustified and sometimes it has claimed to comply while

billionaire elon musk wants to end his 44 billion deal to buy twitter musk s lawyer claimed twitter failed to comply with its obligations in the merger agreement twitter s board chair bret taylor said the company is still committed to closing the deal at the agreed upon price and plans to pursue legal action to enforce the agreement billionaire elon musk wants to end his 44 billion deal to buy twitter according to a letter sent by a lawyer on his behalf to the company s chief legal officer friday but twitter s board chair bret taylor said the company is still committed to closing the deal at the agreed upon price and plans to pursue legal action to enforce the agreement get philly local news weather forecasts sports and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc philadelphia newsletters we are confident we will prevail in the delaware court of chancery taylor wrote twitter shares were down about 6 after hours on friday in the letter disclosed in a securities and exchange commission filing skadden arps attorney mike ringler said that twitter has not complied with its contractual obligations ringler claimed that twitter did not provide musk with relevant business information he requested as ringler said the contract would require musk has previously said he wanted to assess twitter s claims that about 5 of its monetizable daily active users mdaus are spam accounts twitter has failed or refused to provide this information ringler claimed sometimes twitter has ignored mr musk s requests sometimes it has rejected them for reasons that appear to be unjustified and sometimes it has claimed to comply while giving mr musk incomplete or unusable information ringler also charged in the letter that twitter breached the merger agreement because it allegedly contains materially inaccurate representations this accusation is based on musk s own preliminary review of spam accounts on twitter s platform twitter has said it s not possible to calculate spam accounts from solely public information and that a team of experts conducts a review to reach the 5 figure while this analysis remains ongoing all indications suggest that several of twitter s public disclosures regarding its mdaus are either false or materially misleading ringer alleged despite public speculation on this point mr musk did not waive his right to review twitter s data and information simply because he chose not to seek this data and information before entering into the merger agreement ringer added in fact he negotiated access and information rights within the merger agreement precisely so that he could review data and information that is important to twitter s business before financing and completing the transaction he also claimed twitter breached its obligations under the agreement to get musk s consent before changing its ordinary course of business pointing to recent layoffs at the company while musk is now officially seeking to walk away from the deal this saga is likely far from over under the terms of the agreement musk agreed to pay 1 billion if he backs out but as twitter s board chair indicated they would do the company can seek to hold musk to his original deal by suing him for walking away if they dispute that his reasoning should let him out of the contract twitter has reason to seek to hold musk to his original terms the stock has fallen considerably since the board announced it had accepted his offer to buy the company at 54 20 per share on the day of that announcement the stock ended the trading day at 51 70 per share twitter shares sat at 36 81 as of friday s market close musk is apparently paying attention to the stock price too according to the letter and is considering whether the company s declining business prospects and financial outlook constitute a company material adverse effect giving mr musk a separate and distinct basis for terminating the merger agreement watch a timeline of the elon musk twitter takeover saga

greg nagel and nicholas clarke guest columnists over the past few years stock buybacks have become identified with corporate greed and wealth inequality critics claim that corporate executives increase their pay by using buybacks to give an abnormal boost to stock prices when cash should have been spent investing in new projects or increasing employee wages it is easy to understand how this criticism has gained popularity among politicians and social activists culminating in proposals like a 1 excise tax on share repurchases while there are concerns about rising executive compensation and income inequality taxing buybacks will do virtually nothing to address them while making companies employees and the economy worse off there are three compelling reasons reason 1 stock buybacks alone do not increase stock prices we know this is a common belief but it ignores the fact that corporate cash is used to buy back stocks for each share repurchased the value of the company is decreased by the cost of that share true the remaining shareholders can claim more of the future earnings but this increased claim is balanced out by the cash spent so there is no boost to stock prices for example the s p 500 buyback index which tracks s p 500 companies that buy back large amounts of stock has underperformed the overall s p 500 by 0 7 per year over the last 10 years decades ago stock buybacks nearly uniformly signaled management s genuine belief that their stock was undervalued that credible signal was then followed by abnormal stock price increases however in recent decades buybacks have become preferred to dividends thanks to their flexibility and tax efficiency so we now see companies using buybacks for a number of reasons including giving extra cash back to shareholders over time abnormal returns after stock buybacks have declined but the belief that buybacks alone increase prices has persisted reason 2 there is not an endless supply of profitable projects in which companies can invest buyback critics assume that whenever companies have extra cash they also have plenty of investment opportunities this tends to be true of younger less profitable companies however older more profitable companies with lots of cash tend to have fewer investment opportunities not coincidentally these companies are also the kind that buy back stock hear more tennessee voices get the weekly opinion newsletter for insightful and thought provoking columns regardless when companies buy back stock the cash does not vanish from the economy instead investors who sell their stock back to the company can use their cash however they want this includes spending the cash on consumption depositing the cash into banks where it can then be loaned out or reinvesting the cash in those younger less profitable companies that need it apple has received lots of negative attention because they have spent hundreds of billions of dollars buying back stock over the last 10 years however if apple had simply kept that cash or invested it in unprofitable projects the economy would likely have been worse off reason 3 regulating buybacks will likely increase dividends sure if a 1 excise tax or some other regulation is imposed on buybacks it will certainly curb buyback activity but the question then becomes what do companies do with that cash buyback critics hope that companies will invest in new projects or increase employee benefits but if companies choose to buy back stock instead of doing these things they will almost certainly choose to pay out dividends as well dividends and buybacks are similar methods of returning cash to shareholders while dividends tend to be less flexible and tax efficient than buybacks these issues are unlikely to stop managers from simply increasing dividends in response to buyback regulations and given recent evidence this shouldn t be a surprise when companies had extra cash following the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 s p 500 companies increased buybacks in 2018 by over 250 billion but remember those buybacks likely did little to boost stock prices nor did they vanish from the economy instead companies had too much cash and decided to give it back to stockholders to spend how they wanted there are concerns about executive compensation and income inequality however penalizing stock buybacks does a disservice to employees companies and our economy greg nagel is a full professor of finance whose research on executive labor markets and institutional investors has been presented to many fortune 500 executives his writings have been published in the harvard business review and cited by the federal reserve and the new york times nicholas clarke is an assistant professor of finance who regularly presents his research on share repurchases at universities and financial conferences his work has been published in leading academic journals including financial management and the journal of banking and finance

updated july 10 2022 at 5 32 pm et elon musk wants to break off his agreement to buy twitter in a letter to the company filed friday with the securities and exchange commission musk accuses twitter of making false and misleading representations about the prevalence of fake accounts on its platform he says the company has not complied with its obligations to share data and information that he says he needs to evaluate its business sometimes twitter has ignored mr musk s requests sometimes it has rejected them for reasons that appear to be unjustified and sometimes it has claimed to comply while giving mr musk incomplete or unusable information musk s lawyer mike ringler wrote legal experts say this may not be sufficient grounds to break off the 44 billion deal without musk being on the hook for a hefty fine in response to musk s letter the chair of twitter s board said it planned to sue the twitter board is committed to closing the transaction on the price and terms agreed upon with mr musk and plans to pursue legal action to enforce the merger agreement we are confident we will prevail in the delaware court of chancery said bret taylor in a tweet referring to a delaware court that handles corporate disputes the billionaire ceo of tesla and space x struck a deal to buy the social media company back in april but almost immediately he started hinting and then saying outright that he had cold feet in may he declared the purchase was on hold while he looked into twitter s accounting of how many users are not real people but automated bots or spam soon after twitter agreed to give him access to its firehose a real time stream of more than 500 million tweets posted every day since then the two sides have been sharing information and working to close the transaction on thursday the washington post reported the deal was in jeopardy because musk doubts that twitter s spam figures are verifiable his team was expected to take potentially drastic action the post reported bots may not be the only factor in musk s change of heart while his offer of 54 20 a share was initially seen as a lowball price for twitter given that it was trading above 70 last year tech stocks and the market as a whole have fallen sharply since he struck the deal as of the closing bell on friday twitter shares were trading around 37 down nearly 30 from the day musk s purchase was announced in may musk even said he might seek to negotiate a lower price on thursday twitter had pointed to a statement the company issued in june saying it has and will continue to cooperatively share information with musk and that we intend to close the transaction and enforce the merger agreement at the agreed price and terms the company was expecting to hold a shareholder vote on the deal by mid

billion fee to the other party in his letter on friday musk cites twitter s alleged refusal to turn over more information about bots as grounds to abandon the deal but legal experts say that would be an uphill battle for years twitter has publicly said it estimates less than 5 of daily users who see ads are spam or bots but has also cautioned the number could be higher musk disputes this saying he believes as many as 20 of accounts may be fake while twitter gave musk access to its firehose of public data it told reporters this week its spam estimates are also based on private data such as users ip addresses phone numbers locations and behavior and are therefore difficult for outsiders to verify even if twitter s 5 figure is incorrect that still might not be enough to let musk back out or change the terms of the deal without paying a hefty price merger agreements are drafted to avoid exactly what musk is doing which is try to find some tiny little false thing and then say whoops i get

false massively damaging to the company twitter has a strong case against musk say experts the merger agreement includes what s known as a specific performance clause which says twitter can take musk to court to force him to go through with the purchase as long as he still has financing in place while that may sound risky and costly for twitter lipton says the company s case would be very strong and its board has compelling incentives to see the sale through investors are expecting to receive 54 20 a piece for their shares the board s view according to a person familiar with the deal talks is that the sale agreement with musk is the most valuable part of twitter right now they would much rather have the 54 20 without a court fight but it s worth fighting over lipton said given the company s current share price 54 20 seems like an unbelievable deal for twitter so there is a lot that they could sacrifice that would still make it worth it in the end if they got to force musk to close musk might try to get twitter at a discount still some wall street analysts say twitter s board and management should be open to accepting a lower price to avoid a lengthy legal battle there s no chance it s getting done at 54 20 said angelo zino analyst at cfra research you re either going to see a 15 to 20 drop in the offer price to get elon musk engaged again or he continues to play the bot card

by barbara ortutay tom krisher and matt o brien associated press elon musk announced friday that he will abandon his tumultuous 44 billion offer to buy twitter after the company failed to provide enough information about the number of fake accounts twitter immediately fired back saying it would sue the tesla ceo to uphold the deal the likely unraveling of the acquisition was just the latest twist in a saga between the world s richest man and one of the most influential social media platforms and it may portend a titanic legal battle ahead twitter could have pushed for a 1 billion breakup fee that musk agreed to pay under these circumstances instead it looks ready to fight to complete the purchase which the company s board has approved and ceo parag agrawal has insisted he wants to consummate in a letter to twitter s board musk lawyer mike ringler complained that his client had for nearly two months sought data to judge the prevalence of fake or spam accounts on the social media platform twitter has failed or refused to provide this information sometimes twitter has ignored mr musk s requests sometimes it has rejected them for reasons that appear to be unjustified and sometimes it has claimed to comply while giving mr musk incomplete or unusable information the letter said musk also said the information is fundamental to twitter s business and financial performance and is needed to finish the merger in response the chair of twitter s board bret taylor tweeted that the board is committed to closing the transaction on the price and terms agreed upon with musk and plans to pursue legal action to enforce the merger agreement we are confident we will prevail in the delaware court of chancery the trial court in delaware frequently handles business disputes among the many corporations including twitter that are incorporated there former president donald trump weighed in on his own social platform truth social the twitter deal is dead long live the truth musk said in may that he would allow trump who was banned from twitter following the jan 6 2021 riot at the u s capitol back onto the platform much of the drama surrounding the deal has played out on twitter with musk who has more than 100 million followers lamenting that the company was failing to live up to its potential as a platform for free speech on friday shares of twitter fell 5 to 36 81 well below the 54 20 that musk agreed to pay shares of tesla meanwhile climbed 2 5 to 752 29 after the market closed and musk s letter was published twitter s stock continued to decline while tesla climbed higher this is a disaster scenario for twitter and its board wedbush analyst dan ives wrote in a note to investors he predicted a long court fight by twitter to either restore the deal or get the 1 billion breakup fee on thursday twitter sought to shed more light on how it counts spam accounts in a briefing with journalists and company executives twitter said it removes 1 million spam accounts each day the accounts represent well below 5 of its active user base each quarter to calculate how many accounts are malicious spam twitter said it reviews thousands of accounts sampled at random using both public and private data such as ip addresses phone numbers location and account behavior when active to determine whether an account is real last month twitter offered musk access to its fire hose of raw data on hundreds of millions of daily tweets according to multiple reports at the time though neither the company nor musk confirmed that one of the chief reasons musk gave for his interest in taking twitter private was his belief he could add value to the business by getting rid of its spam bots the same problem that he s now citing as a reason to end the deal this whole process has been bizarre said christopher bouzy founder of research firm bot sentinel which tracks fake twitter accounts used for disinformation or harassment he knew about this problem it s odd that he would use bots and trolls and inauthentic accounts as a way of getting out of the deal on the other hand bouzy said the letter from musk s legal team makes some valid critiques of twitter s lack of transparency including its apparent refusal to provide musk with the same level of internal data it offers some of its big customers it just seems as if they re hiding something said bouzy who also believes the number of fake or spam twitter accounts is higher than what the company has reported musk s lawyer also alleged that twitter broke the agreement when it fired two top managers and laid off a third of its talent acquisition team the sale agreement he wrote required twitter to seek and obtain consent if it deviated from conducting normal business twitter was required to preserve substantially intact the material components of its current business organization the letter said musk s flirtation with buying twitter appeared to begin in late march that s when twitter said he contacted members of its board including co founder jack dorsey and told them he was buying up shares of the company and was interested in either joining the board taking twitter private or starting a competitor then on april 4 he revealed in a regulatory filing that he had became the company s largest shareholder after acquiring a 9 stake worth about 3 billion at first twitter offered musk a seat on its board but six days later agrawal tweeted that musk would not be joining the board after all his bid to buy the company came together quickly after that when musk agreed to buy twitter for 54 20 per share he inserted a 420 marijuana reference into his price he sold roughly 8 5 billion worth of shares in tesla to help fund the purchase then strengthened his commitments of more than 7 billion from a diverse group of investors including silicon valley heavy hitters like oracle co founder larry ellison inside twitter musk s offer was met with confusion and falling morale especially after musk publicly criticized one of twitter s top lawyers involved in content moderation decisions groups opposing the takeover from the outset including those advocating for women minorities and lgbtq people cheered friday s news despite what musk may claim this deal isn t ending because of twitter bots or spam accounts this deal is collapsing because of elon musk s own erratic behavior embrace of extremists and bad business decisions said angelo carusone president of media matters a left leaning nonprofit watchdog group that s been critical of musk s twitter bid musk he said made it clear that he would roll back twitters community standards and safety guidelines which would turn the platform into a fever swamp of dangerous conspiracy theories partisan chicanery and white supremacist radicalization
tesla shares get baby bump as elon musk tries to pull out of twitter deal tesla shares received an upwards bump in after hours trading friday as investors reacted positively to elon musk s move to terminate his 44 billion deal to buy twitter tesla shares rose 14 51 to close at 752 29 on friday the share price continued to edge higher after regular trading hours by as much as 3 39 before settling to about a 2 68 increase as of 7 48 pm et musk s legal team issued a letter friday formally attempting to pull out of an agreement to acquire twitter the letter came after musk publicly attacked twitter via twitter no less over the social media company s bot calculations prompting speculation that he would try to exit the deal the letter said musk was terminating the deal because twitter is in material breach of multiple provisions of its merger agreement and also argued that the company appears to have made false and misleading representations that he had relied on tesla shareholders have publicly expressed concern about musk s ability to effectively run tesla while owning twitter along with his handful of other companies that include spacex neuralink and the boring company their cries became progressively louder as tesla s shares continued their downward trajectory in early april when musk took a 9 2 stake in twitter becoming the social media company s biggest shareholder tesla shares were priced at 1 145 45 the share price has since fallen more than 34 one of the bigger drops in the past several months came april 26 a day after musk agreed to buy twitter for 44 billion tesla stock tanked more than 12 bringing its market capitalization down to 906 billion twitter shares which initially rose in early april after musk disclosed his stake in the company have also fallen since april 4 twitter shares have dropped 26 34 pushing its market capitalization to 28 31 billion today s share price of 36 81 is far below musk s cash offer for twitter that valued the business at 54 20 per share while tesla shareholders may have enjoyed a momentary sense of relief the twitter musk saga is hardly over twitter s board has already promised to fight musk bret taylor chairman of the twitter board tweeted friday we re committed to closing the transaction on the price and terms agreed upon with mr musk and plans to pursue legal action to enforce the merger agreement we are confident we will prevail in the delaware court of chancery
by lewis krauskopf new york reuters with a miserable first half for the stock market now in the history books investors are assessing whether the u s economy can avoid a significant downturn as the federal reserve raises rates to fight the worst inflation in decades the answer to that question stands to have a direct impact on markets strategists say an economic slump coupled with weak corporate earnings could push the s p 500 lower by at least another 10 compounding losses that have already pushed the benchmark index down 18 year to date conversely in a scenario that includes solid profit increases and moderating inflation stocks could bounce to around where they started the year according to some analysts price targets for now investors are anticipating that we are seeing a slowdown said lindsey bell chief markets and money strategist at ally the big question is how deep is this slowdown going to be the case for an imminent economic downturn took a hit on friday after a labor department report showed employers hired far more workers than expected in june giving the fed ammunition to deliver another 75 basis point interest rate hike this month the june employment report indicates that the economy is neither on the cusp of a recession much less already in one nor in an overheated state oxford economics said in a note it predicted more market volatility amid heightened speculation over what the fed will do more key information on the course of the economy is expected later this month as second quarter earnings reports flood in over the next few weeks and investors parse fresh data including wednesday s closely watched consumer prices report for june though the fed has said it is confident in achieving a so called soft landing by bringing down inflation without upsetting the economy some investors believe this year s steep stock declines suggest a degree of economic slowdown is already baked in to asset prices the s p 500 for instance has fallen as low as 23 6 from its january record high this year in line with the 24 median decline the index has registered in past recessions indicating that at least some of the challenging environment is reflected in stock prices keith lerner co chief investment officer at truist advisory services said in a report recessions are officially called in hindsight with the national bureau of economic research declaring one when there has been a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and lasts more than a few months competing scenarios forecasts vary for how rocky the economy can get a note outlining various economic scenarios from ubs global wealth management said the s p 500 could fall to 3 300 some 31 from its january high if an economic slump leads to a steep drop in corporate earnings as well as in the case of stagflation which typically involves a cocktail of persistently high inflation combined with slow growth the bank s analysts gave a 30 chance for the slump scenario and pegged the chances of stagflation at 20 a soft landing scenario is their most likely outcome however and would include the s p 500 finishing the year at 3 900 right around where it closed on friday such a scenario to which ubs assigned a 40 weighting depends on investors believing that inflation is under control and earnings can remain resilient despite tighter financial conditions they said in a recent note outlining the increasing likelihood of a stagflationary environment strategists at bofa global research recommended investors combine areas of the stock market that would benefit from inflation such as energy with defensive sectors like healthcare wells fargo investment institute strategists meanwhile earlier this week called for a moderate u s recession and lowered their year end s p 500 target to a range of 3 800 4 000 some investors hold a more optimistic view of the economy and believe stocks could head higher from current levels citi s strategists weighted a soft landing scenario at 55 although they also saw a 40 chance of a mild recession and a 5 chance of a severe one their year end s p target is 4 200 john stoltzfus chief investment strategist at oppenheimer asset management this week lowered his s p 500 price target to 4 800 from 5 330 that he had initiated in december with the new level still 23 above where the index closed on friday he expects consumer demand business investment and government spending to support growth it s a resilient economy stoltzfus said reporting by lewis krauskopf in new york editing by ira iosebashvili and matthew lewis

updated july 10 2022 at 5 32 pm et elon musk wants to break off his agreement to buy twitter in a letter to the company filed friday with the securities and exchange commission musk accuses twitter of making false and misleading representations about the prevalence of fake accounts on its platform he says the company has not complied with its obligations to share data and information that he says he needs to evaluate its business sometimes twitter has ignored mr musk s requests sometimes it has rejected them for reasons that appear to be unjustified and sometimes it has claimed to comply while giving mr musk incomplete or unusable information musk s lawyer mike ringler wrote legal experts say this may not be sufficient grounds to break off the 44 billion deal without musk being on the hook for a hefty fine in response to musk s letter the chair of twitter s board said it planned to sue the twitter board is committed to closing the transaction on the price and terms agreed upon with mr musk and plans to pursue legal action to enforce the merger agreement we are confident we will prevail in the delaware court of chancery said bret taylor in a tweet referring to a delaware court that handles corporate disputes the billionaire ceo of tesla and space x struck a deal to buy the social media company back in april but almost immediately he started hinting and then saying outright that he had cold feet in may he declared the purchase was on hold while he looked into twitter s accounting of how many users are not real people but automated bots or spam soon after twitter agreed to give him access to its firehose a real time stream of more than 500 million tweets posted every day since then the two sides have been sharing information and working to close the transaction on thursday the washington post reported the deal was in jeopardy because musk doubts that twitter s spam figures are verifiable his team was expected to take potentially drastic action the post reported bots may not be the only factor in musk s change of heart while his offer of 54 20 a share was initially seen as a lowball price for twitter given that it was trading above 70 last year tech stocks and the market as a whole have fallen sharply since he struck the deal as of the closing bell on friday twitter shares were trading around 37 down nearly 30 from the day musk s purchase was announced in may musk even said he might seek to negotiate a lower price on thursday twitter had pointed to a statement the company issued in june saying it has and will continue to cooperatively share information with musk and that we intend to close the transaction and enforce the merger agreement at the agreed price and terms the company was expecting to hold a shareholder vote on the deal by mid august musk signed a merger agreement the two sides signed a legal agreement that musk would buy twitter for 54 20 a share if either side broke off the deal they could be on the hook to pay a 1 billion fee to the other party in his letter on friday musk cites twitter s alleged refusal to turn over more information about bots as grounds to abandon the deal but legal experts say that would be an uphill battle for years twitter has publicly said it estimates less than 5 of daily users who see ads are spam or bots but has also cautioned the number could be higher musk disputes this saying he believes as many as 20 of accounts may be fake while twitter gave musk access to its firehose of public data it told reporters this week its spam estimates are also based on private data such as users ip addresses phone numbers locations and behavior and are therefore difficult for outsiders to verify even if twitter s 5 figure is incorrect that still might not be enough to let musk back out or change the terms of the deal without paying a hefty price merger agreements are drafted to avoid exactly what musk is doing which is try to find some tiny little false thing and then say whoops i get to walk away now said ann lipton a business law professor at tulane university law school they specifically say things like you can t back out unless it s not just false but incredibly false hugely false massively damaging to the company twitter has a strong case against musk say experts the merger agreement includes what s known as a specific performance clause which says twitter can take musk to court to force him to go through with the purchase as long as he still has financing in place while that may sound risky and costly for twitter lipton says the company s case would be very strong and its board has compelling incentives to see the sale through investors are expecting to receive 54 20 a piece for their shares the board s view according to a person familiar with the deal talks is that the sale agreement with musk is the most valuable part of twitter right now they would much rather have the 54 20 without a court fight but it s worth fighting over lipton said given the company s current share price 54 20 seems like an unbelievable deal for twitter so there is a lot that they could sacrifice that would still make it worth it in the end if they got to force musk to close musk might try to get twitter at a discount still some wall street analysts say twitter s board and management should be open to accepting a lower price to avoid a lengthy legal battle there s no chance it s getting done at 54 20 said angelo zino analyst at cfra research you re either going to see a 15 to 20 drop in the offer price to get elon musk engaged again or he continues to play the bot card taking musk to court could be even more damaging to twitter at a time when uncertainty over the deal and what the billionaire s ownership might mean are weighing heavily on the company morale is already low and some employees are leaving ceo parag agrawal has shaken up his executive ranks and announced a hiring freeze and spending cuts going to court doesn t bode well for the business prospects of your company and it further adds uncertainty to the employee base zino said that s also a risk for musk lipton said what if he has to buy the company and now he s kind of undermined it at the same time ultimately she said the billionaire s antics however chaotic appear to have a single goal i don t think he s committed to winning i think he s committing to not spending 44 billion on

photo credit alamy stock photo photo credit ppa shutterstock in the heated residential real estate market of the last two years one factor contributing to fierce competition and rising prices has been real estate investors while many prospective homebuyers were drawn into the market with historically low interest rates and strong savings and investment returns they have frequently found themselves outbid by corporate landlords and investment firms these firms have the wherewithal to pay cash for homes and greater ability to absorb risk when purchasing properties than individual buyers institutional investors purchased a record 18 4 of all u s homes sold in the last quarter of 2021 up from 12 6 in the last quarter of 2020 while real estate investment has reached new heights over the last year the number of homes purchased by investors has grown steadily since the collapse of the housing bubble and great recession in the mid 2000s between appreciation in home values and steady income from rents residential real estate has proven to be an attractive asset class for major investors advertisement article continues below this ad these attributes can also make real estate a desirable investment for individual investors and small landlords especially those who have cash to make a purchase but for investors who require a mortgage loan to buy a rental property financing can be more difficult to come by qualifying for a mortgage on an investment property is more difficult than for a principal residence which is one reason why a majority of rental purchases are made with cash while the typical property value for an investment purchase is lower than for a principal residence lenders typically require larger down payments and lower debt to income ratios and command higher interest rates on the loan in 2020 the mortgage for an investment property had a median down payment of 60 000 and a median interest rate of 4 0 compared to 50 000 and 3 1 for a residence even

offer to buy twitter after the company failed to provide enough information about the number of fake accounts twitter immediately fired back saying it would sue the tesla ceo to uphold the deal the likely unraveling of the acquisition was just the latest twist in a saga between the world s richest man and one of the most influential social media platforms and it may portend a titanic legal

to pay shares of tesla meanwhile climbed 2 5 to 752 29 after the market closed and musk s letter was published twitter s stock continued to decline while tesla climbed higher this is a disaster scenario for twitter and its board wedbush analyst dan ives wrote in a note to investors he predicted a long court fight by twitter to either restore the deal or get the 1 billion breakup fee on thursday twitter sought to shed more light on how it counts spam accounts in a briefing with journalists and company executives twitter said it removes 1 million spam accounts each day the accounts represent well below 5 of its active user base each quarter to calculate how many accounts are malicious spam twitter said it reviews thousands of accounts sampled at random using both public and private data such as ip addresses phone numbers location and account behavior when active to determine whether an account is real last month twitter offered musk access to its fire hose of raw data on hundreds of millions of daily tweets according to multiple reports at the time though neither the company nor musk confirmed that one of the chief reasons musk gave for his interest in taking twitter private was his belief he could add value to the business by getting rid of its spam bots the same problem that he s now citing as a reason to end the deal this whole process has been bizarre said christopher bouzy founder of research firm bot sentinel which tracks fake twitter accounts used for disinformation or harassment he knew about this problem it s odd that he would use bots and trolls and inauthentic accounts as a way of getting out of the deal on the other hand bouzy said the letter from musk s legal team makes some valid critiques of twitter s lack of transparency including its apparent refusal to provide musk with the same level of internal data it offers some of its big customers it just seems as if they re hiding something said bouzy who also believes the number of fake or spam twitter accounts is higher than what the company has reported musk s lawyer also alleged that twitter broke the agreement when it fired two top managers and laid off a third of its talent acquisition team the sale agreement he wrote required twitter to seek and obtain consent if it deviated from conducting normal business twitter was required to preserve substantially intact the material components of its current business organization the letter said musk s flirtation with buying twitter appeared to begin in late march that s when twitter said he contacted members of its board including co founder jack dorsey and told them he was buying up shares of the company and was interested in either joining the board taking twitter private or starting a competitor then on april 4 he revealed in a regulatory filing that he had became the company s largest shareholder after acquiring a 9 stake worth about 3 billion at first twitter offered musk a seat on its board but six days later agrawal tweeted that musk would not be joining the board after all his bid to buy the company came together quickly after that winnipeg free press newsletter business weekly monday mornings the latest local business news and a lookahead to the coming week sign up i agree to the terms and conditions cookie and privacy policies and casl agreement when musk agreed to buy twitter for 54 20 per share he inserted a 420 marijuana reference into his price he sold roughly 8 5 billion worth of shares in tesla to help fund the purchase then strengthened his commitments of more than 7 billion from a diverse group of investors including silicon valley heavy hitters like oracle co founder larry ellison inside twitter musk s offer was met with confusion and falling morale especially after musk publicly criticized one of twitter s top lawyers involved in content moderation decisions groups opposing the takeover from the outset including those advocating for women minorities and lgbtq people cheered friday s news despite what musk may claim this deal isn t ending because of twitter bots or spam accounts this deal is collapsing because of elon musk s own erratic behavior embrace of extremists and bad business decisions said angelo carusone president of media matters a left leaning nonprofit watchdog group that s been critical of musk s twitter bid musk he said made it clear that he would roll back twitters community standards and safety guidelines which would turn the platform into a fever swamp of dangerous conspiracy theories partisan chicanery and white supremacist radicalization
by lewis krauskopf new york reuters with a miserable first half for the stock market now in the history books investors are assessing whether the u s economy can avoid a significant downturn as the federal reserve raises rates to fight the worst inflation in decades the answer to that question stands to have a direct impact on markets strategists say an economic slump coupled with weak corporate earnings could push the s p 500 lower by at least another 10 compounding losses that have already pushed the benchmark index down 18 year to date conversely in a scenario that includes solid profit increases and moderating inflation stocks could bounce to around where they started the year according to some analysts price targets for now investors are anticipating that we are seeing a slowdown said lindsey bell chief markets and money strategist at ally the big question is how deep is this slowdown going to be the case for an imminent economic downturn took a hit on friday after a labor department report showed employers hired far more workers than expected in june giving the fed ammunition to deliver another 75 basis point interest rate hike this month the june employment report indicates that the economy is neither on the cusp of a recession much less already in one nor in an overheated state oxford economics said in a note it predicted more market volatility amid heightened speculation over what the fed will do more key information on the course of the economy is expected later this month as second quarter earnings reports flood in over the next few weeks and investors parse fresh data including wednesday s closely watched consumer prices report for june though the fed has said it is confident in achieving a so called soft landing by bringing down inflation without upsetting the economy some investors believe this year s steep stock declines suggest a degree of economic slowdown is already baked in to asset prices the s p 500 for instance has fallen as low as 23 6 from its january record high this year in line with the 24 median decline the index has registered in past recessions indicating that at least some of the challenging environment is reflected in stock prices keith lerner co chief investment officer at truist advisory services said in a report recessions are officially called in hindsight with the national bureau of economic research declaring one when there has been a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and lasts more than a few months competing scenarios forecasts vary for how rocky the economy can get a note outlining various economic scenarios from ubs global wealth management said the s p 500 could fall to 3 300 some 31 from its january high if an economic slump leads to a steep drop in corporate earnings as well as in the case of stagflation which typically involves a cocktail of persistently high inflation combined with slow growth the bank s analysts gave a 30 chance for the slump scenario and pegged the chances of stagflation at 20 a soft landing scenario is their most likely outcome however and would include the s p 500 finishing the year at 3 900 right around where it closed on friday such a scenario to which ubs assigned a 40 weighting depends on investors believing that inflation is under control and earnings can remain resilient despite tighter financial conditions they said in a recent note outlining the increasing likelihood of a stagflationary environment strategists at bofa global research recommended investors combine areas of the stock market that would benefit from inflation such as energy with defensive sectors like healthcare wells fargo investment institute strategists meanwhile earlier this week called for a moderate u s recession and lowered their year end s p 500 target to a range of 3 800 4 000 some investors hold a more optimistic view of the economy and believe stocks could head higher from current levels citi s strategists weighted a soft landing scenario at 55 although they also saw a 40 chance of a mild recession and a 5 chance of a severe one their year end s p target is 4 200 john stoltzfus chief investment strategist at oppenheimer asset management this week lowered his s p 500 price target to 4 800 from 5 330 that he had initiated in december with the new level still 23 above where the index closed on friday he expects consumer demand business investment and government spending to support growth it s a resilient economy stoltzfus said reporting by lewis krauskopf in new york editing by ira iosebashvili and matthew lewis
elon musk may have changed his mind about paying 44 billion for twitter but it s not so easy to walk away the billionaire ceo of tesla and space x struck a deal to buy the social media company back in april but almost immediately he started hinting and then saying outright that he had cold feet in may he declared the purchase was on hold while he looked into twitter s accounting of how many users are not real people but automated bots or spam soon after twitter agreed to give him access to its firehose a real time stream of more than 500 million tweets posted every day since then the two sides have been sharing information and working to close the transaction on thursday the washington postreported the deal is in jeopardy because musk doubts that twitter s spam figures are verifiable his team is expected to take potentially drastic action the post reported though its sources did not elaborate what that action might be bots may not be the only factor in musk s apparent change of heart while his offer of 54 20 a share was initially seen as a lowball price for twitter given that it was trading above 70 last year tech stocks and the market as a whole have fallen sharply since he struck the deal twitter shares are now trading around 37 down nearly 30 from the day musk s purchase was announced he s even said he might seek to negotiate a lower price but escalating his fight could be costly for musk and the battle would almost certainly wind up in a delaware courtroom that handles corporate disputes musk and his representatives did not respond to requests for comment twitter spokesman brian poliakoff declined to comment he pointed to a statement the company issued in june saying it is has and will continue to cooperatively share information with musk and that we intend to close the transaction and enforce the merger agreement at the agreed price and terms the company expects to hold a shareholder vote on the deal by mid august so what are musk s and twitter s options musk signed a merger agreement the two sides have signed a legal agreement that musk will buy twitter for 54 20 a share if either side breaks off the deal they could be on the hook to pay a 1 billion fee to the other party by raising concerns over bots on twitter musk may be trying to lay the groundwork to get out of paying that fee but legal experts say that would be an uphill battle for years twitter has publicly said it estimates less than 5 of daily users who see ads are spam or bots but has also cautioned the number could be higher musk disputes this saying he believes as many as 20 of accounts may be fake while twitter gave musk access to its firehose of public data it told reporters this week its spam estimates are also based on private data such as users ip addresses phone numbers locations and behavior and are therefore difficult for outsiders to verify even if twitter s 5 figure is incorrect that still might not be enough to let musk back out or change the terms of the deal without paying a hefty price merger agreements are drafted to avoid exactly what musk is doing which is try to find some tiny little false thing and then say whoops i get to walk away now said ann lipton a business law professor at tulane university law school they specifically say things like you can t back out unless it s not just false but incredibly false hugely false massively damaging to the company twitter could take musk to court if musk went ahead and terminated the deal anyway twitter would likely sue him for a lot more than the 1 billion breakup fee the merger agreement includes what s known as a specific performance clause which says twitter can take musk to court to force him to go through with the purchase as long as he still has financing in place while that may sound risky and costly for twitter lipton says the company s case would be very strong and its board has a strong incentive to see the sale through shareholders are expecting to receive 54 20 a piece for their shares the board s view according to a person familiar with the deal talks is that the sale agreement with musk is the most valuable part of twitter right now they would much rather have the 54 20 without a court fight but it s worth fighting over lipton said given the company s current share price 54 20 seems like an unbelievable deal for twitter so there is a lot that they could sacrifice that would still make it worth it in the end if they got to force musk to close musk might try to get twitter at a discount still some wall street analysts say twitter s board and management should be open to accepting a lower price to avoid a lengthy legal battle there s no chance it s getting done at 54 20 said angelo zino analyst at cfra research you re either going to see a 15 to 20 drop in the offer price to get elon musk engaged again or he continues to play the bot card taking musk to court could be even more damaging to twitter at a time when uncertainty over the deal and what the billionaire s ownership might mean are weighing heavily on the company morale is already low and some employees are leaving ceo parag agrawal has shaken up his executive ranks and announced a hiring freeze and spending cuts going to court doesn t bode well for the business prospects of your company and it further adds uncertainty to the employee base zino said that s also a risk for musk lipton said what if he has to buy the company and now he s kind of undermined it at the same time ultimately she said the billionaire s antics however chaotic appear to have a single goal i don t think he s committed to winning i think he s committing to not spending 44 billion on twitter copyright 2022 npr to see more visit
wall street digested another positive jobs report without related gains as the good news for employment likely means the federal reserve will remain aggressive on interest rates manhattan cn fears of a recession were kept at bay this week as another jobs report showing better than expected employment gains helped u s markets pull out a winning week to kick off the second half of 2022 the week s gains were mild on wall street with the dow jones industrial average increasing just 242 points for the week the s p 500 rising 74 points and the nasdaq netting 508 points on friday the u s bureau of labor statistics noted the economy added 372 000 jobs last month all of it from the private sector and well above the 250 000 jobs many analysts had predicted wage growth also increased only 0 3 in june for a total 5 1 increase annually thus far the third month growth increases have shrunk due to june s job increases the three month average starting in march is at 374 000 jobs gained per month the gains were pretty consistent among sectors though the leisure and hospitality sector still remains 1 3 million jobs below the sector s pre pandemic high wall street had a muted reaction to the report with markets teetering slightly positive and negative throughout the day as investors consider whether it means the federal reserve will continue to aggressively raise interest rates bond yields again increased sharply friday morning with the 10 year treasury settling at nearly 3 1 by the end of trading analysts however cheered the report as a splash of cold water to all the recent recession talk the strong jobs report appears to make a mockery of claims the economy is heading into let alone already in a recession said andrew hunter senior u s economist at capital economics overall today s report simply means the fed still has more work to do with regards to policy rates said charlie ripley senior investment strategist at allianz investment management ultimately what matters here for investors is not how quickly the fed hikes rates but how high they have to go in order to slow the economy there were some soft points in the jobs report though the last two jobs reports were revised downward by 74 000 jobs and the labor participation rate fell 0 1 to hit 62 2 with the employment to population ratio is down to 59 9 however the 3 6 unemployment rate is at a record low giving analysts some hope despite the setback in labor force participation we believe conditions for a continued rebound in the labor supply remain in place with rising wages and inflation likely to push more sidelined workers to re joining the labor force in coming months wrote oxford economics analyst lydia boussour in an investor s note experts are now leaning toward the fed keeping its foot on the gas pedal when it comes to interest rate hikes with some even pointing out the recently released meeting minutes mentioned inflation about 90 times while not mentioning the word recession at all however just how much pressure the fed puts on the gas pedal is up for debate the consensus seems to be at least a 0 5 interest rate hike but some think a 0 75 rate hike is in the works after it already did so for the first time in nearly 30 years during its june meeting the current interest rate for the overnight federal funds rate is at 1 5 to 1 75 some think the fed is determined to increase interest rates by 75 basis points during its next meeting the strong number not only keeps the focus on 75bps in july which now seems a done deal but also means we could see a similar move of 75bps in september especially if we get a strong number next week michael hewson at cmc markets wrote in an investor s note based on the last meeting s minutes during which all but one participant supported a rate hike of 75 basis points the fed certainly seems ready to keep the 0 75 rate hikes coming indeed the minutes noted that recent inflation data point to a considerable probability of 7 basis point moves at both the june and july meetings however the minutes also hint the fed may pause its interest rate hikes later this year participants noted that with the federal funds rate expected to be near or above estimates of its longer run level later this year the committee would then be well positioned to determine the appropriate pace of further policy firming and the extent to which economic developments warranted policy adjustments the minutes read the path forward may be additional 50 basis point increases during the fed s fall meetings with a possible 25 basis point hike at its last meeting for the year the fed meets again from july 26 to 27

elon musk late friday proved that it s a mistake to think of him as unpredictable in a move that everyone from investors to casual observers has been predicting for many weeks he formally bailed out of his 44 billion deal to buy twitter musk s stated rationale for abandoning the deal as set forth in a letter from his lawyers to twitter makes no sense it s all based on his purported supposition that the condition of twitter s business is worse than the company has let on but he presents no evidence to support his claims the word appears is forced to carry the major burden of his assertions twitter he says in the letter appears to have made false and misleading representations somehow designed to coax him into signing a merger agreement on april 25 the merger agreement he contends appears to contain materially inaccurate representations advertisement merger agreements are designed to prevent exactly what musk is doing now tulane business professor ann lipton in may on the issue that he began pressing starting in mid may as grounds to either renegotiate or abandon the deal the proportion of twitter accounts that are fake spam or automated bots musk s friday missive says it appears that twitter is dramatically understating the proportion of spam and false accounts represented in its count of daily active users he says twitter s contention that it stops counting fake or spam users once it determines that the users are fakes appears to be false newsletter get the latest from michael hiltzik commentary on economics and more from a pulitzer prize winner enter email address sign me up you may occasionally receive promotional content from the los angeles times he also asserts that twitter s process for calculating its user numbers appears to be arbitrary and ad hoc musk has made an issue of twitter s disclosures over many years that the proportion of fake accounts included in its user statistics is 5 or less his letter says he has been caused to strongly believe that the proportion of false and spam accounts included in the reported count is wildly higher than 5 to back this up however he cites no evidence advertisement over the last two months musk s behavior has made it plain that he would prefer to be out of this deal even though the merger contract he signed left him only the narrowest options to do so he explicitly opted not to perform due diligence on twitter s books before signing the deal but subsequently demanded information about twitter s inner workings even though the term due diligence generally refers to scrutiny a prospective buyer performs before signing a deal not afterward under the terms of the merger agreement either party that bails out of the deal would be subject to a 1 billion penalty payment though twitter could also demand that musk complete the deal on the signed terms the twitter board said friday that it s prepared to sue musk to complete the deal we are confident we will prevail in the delaware court of chancery the board said what has happened to sour musk on buying twitter there are several possibilities one thought is that he was never serious to begin with but hubris led him to convert a public musing about buying one of the world s leading social media platforms into a real transaction then there s the possibility that he came to realize that managing a platform that attracts obstreperous users and an enormous amount of public attention would be an enormous pain in the backside a likely factor if not the major factor is that the value of technology companies has plummeted since april that includes twitter itself and tesla the electric car company that represents most of musk s wealth through his ownership of its shares he initially pledged many of those shares as collateral on financing for the twitter deal advertisement since april 25 through friday s trading twitter shares have lost about 30 of their value they never came close to the 54 20 per share he agreed to pay the figure may very well be a marijuana related joke don t ask tesla shares fell about 25 in the same time frame and as of friday s close were about 38 below their peak price of 1 208 59 reached on nov 1 amid the stock downturns musk announced may 13 that the deal was temporarily on hold because of his doubts about fake accounts experts were doubtful from the start of his pettifogging that he had reasonable grounds to bail out for starters there s no such thing in mergers as one side placing a deal temporarily on hold twitter for its part said then that work on closing the deal was proceeding normally merger agreements are designed to prevent exactly what musk is doing now tulane business professor ann m lipton wrote on twitter after musk s may announcement have a buyer get cold feet and then nitpick to find some arguably false rep that they can use as a pretext to avoid their obligations a material adverse change in a company s business is a common escape clause but lipton observed that it s a very high standard that has been met once in the history of the delaware business court with jurisdiction over this deal there s no evidence that it exists here due to spam on twitter s platform musk again didn t provide any evidence on friday the only question today is whether musk can extricate himself or more precisely at what price barring a settlement this whole deal looks like it s destined to turn into one of the business world s longest running courtroom dramas advertisement it may look fascinating at this moment but be warned it s almost certain to become very tiresome very soon if you haven t already wearied of musk s clownishness you will eventually that s a sure bet

making false and misleading representations about the prevalence of fake accounts on its platform he says the company has not complied with its obligations to share data and information that he says he needs to evaluate its business sometimes twitter has ignored mr musk s requests sometimes it has rejected them for reasons that appear to be unjustified and sometimes it has claimed to comply while

he had cold feet in may he declared the purchase was on hold while he looked into twitter s accounting of how many users are not real people but automated bots or spam soon after twitter agreed to give him access to its firehose a real time stream of more than 500 million tweets posted every day since then the two sides have been sharing information and working to close the transaction on thursday the washington post reported the deal was in jeopardy because musk doubts that twitter s spam figures are verifiable his team was expected to take potentially drastic action the post reported bots may not be the only factor in musk s change of heart while his offer of 54 20 a share was initially seen as a lowball price for twitter given that it was trading above 70 last year tech stocks and the market as a whole have fallen sharply since he struck the deal as of the closing bell on friday twitter shares were trading around 37 down nearly 30 from the day musk s purchase was announced in may musk even said he might seek to negotiate a lower price on thursday twitter had pointed to a statement the company issued in june saying it has and will continue to cooperatively share information with musk and that we intend to close the transaction and enforce the merger agreement at the agreed price and terms the company was expecting to hold a shareholder vote on the deal by mid august musk signed a merger agreement the two sides signed a legal agreement that musk would buy twitter for 54 20 a share if either side broke off the deal they could be on the hook to pay a 1 billion fee to the other party in his letter on friday musk cites twitter s alleged refusal to turn over more information about bots as grounds to abandon the deal but legal experts say that would be an uphill battle for years twitter has publicly said it estimates less than 5 of daily users who see ads are spam or bots but has also cautioned the number could be higher musk disputes this saying he believes as many as 20 of accounts may be fake while twitter gave musk access to its firehose of public data it told reporters this week its spam estimates are also based on private data such as users ip addresses phone numbers locations and behavior and are therefore difficult for outsiders to verify even if twitter s 5 figure is incorrect that still might not be enough to let musk back out or change the terms of the deal without paying a hefty price merger agreements are drafted to avoid exactly what musk is doing which is try to find some tiny little false thing and then say whoops i get to walk away now said ann lipton a business law professor at tulane university law school they specifically say things like you can t back out unless it s not just false but incredibly false hugely false massively damaging to the company twitter has a strong case against musk say experts the merger agreement includes what s known as a specific performance clause which says twitter can take musk to court to force him to go through with the purchase as long as he still has financing in place while that may sound risky and costly for twitter lipton says the company s case would be very strong and its board has compelling incentives to see the sale through investors are expecting to receive 54 20 a piece for their shares the board s view according to a person familiar with the deal talks is that the sale agreement with musk is the most valuable part of twitter right now they would much rather have the 54 20 without a court fight but it s worth fighting over lipton said given the company s current share price 54 20 seems like an unbelievable deal for twitter so there is a lot that they could sacrifice that would still make it worth it in the end if they got to force musk to close musk might try to get twitter at a discount still some wall street analysts say twitter s board and management should be open to accepting a lower price to avoid a lengthy legal battle there s no chance it s getting done at 54 20 said angelo zino analyst at cfra research you re either going to see a 15 to 20 drop in the offer price to get elon musk engaged again or he continues to play the bot card taking musk to court could be even more damaging to twitter at a time when uncertainty over the deal and what the billionaire s ownership might mean are weighing heavily on the company morale is already low and some employees are leaving ceo parag agrawal has shaken up his executive ranks and announced a hiring freeze and spending cuts going to court doesn t bode well for the business prospects of your company and it further adds uncertainty to the employee base zino said that s also a risk for musk lipton said what if he has to buy the company and now he s kind of undermined it at the same time ultimately she said the billionaire s antics however chaotic appear to have a single goal i don t think he s committed to winning i think he s committing to not spending 44 billion on

all things considered most of us would like the stock market to go up that s not how it works though the stock market goes up it goes down it goes up again but over a long period of time for like the last century it generally goes up sponsored how generative ai will improve legal service delivery learn how emerging tools will likely change and enhance the work of lawyers for years to come in this new report there s no reason to think that the general historical trend of the stock market going up over time won t hold we are in a really tough place to hold the line on that long term thinking though the first six months of 2022 were the worst first half of a year for the stock market since 1970 the s p 500 dropped about 21 percent from its peak in january the nasdaq has had its largest percentage drop since its inception it has not been a good time for investors overall the s p 500 has shed 8 2 trillion since the start of 2022 that is a lot of money to have evaporate analysts blame a number of factors for the precipitous decline of the stock market inflation is surging and consequently the federal reserve is raising interest rates covid 19 continues to disrupt economic activity in china where new lockdowns are still being instituted with some frequency supply chains have yet to untangle themselves and of course russia s invasion of ukraine has thrown a big geopolitical wrench into the gears of the global economy there are some signs of hope however for one thing there is not meaningful data to imply that the stock market s performance in the first half of a year really means much of anything at all in 1970 for example that last year when stocks tanked for the whole first half of the year by about 21 percent the stock market rebounded to gain 27 percent in the second half of the year a similar rebound certainly isn t guaranteed in 2022 but there is some historical precedent july has already seen some modest growth in the stock market job numbers remain robust the u s trade deficit is down month over month another good sign despite some silver linings most americans remain pessimistic about the economy one new survey found that 52 percent of americans report that they are worse off financially than they were a year ago only 14 percent said they were better off financially than they were a year ago a record low for this particular survey of course what americans say and the reality of the situation are two different things americans behavior doesn t exactly indicate dire financial straits some commentators do see the current stock market slump as a buying opportunity if history is a lesson the stock market typically recovers from a bear market within approximately two years and looking very long term there has never been a negative annualized return over any 20 year period still it is not a good time to be meticulously checking your 401 k balance keep that money in there though and if you can buy more stocks on the cheap savvy investors know that time after time again and again a bad stock market inevitably turns itself around and surges back into the black when that will happen is anyone s guess it could be coming faster than you might think though especially if the fed successfully engineers that soft landing they ve been shooting for when the stock market recovery does come you definitely don t want to be left behind so stick in there stay with it and try not to give in to all the economic gloom jonathan wolf is a civil litigator and author of your debt free jd affiliate link he has taught legal writing written for a wide variety of publications and made it both his business and his pleasure to be financially and scientifically literate any views he expresses are probably pure gold but are nonetheless solely his own and should not be attributed to any organization with which he is affiliated he wouldn t want to share the credit anyway he can be reached at jon_wolf hotmail com
elon musk s tumultuous 44 billion bid to buy twitter is on the verge of collapse after the tesla ceo sent a letter to twitter s board friday saying he is terminating the acquisition the chair of twitter s board bret taylor tweeted friday that the board is committed to closing the transaction on the price and terms agreed upon with mr musk and plans to pursue legal action to enforce the merger agreement we are confident we will prevail in the delaware court of chancery twitter could have pushed for a 1 billion breakup fee musk agreed to pay under these circumstances instead it looks ready to fight over the deal which the company s board has approved and ceo parag agrawal has insisted he wants to consummate the possible unraveling of the deal is just the latest twist in a saga between the world s richest man and one of the most influential social media platforms much of the drama has played out on twitter with musk who has more than 100 million followers lamenting that the company was failing to live up to its potential as a platform for free speech on friday shares of twitter fell 5 to 36 81 well below the 54 20 that musk had offered to pay shares of tesla meanwhile climbed 2 5 to 752 29 musk lawyer mike ringler wrote in the letter to twitter dated friday that for nearly two months musk has sought data to judge the prevalence of fake or spam accounts on the social media platform twitter has failed or refused to provide this information sometimes twitter has ignored mr musk s requests sometimes it has rejected them for reasons that appear to be unjustified and sometimes it has claimed to comply while giving mr musk incomplete or unusable information the letter said it also said the information is fundamental to twitter s business and financial performance and it s needed to finish the merger agreement from the beginning this was always a head scratcher to go after twitter at a 44 billion price tag for musk and never made much sense to the street now it ends for now in a twilight zone ending with twitter s board back against the wall and many on the street scratching their head around what is next wedbush analyst daniel ives wrote in a note to investors after the letter was published on thursday twitter sought to shed more light on how it counts spam accounts in a briefing with journalists and company executives twitter said it removes 1 million spam accounts each day the spam accounts represent well below 5 of its active user base each quarter to calculate how many accounts are malicious spam twitter said it reviews thousands of accounts sampled at random using both public and private data such as ip addresses phone numbers geolocation and how the account behaves when it is active to determine whether an account is real last month twitter offered musk access to its firehose of raw data on hundreds of millions of daily tweets according to multiple reports at the time though neither the company nor musk confirmed this private data which isn t available publicly and thus not in the data firehose that was given to musk includes ip addresses phone numbers and location twitter said such private data helps avoid misidentifying real accounts as spam ringler also alleged that twitter broke the agreement when it fired its revenue product leader and general manager of consumers as well announcing the layoff of one third of its talent acquisition team the sale agreement he wrote required twitter to seek and obtain consent if it deviated from conducting normal business twitter was required to preserve substantially intact the material components of its current business organization the letter said musk s flirtation with buying twitter appeared to begin in late march that s when twitter has said he contacted members of its board including co founder jack dorsey and told them he was buying up shares of the company and interested in either joining the board taking twitter private or starting a competitor then on april 4 he revealed in a regulatory filing that he had became the company s largest shareholder after acquiring a 9 stake worth about 3 billion at first twitter offered musk a seat on its board but six days later agrawal tweeted that musk will not be joining the board after all his bid to buy the company came together quickly after that musk had agreed to buy twitter for 54 20 per share inserting a 420 marijuana reference into his offer price he sold roughly 8 5 billion worth of shares in tesla to help fund the purchase then strengthened his commitments of more than 7 billion from a diverse group of investors including silicon valley heavy hitters like oracle co founder larry ellison inside twitter musk s offer was met with confusion and falling morale especially after musk publicly criticized one of twitter s top lawyers involved in content moderation decisions as twitter executives prepared for the deal to move forward the company instituted a hiring freeze halted discretionary spending and fired two top managers the san francisco company has also been laying off staff most recently part of its talent acquisition team you can find more national news

billionaire elon musk called off his deal to buy social media company twitter according to a filing on friday with the securities and exchange commission skadden arps attorney mike ringler said in a letter to twitter s chief legal officer that twitter has not complied with its contractual obligations for nearly two months the company has failed to provide musk with information about fake or spam accounts the letter said the stock closed down 11 3 monday ending the day at 32 65 for twitter this fiasco is a nightmare scenario and will result in an everest like uphill climb for twitter ceo parag agrawal co to navigate the myriad of challenges ahead around employee turnover morale advertising headwinds investor credibility around the fake account bot issues and host of other issues abound wedbush analyst dan ives wrote in a note on monday twitter contends musk s argument for termination is invalid and wrongful according to a letter sent on behalf of the company by law firm wachtell lipton rosen katz twitter is demanding musk use his best efforts to complete the deal and says it reserves the right to force musk to comply with the agreement the agreement is not terminated the letter says twitter will continue to provide information reasonably requested by mr musk under the agreement and to diligently take all measures required to close the transaction on saturday former u s president donald trump formerly one of twitter s more infamous users reportedly called musk a bulls artist saturday during a campaign rally in alaska trump said musk told him he had voted for trump for president but actually had never voted for a republican before i said i didn t know that trump said he told me he voted for me so he s another bulls artist all this comes as twitter s stock has fallen sharply since the company s board accepted musk s offer to buy the social media platform in april for 54 20 a share on the day of the announcement twitter closed at 51 70 a share on friday it closed at 36 81 the tesla and spacex ceo is also known for his polarizing online persona as his entrepreneurial endeavors he is popular on twitter where he has more than 100 million followers and frequently chimes in on politics talks business openly and embraces the internet s meme culture some of his tweets have landed him in legal trouble who is elon musk what to know about the tesla ceo who wanted to buy twitter elon musk mocks twitter in a tweet of course is this a case of he who laughs first laughs last musk might think so on monday some 72 hours after wanting to break his deal with twitter musk emerged back on the platform he tweeted four images of him laughing next to intriguing captions that read they said i couldn t buy twitter then they wouldn t disclose bot information now they want to force me to buy twitter in court now they have to disclose bot information in court then musk followed up the tweet with a picture of action star chuck norris playing chess with only a single pawn on his side of the board and a set of pieces on the other side with musk tweeting chuckmate either this means musk is back in full on tweet mode or he ll strategically pick his spots that no doubt his 100 million followers will be watching can elon musk walk away from twitter according to the filing with the sec on april 25 the deal calls for musk to pay twitter a 1 billion break up fee if he terminates the deal but musk may not be able to just walk away twitter may be able to force musk to complete the deal legal observers say at issue is whether the prevalence of bots on the social media platform is fundamental to twitter s business and financial performance as musk s lawyers have argued the question is whether or not this is really material information ucla law professor james park said it should be fairly obvious that there s potentially fake spam accounts at a company like twitter musk can make this argument but i think it s a weak one he said to me this is just a pretext for him to pull out of the deal and twitter has every incentive to enforce the deal case western reserve business law professor anat alon beck told usa today in an email if they don t at least attempt to force musk to close they ll have his allegations of false statements hanging around their necks unless they contest his statements alon beck said this fight is just beginning and only time will tell on how steep a penalty each side will pay to close this deal jennifer grygiel a professor at syracuse university noted that musk may not be through with the deal yet who says he s still not trying to acquire it grygiel said we re still very much in a limbo period and we have to wait and see where this all ends up what is clear musk will have a legal battle on his hands park said the case should move very quickly through the delaware court of chancery with a trial and a decision in just a few weeks bailey schulz and terry collins twitter users react to elon musk reaction on twitter was mixed friday some made jokes about musk s change of plans progressive nonprofit consumer advocacy organization public citizen said musk terminating the deal is what a win for free speech actually looks like musk in april tweeted i hope that even my worst critics remain on twitter because that is what free speech means attorney richard signorelli said he hopes musk pays a hefty penalty to get out of the deal in another tweet signorelli identified himself as a twitter shareholder and said he is glad musk is trying to back out illinois congressman chuy garci a tweeted at the billionaire friday telling him don t let the door hit you on your way out garci a previously spoke out against the 44 billion deal on twitter one avid twitter user who has yet to tweet about the letter musk bailey schulz gop elon musk isn t going to save us conservatives rejoiced in april when elon musk made an unsolicited 44 billion bid for twitter vowing to restore free speech on the social media platform the response was more muted late friday when it became clear that musk would not be the savior the political right had hoped for in a regulatory filing musk said he was terminating the twitter deal over a disagreement about how many spam accounts are on the platform tom fitton s take the conservative activist and president of judicial watch said musk was ditching the twitter deal because the company refused to disclose details of its censorship operation charlie kirk founder and president of the conservative nonprofit turning point usa tweeted maybe elon never intended to buy twitter at all maybe he just wanted to expose it donald trump jr declared that musk walking away from the deal meant twitter was caught lying about spam accounts so basically twitter has a huge amount of spam accounts way more than they let on and has gotten busted for it bottom line tweeted florida gop congressional candidate lavern spicer elon musk isn t going to save us only actor james woods sounded a more critical note tweeting musk failed us he later deleted the tweet it was a far cry from the rousing way conservatives cheered on musk at the start conservative commentator dinesh d souza began lobbying musk to buy twitter in january his idea that musk would take over and censor liberals to teach them a lesson on the imperative of free speech when d souza again urged musk to buy a major social media platform to dramatically shift the political and cultural landscape musk replied interesting ideas soon musk was buying up shares of twitter and being egged on by other conservative figures after making a bid for twitter the billionaire tesla ceo picked up millions of followers many of them conservatives who for years have accused twitter facebook and google of anti conservative bias conservative commentator brent bozell founder and president of the media research center tweeted free at last free at last conservatives may be free at last as of early friday night bozell had not tweeted a reaction to the news that musk was ending his bid for twitter over on donald trump s social media platform truth social the former president posted the twitter deal is dead long live the truth jessica guynn musk deal termination a twitter disaster never in a million years would i have imagined this said daniel ives senior equity research analyst at wedbush securities ives predicts an uphill battle for twitter and a lot of legal twists and turns this is a disaster scenario for twitter and its board as now the company will battle musk in an elongated court battle to recoup the deal and or the breakup fee of 1 billion at a minimum ives said musk should likely share in some of the blame it s going to be a black eye for musk as well ives said he doesn t come out smelling like roses syracuse university s grygiel says she believed from the start that a powerful executive like musk may have had cruel intentions for pursuing twitter it turns out that he didn t actually need to own it to destroy it grygiel said terry collins who is elon musk what to know about the tesla ceo who wanted to buy twitter how much was musk going to buy twitter for musk was to acquire twitter in a deal worth 44 billion musk said he had lined up 46 5 billion in financing to buy twitter once the deal was complete twitter was to become a privately held company when did musk agree to buy twitter musk s 44 billion deal was confirmed in late april after he spent nearly three months buying up twitter shares to increase his stake in the company at the time the world s richest person said he wanted to make twitter better than ever by enhancing the product with new features making the algorithms open source to increase trust defeating the spam bots and authenticating all humans bailey schulz why isn t elon musk buying twitter in a word bots musk claims twitter is vastly understating the prevalence of spam and fake accounts on the platform twitter says bots make up just 5 of its monetizable daily active users in friday s regulatory filing musk says that twitter appears to be dramatically understating that figure musk previously contended that the count is 20 or higher some observers say musk is using bots as a pretext to pull out of the deal bailey schulz twitter bots what are they and how could they mess up elon musk s 44 billion twitter deal how is the twitter board responding twitter plans to sue musk and is committed to closing the transaction according to bret taylor chair of twitter s board we are confident we will prevail in the delaware court of chancery he said in a tweet one former twitter executive told the financial times it seems twitter is willing to go to war to make this deal happen in its latest quarterly report twitter warned that its financial condition may suffer if the merger does not close tumbling stock prices low investor confidence stockholder lawsuits and business disruptions were just a few of the possibilities the company laid out twitter

by lewis krauskopf new york reuters with a miserable first half for the stock market now in the history books investors are assessing whether the u s economy can avoid a significant downturn as the federal reserve raises rates to fight the worst inflation in decades the answer to that question stands to have a direct impact on markets strategists say an economic slump coupled with weak corporate earnings could push the s p 500 lower by at least another 10 compounding losses that have already pushed the benchmark index down 18 year to date conversely in a scenario that includes solid profit increases and moderating inflation stocks could bounce to around where they started the year according to some analysts price targets for now investors are anticipating that we are seeing a slowdown said lindsey bell chief markets and money strategist at ally the big question is how deep is this slowdown going to be the case for an imminent economic downturn took a hit on friday after a labor department report showed employers hired far more workers than expected in june giving the fed ammunition to deliver another 75 basis point interest rate hike this month the june employment report indicates that the economy is neither on the cusp of a recession much less already in one nor in an overheated state oxford economics said in a note it predicted more market volatility amid heightened speculation over what the fed will do more key information on the course of the economy is expected later this month as second quarter earnings reports flood in over the next few weeks and investors parse fresh data including wednesday s closely watched consumer prices report for june though the fed has said it is confident in achieving a so called soft landing by bringing down inflation without upsetting the economy some investors believe this year s steep stock declines suggest a degree of economic slowdown is already baked in to asset prices the s p 500 for instance has fallen as low as 23 6 from its january record high this year in line with the 24 median decline the index has registered in past recessions indicating that at least some of the challenging environment is reflected in stock prices keith lerner co chief investment officer at truist advisory services said in a report recessions are officially called in hindsight with the national bureau of economic research declaring one when there has been a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and lasts more than a few months competing scenarios forecasts vary for how rocky the economy can get a note outlining various economic scenarios from ubs global wealth management said the s p 500 could fall to 3 300 some 31 from its january high if an economic slump leads to a steep drop in corporate earnings as well as in the case of stagflation which typically involves a cocktail of persistently high inflation combined with slow growth the bank s analysts gave a 30 chance for the slump scenario and pegged the chances of stagflation at 20 a soft landing scenario is their most likely outcome however and would include the s p 500 finishing the year at 3 900 right around where it closed on friday such a scenario to which ubs assigned a 40 weighting depends on investors believing that inflation is under control and earnings can remain resilient despite tighter financial conditions they said in a recent note outlining the increasing likelihood of a stagflationary environment strategists at bofa global research recommended investors combine areas of the stock market that would benefit from inflation such as energy with defensive sectors like healthcare wells fargo investment institute strategists meanwhile earlier this week called for a moderate u s recession and lowered their year end s p 500 target to a range of 3 800 4 000 some investors hold a more optimistic view of the economy and believe stocks could head higher from current levels citi s strategists weighted a soft landing scenario at 55 although they also saw a 40 chance of a mild recession and a 5 chance of a severe one their year end s p target is 4 200 john stoltzfus chief investment strategist at oppenheimer asset management this week lowered his s p 500 price target to 4 800 from 5 330 that he had initiated in december with the new level still 23 above where the index closed on friday he expects consumer demand business investment and government spending to support growth it s a resilient economy stoltzfus said reporting by lewis krauskopf in new york editing by ira iosebashvili and matthew lewis

as it now faces the possibility of a protracted legal battle against the richest man in the world to determine control and perception of the company twitter finds itself in a worst case scenario according to one wall street analyst on friday elon musk filed a letter with the securities and exchange commission stating his intention to pull out of an agreement made in april to purchase twitter for 54 20 a share or about 44 billion in response twitter said it will sue musk to force him to consummate the agreement dan ives a managing director and senior equity research analyst covering the technology sector at wedbush securities said twitter s stock price stands to suffer significant damage already twitter shares were down more than 5 in after hours trading on friday to 34 70 monday this is a 25 stock ives said the company has been in pure chaos people have left in droves and now competitors are going to seize on the ad dollars with the employee turnover it s going to be viewed as damaged goods from another potential buyer in his filing musk accused twitter of failing to respond to requests for information about the volume of spam and bot accounts on the platform since the acquisition deal was first announced in april twitter has maintained that it has cooperated with musk s requests for information a person walks near the twitter headquarters in san francisco on apr 26 2022 amy osborne afp via getty images file on friday it did not comment on musk s specific allegations saying instead that it will file a lawsuit in a delaware court to force musk to follow through with his pledge to buy the company at the agreed upon price when musk and twitter s board of directors first entered their agreement the two parties agreed that neither side could walk away from the deal without paying a 1 billion breakup fee but payment of such a fee isn t all that s required there would need to be a substantial discovery of new information that has a negative impact on the company known as a material adverse effect one law professor believes musk s defense asserting that twitter was not forthcoming about bots on its website could prove to be weak he does not bring his a game to this case said eric talley a professor at columbia university law school everything is turning on disclosure of information about bot accounts and that that somehow translates into material adverse effects talley said twitter has consistently for years disclosed information about spam accounts on its platform this is not some crazy thing where we are suddenly discovering a toxic waste dump this is a known quantity so it s an odd thing talley said musk s case could be so weak that a protracted court battle may not occur he also said the two sides are likely to attempt to come to a settlement that seeks to satisfy both parties but ives the wedbush securities analyst believes the damage to twitter s value has only just begun when you have a cult figure like musk one of if not the most followed person in world calling out twitter now it has a ripple effect that s hard to quantify ives said from advertisers to employees to the political firestorm that could ensue he said for twitter it s not about the court battle and the legal ramifications and how that plays out that will be debated by lawyers but it s a public company that needs to be run and now it s hanging in the wind

billionaire elon musk called off his deal to buy social media company twitter according to a filing on friday with the securities and exchange commission skadden arps attorney mike ringler said in a letter to twitter s chief legal officer that twitter has not complied with its contractual obligations for nearly two months the company has failed to provide musk with information about fake or spam accounts the letter said the stock closed down 11 3 monday ending the day at 32 65 for twitter this fiasco is a nightmare scenario and will result in an everest like uphill climb for twitter ceo parag agrawal co to navigate the myriad of challenges ahead around employee turnover morale advertising headwinds investor credibility around the fake account bot issues and host of other issues abound wedbush analyst dan ives wrote in a note on monday twitter contends musk s argument for termination is invalid and wrongful according to a letter sent on behalf of the company by law firm wachtell lipton rosen katz twitter is demanding musk use his best efforts to complete the deal and says it reserves the right to force musk to comply with the agreement the agreement is not terminated the letter says twitter will continue to provide information reasonably requested by mr musk under the agreement and to diligently take all measures required to close the transaction on saturday former u s president donald trump formerly one of twitter s more infamous users reportedly called musk a bulls artist saturday during a campaign rally in alaska trump said musk told him he had voted for trump for president but actually had never voted for a republican before i said i didn t know that trump said he told me he voted for me so he s another bulls artist all this comes as twitter s stock has fallen sharply since the company s board accepted musk s offer to buy the social media platform in april for 54 20 a share on the day of the announcement twitter closed at 51 70 a share on friday it closed at 36 81 the tesla and spacex ceo is also known for his polarizing online persona as his entrepreneurial endeavors he is popular on twitter where he has more than 100 million followers and frequently chimes in on politics talks business openly and embraces the internet s meme culture some of his tweets have landed him in legal trouble who is elon musk what to know about the tesla ceo who wanted to buy twitter elon musk mocks twitter in a tweet of course is this a case of he who laughs first laughs last musk might think so on monday some 72 hours after wanting to break his deal with twitter musk emerged back on the platform he tweeted four images of him laughing next to intriguing captions that read they said i couldn t buy twitter then they wouldn t disclose bot information now they want to force me to buy twitter in court now they have to disclose bot information in court then musk followed up the tweet with a picture of action star chuck norris playing chess with only a single pawn on his side of the board and a set of pieces on the other side with musk tweeting chuckmate either this means musk is back in full on tweet mode or he ll strategically pick his spots that no doubt his 100 million followers will be watching can elon musk walk away from twitter according to the filing with the sec on april 25 the deal calls for musk to pay twitter a 1 billion break up fee if he terminates the deal but musk may not be able to just walk away twitter may be able to force musk to complete the deal legal observers say at issue is whether the prevalence of bots on the social media platform is fundamental to twitter s business and financial performance as musk s lawyers have argued the question is whether or not this is really material information ucla law professor james park said it should be fairly obvious that there s potentially fake spam accounts at a company like twitter musk can make this argument but i think it s a weak one he said to me this is just a pretext for him to pull out of the deal and twitter has every incentive to enforce the deal case western reserve business law professor anat alon beck told usa today in an email if they don t at least attempt to force musk to close they ll have his allegations of false statements hanging around their necks unless they contest his statements alon beck said this fight is just beginning and only time will tell on how steep a penalty each side will pay to close this deal jennifer grygiel a professor at syracuse university noted that musk may not be through with the deal yet who says he s still not trying to acquire it grygiel said we re still very much in a limbo period and we have to wait and see where this all ends up what is clear musk will have a legal battle on his hands park said the case should move very quickly through the delaware court of chancery with a trial and a decision in just a few weeks bailey schulz and terry collins twitter users react to elon musk reaction on twitter was mixed friday some made jokes about musk s change of plans progressive nonprofit consumer advocacy organization public citizen said musk terminating the deal is what a win for free speech actually looks like musk in april tweeted i hope that even my worst critics remain on twitter because that is what free speech means attorney richard signorelli said he hopes musk pays a hefty penalty to get out of the deal in another tweet signorelli identified himself as a twitter shareholder and said he is glad musk is trying to back out illinois congressman chuy garci a tweeted at the billionaire friday telling him don t let the door hit you on your way out garci a previously spoke out against the 44 billion deal on twitter one avid twitter user who has yet to tweet about the letter musk bailey schulz gop elon musk isn t going to save us conservatives rejoiced in april when elon musk made an unsolicited 44 billion bid for twitter vowing to restore free speech on the social media platform the response was more muted late friday when it became clear that musk would not be the savior the political right had hoped for in a regulatory filing musk said he was terminating the twitter deal over a disagreement about how many spam accounts are on the platform tom fitton s take the conservative activist and president of judicial watch said musk was ditching the twitter deal because the company refused to disclose details of its censorship operation charlie kirk founder and president of the conservative nonprofit turning point usa tweeted maybe elon never intended to buy twitter at all maybe he just wanted to expose it donald trump jr declared that musk walking away from the deal meant twitter was caught lying about spam accounts so basically twitter has a huge amount of spam accounts way more than they let on and has gotten busted for it bottom line tweeted florida gop congressional candidate lavern spicer elon musk isn t going to save us only actor james woods sounded a more critical note tweeting musk failed us he later deleted the tweet it was a far cry from the rousing way conservatives cheered on musk at the start conservative commentator dinesh d souza began lobbying musk to buy twitter in january his idea that musk would take over and censor liberals to teach them a lesson on the imperative of free speech when d souza again urged musk to buy a major social media platform to dramatically shift the political and cultural landscape musk replied interesting ideas soon musk was buying up shares of twitter and being egged on by other conservative figures after making a bid for twitter the billionaire tesla ceo picked up millions of followers many of them conservatives who for years have accused twitter facebook and google of anti conservative bias conservative commentator brent bozell founder and president of the media research center tweeted free at last free at last conservatives may be free at last as of early friday night bozell had not tweeted a reaction to the news that musk was ending his bid for twitter over on donald trump s social media platform truth social the former president posted the twitter deal is dead long live the truth jessica guynn musk deal termination a twitter disaster never in a million years would i have imagined this said daniel ives senior equity research analyst at wedbush securities ives predicts an uphill battle for twitter and a lot of legal twists and turns this is a disaster scenario for twitter and its board as now the company will battle musk in an elongated court battle to recoup the deal and or the breakup fee of 1 billion at a minimum ives said musk should likely share in some of the blame it s going to be a black eye for musk as well ives said he doesn t come out smelling like roses syracuse university s grygiel says she believed from the start that a powerful executive like musk may have had cruel intentions for pursuing twitter it turns out that he didn t actually need to own it to destroy it grygiel said terry collins who is elon musk what to know about the tesla ceo who wanted to buy twitter how much was musk going to buy twitter for musk was to acquire twitter in a deal worth 44 billion musk said he had lined up 46 5 billion in financing to buy twitter once the deal was complete twitter was to become a privately held company when did musk agree to buy twitter musk s 44 billion deal was confirmed in late april after he spent nearly three months buying up twitter shares to increase his stake in the company at the time the world s richest person said he wanted to make twitter better than ever by enhancing the product with new features making the algorithms open source to increase trust defeating the spam bots and authenticating all humans bailey schulz why isn t elon musk buying twitter in a word bots musk claims twitter is vastly understating the prevalence of spam and fake accounts on the platform twitter says bots make up just 5 of its monetizable daily active users in friday s regulatory filing musk says that twitter appears to be dramatically understating that figure musk previously contended that the count is 20 or higher some observers say musk is using bots as a pretext to pull out of the deal bailey schulz twitter bots what are they and how could they mess up elon musk s 44 billion twitter deal how is the twitter board responding twitter plans to sue musk and is committed to closing the transaction according to bret taylor chair of twitter s board we are confident we will prevail in the delaware court of chancery he said in a tweet one former twitter executive told the financial times it seems twitter is willing to go to war to make this deal happen in its latest quarterly report twitter warned that its financial condition may suffer if the merger does not close tumbling stock prices low investor confidence stockholder lawsuits and business disruptions were just a few of the possibilities the company laid out twitter employees were warned not to make any public statements an internal memo from twitter s general counsel obtained by the verge directed staffers to refrain from tweeting slacking or sharing any commentary about the merger agreement terry collins and bailey schulz contributing sara edwards
elon musk said friday that he s calling off 44 billion offer to buy twitter mostly over the social media company s failure to provide enough information about fake accounts ap file photo elon musk announced friday that he will abandon his tumultuous 44 billion offer to buy twitter after the company failed to provide enough information about the number of fake accounts twitter immediately fired back saying it would sue the tesla ceo to uphold the deal the likely unraveling of the acquisition was just the latest twist in a saga between the world s richest man and one of the most influential social media platforms and it may portend a titanic legal battle ahead twitter could have pushed for a 1 billion breakup fee that musk agreed to pay under these circumstances instead it looks ready to fight to complete the purchase which the company s board has approved and ceo parag agrawal has insisted he wants to consummate in a letter to twitter s board musk lawyer mike ringler complained that his client had for nearly two months sought data to judge the prevalence of fake or spam accounts on the social media platform twitter has failed or refused to provide this information sometimes twitter has ignored mr musk s requests sometimes it has rejected them for reasons that appear to be unjustified and sometimes it has claimed to comply while giving mr musk incomplete or unusable information the letter said musk also said the information is fundamental to twitter s business and financial performance and is needed to finish the merger in response the chair of twitter s board bret taylor tweeted that the board is committed to closing the transaction on the price and terms agreed upon with musk and plans to pursue legal action to enforce the merger agreement we are confident we will prevail in the delaware court of chancery the trial court in delaware frequently handles business disputes among the many corporations including twitter that are incorporated there much of the drama has played out on twitter with musk who has more than 100 million followers lamenting that the company was failing to live up to its potential as a platform for free speech on friday shares of twitter fell 5 to 36 81 well below the 54 20 that musk had offered to pay shares of tesla meanwhile climbed 2 5 to 752 29 after the market closed and musk s letter was published twitter s stock continued to decline while tesla climbed higher this is a disaster scenario for twitter and its board wedbush analyst dan ives wrote in a note to investors he predicted a long court fight by twitter to either restore the deal or get the 1 billion breakup fee on thursday twitter sought to shed more light on how it counts spam accounts in a briefing with journalists and company executives twitter said it removes 1 million spam accounts each day the accounts represent well below 5 of its active user base each quarter to calculate how many accounts are malicious spam twitter said it reviews thousands of accounts sampled at random using both public and private data such as ip addresses phone numbers location and account behavior when active to determine whether an account is real last month twitter offered musk access to its fire hose of raw data on hundreds of millions of daily tweets according to multiple reports at the time though neither the company nor musk confirmed that one of the chief reasons musk gave for his interest in taking twitter private was his belief he could add value to the business by getting rid of its spam bots the same problem that he s now citing as a reason to end the deal this whole process has been bizarre said christopher bouzy founder of research firm bot sentinel which tracks fake twitter accounts used for disinformation or harassment he knew about this problem it s odd that he would use bots and trolls and inauthentic accounts as a way of getting out of the deal on the other hand bouzy said the letter from musk s legal team makes some valid critiques of twitter s lack of transparency including its apparent refusal to provide musk with the same level of internal data it offers some of its big customers it just seems as if they re hiding something said bouzy who also believes the number of fake or spam twitter accounts is higher than what the company has reported musk s lawyer also alleged that twitter broke the agreement when it fired two top managers and laid off a third of its talent acquisition team the sale agreement he wrote required twitter to seek and obtain consent if it deviated from conducting normal business twitter was required to preserve substantially intact the material components of its current business organization the letter said musk s flirtation with buying twitter appeared to begin in late march that s when twitter said he contacted members of its board including co founder jack dorsey and told them he was buying up shares of the company and was interested in either joining the board taking twitter private or starting a competitor then on april 4 he revealed in a regulatory filing that he had became the company s largest shareholder after acquiring a 9 stake worth about 3 billion at first twitter offered musk a seat on its board but six days later agrawal tweeted that musk would not be joining the board after all his bid to buy the company came together quickly after that musk had agreed to buy twitter for 54 20 per share inserting a 420 marijuana reference into his offer price he sold roughly 8 5 billion worth of shares in tesla to help fund the purchase then strengthened his commitments of more than 7 billion from a diverse group of investors including silicon valley heavy hitters like oracle co founder larry ellison inside twitter musk s offer was met with confusion and falling morale especially after musk publicly criticized one of twitter s top lawyers involved in content moderation decisions groups opposing the takeover from the outset including those advocating for women minorities and lgbtq people cheered friday s news despite what musk may claim this deal isn t ending because of twitter bots or spam accounts this deal is collapsing because of elon musk s own erratic behavior embrace of extremists and bad business decisions said angelo carusone president of media matters a left leaning nonprofit watchdog group that s been critical of musk s twitter bid musk he said made it clear that he would roll back twitters community standards and safety guidelines which would turn the platform into a fever swamp of dangerous conspiracy theories partisan chicanery and white supremacist radicalization twitter says it will sue elon musk to make the tesla ceo uphold his agreement to buy the social media company ap file photo
updated july 10 2022 at 5 32 pm et elon musk wants to break off his agreement to buy twitter in a letter to the company filed friday with the securities and exchange commission musk accuses twitter of making false and misleading representations about the prevalence of fake accounts on its platform he says the company has not complied with its obligations to share data and information that he says he needs to evaluate its business sometimes twitter has ignored mr musk s requests sometimes it has rejected them for reasons that appear to be unjustified and sometimes it has claimed to comply while giving mr musk incomplete or unusable information musk s lawyer mike ringler wrote legal experts say this may not be sufficient grounds to break off the 44 billion deal without musk being on the hook for a hefty fine in response to musk s letter the chair of twitter s board said it planned to sue the twitter board is committed to closing the transaction on the price and terms agreed upon with mr musk and plans to pursue legal action to enforce the merger agreement we are confident we will prevail in the delaware court of chancery said bret taylor in a tweet referring to a delaware court that handles corporate disputes the billionaire ceo of tesla and space x struck a deal to buy the social media company back in april but almost immediately he started hinting and then saying outright that he had cold feet in may he declared the purchase was on hold while he looked into twitter s accounting of how many users are not real people but automated bots or spam soon after twitter agreed to give him access to its firehose a real time stream of more than 500 million tweets posted every day since then the two sides have been sharing information and working to close the transaction on thursday the washington post reported the deal was in jeopardy because musk doubts that twitter s spam figures are verifiable his team was expected to take potentially drastic action the post reported bots may not be the only factor in musk s change of heart while his offer of 54 20 a share was initially seen as a lowball price for twitter given that it was trading above 70 last year tech stocks and the market as a whole have fallen sharply since he struck the deal as of the closing bell on friday twitter shares were trading around 37 down nearly 30 from the day musk s purchase was announced in may musk even said he might seek to negotiate a lower price on thursday twitter had pointed to a statement the company issued in june saying it has and will continue to cooperatively share information with musk and that we intend to close the transaction and enforce the merger agreement at the agreed price and terms the company was expecting to hold a shareholder vote on the deal by mid august musk signed a merger agreement the two sides signed a legal agreement that musk would buy twitter for 54 20 a share if either side broke off the deal they could be on the hook to pay a 1 billion fee to the other party in his letter on friday musk cites twitter s alleged refusal to turn over more information about bots as grounds to abandon the deal but legal experts say that would be an uphill battle for years twitter has publicly said it estimates less than 5 of daily users who see ads are spam or bots but has also cautioned the number could be higher musk disputes this saying he believes as many as 20 of accounts may be fake while twitter gave musk access to its firehose of public data it told reporters this week its spam estimates are also based on private data such as users ip addresses phone numbers locations and behavior and are therefore difficult for outsiders to verify even if twitter s 5 figure is incorrect that still might not be enough to let musk back out or change the terms of the deal without paying a hefty price merger agreements are drafted to avoid exactly what musk is doing which is try to find some tiny little false thing and then say whoops i get to walk away now said ann lipton a business law professor at tulane university law school they specifically say things like you can t back out unless it s not just false but incredibly false hugely false massively damaging to the company twitter has a strong case against musk say experts the merger agreement includes what s known as a specific performance clause which says twitter can take musk to court to force him to go through with the purchase as long as he still has financing in place while that may sound risky and costly for twitter lipton says the company s case would be very strong and its board has compelling incentives to see the sale through investors are expecting to receive 54 20 a piece for their shares the board s view according to a person familiar with the deal talks is that the sale agreement with musk is the most valuable part of twitter right now they would much rather have the 54 20 without a court fight but it s worth fighting over lipton said given the company s current share price 54 20 seems like an unbelievable deal for twitter so there is a lot that they could sacrifice that would still make it worth it in the end if they got to force musk to close musk might try to get twitter at a discount still some wall street analysts say twitter s board and management should be open to accepting a lower price to avoid a lengthy legal battle there s no chance it s getting done at 54 20 said angelo zino analyst at cfra research you re either going to see a 15 to 20 drop in the offer price to get elon musk engaged again or he continues to play the bot card taking musk to court could be even more damaging to twitter at a time when uncertainty over the deal and what the billionaire s ownership might mean are weighing heavily on the company morale is already low and some employees are leaving ceo parag agrawal has shaken up his executive ranks and announced a hiring freeze and spending cuts going to court doesn t bode well for the business prospects of your company and it further adds uncertainty to the employee base zino said that s also a risk for musk lipton said what if he has to buy the company and now he s kind of undermined it at the same time ultimately she said the billionaire s antics however chaotic appear to have a single goal i don t think he s committed to winning i think he s committing to not spending 44 billion on

reuters elon musk the chief executive officer of tesla and the world s richest person said on friday he was terminating his 44 billion deal to buy twitter because the social media company had breached multiple provisions of the merger agreement twitter s chairman bret taylor said on the micro blogging platform that the board planned to pursue legal action to enforce the merger agreement the twitter board is committed to closing the transaction on the price and terms agreed upon with mr musk he wrote in a filing musk s lawyers said twitter had failed or refused to respond to multiple requests for information on fake or spam accounts on the platform which is fundamental to the company s business performance twitter is in material breach of multiple provisions of that agreement appears to have made false and misleading representations upon which mr musk relied when entering into the merger agreement the filing said musk also said he was walking away because twitter fired high ranking executives and one third of the talent acquisition team breaching twitter s obligation to preserve substantially intact the material components of its current business organization legal battle musk s decision is likely to result in a protracted legal tussle between the billionaire and the 16 year old san francisco based company disputed mergers and acquisitions that land in delaware courts more often than not end up with the companies re negotiating deals or the acquirer paying the target a settlement to walk away rather than a judge ordering that a transaction be completed that is because target companies are often keen to resolve the uncertainty around their future and move on twitter however is hoping that court proceedings will start in a few weeks and be resolved in a few months according to a person familiar with the matter there is plenty of precedent for a deal renegotiation several companies repriced agreed acquisitions when the covid 19 pandemic broke out in 2020 and delivered a global economic shock in one instance french retailer lvmh threatened to walk away from a deal with tiffany co the u s jewelry retailer agreed to lower the acquisition price by 425 million

ann lipton associate dean for faculty research at tulane law school shares of twitter were down 6 at 34 58 in extended trading that is 36 below the 54 20 per share musk agreed to buy twitter for in

their jobs pay and ability to work remotely and many have expressed skepticism about musk s plans to loosen content moderation digital ad woes musk s abandonment of the deal and twitter s promise to

and the market as a whole have fallen sharply since he struck the deal as of the closing bell on friday twitter shares were trading around 37 down nearly 30 from the day musk s purchase was announced in may musk even said he might seek to negotiate a lower price on thursday twitter had pointed to a statement the company issued in june saying it has and will continue to cooperatively share information with musk and that we intend to close the transaction and enforce the merger agreement at the agreed price and terms the company was expecting to hold a shareholder vote on the deal by mid august musk signed a merger agreement the two sides signed a legal agreement that musk would buy twitter for 54 20 a share if either side broke off the deal they could be on the hook to pay a 1 billion fee to the other party in his letter on friday musk cites twitter s alleged refusal to turn over more information about bots as grounds to abandon the deal but legal experts say that would be an uphill battle for years twitter has publicly said it estimates less than 5 of daily users who see ads are spam or bots but has also cautioned the number could be higher musk disputes this saying he believes as many as 20 of accounts may be fake while twitter gave musk access to its firehose of public data it told reporters this week its spam estimates are also based on private data such as users ip addresses phone numbers locations and behavior and are therefore difficult for outsiders to verify even if twitter s 5 figure is incorrect that still might not be enough to let musk back out or change the terms of the deal without paying a hefty price merger agreements are drafted to avoid exactly what musk is doing which is try to find some tiny little false thing and then say whoops i get to walk away now said ann lipton a business law professor at tulane university law school they specifically say things like you can t back out unless it s not just false but incredibly false hugely false massively damaging to the company twitter has a strong case against musk say experts the merger agreement includes what s known as a specific performance clause which says twitter can take musk to court to force him to go through with the purchase as long as he still has financing in place while that may sound risky and costly for twitter lipton says the company s case would be very strong and its board has compelling incentives to see the sale through investors are expecting to receive 54 20 a piece for their shares the board s view according to a person familiar with the deal talks is that the sale agreement with musk is the most valuable part of twitter right now they would much rather have the 54 20 without a court fight but it s worth fighting over lipton said given the company s current share price 54 20 seems like an unbelievable deal for twitter so there is a lot that they could sacrifice that would still make it worth it in the end if they got to force musk to close musk might try to get twitter at a discount still some wall street analysts say twitter s board and management should be open to accepting a lower price to avoid a lengthy legal battle there s no chance it s getting done at 54 20 said angelo zino analyst at cfra research you re either going to see a 15 to 20 drop in the offer price to get elon musk engaged again or he continues to play the bot card taking musk to court could be even more damaging to twitter at a time when uncertainty over the deal and what the billionaire s ownership might mean are weighing heavily on the company morale is already low and some employees are leaving ceo parag agrawal has shaken up his executive ranks and announced a hiring freeze and spending cuts going to court doesn t bode well for the business prospects of your company and it further adds uncertainty to the employee base zino said that s also a risk for musk lipton said what if he has to buy the company and now he s kind of undermined it at the same time ultimately she said the billionaire s antics however chaotic appear to have a single goal i don t think he s committed to winning i think he s committing to not spending 44 billion on

wall street s key concern centers around the federal reserve s effort to rein in inflation and the risk its plan could send the economy into a recession mary altaffer associated press wall street capped a winning week with a sputtering finish friday as stocks waffled after a stronger than expected report on the u s jobs market the standard poor s 500 slipped 0 1 after earlier flipping between a loss of 0 9 and a gain of 0 4 despite its weak finish the benchmark index delivered just its third winning week in the last 14 the surprisingly strong jobs report showed that employers are continuing to hire despite worries about a possible recession however the hotter the economy remains the more likely the federal reserve is to continue raising interest rates sharply in its fight against inflation treasury yields shot higher immediately after the release of the jobs data underscoring expectations of fed rate hikes but then eased back the yield on the two year treasury jumped as high as 3 15 from 3 03 late thursday but it then moderated to 3 11 the 10 year yield which influences rates on mortgages and other consumer loans rose to 3 08 from 3 a day earlier the dow jones industrial average slipped 0 1 while the nasdaq composite rose 0 1 after swinging between a loss of 1 2 and a 0 6 gain the technology and other high growth companies that make up a big chunk of the nasdaq index have been some of the most vulnerable to rising rates recently both indexes also notched a gain for the week something that s been rare in recent months as the market s downturn gained momentum today we just have a little reversal because rates popped over 3 on this strong employment report said jay hatfield chief executive of infrastructure capital advisors wall street s key concern centers on the federal reserve s effort to rein in inflation and the risk that its plan could send the economy into a recession the central bank has already hiked its key overnight interest rate three times this year and the increases have become increasingly aggressive last month it raised rates by the sharpest degree since 1994 by three quarters of a percentage point to a range of 1 50 to 1 75 it was at virtually zero as recently as march by making it more expensive to borrow the fed has already slowed some parts of the economy the housing market has cooled in particular as mortgage rates rise because of the fed s actions other parts of the economy have also shown signs of flagging and confidence has fallen sharply among consumers as they contend with the highest inflation in four decades the hope on wall street had been that the recently mixed data on the economy could convince the federal reserve to take it easier on rate hikes this week s reprieve from soaring prices for oil and other commodities helped strengthen such hopes but friday s jobs report may have undercut them the choppy trading friday comes ahead of a key report wednesday on inflation at the consumer level the consumer price index which in may came in at the highest level since 1981 is projected to show an increase of 8 8 over the 12 months that ended in june according to factset i don t think anybody wants to get super long over the weekend going into the cpi hatfield said raising interest rates slows the economy by design and the fed s intent is to do so enough to force down inflation it s a sharp reversal from policy during the pandemic which was to keep rates low in order to support economic growth the danger is that rate hikes are a notoriously blunt tool with long lag times before their full effects are seen and the fed risks causing a recession if it acts too aggressively you can t just raise rates and reduce the balance sheet without it doing the opposite of what it did before said jerry braakman chief investment officer of first american trust when you do the reverse you can expect it will do the opposite as well other central banks around the world are also raising interest rates and removing emergency plans put in place early in the pandemic to prop up financial markets one closely watched signal in the u s bond market is continuing to warn of a possible recession the yield on the two year treasury this week topped the yield on the 10 year treasury and remained that way on friday it s a relatively rare occurrence that some see as a precursor for a recession within a year or two other warning signals in the bond market which focus on shorter term yields are not flashing though even if the fed can pull off the delicate task of crushing inflation and avoiding a recession higher interest rates push down on prices for stocks bonds cryptocurrencies and all kinds of investments in the meantime following friday s jobs report traders are universally betting the fed will raise the target for its short term interest rate by at least three quarters of a percentage point at its meeting later this month according to cme group that would match june s big move a small number of traders are even betting on an increase of a full percentage point a week ago no one was predicting that big a move and some traders were thinking an increase of just half
