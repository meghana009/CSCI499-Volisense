at the initiative of the republic of kazakhstan the un declared august 29 as the international day against nuclear tests universally adopted in 2009 while many of those discussing the possible use of nuclear weapons including mutually assured destruction mad tactical nuclear weapons and nuclear utilization target selection nuts and are modernizing and improving their nuclear capacity most of them know almost nothing about nuclear warfare and its consequences for humankind in contrast the people of kazakhstan and their leaders have witnessed many nuclear tests carried out at the semipalatinsk nuclear test site for 40 years 1949 1989 from pervaya molniya first lightning on august 29 1949 there were 456 tests at semipalatinsk 340 underground and 116 above ground kazakhstan and its 1 5 million citizens have suffered from all the negative consequences of nuclear tests early death lifelong debilitating illnesses and horrific birth defects including jelly babies and children born without limbs with good reason kazakhstan signed and ratified the treaty on prohibition of nuclear weapons and was among the original 50 states party to the treaty on its independence day kazakhstan inherited 1 400 soviet nuclear warheads and quickly relinquished them emphasizing that security is better achieved through disarmament and negotiation kazakhstan also initiated a global moment of silence to honor all victims of nuclear weapons testing at 11 05 kazakhstan time on august 29 at 11 05 a m the clock shows v standing for victory the elimination of nuclear weapons is truly a victory for humankind on july 9 1955 the russell einstein manifesto signed by 11 outstanding scientists was issued stressing here is the problem we present to you stark dreadful and inescapable shall we put an end to the human race or shall mankind renounce war remember your humanity and forget the rest kazakh president kassym jomart kemelevich tokayev responded to a wave of protests with repressive and violent actions credit pavel mikheyev reuters why start wars why do we still waste enormous resources on developing weapons that soon become obsolete why do we start wars war is immoral illegal and useless all wars that were fought from the end of world war two did not achieve their objectives with the possible exception of the first gulf war the superpowers involved had to admit failure and there are many korea vietnam laos cambodia many latin american wars constant conflicts between israel and arab states iraq syria libya afghanistan and now ukraine our world today is the best ever but very vulnerable and self destructive the massive destruction of the natural environment and human capital is constantly dissipating our one and only habitat most threats and dangers affecting our world are global bio extinction climate change extreme weather pollution insufficient energy and food insecurity damaging natural resources leads to the destruction of human capital as well a shortage of food and enormous inequality leaving millions of people excluded and marginalized practically creating a modern slave class increasing human capital leads to education research creativity and knowledge most countries do not assure enough resources to achieve these conditions kazakhstan is among the better ones with 150 universities two of them rated on top academic lists yet we were never as close to doomsday as we are today expressed by the doomsday clock introduced in 1947 and put at seven minutes to midnight which symbolizes the human made catastrophe the doomsday clock since 2020 is at 100 seconds and most likely will deteriorate the recent conflicts in europe and asia will probably abbreviate it further the manifesto was primarily inspired by nuclear weapons threats caused by the us and the ussr but nowadays nine countries possess nuclear weapons we are closer to world nuclear war than ever in a fast changing world empires will not save us from weapons of mass destruction inflicted upon us the solution is hidden in alliances the comprehensive test ban treaty ctbt is an excellent example to be emulated it is imperative to forbid all production selling and distribution of any weapons but today a large stock of weapons is waiting to be sold globally while sovereign states maintain more and more armaments this situation raises a question should sovereign states be allowed to research and develop new weapons my answer is unambiguous all novel weapons should be under total control of global inspection regardless of the origin country of production the un structure has been fairly successful but it still needs considerable improvements who is kassym jomart tokayev among world leaders kassym jomart tokayev president of kazakhstan holds the most relevant record for that vision tokayev started his nuclear disarmament campaign long ago as the foreign minister and prime minister of kazakhstan tokayev played an active role in the field of nuclear non proliferation in 1995 and 2005 he participated in the review conferences for the treaty on the non proliferation of nuclear weapons in new york in 1996 he signed the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty and in 2005 the treaty on a nuclear weapons free zone in central asia on march 2011 the un announced the appointment of tokayev as director general of the un office in geneva and personal representative of the united nations secretary general to the conference on disarmament he served as secretary general of the conference on disarmament and as the director general of the un office in geneva from 2011 to 2013 where he led the global fight against nuclear weapons in december 2001 on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the nobel prize 110 nobel laureates expressed their vision for the world s next hundred years if we permit the devastating power of modern weaponry to spread through this combustible human landscape we invite a conflagration that can engulf both rich and poor the only hope for the future lies in cooperative international action legitimized by democracy we must persist in the quest for united action to counter both global warming and a weaponized world three threats indeed societal global threats and challenges can be aggregated into three groups the first pertains to violence and wars if we are clever we could avoid them however human error terror and stupidity should not be underestimated the russian ukraine war going on for half a year should stop immediately and be peacefully resolved around the negotiation table the second threat deals with the destruction of natural and human capital humankind can still save itself if we change the economic and political route for zero arrogance zero ignorance and zero violence the third threat concerns new disruptive cutting edge technologies the un general assembly unanimously adopted its most important document in 2015 named transforming our world the 2030 agenda for sustainable development the 41 page document is an action plan for the planet s prosperity it seeks to strengthen universal peace for greater freedom and recognizes that eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions is the greatest global challenge and an indispensable requirement for sustainable development the preamble noted that all countries and all stakeholders acting in collaborative partnership will implement this plan the republic of kazakhstan the world s ninth largest country stretching from russia to china can be such a role model kazakhstan s 20 million population consists of multiple different nationalities religions and ethnic groups living together peacefully against the backdrop of the current global turbulence kazakhstan is rapidly transforming under tokayev s leadership into a normative presidential state democratizing modernizing and decentralizing its governance systems and economy the august 29 international day against nuclear tests originally initiated by kazakhstan as well as the upcoming september 13 15 congress of leaders of world and traditional religions in nur sultan are great opportunities to promote these agendas worldwide they are two pivotal opportunities that are occurring at the right place and time the writer a nuclear and particle physicist is the honorary president of the world academy of art and science he is a member of croatia s academia europaea the macedonian academies of science and the european leadership network he is a supporter of the campaign for democratic reform in the un as well as the creation of a more accountable

forecasting ability i just found it a very unsatisfactory description he told cnbc s squawk box monday siegel also said he d like to know more about what statistics the fed is looking at now to gauge inflation and chart its potential path forward as he s worried about the lag in many economic data reports if waits for the official statistics to really start coming down to 2 he will overtighten and he will make the same mistake on the downside as he made on being too slow on restricting liquidity in 2021 and 2022 siegel said siegel s view is that the fed probably has another 100 basis points or one percentage point left of tightening before it begins to cut rates probably next year he said carmen reinicke catalent falls more than 8 premarket the pharmaceutical company catalent saw its shares

market is earnings morgan stanley s wilson says morgan stanley s michael wilson said in a note monday that while powell s remarks friday may have dented stocks the market s biggest risk is still corporate earnings the path for stocks from here will be determined by earnings where we still see material downside the bank s chief u s equity strategist said almost all of the weakness for stocks during 1h22 was due to the fed and tighter financial conditions the 2h outcome will ultimately be determined by earnings expectations for next year in our view as a result equity investors should be laser focused on this risk not the fed particularly as we enter the seasonally weakest time of the year for earnings revisions and inflation further eats into margins and demand he said fred imbert

the central bank s commitment to rate hikes while powell has said that he has hoped to achieve a soft landing he made clear on friday that the fed is prepared to hike interest rates even if it causes economic pain while higher interest rates slower growth and softer labor market conditions will bring down inflation they will also bring some pain to households and businesses he said in prepared

i am not a big fan of fish n chips but give me tips and strips and i am very happy having grown up vegetarian in india i came to the united states when i was 18 the only on campus job i could get was flipping burgers at the red door café at caltech where i was told by the café boss that i had to flip em not eat em adapting to the times the red door now offers smoked tofu hummus grain salad and other vegan menu items hard work at the burger joint paid off and i was sort of promoted to be waiter at the caltech athenaeum where i had the distinct pleasure of serving and once spilling soup on the richard feynman the nobel prize winning physicist working in a student cafeteria gave me optionality i e come whatever i knew i was going to be able to at least survive on my own and this resulted in convexity i e large gains from small but important decisions at the right time lots of upside potential with limited downside i would like to discuss a couple of items on the government bond menu today that provide a similar kind of asymmetric risk reward tip tip s treasury inflation protected securities and strips separate trading of registered interest and principal of securities as of this writing they offer meaty yield and above all convexity under uncertain macro economic conditions under the specter of a resolute fed that might end up breaking financial markets to correct its massive errors in managing monetary policy and inflation this choice provides a lot of protein for carb stock overloaded stock heavy portfolios first tips as i wrote a couple of weeks ago in this forum tips pay a real coupon rate which is typically quite low since real yields equal nominal yields minus inflation but the principal of these securities increases with inflation based on the cpi inflation rate for tips etfs like ishares tip the increased principal is actually paid every month so if inflation is running at 8 say each month the increased principal assuming nothing else changes will result in a distribution to the tips holder of record a coupon of 8 12 from the inflation component of course if inflation falls to zero there would be no inflation compensation so an etf like tip currently offers an indicated yield of over 10 source bloomberg and this is for a treasury which has no credit risk if inflation is a tax on the common person then for tips holders the payout is a tax refund of sorts tips are a call option on inflation next strips strips are basically zero coupon bonds that are the building blocks of regular treasuries stripped away from their parent treasuries for your consumption pleasure as a matter of routine the treasury issues bonds that both have a coupon and principal due to demand from those who want bullet cashflows on one day in the future for example a lump sum payment against a single insurance obligation or to pay a defeasance the government allows dealers to strip out the principal and the intermediate coupons slap a new label on them and sell them as separate stripped bonds i have previously called these type of zero coupon bonds the god particle of finance because they ultimately are the building block of all financial instrument prices because the principal strips belong to a specific bond while the coupon strips can originate from many different bonds with the same coupon dates there is a premium to the principal p strips over the coupon c strips in terms of a lower yield on the p strips in the table below i show the 3 coupon full bond issued in 2014 along with its zero coupon strips as an example source bloomberg as of august 26 2022 author for our discussion the two kinds of strips may be treated the same for example if i were to buy a strip maturing in 2044 as of this writing it would cost me roughly 45 cents on the dollar and in 2044 on maturity date i would get 1 dollar back the reason this is interesting is because of the convexity of the strips relative to the full bond with all the coupons note that the percentage price movement or duration of the strips is more than 50 higher than the full bonds the volatility of interest rates means that long term strips are more convex than equivalent maturity coupon bonds because the intermediate coupon payments don t weigh down the zero coupon bond in this example if yields rise or fall by 100 bps the full bonds will lose 14 37 points while the zero coupon bond will lose 9 7 points convexity rises with volatility so in a sense similar to options strips provide a call option on long term interest rate volatility so there we have it tips are a call option on inflation rising and strips are a call option on yield volatility rising with inflation raging the fed pledging to fight it at all costs and a lot of macroeconomic uncertainty the ability to own call options against macroeconomic volatility can be had today in the bond markets with tips and strips while receiving a nice yield at the same time it s the equivalent of offering both burgers and vegan items on the menu something everyone can like lots of good protein for your portfolio and healthy at the same time

friday speech at jackson hole wharton professor jeremy siegel is worried that the central bank may hike interest rates too much and throw the u s economy into a recession powell noted that there could be some pain ahead as the fed looks to combat high inflation that sentiment was far too negative according to siegel adding that he s not confident in powell s forecasting ability i just found it a very unsatisfactory description he told cnbc s squawk box monday siegel also said he d like to know more about what statistics the fed is looking at now to gauge inflation and chart its potential path forward as he s worried about the lag in many economic data reports if waits for the official statistics to really start coming down to 2 he will overtighten and he will make the same mistake on the downside as he made on being too slow on restricting liquidity in 2021 and 2022 siegel said siegel s view is that the fed probably has another 100 basis points or one percentage point left of tightening before it begins to cut rates probably next year he said carmen reinicke catalent falls more than 8 premarket the pharmaceutical company catalent saw its shares fall about 8 7 after

been flattish and bond yields have trended higher and the curve has become increasingly inverted he said in a note to investors sunday we expect more volatility as we enter fall and winter as we suspect earnings expectations will start weakening more severely offset by inflation headlines central bank hawkishness weakening as well tanaya macheel biggest risk to market is earnings morgan stanley s wilson says morgan stanley s michael wilson said in a note monday that while powell s remarks friday may have dented stocks the market s biggest risk is still corporate earnings the path for stocks from here will be determined by earnings where we still see material downside the bank s chief u s equity strategist said almost all of the weakness for stocks during 1h22 was due to the fed and tighter financial conditions the 2h outcome will ultimately be determined by earnings expectations for next year in our view as a result equity investors should be laser focused on this risk not the fed particularly as we enter the seasonally weakest time of the year for earnings revisions and inflation further eats into margins and demand he said fred imbert expect more market choppiness ahead rbc s calvasina says rbc s lori calvasina said investors should brace for more market volatility in the near term in terms of stock market direction we think it s more likely than not that us

markets yet to price in a recession ing says the negative reaction in the stock market following fed chairman jerome powell s speech shows that higher rates haven t been reflected in equity prices according to rob carnell head of research at ing on friday powell reiterated that the central bank will continue raising rates to subdue inflationary pressures warning there may be some pain ahead as these measures take hold powell s saying you need a recession to get this under control to get inflation down and i think that s really where the equity market has to start thinking what s the right price for the u s in a recession with high rates thrown in carnell said on cnbc s capital connection realistically that means some sort of recession he said the only big question is how bad how long

morningstar s analyst david meats isn t positive on it zavier ong powell s hawkish stance investors on friday appeared to be spooked by fed chair jerome powell s firm statements about the central bank s commitment to rate hikes while powell has said that he has hoped to achieve a soft landing he made clear on friday that the fed is prepared to hike interest rates even if it causes economic pain while higher interest rates slower growth and softer labor market conditions will bring down inflation they will also bring some pain to households and businesses he said in prepared remarks these are the unfortunate costs of reducing inflation but a failure to restore price stability would mean far greater pain jesse pound futures open lower the negative momentum from friday appears to have lasted

while some supermajors prefer passing out dividends others prefer buybacks as away to consolidate voting shares and the tax benefits that come along with the strategy oil and gas supermajors are on course to repurchase their shares at near record levels this year thanks to soaring oil and gas prices helping them to deliver bumper profits and boost returns for investors according to data from bernstein research the seven supermajors including exxonmobil nyse xom chevron nyse cvx bp nyse bp and shell nyse shel are poised to return 38bn to shareholders through buyback programmes this year with investment bank rbc capital markets putting the total figure even higher at 41bn in 2014 when oil was trading over 100 barrel we only saw 21 billion in buybacks this year s figure rivals that of 2008 but here s another interesting thing big oil s capex and production have remained mostly flat despite reporting record second quarter profits data from the u s energy information administration eia shows that big oil companies downshifted both capital spending and production for the second quarter an eia review of 53 public u s gas and oil companies responsible for about 34 of domestic production showed a 5 decline in capital expenditures in the second quarter vs q1 this year meanwhile crude oil production has increased 10 q q but remained flat compared to q4 2021 despite an 86 jump in cash flows to 25 7 billion some oil and gas majors are prefering to return excess cash to shareholders in the form of fat dividends for instance conocophillips nyse cop announced during its second quarter earnings call that it will pay shareholders 1 40 per share in a special dividend on october 14 for perspective that s nearly three times its regular quarterly dividend of 0 46 however in many cases big oil companies prefer buybacks to dividends for several reasons first off buybacks effectively reduce a company s outstanding shares while propping demand for the stock consequently the smaller number of shares automatically increases earnings per share eps since the company s earnings are distributed among fewer shares additionally there is a tax efficiency element here as a method of returning capital to shareholders buybacks are preferred because there are no additional taxes on the sale process as opposed to dividends that get taxed up to 20 for buybacks the tax applies only to the actual sale of shares another big consideration for the oil majors buybacks deliver more voting leverage back into the hands of companies something that exxon shareholders understand only too well when activist investor engine 1 was able to push for the company to diversify the oil company away from fossil fuel by having three of its members sitting on the board here s a rundown of how big oil companies have been repurchasing shares exxon mobil exxon mobil corp has been using the strength of its balance sheet to return significant capital to its shareholders via dividends and share buybacks and has announced plans to continue such distributions going forward exxon returned 7 6 billion to shareholders during the second quarter through dividends and share buybacks with 3 9 billion for share repurchases and 3 7 billion going into dividends year to date exxon has repurchases amounting to 6 billion and eyes repurchasing up to 30 billion shares through 2023 we re definitely focused on being efficient as we look to return capital to shareholders exxonmobil cfo kathryn mickells told investors exxon mobil reported cash flow from operations of 20 billion for the april june period while capex reached 4 6 billion in q2 2022 exxon s capex is running at 9 5 billion year to date and the company expects capex to fall between 21 billion 24 billion reflecting increased investment in chemical and short cycle projects with strong returns exxon produced 3 7 million oil equivalent barrels per day in the second quarter a 4 increase from the first quarter however exxon mobil cautioned that expanding output any further is unlikely with ceo daren woods saying the refining market is extremely tight and that growing supply will not happen overnight chevron chevron has spent nearly 4 billion repurchasing its own shares in the first half of the year the company however is targeting a lot more and has raised the upper limit of its buyback target for the full year to 15 billion up from 10 billion previously wall street was not expecting such a big expansion of the buyback program after chevron raised its guidance in may to the top end of its 5 billion 10 billion range we think we can do it all grow the dividend to investors grow traditional and new energy pay down debt and buy back shares when we have cash in excess of those first three priorities we buy back shares we ll continue buybacks even when the commodity cycle turns down chevron s chief financial officer pierre breber told reuters chevron posted its biggest quarterly earnings ever built on strong fuel margins and high prices for natural gas and oil the oil major posted second quarter net profit of 11 6 billion or 5 95 per diluted share more than triple the 3 1 billion or 1 60 per share for last year s corresponding period chevron s average u s sales price for a barrel of crude oil and natural gas liquids ngls was 89 in the quarter vs 54 a year earlier the california based energy giant produced 1 72 million oil equivalent barrels per day in the second quarter marking a decrease of 266 000 barrels per day vs q2 2021 occidental petroleum occidental petroleum ceo vicki hollub told investors during the company s second quarter earnings call that the company plans to buy back a significant volume of shares or at least we hope to over the next few years we don t feel the need to grow production until we get beyond that point because we feel like one of the best values right now is investment in our own stock related half of uk households will be in fuel poverty by january occidental has paid down much of the debt it took on in 2019 to buy rival anadarko petroleum in the second quarter it paid down 4 8 billion in debt and launched a 3 billion share repurchase program oxy said it spent 1 1 billion to buy back shares through aug 1 the houston based energy company posted an adjusted profit of 3 2 billion or 3 16 per share advertisement occidental petroleum s strategy if pumping oil while it develops technology to reduce carbon emissions from fossil fuels gained a serious vote of confidence after the federal energy regulatory commission approved a request from warren buffett s berkshire hathaway nyse brk a nyse brk b to accumulate as much as a 50 stake in the oil producer shell plc a month ago europe s biggest oil company shell plc extended its share buybacks after its second quarter profits beat an already record breaking previous quarter on the back of soaring crude gas and oil product prices shell announced the commencement of a 6 billion share buyback programme to be executed in q3 2022 after completing buybacks of 8 5 billion in the first half of 2022 high crude prices normally weigh on refining margins yet shell s refining margin virtually tripled to 28 a barrel thanks to tight refined fuel supply shell is on track to exceed the company s guidance for shareholder returns of up to 30 of cash from operations however shell did not raise its dividend from its current level of 25 cents a share good for a modest 4 annual increase after a 60 cut during the pandemic totalenergies totalenergies se announced that it will extend its 2 billion buyback program into the third quarter after profit surged to a record propelled by soaring demand for natural gas in europe and surging gasoline prices that comes on the back of h1 2022 repurchases amounting to 3 billion however totalenergies buybacks have been viewed as being overly conservative by comparison which has limited its share price gains the company reported q2 net profit jumped 2 6x to 5 69b from

washington the united states on sunday denounced russia s cynical obstructionism after moscow blocked adoption of a joint declaration on nuclear non proliferation following lengthy international negotiations at the united nations the nuclear non proliferation treaty npt which 191 signatories review every five years aims to stop the spread of nuclear weapons promote complete disarmament and promote cooperation in the peaceful use of nuclear energy russia on friday prevented the declaration s adoption saying it took issue with political aspects of the text a step criticised by washington after weeks of intensive but productive negotiations the russian federation alone decided to block consensus on a final document at the conclusion of the four week npt review conference state department deputy spokesman vedant patel said in a statement he said moscow s move was done in order to block language that merely acknowledged the grave radiological risk at the zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in ukraine a major atomic facility that is currently occupied by the russian military the latest draft text had expressed grave concern over military activities around ukrainian power plants including zapori zhzhia as well as over ukraine s loss of control of such sites and the negative impact on safety despite russia s cynical obstruction the fact that all other parties supported the final document demonstrates the treaty s essential role in preventing nuclear proliferation the state department s patel said he reiterated washington s call for russia to end its military activity near zaporizhzhia and return control of the plant to ukraine meanwhile neutral and non nuclear austria on saturday condemned the attitude at the talks of major powers and not just russia while three quarters of the 191 signatory states support credible progress for nuclear disarmament it is mainly the nuclear armed states and above all russia which resisted the government in vienna said in a statement it noted that contrary to treaty commitments britain china france russia and the united states are improving or expanding their stock of nuclear weapons published in dawn august 29th 2022
this article is part of the conversation s series looking at labor s jobs summit read the other articles in the series here after 20 years of declining educational standards as well as recent disruptions to migrant flows discussions at this week s jobs summit will rightly emphasise the importance of growing skills but reforms to education policy can take a long time to reap benefits and there is no guarantee that changes to migration policies can rapidly return australia to pre pandemic population intakes this means discussions at the summit should focus not only on growing our stock of talent but also on allocating our existing talent more efficiently in a study entitled better harnessing australia s talent released this morning prepared for the non profit e61 institute we demonstrate that s not yet happening we find there aren t enough people changing jobs there aren t enough new firms being created and there isn t enough competition between firms what we need is for australians to be resigning from jobs and seeking new ones along the lines of the great resignation that was said to be taking place in the united states we find the industries that are the least dynamic where there are the least resignations are the ones where the rate at which productivity growth is turned into wages growth has slipped the most probably because of a decline in worker bargaining power the probability that the average australian worker switches jobs has fallen from 12 8 in the mid 1990s to 9 5 workers that do switch jobs get an 8 pay bump on average and it s better for their mental health switching from a poorly matched to a well matched job gives a boost to reported mental health equivalent to getting married singles take note we also have fewer new companies the rate at which new companies were being created fell from 13 in the mid 2000s to 11 in the mid 2010s industry concentration has increased the share of industry revenue going to the four biggest companies has doubled since 2010 those at the top are safer than ever the probability of a market leader being displaced from the top has declined by about seven percentage points since the mid 2000s so what can we do to make australia more dynamic it needs to be easier to change jobs there s lots we could look at easier job switching we could harmonise and reduce occupational licensing restrictions across states something the states and the commonwealth are working on and remove taxes like stamp duties that make it expensive for people to relocate we could reduce barriers faced by new firms non compete clauses planning and zoning laws and visa quotas are ripe areas for reassessment and we could shift our tax breaks for small business supports towards new small businesses it is young employers not small employers that most create jobs old employers taken together destroy them read more australia s great resignation is a myth we are changing jobs less often penalties for anti competitive conduct and laws restricting mergers in already concentrated markets ought to be strengthened as suggested by assistant treasurer andrew leigh last week but we need to acknowledge that market dynamism is not great for everyone most workers benefit from dynamic markets in jobs in wages and in choice but more dynamism would mean more workers would lose jobs and struggle to get new ones an improved safety net the decline in reported mental health that follows the loss of a job is equivalent to that following a serious injury or illness lost earnings take years to recover we need to consider reforms to our income support system our present system of unemployment benefits offers support but not much insurance for workers considering a change of jobs to meaningfully help workers the summit will need a plan to fix australia s stagnant economy anything less will be addressing the symptoms not the cause the views expressed in this article are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of the e61 institute authors dan andrews visiting fellow and director micro heterogeneity and macroeconomic performance program crawford school of public policy australian national university adam triggs visiting research fellow australian national university gianni la cava senior lecturer in economics macquarie university

mitchell ferman texas tribune texas banned 10 financial firms from doing business with the state after comptroller glenn hegar said wednesday that they did not support the oil and gas industry hegar a republican running for reelection in november banned blackrock inc and other banks and investment firms as well as some investment funds within large banks such as goldman sachs and jp morgan from entering into most contracts with state and local entities after hegar s office said the firms boycott the fossil fuel sector hegar sent inquiries to hundreds of financial companies earlier this year requesting information about whether they were avoiding investments in the oil and gas industry in favor of renewable energy companies the survey was a result of a new texas law that went into effect in september and prohibits most state agencies as well as local governments from contracting with firms that have cut ties with carbon emitting energy companies state pension funds and local governments issuing municipal bonds will have to divest from the companies on the list though there are some exemptions hegar said the environmental social and corporate governance esg movement has produced an opaque and perverse system in which some financial companies no longer make decisions in the best interest of their shareholders or their clients but instead use their financial clout to push a social and political agenda shrouded in secrecy hegar said in a written statement on wednesday new york based blackrock which has publicly embraced investing more in renewable energy criticized hegar s decision this is not a fact based judgment a spokesperson for the company said in a written statement blackrock does not boycott fossil fuels investing over 100 billion in texas energy companies on behalf of our clients proves that elected and appointed public officials have a duty to act in the best interests of the people they serve the spokesperson added politicizing state pension funds restricting access to investments and impacting the financial returns of retirees is not consistent with that duty the other nine companies banned completely are bnp paribas sa a french

value was recently changing hands at roughly 1 430 down more than 4 as investors continued to chew over u s federal reserve chairman jerome powell s vow to continue the monetary hawkishness the fed adopted earlier this year that news disappointed some investors hoping for signs of fed confidence that its steps the last few months were taming inflation and that it might back away from its recent diet of 75 basis point interest rate hikes the macroeconomic uncertainties continued to weigh on the price of btc and while the data came in negative giving market hopes that the fed could take a less aggressive stance moving forward fed chair s talk on friday dashed those hopes as he cautioned against premature policy loosening joe dipasquale of crypto asset manager bitbull capital wrote to coindesk the market has reacted negatively to those comments and we re seeing bitcoin testing the 20 000 support most other major cryptos were recently in the red with avax and atom down more than 9 and 6 respectively xmr rose about a percentage point on friday bitcoin fell precipitously from the 21 000 perch it held throughout the working week as powell noted that inflation remains a serious threat he said that reducing inflation is likely to require a sustained period of below trend growth that would create softer labor markets among other impacts the ongoing strength of the job market has suggested repeatedly that the economy has not fallen into recession the 3 5 unemployment rate is the lowest level since february 2020 while higher interest rates slower growth and softer labor market conditions will bring down inflation they will also bring some pain to households and businesses powell said we are moving our policy stance purposefully to a level that will be sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 powell said equities and crypto news cryptos in the late week fall tracked equity markets which closed substantially lower on friday with the tech focused nasdaq

ongoing crypto winter grayscale investments is a digital asset management firm owned by digital currency group which also owns coindesk bitbull s dipasquale wrote that monday s opening for equities will be key as any more downside there could push btc toward the recent lows we will be watching for the market s reactions to new lows and aiming to accumulate btc between 20 000 and 15 000 he wrote biggest gainers there are no gainers in coindesk 20 today biggest losers insights here s how fed observers viewed powell s jackson hole speech by james rubin speeches by u s central bank chairs receive more scrutiny than any others by public officials except for u s presidential addresses they also draw some of the strongest reactions by analysts investors and others who make a living observing monetary policy and the economy even by these standards jerome powell s remarks at the fed s economic symposium on friday drew particular attention coming amid a flood of often confounding economic indicators including july s decline in the consumer price index cpi suggesting that inflation which reached a 40 year high the previous month was waning would powell be a hawk or signal a softening in interest rate hikes he sharpened his claws in the strongest terms powell said that inflation remained a menace to economic well being and that the fed would continue raising rates we will keep at it until we are confident the job is done he said here s how a few commentators from major research and financial services groups view powell s comments and the likely future impact of ongoing monetary hawkishness they won t want to be remembered as the central bank that missed inflation or even spurred inflation higher said brian o reilly head of market strategy at mediolanum international funds told the wall street journal the process won t be painless and i think he s being more upfront about that said neil dutta head of u s economics at renaissance macro research told the new york times the likelihood of recession is rising because that s the solution to the inflation problem that s what they re telling you powell is not budging on having restrictive policy and that should mean the economy will steadily weaken going forward oanda senior market analyst edward moya wrote in an email powell drove home the point that when they are done raising rates that we should expect them to stay there for a long period of time there was no dovish pivot but it seems financial markets are getting close to fully pricing in the remaining fed rate hikes in essence powell is clearly stating

there are signs that the global supply chain dysfunction that has been a key driver in global inflation rates rising to levels not seen in decades is easing credit bloomberg the pandemic has disrupted global supply chains with some of those changes appearing structural and permanent as governments and businesses have responded to the vulnerabilities covid 19 exposed pre pandemic china s rise and its dominance of consumer goods in particular built on low labour costs and in an increasingly globalised trade environment had been a major factor in several decades of unusually low inflation china s singular and ineffective response to outbreaks of covid and the start of a decoupling of the us and chinese economies as geopolitical tensions rise have added to both the supply chain issues and the structural changes occurring in global trade then of course there has been the russian invasion of ukraine and its dramatic impacts on global energy and food markets some of which are likely to be permanent europe won t allow itself to become dependent on russian energy again us rates are going to have to be increased further and remain at elevated levels longer even as powell delivered last year s address it was obvious the fed was being too complacent and was misreading the nature of the inflationary spiral subsequent events have compounded the damage of that misjudgment and the fed s belated recognition of its mistakes have come too late to prevent the us inflation rate from peaking above 9 per cent that means and it seems powell and his colleagues now accept us rates are going to have to be increased further and remain at elevated levels longer than might otherwise be the case even if that leads to a rise in unemployment or a full blown recession given the bluntness of monetary policy tools interest rates and the availability of credit the fed is going to have to clobber demand to bring it into line with the reduced supply powell on friday referred to the us experience in the early 1980s when after a number of half hearted attempts by the fed to lower inflation that soared after the oil shocks in the 1970s paul volcker drove the fed s policy rate up to almost 20 per cent he engineered a recession during which us unemployment peaked in double digits before the inflation rate and unemployment rate began trending down and ushered in decades of low inflation our aim is to avoid that outcome by acting with resolve now powell said at jackson hole we are taking forceful and rapid steps to moderate demand so that it comes into better alignment with supply and to keep inflation expectations anchored we will keep at it until we are confident the job is done his comments drove a 3 4 per cent fall in the s p 500 index and a 3 94 per cent slump in the tech heavy nasdaq index and therefore could be interpreted as being successful in forcing investors to reconsider their expectations of a soft landing for the usa economy next year investors however don t appear to have fully bought the narrative that the fed will keep rates higher for longer regardless of the consequences for the economy and markets the sharemarket is now about 5 7 per cent off its peak this month and this year but is still about 10 per cent above its starting point this year loading investors are still relatively optimistic about the prospect of avoiding recession and rate cuts in the second half of next year which is not what the fed wants if it is to deflate expectations of inflation and convince market participants that it won t blink if they stage a tantrum against rising rates and shrinking liquidity the fed will of course have to follow through on its newly adopted hawkishness if it and powell are to regain the credibility they lost with their misreading of events last year the next meeting of the fed s open market committee towards the end of september could be critical powell had indicated previously that after 75 basis point increases at the past two meeting of the committee the fed might be done with super charged rises the markets were pricing in a 50 basis point increase next month our decision at the september meeting will depend on the totality of the incoming data and the evolving outlook powell said on friday adding that at some point as the stance of monetary policy tightens further it likely will become appropriate to slow the pace of increases
us blasts cynical russia for blocking un nuclear text in this file photo taken on june 2 2020 white steam billows from the cattenom nuclear power plant at sunset in cattenom eastern france washington united states the united states on sunday denounced russia s cynical obstructionism after moscow blocked adoption of a joint declaration on nuclear non proliferation following lengthy international negotiations at the united nations the nuclear non proliferation treaty npt which 191 signatories review every five years aims to stop the spread of nuclear weapons promote complete disarmament and promote cooperation in the peaceful use of nuclear energy russia on friday prevented the declaration s adoption saying it took issue with political aspects of the text a step criticized by washington after weeks of intensive but productive negotiations the russian federation alone decided to block consensus on a final document at the conclusion of the four week npt review conference state department deputy spokesman vedant patel said in a statement he said moscow s move was done in order to block language that merely acknowledged the grave radiological risk at the zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in ukraine a major atomic facility that is currently occupied by the russian military the latest draft text had expressed grave concern over military activities around ukrainian power plants including zaporizhzhia as well as over ukraine s loss of control of such sites and the negative impact on safety zaporizhzhia the largest nuclear power station in europe was seized by russian troops in early march shortly after moscow launched its deadly invasion of ukraine on february 24 the facility is near the battlefront in ukraine s southeast kyiv and moscow have repeatedly traded accusations of shelling at the plant and its operator has warned of the risks of a radioactive leak despite russia s cynical obstruction the fact that all other parties supported the final document demonstrates the treaty s essential role in preventing nuclear proliferation the state department s patel said he reiterated washington s call for russia to end its military activity near zaporizhzhia and return control of the plant to ukraine meanwhile neutral and non nuclear austria on saturday condemned the attitude at the talks of major powers and not just russia while three quarters of the 191 signatory states support credible progress for nuclear disarmament it is mainly the nuclear armed states and above all russia which resisted the government in vienna said in a statement it noted that contrary to treaty commitments britain china france russia and the united states are improving or expanding their stock of nuclear weapons
file photo the asian development bank headquarters stands in manila the philippines jan 4 2012 on july 2 1997 the thai baht collapsed after waves of speculative attacks the government had run out of foreign currency and become unable to support its exchange rate peg to the us dollar so it floated the baht which went into free fall a wave of financial and nonfinancial thai corporates that had borrowed heavily in dollars filed for bankruptcy the asian financial crisis had begun unable to service their foreign debt thailand indonesia and south korea turned to the international monetary fund for support but the imf s rescue packages were too little too late and came with excessively harsh conditions east asia it increasingly appeared would be better off saving itself the region certainly had resources though some countries like thailand were running current account deficits east asia as a whole ran an external surplus so in september 1997 japan proposed pooling the region s foreign exchange reserves and using them to rescue ailing countries the asian monetary fund that would be established to manage this facility would it was promised move faster and impose less stringent conditions than the imf but the united states and the imf objected to the initiative and the amf was stillborn nevertheless regional actors did not give up on cooperation in may 2000 the 10 asean countries brunei cambodia indonesia laos malaysia myanmar the philippines singapore thailand and vietnam plus china japan and south korea asean 3 signed the chiang mai initiative the region s first currency swap arrangement by enabling countries to swap their local currencies for us dollars for a fixed period of time the cmi was supposed to help regional borrowers overcome short term liquidity challenges thereby serving as a complement to the imf this opened the way for the fulfillment of the amf s promise in 2009 the cmi became the chiang mai initiative multilateralization a multilateral reserve pooling program totaling 120 billion in 2014 the facility was expanded to 240 billion another milestone came in 2002 when asean 3 launched the asian bond markets initiative in the hope that a regional bond market would strengthen financial stability reduce vulnerability to capital flow reversals mitigate currency and maturity mismatches and counter overbanking in march this year emerging east asia s local currency bond market was worth 23 5 trillion in 2005 the asian development bank proposed the most ambitious attempt at regional financial cooperation the asian currency unit a basket of the asean 3 currencies the acu was devised as an anchor to which countries in the region could tether their own currencies thereby deterring competitive devaluations and enabling countries in the region to float their currencies collectively against the us dollar this would enable faster adjustment of current account imbalances and promote regional trade and financial flows building on the asian currency unit idea a group of japanese economists devised a supplementary concept the asian monetary unit whose value would reflect a weighted average of east asian currencies however while asian academics welcomed the proposals as possible first steps toward the creation of a common regional currency neither the asian currency unit nor the asian monetary unit has gained traction among policymakers unfortunately asian financial cooperation has been losing momentum in recent years for several reasons first the need for regional liquidity support has become less urgent most of the asean 3 countries run current account surpluses most of the time and the region had accumulated some 3 7 trillion in foreign exchange reserves by the time the global financial crisis erupted in 2008 a more than sixfold increase from the 542 billion they held in 1997 second although the asian bond market has made impressive headway over the past 10 years the development of local currency bond markets is driven by domestic financial needs rather than regional financial cooperation and cross border local currency bonds are rarely issued in fact individual countries financial development has significantly outpaced the development of infrastructure for the cross border issuance of local currency bonds as a result factors like nonstandardized regulations inadequate market liquidity and a lack of an effective securities settlement system continue to hinder the development of cross border issuance of local currency bonds in the region third since the asian financial crisis most east asian countries have adopted a managed floating exchange rate regime but none of them have pegged their currencies to a basket of east asian currencies based on the asian currency unit largely because they are unwilling to accept constraints on their exchange rates for the sake of exchange rate stabilization among regional currencies more broadly greater economic and financial cooperation is vital to asia s long term prosperity yet pursuing it including the possible formation of an east asian economic community is fundamentally a political not an economic question because of east asian countries close geographic vicinity and economic connectivity asean 3 governments should urgently put the endeavor that began 25 years ago back on their agendas the author former president of the

this article is part of the conversation s series looking at labor s jobs summit read the other articles in the series here after 20 years of declining educational standards as well as recent disruptions to migrant flows discussions at this week s jobs summit will rightly emphasise the importance of growing skills but reforms to education policy can take a long time to reap benefits and there is no guarantee that changes to migration policies can rapidly return australia to pre pandemic population intakes this means discussions at the summit should focus not only on growing our stock of talent but also on allocating our existing talent more efficiently in a study entitled better harnessing australia s talent released this morning prepared for the non profit e61 institute we demonstrate that s not yet happening we find there aren t enough people changing jobs there aren t enough new firms being created and there isn t enough competition between firms what we need is for australians to be resigning from jobs and seeking new ones along the lines of the great resignation that was said to be taking place in the united states we find the industries that are the least dynamic where there are the least resignations are the ones where the rate at which productivity growth is turned into wages growth has slipped the most probably because of a decline in worker bargaining power the probability that the average australian worker switches jobs has fallen from 12 8 in the mid 1990s to 9 5 workers that do switch jobs get an 8 pay bump on average and it s better for their mental health switching from a poorly matched to a well matched job gives a boost to reported mental health equivalent to getting married singles take note we also have fewer new companies the rate at which new companies were being created fell from 13 in the mid 2000s to 11 in the mid 2010s industry concentration has increased the share of industry revenue going to the four biggest companies has doubled since 2010 those at the top are safer than ever the probability of a market leader being displaced from the top has declined by about seven percentage points since the mid 2000s so what can we do to make australia more dynamic it needs to be easier to change jobs there s lots we could look at easier job switching we could harmonise and reduce occupational licensing restrictions across states something the states and the commonwealth are working on and remove taxes like stamp duties that make it expensive for people to relocate we could reduce barriers faced by new firms non compete clauses planning and zoning laws and visa quotas are ripe areas for reassessment and we could shift our tax breaks for small business supports towards new small businesses it is young employers not small employers that most create jobs old employers taken together destroy them read more australia s great resignation is a myth we are changing jobs less often penalties for anti competitive conduct and laws restricting mergers in already concentrated markets ought to be strengthened as suggested by assistant treasurer andrew leigh last week but we need to acknowledge that market dynamism is not great for everyone most workers benefit from dynamic markets in jobs in wages and in choice but more dynamism would mean more workers would lose jobs and struggle to get new ones an improved safety net the decline in reported mental health that follows the loss of a job is equivalent to that following a serious injury or illness lost earnings take years to recover we need to consider reforms to our income support system our present system of unemployment benefits offers support but not much insurance for workers considering a change of jobs to meaningfully help workers the summit will need a plan to fix australia s stagnant economy anything less will be addressing the symptoms not the cause the views expressed in this article are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of the e61 institute authors dan andrews visiting fellow and director micro heterogeneity and macroeconomic performance program crawford school of public policy australian national university adam triggs visiting research fellow australian national university gianni la cava senior lecturer in economics macquarie university
oxford a poor performance or a crash in a heat can snuff out any driver s dream of getting into the oxford 250 but last year s champion cassius clark not only made the cut but won his heat at oxford plains speedway on sunday we had a good draw and started on the pole said clark who was racing for the first time of the season i was able to maintain so we will have a good start at the top of the feature we were off a little bit from where we wanted to be but it was a good run we will make some adjustments for the race and we should be in good shape hopefully it will be a good race for the fans and a good race for us clark wasn t as fortunate in the main event however he was near the front during most of the first half of the race but was forced to retire early because of transmission issues he was one of many former champions whose 250s were cut short travis benjamin and glen luce failed to make the field and ben rowe was taken out by a fuel cell issue curtis gerry spun out soon after taking the lead and eddie macdonald had an early flat tire but both battled back to the top three tim brackett of buckfield made the cut but his son tj crashed and was knocked out of the race because of damage to his car advertisement our race wasn t very good but it was good enough tim brackett said the coming out of the sun changed the track this track is really temperature sensitive and when the sun comes out of the clouds it ain t good tim brackett initially fell one spot short of qualifying the top four in each of the five heats moved on but he was bumped up to fourth with the heat s runner up mike hopkins failed the postrace technical inspection he bowed out of the oxford 250 after 83 laps and finished 40th of 42 cars a fine young racer this was 17 year old isaac bevin s first oxford 250 and he was loving every minute of it bevin is the son of matt bevin who served as kentucky governor from 2015 19 and their family enjoys spending time in maine isaac bevin was smitten by cars as a child and hasn t lost that passion advertisement i have always loved cars bevin said if there is any chance i could be around a car i would be one day we went to a little car track for just recreational stuff and i got hooked ever since then then january of 2020 i started racing legend cars then 2021 was late model stocks and legends and here i am running supers in the northeast bevin missed out on qualifying through the heats consolation races and last chance qualifier bevin like tim brackett said oxford plains speedway is finicky and weather sensitive related 49th annual oxford 250 results everything can change about it in an instant bevin said during qualifying everyone here is good it is a difficult track to master it will be hard to get in but if we can make the show that is the main part canadians in the dark randy millican and dwayne moore fans from st john new brunswick were watching the races at oxford plains speedway on saturday when the lights went out advertisement i have never been at a track when the power went out millican said thank god it was a yellow under caution so the cars were going slow if they were going fast it would have been a nightmare the power went out at about 9 45 p m when a vehicle hit a utility pole on french road in oxford it took about an hour get the power back on at oxford plains moore said but the whole town was out send in the clouds palmyra s ben ashline who qualified for 250 feature in the consolation round enjoyed the cooler weather but was no fan of the sun honestly i wouldn t mind some cloud cover just for a little grip on the racetrack i guess he said obviously everybody has got to race in the same conditions so it is a nice day obviously we had to deal with a little bit of rain before the weekend but for the most part it has been an upbeat weekend advertisement it is nice to be able to do this there are people in the world that have to worry about a lot worse than us and we get to enjoy one of the biggest stock car races in the country racing to the top driver derek griffith of new hampshire is doing all he can to to make it in the world of racing it is a difficult road he said you ve got to know the right people make the right choices and got to have some luck on this side it is a tough deal but we are working at it we finished third last year at the oxford 250 second in 2019 we ve never missed the 250 since 2014 i think we always like to run it is a good way to learn and compete in some of the best races in the country griffith who was driving kate re s car sunday earned his spot in the 250 by finishing first in the first consolation heat he finished 15th one of 21 cars to finish on the lead lap send questions comments to the editors previous next filed under

david bishop associated press portland maine diesel and heating oil supplies in the northeast are more than 50 below the recent average raising concerns that an extreme weather event could cause supply disruptions federal officials said fuel supplies are lower than normal across the country for a variety of reasons including the war in ukraine but it s the worst in the northeast diesel fuel and heating oil which comprise the distillate category are 63 below the five year average in new england and 58 below the same average from maryland to new york according to a survey by the department of energy gasoline inventories are not as bad but are still at their lowest levels in nearly a decade along the entire east coast the agency said the northeast is heavily dependent on heating oil to keep homes warm in the winter while other regions rely more on natural gas and electricity also the national oceanic and atmospheric administration has projected an active hurricane season and a powerful weather event could cause disruptions since most fuel consumed from the middle atlantic states to maine comes from gulf coast refineries energy officials say energy secretary jennifer granholm is convening a meeting of new england governors and their energy directors after labor day to discuss the situation in the meantime she has urged governors in a letter to take whatever steps they can to shore up fuel supplies in coming weeks to prevent any problems the energy department also sent letters to seven major oil companies asking them to hold onto their stocks to help offset low stocks the federal agency has been monitoring the problem and is attempting to be proactive with outreach but there s little incentive for buyers to stock up on high priced fuel for storage because it is anticipated that prices will drop said michael ferrante of the massachusetts energy marketers association the fuel inventory concerns come against a backdrop of russian s invasion of ukraine further shaking up an energy supply chain that was seeking to catch up with growing demand the war is causing worries about the adequacy of energy supplies around the world in new england the immediate concern in the late summer is diesel fuel but the winter heating season looms not far behind heating oil disruptions would hit the region hard because the percentage of homes that rely on it range from 24 in massachusetts to more than 60 in maine the most heavily dependent states maine gov janet mills a democrat has urged the energy department to expedite its meeting with governors to talk about maintaining a stable heating oil supply maine is distinctly vulnerable to the increased prices and volatility the global fossil fuel market is now experiencing due to the russian invasion of ukraine said anthony ronzio a spokesperson for the mills administration despite the concern wholesale suppliers and retailers are working well together and ferrante said he anticipates inventories will increase in september and october easing the immediate concerns he said he is optimistic that there will be an ample supply of heating oil suppliers and retail delivery companies are concerned about prices and inventory but there s not any alarm bell being rung at this time he said i don t see a crisis at this point the energy department created a heating oil reserve that holds 1 million barrels in terminals in the northeast those could be tapped in an emergency

measures take hold powell s saying you need a recession to get this under control to get inflation down and i think that s really where the equity market has to start thinking what s the right price

forecasting ability i just found it a very unsatisfactory description he told cnbc s squawk box monday siegel also said he d like to know more about what statistics the fed is looking at now to gauge inflation and chart its potential path forward as he s worried about the lag in many economic data reports if waits for the official statistics to really start coming down to 2 he will overtighten and he will make the same mistake on the downside as he made on being too slow on restricting liquidity in 2021 and 2022 siegel said siegel s view is that the fed probably has another 100 basis points or

the dependence of western europe on russian natural gas is critical the 27 member nations of the eu currently receive 40 of their imported natural gas from russia understanding the importance of ukraine to the global energy market begins with an overview of ukraine s role as the major conduit for the shipment of natural gas from russia to western europe ukraine is not a major energy producer but it is one of the world s most important energy transhipment locations this graphic below shows the major natural gas pipelines running from russia in the east and belarus in the north toward poland slovakia hungary and romania from there those pipelines connect to hubs that distribute the natural gas further to italy germany austria and other major economies in western europe the dependence of western europe on russian natural gas is critical the 27 member nations of the eu currently receive 40 of their imported natural gas from russia most but not all of this natural gas passes through ukraine some natural gas enters germany through the nord stream 1 pipeline and other conduits under the baltic sea the nord stream 2 pipeline also under the baltic sea which would supply natural gas to germany is currently suspended due to sanctions on russia still the ukraine pipelines are the most important link the immediate damage to european natural gas supplies transiting through ukraine went beyond financial sanctions and potential embargos russia blew up certain gas pipelines in ukraine to deny natural gas to ukrainians and to deny ukraine their share of the gas revenues paid to ukraine as transit fees this damage will not be repaired quickly even if the war ends this dependence on russian natural gas isn t distributed evenly throughout the eu finland and latvia receive more than 90 of their natural gas from russia germany receives almost 50 of its natural gas from russia while the figure for italy is only slightly less at 46 poland is dependent on russia for 40 france is somewhat less dependent getting 24 of its natural gas from russia france gets a large percentage of its total energy from nuclear power making it less dependent on oil and natural gas these figures are presented in more detail in the chart below of course these nations have other energy sources including oil coal wind and solar but none come close to providing the energy needed to run modern industrial economies while providing heat and light to civilian populations in particular solar and wind provide intermittent output which is not capable of providing the baseload needed to keep a modern power grid in operation germany foolishly shut down almost all of its coal and nuclear generating capacity over the past 10 years at the urging of climate alarmists leaving it almost completely dependent on russia russia seemed to have timed its invasion of ukraine perfectly if one aim was to have the maximum effect on energy prices those prices were already rising steeply due to basic supply and demand factors well before the invasion in military planning this is called a force multiplier the idea is to take military forces and make them more powerful by combining with some exogenous variable that has already put the wind at your back if you were going to conduct a cyber attack on a stock exchange the best time would be when the market was already crashing say 3 or so and then launch the attack to use the momentum to push it down 20 or more putin used the force multiplier tactic by disrupting energy supply chains when prices were already going up this tactic is explained by daniel yergin one of the world s leading authorities on energy and oil markets he is the pulitzer prize winning author of the prize the epic quest for oil money and power yergin had the following comments on the timing of putin s invasion of ukraine and the state of global energy markets in an interview with the new york times published on 26 february 2022 this was a very advantageous time for putin to move the oil market always goes through cycles but it s just gone through the most violent cycle that i ve ever studied from negative prices less than two years ago to an incredibly tight market whether putin calculated that or not he chose a time when oil markets are really tight gas markets are really tight coal markets are really tight and he s a big exporter of all three so he s a beneficiary of it that gives him leverage so whatever this terrible invasion is costing russia he s making a lot of money from a higher oil price it s noticeable that oil and gas were not directly sanctioned and that s because you know if they were to do that you would really be hitting europe i mean it would partly immobilize europe that s why this is such a difficult situation the impact of the war in ukraine on world energy prices was felt immediately gasoline prices at the pump increased in a matter of days because of sanctions exxonmobil has announced that it was pulling out of its sakhalin 1 oil and gas project in the russian far east energy majors bp shell and total announced similar pull outs from russian energy joint ventures enter your email address in the box below and you ll get fat tail daily every day absolutely free the biden administration s dirty little secret these shutdowns come on top of what was already a global energy shortage numerous suggestions are being offered for how europe can deal with an energy shortage if they cannot buy russian oil and gas or if russia imposes an embargo on energy exports none of these solutions are practical in less than three or four years biden suggested that europe could obtain natural gas from the middle east particularly qatar this ignores the fact that china has been buying all of the natural gas available under long term contracts so spare capacity is minimal moreover the chart below shows that spare import capacity for liquid natural gas lng in major countries including spain france italy and the uk is quite low compared to the amount needed to replace russian exports source international gas union the dirty little secret among white house policymakers is that they like high energy prices because it helps to promote the green new deal really the green new scam goals of wind and solar power to replace oil and gas the more expensive gas is the more feasible alternatives become that represents the triumph of ideology over common sense there s a role for wind and solar but even if you favour it one has to recognise that it s non scalable intermittent and cannot come online fast enough to close the gap between existing energy supplies and growing demand for energy another drag on global energy output is the fact that major energy companies are reducing their investments in new exploration and development given the opposition to oil and gas from climate alarmists and do gooder ideologue investors like blackrock s larry fink major oil companies are reluctant to invest large amounts in projects that may be deemed unwanted or even banned in years to come this can be reversed in future years but not in time to alleviate the current shortages investors should expect persistent energy shortages and much higher prices these trends were underway before the war in ukraine but they were greatly exacerbated by the war regards jim rickards

reposted from nlr sidecar august 19 2022 six months into the conflict a russian army incapable of taking kyiv is presented as a threat to the entire continent ukraine has become according to president zelensky a springboard for an attack on other nations of europe for the us defense secretary lloyd austin russia represents nothing less than a challenge to free people everywhere given in the american airbase of ramstein germany his speech sounded like a script for a historical reenactment of the cold war the war in ukraine is widely regarded a war against russian expansionism and thus a war for europe the cold war fantasy of seeing cossacks watering their horses in the fountains of saint peter of rome has gained a second life the cossacks are now motorized and nothing short of a coalition of the so called free world will prevent kilo class submarines from mooring in gdansk or columns of t 14s from racing down the autobahn if we don t want to stock up on flour and sugar we need to enlarge nato by bringing in sweden and finland and while we are at it why not fight and defeat russia on the battlefield with nato on the front lines realism is in short supply these days and we are teetering on the edge of a global war it wouldn t hurt to remind ourselves more often that since 1945 nuclear arsenals have set absolute limits to worldwide conflicts and to the possibility of substantially modifying the global order between nuclear powers there is a tacit agreement that this order cannot be radically altered we should not try to find out where the breaking point is despite recurrent announcements that we live in a new reality neither the end of the cold war nor globalization have fundamentally altered this situation a world interconnected by global markets and productive and communication systems is less flexible than we imagine with its abundant reserves of raw materials and highly developed sectors in military and space technologies it is already clear that russia will continue to be part of the global system despite western sanctions at most these limits have become less visible and more fragile nothing would be more dangerous than to mistake a proxy war between nuclear powers for an asymmetric conflict against a terrorist state fought in the name of lofty ideals such as democracy or human rights if realism struggles to be heard it is also because in wartime everything is grist for the propaganda mill democracy antifascist resistance and the fight against imperialism are noble goals but they are also easily pliable not so long ago they motivated the special military operation to denazify iraq since they are now the main narrative for the ukrainian resistance to the russian invasion realism has become de facto assimilated to kremlin propaganda or worse whether it s john mearsheimer or jürgen habermas woe betide those who dare to balance idealism against the realities of international politics and yet we need a sober assessment of the objectives pursued by the coalition of countries supporting ukraine is it to kick the russians out of the country and to take back its eastern provinces despite the stunning performance of the ukrainian military and even without considering crimea it is unlikely this can be achieved is it to put an end to the atrocious war crimes that russian troops seem to commit on a daily basis only a perverse logic can seek justice in the continuation of a war that enables such crimes in the first place or is to deal russia a decisive defeat on the battlefield which would leave the country weakened if not humiliated this goes beyond kyiv s most intransigent demands and runs the risk of escalating the conflict and increasing the chances that non conventional weapons are used in any case any talk of victory is meaningless in this dangerous situation what should europe do there is no doubt that the war in ukraine represents a turning point in which the future of europe is at stake but not for the reasons usually invoked there is a distinct possibility that the war might generate a fracture between eastern and western europe and spell the end of europe as a political project it is in the interest of the europeans and of the ukrainians who will eventually join the union to make sure that this project does not become a collateral victim of the conflict to prevent this a return to realism is necessary first europe must recognize that increasingly its interests do not coincide with those of washington it bears repeating that european unity was achieved outside the strategies that furthered us national interests for the us nato has always been a greater priority than european unity yet no matter how painstaking and tentative it may be this unity has recently reached important milestones with the mutualization of debt to face the pandemic for instance it should not be sacrificed to the goal of weakening russia the united states can afford to bet on a protracted conflict and to raise the stakes because the consequences of these decisions are born mostly by europe the resettlement of millions of refugees the cost of sanctions that are devastating for european economies and the need to scramble for new sources of energy the increase of european defense budgets will further impact welfare systems already weakened by decades of neoliberal policies and the 2008 crisis which are nevertheless central to the regulation of the social equilibria upon which the political stability of the union is premised finally should the conflict escalate europe would become its primary theatre the war in ukraine offers washington an opportunity to shore up its declining hegemony by shifting onto european countries some of its costs while also drafting them in its global confrontation with china in this respect the continuity between the trump and biden administrations is striking this would have a major impact on europe s constitutional order that will diminish the capacity of its historical members to define the political orientation of the union in favour of more docile governments the political weakening of europe has become an explicit goal of nato enlargement especially among neoconservatives reinvigorated by the prospects of a war with russia sold as a fight for democracy to counteract the risk of an alliance made unwieldy by its swelling membership and a tumescent mission that now includes the containment of china some suggest using nato enlargement to adjust the balance of power within the union their goal is to promote a coalition that would include the eastern european and baltic states with poland in the lead the scandinavian states in particular finland and norway but also the english speaking external powers including the united kingdom and canada the same strategy is behind the recent british proposition of creating a european commonwealth which would amount to establishing a shadow union more aligned with transatlantic agendas this approach finds support in the new nato strategic concept which promotes the fullest involvement of non eu members in european defense efforts against this backdrop sweden and finland s bid to join nato stands out for its political implications rather than its strategic significance as adam tooze has pointed out their decision to apply was made possible by the weakness of the russian military not by the threat it represented it s too early to say how the emergence of a nordic and rather hawkish nato constituency will shape the conflict but it makes visible new fault lines in europe can we save ukraine and yet save europe as well as the physicist carlo rovelli recently wrote the problem of wars is not to win them it is to put an end to them europe is not a club of winners it was built upon the rejection of war the limitation of state sovereignty and the adoption of federalism as a founding principle its main goal was always to organize peace on the continent and it must remain the same today if europe is to survive the support of european governments to ukraine cannot be the vehicle for strategies that prevent europe s further political integration this does not mean abandoning kyiv to its own devices or refusing to send military assistance it means that this assistance must be accompanied by explicit diplomatic conditionalities and that it must be carefully calibrated so as not to prevent future negotiations or future relations with russia sooner or later there will be a negotiated solution which will probably approximate the contours of the minsk agreements europe must also keep a safe distance from a us grand strategy that has not yet found the political formula for accommodating the global decline of american power and its loss of prestige going back to the cold war will not restore american supremacy but it will hurt europe it will not restore prestige either leading a global fight for democracy is less convincing when the leading country is one whose senate is holding hearings about a coup attempt where women s rights are trampled by the jurisdictions supposed to protect them and where the possibility of civil war is a recurrent conversation topic unsurprisingly most of the world does not go along it would be a mistake for europe to throw its lot in with this strategy rather it should bet on the rising cadre of restrainers in washington who advocate a different and less bellicose foreign policy far from the unctuous homilies about the liberal international order and its military underpinnings caught between the crisis of american hegemony and the sly maneuvering of the kremlin which seeks to bolster the most anti european and reactionary political forces europe must become a political subject and develop strategic autonomy at the global level the war in ukraine has made this an urgent task that can no longer be postponed

in 2008 we experienced a nightmarish financial crisis that was felt in every corner of the globe is such an event about to happen again on friday the dow jones industrial average plunged 1 008 points as panic swept through wall street in the aftermath of jerome powell s dramatic speech in wyoming powell made it exceedingly clear that interest rates are going to continue to go up and that deeply alarmed investors some very vocal influencers in the financial community had been anticipating that the interest rate hikes would be ending soon but now powell has completely dashed those hopes wall street is going to have to finally face reality in the weeks ahead and it isn t going to be pretty when i heard that the dow had fallen 1 008 points on friday the last two digits immediately stood out to me we all remember what happened the last time a year ended in 08 could this be a sign that another 2008 is coming before you dismiss such a notion there are other times when a stock market crash has seemed to have been a sign of things to come for example on september 29th 2008 the entire world was stunned when the dow jones industrial average dropped 777 points that was a new all time record and fear swept through wall street like wildfire the following comes from a cbs news report that was published in the immediate aftermath of that market crash wall street watched washington with shock and fear as the bailout package flamed out on capital hill and as that 700 billion financial rescue plan went down the dow went down like a sub hurtling the dow jones industrials down nearly 780 points in its largest one day point drop ever reports cbs news correspondent anthony mason nobody could believe it said ted weisberg of seaport securities the fact that it did not get done is just mind boggling the result on wall street was a history making 777 point nosedive the nasdaq plunged almost 10 percent many thought that it was rather odd that the stock market would fall 777 points just as a 7 year shemitah cycle was ending and a new 7 year shemitah cycle was beginning rosh hashanah started on the evening of september 29th 2008 and all throughout history we have seen really big things happen on or around the times of major biblical festivals ultimately the weeks following september 29th 2008 were some of the most difficult that we have ever seen for wall street a great financial crisis shook the entire planet and the u s economy plunged into what would become known as the great recession 7 years later there was another stock market crash in 2015 it was immensely painful at the time but not a lot of people remember it today now another 7 years have passed and it appears that we are on the verge of yet another major panic on wall street interestingly another cycle seems to be repeating as well as i discussed the other day this is the 14th anniversary of the housing crash of 2008 but what most people don t remember is that there was another housing crash 14 years before that in 1994 and if you go back 14 years before that you will find that the u s housing market was crashing in 1980 now the u s housing market is crashing again and this one could turn out to be the most painful of them all if the federal reserve would just stop raising interest rates we may have had a shot at avoiding a complete collapse of the housing bubble but that isn t going to happen and jerome powell made that exceptionally clear on friday morning in a keynote speech at the federal reserve s annual jackson hole economic symposium friday morning powell said that the path to reducing inflation would not be quick or easy adding that the task requires using our tools forcefully to bring demand and supply into better balance using our tools forcefully that doesn t sound good at all and during his speech he actually seemed to promise that some pain would be coming for u s households and u s businesses while higher interest rates slower growth and softer labor market conditions will bring down inflation they will also bring some pain to households and businesses he said these are the unfortunate costs of reducing inflation but a failure to restore price stability would mean far greater pain even with four consecutive interest rate hikes including two back to back 75 basis point increases powell stressed that the fed is not in a place to stop or pause an unwelcome sign for investors who were predicting a rate cut next year so more interest rate hikes are coming will it be a half a percentage point next month or will it be three quarters of a point once again only time will tell but either choice will accelerate the collapse of the housing market and will bring even more pain for wall street something that i will be watching very closely is the derivatives market as alasdair macleod recently explained the derivatives bubble has expanded to a size that is almost unimaginable by far the largest problem in a period of credit contraction is to be found in over the counter derivatives these are unlisted contractual agreements between counterparties including commodity contracts credit default swaps equity linked contracts foreign exchange derivatives and interest rate derivatives according to the bis s database in december 2021 the notional amounts outstanding of all contracts was 610 trillion these positions are the total of seventy dealers returns in twelve jurisdictions capturing an estimated 94 of the total covered in the bis s triannual survey suggesting that the true total outstanding is closer to 650 trillion once this derivatives bubble finally bursts it will be an event that will be absolutely cataclysmic for the global financial system i have been specifically warning about the dangers posed by the derivatives bubble for many years and it is only a matter of time before it comes crashing down unfortunately what jerome powell and his minions at the fed are doing threatens to greatly destabilize financial markets wall street is not prepared for an interest rate shock and i believe that fed officials are making a tragic policy error it is finally here michael s new book entitled 7 year apocalypse is now

conditions than the imf but the united states and the imf objected to the initiative and the amf was stillborn nevertheless regional actors did not give up on cooperation in may 2000 the 10 asean countries brunei cambodia indonesia laos malaysia myanmar the philippines singapore thailand and vietnam plus china japan and south korea asean 3 signed the chiang mai initiative the region s first currency swap arrangement by enabling countries to swap their local currencies for us dollars for a fixed period of time the cmi was supposed to help regional borrowers overcome short term liquidity challenges thereby serving as a complement to the imf this opened the way for the fulfillment of the amf s promise in 2009 the cmi became the chiang mai initiative multilateralization a multilateral reserve pooling program totaling 120 billion in 2014 the facility was expanded to 240 billion another milestone came in 2002 when asean 3 launched the asian bond markets initiative in the hope that a regional bond market would strengthen financial stability reduce vulnerability to capital flow reversals mitigate currency and maturity mismatches and counter overbanking in march this year emerging east asia s local currency bond market was worth 23 5 trillion in 2005 the asian development bank proposed the most ambitious attempt at regional financial cooperation the asian currency unit a basket of the asean 3 currencies the acu was devised as an anchor to which countries in the region could tether their own currencies thereby deterring competitive devaluations and enabling countries in the region to float their currencies collectively against the us dollar this would enable faster adjustment of current account imbalances and promote regional trade and financial flows building on the asian currency unit idea a group of japanese economists devised a supplementary concept the asian monetary unit whose value would reflect a weighted average of east asian currencies however while asian academics welcomed the proposals as possible first steps toward the creation of a common regional currency neither the asian currency unit nor the asian monetary unit has gained traction among policymakers unfortunately asian financial cooperation has been losing momentum in recent years for several reasons first the need for regional liquidity support has become less urgent most of the asean 3 countries run current account surpluses most of the time and the region had accumulated some 3 7 trillion in foreign exchange reserves by the time the global financial crisis erupted in 2008 a more than sixfold increase from the 542 billion they held in 1997 second although the asian bond market has made impressive headway over the past 10 years the development of local currency bond markets is driven by domestic financial needs rather than regional financial cooperation and cross border local currency bonds are rarely issued in fact individual countries financial development has significantly outpaced the development of infrastructure for the cross border issuance of local currency bonds as a result factors like nonstandardized regulations inadequate market liquidity and a lack of an effective securities settlement system continue to hinder the development of cross border issuance of local currency bonds in the region third since the asian financial crisis most east asian countries have adopted a managed floating exchange rate regime but none of them have pegged their currencies to a basket of east asian currencies based on the asian currency unit largely because they are unwilling to accept constraints on their exchange rates for the sake of exchange rate stabilization among regional currencies more broadly greater economic and financial cooperation is vital to asia s long term prosperity yet pursuing it including the possible formation of an east asian economic community is fundamentally a political not an economic question because of east asian countries close geographic vicinity and economic connectivity asean 3 governments should urgently put the endeavor that began 25 years ago back on their agendas the author former president of the
