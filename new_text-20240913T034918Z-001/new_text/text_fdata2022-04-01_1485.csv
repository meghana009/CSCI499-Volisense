the price of energy is too high way too high it s over 100 a barrel for oil it s near 5 a gallon for gasoline it s been an important contributor though by far not the dominant contributor to the 8 inflation rate of the past year by the way a new study suggests that the inflation story has added a 5 200 tax on typical american families this has got to change everybody knows it has to change latest inflation data sends red flashing signal economics professor brian brenberg warns today joe biden who erroneously blames high energy costs on vladimir putin and american fossil fuel companies came up with a new gimmick it s kind of an adult toy it s call spro the strategic petroleum reserve he announced today his administration will release one million barrels of oil daily from spro for up to six months oil prices fell 7 to around 100 today on the news stocks fell about 250 points mr biden says that will cut gasoline prices 10 to 35 cents i m taking the under we will see here are some numbers first the strategic reserve currently has 568 million barrels it could sell as much as 4 4 million in the first few days according to the u s energy information agency but bear in mind that the sell rate will slow as the oil caverns supply diminishes let s just work off of a million barrels a day that would be 30 million barrels a month which would be 180 million barrels over 6 months biden restricting us oil gas drilling a jobs supply killer american petroleum institute vp now the world supply and demand balances at roughly 100 million barrels a day that would come to 3 billion bpds per month which in turn would be 18 billion bpds for 6 months so mr biden s gimmick plan would add 180 million barrels per day compared to a world supply of 18 billion over the 6 month period kind of like spitting in the wind isn t it a pea in a pod a pebble in the ocean we ll see if there s any additional falling oil price effect after today s drop on the news doubtful of course the oil reserve is supposed to be there to protect against national disruptions in supply either from huge natural disasters or war it s really a national security tool not meant to manipulate oil prices in the short run today of course biden blamed vladimir putin and oil companies for the high price of oil and gasoline of course he does it s what we love about him he is consistently selling falsehoods it s actually the only consistency he has in an otherwise incoherent and bewildering policy approach consider the following on his very first day in office joe biden canceled the keystone xl pipeline ended anwr drilling in alaska and instituted a phony metric called the social cost of carbon which pretends to capture upstream production costs and downstream consumer uses measured over centuries think about it it cannot be done government spending to blame for inflation spike san francisco fed study says this whole jihad against fossil fuels throws a wet blanket over the entire oil and gas industry which was by the way not only the best in the world the most affordable in the world and actually the cleanest in the world u s carbon emissions have been falling for years then came the biden regulatory octopus with tentacles reaching everywhere to stop fossil fuels the federal energy regulatory commission ferc has essentially banned new pipelines the interior department has stopped drilling on federal land the energy department has frozen lng export projects the epa has reinstituted burdensome standards for the endangered species act the clean water act and the migratory bird treaty act nepa permitting reform has been thrown out the window even now with a so called nato task force to supply more lng to europe the fine print of the document insists on the same regulatory framework that will get the u s toward net zero carbon emissions in eight years these are all reasons why u s oil production is a million and a half barrels below its peak in early 2020 today president biden couldn t resist his usual jihadist attack against america s great fossil companies take a listen president biden i m calling for use it or lose it policy congress should make companies pay fees on wells on federal leases they haven t used in years and acres of public land they re hoarding without production so goes biden s fatwa against fossil fuels so let me get this right even though the oil companies have leases the regulatory octopus including ferc energy department interior department epa sec and federal reserve won t provide the permits or the pipelines or the financing for those projects it s a classic bait and switch uncle sam gave him the leases but then said uh uh no permits no pipelines no funding so we re going to impose a fee on you that fee comes on top of the 11 tax hikes targeting fossil fuel companies in biden s budget and those come on top of the tax attack on corporations small businesses capital gains and confiscatory wealth through unrealized capital gains consumer sentiment falls to new decade long low as inflation fears soar to be clear inflation is being driven by big government socialist deficit spending financed by federal reserve money printing the inflation rate has moved up from under 2 to over 7 before vladimir putin invaded ukraine but inside this inflation surge the high cost of energy has played a major role it has undermined our economic security at home and our national security abroad it plays right into the hands of war criminal and crook vladimir putin gasoline prices jumped 40 before putin went into the ukraine oil prices jumped nearly 70 click here to get the fox news app these anti fossil regulatory policies are a self inflicted wound we are never going to replace oil and gas let s face that fact honestly the bank of america has estimated that achieving net zero carbon emissions will cost 150 trillion over 30 years that s an annual cost of 5 trillion alone of course inflation would be turbo charged millions of jobs will be lost the economy will sink america will be vastly weaker this is a price we do not have to pay save america drill drill drill the cavalry is coming this article is

this story is from texas monthly s archives we have left the text as it was originally published to maintain a clear historical record read more here about our archive digitization project in houston there are mere murders and then there are big m s you read about big m s on the front page of the newspaper story after story bannered there because big m s always involve rich people in one of those large houses around town something has gone wrong and what goes wrong has to do with a woman she may be the murderer or the victim but as the details of her life come out day by day in the news it gets progressively easier for people in houston their nerves frayed by the sweltering heat and another evening s claustrophobic trip home along the freeway to believe that the opposite of love isn t hate the opposite of love is murder this case looked a little different at first the two would be hit men from california botched the job they put four bullets into the flashy blonde in the red firebird but they didn t kill her they left her paralyzed from the waist down and the scene of the crime the parking lot of a doughnut shop on the corner of beechnut and gessner was a long way from river oaks the setting of most big m s in the past but this murder attempt became a big m as soon as the young victim mumbled the name mimms into the ear of an attending cop the police the press and the public would quickly learn that mimms was meant to be minns as in houston health spa magnate and self styled adventurer richard l minns they had been lovers for three years they were both bottle blonds but otherwise dick minns and barbra piotrowski didn t seem to have much in common she like her attackers was from california just 26 a surfer the kind of summer girl the beach boys bar bar bar bar barbara ann taught a generation how to pine for he was almost twice her age an entrepreneur a promoter and a self made millionaire he had rakish wavy hair a polished smile and the physique of a body builder in defiance of growing old he staged stunts on his birthdays hunting a great white shark or waterskiing for hours around lake tahoe and maybe taking a young mistress was another way for him to defy growing old plenty of other men have done the same popular videos previous next more but there was more to it than that theirs was a romance born of a modern subculture the double knit aristocracy double knit aristocrats make their money fast and without any help from the oldline downtown crowd in raw land and franchises and shopping centers and health spas and in middle age they take to spending it in aspen and acapulco and puerto vallarta they learn how to ski and play tennis and scuba dive they trade in their trusty chevys for 450sls their three piece suits for rhinestone denim ensembles and their scotch and water for more exotic mixtures in the swirl of new money new habits new friends it s often a logical step for them to leave their wives for younger freer women the double knit aristocrats live with a certain vengeance i ve made it and i want everything now is their motto so it s no surprise that their world is filled with sudden crashes wrecked lives and violence in the wake of the october 1980 shooting dick minns s years of tireless self promotion in houston made him the natural center of attention in the press even though no hard evidence linked him to the crime he has not even been questioned by the police from barbra s point of view or what can be gleaned of it from affidavits depositions and her court testimony she isn t talking to reporters it is only right that suspicion should fall on dick to minns s defenders minns himself isn t talking either her claims are merely the puny revenge of someone whose shady past came back to haunt her and who is now trying to blame her lover it is this conflict between the double knit aristocrat and the california girl these two opposite poles of the same magnet that created a charged field around the shooting that made it a big m richard l minns was at an odd juncture the january morning he met barbra piotrowski on the ski lift in aspen for twenty years his life had been dedicated to obsessed with making money during that time he d built a 10 million personal fortune from a six state 32 facility chain of president s first lady health spas he d indulged himself in all the basic trappings of newfound wealth in houston a mansion on memorial a chauffeured cadillac a condo at the lakeway resort near austin but toward the mid seventies as he approached the age of fifty he d become more than a little bored with it all with the federal trade commission cracking down on the spa industry in general he d probably taken the venture as far as it could go it was time to find new challenges to live a little as for his personal life friends later said that minns s decision to gradually liquidate his spa business caused him and his wife mimi to drift apart president s first lady after all had been as much mimi s baby as dick s he was the creative torque behind it the idea man and the salesman she was the common sense the one who kept things running smoothly it had been a successful marriage in business but lately as minns would admit during the divorce proceedings the romance had all but vanished barbra piotrowski for her part was flattered by the aggressive advances of the handsome muscular man from texas but she just wasn t in the mood she was a californian a registered nurse with dreams of becoming a doctor and at the moment wary of men dick minns persisted he would sometimes literally chase her down the mountain as they were skiing occasionally he would wipe out on the slopes in spite of his marvelous physique he wasn t nearly the skier barbra was he told her that he d recently been through a divorce and barbra believed him after she returned to her home in los angeles the handsome texan called her frequently to chat they eventually agreed to meet in aspen again in march as barbra said later in an affidavit during that trip we fell in love he asked me to move to houston i had never been in love like this before i didn t know if i ever would be again so i decided to move to houston barbra packed her bags and headed east dick minns showered his new mistress with the best his considerable fortune could buy he paid her moving expenses to texas installed her in a fancy apartment in westbury and provided her with ample spending money soon he began staying at the apartment several nights a week to explain his absences as barbra later recalled it he told her that his ex wife had a very large home and that he needed to entertain some out of town businessmen there for a few days apparently he was telling his wife mimi a similar story during the divorce proceedings mimi minns testified that when her husband left home for a day or two during this period it was always on the pretext of out of town business barbra and dick would jet off to some exotic resort virtually every other week between march 1977 when barbra moved to houston and november they traveled to aspen twice the british west indies island of antigua lakeway twice a month barbra says new york los angeles lake tahoe twice vail and acapulco twice in return dick required complete devotion from her though he agreed to her enrolling in pre med courses at the university of houston barbra quickly found that his demands made it impossible for her to continue her studies she was so often out of town that she missed too many classes and even when she was able to attend classes as the months passed dick became so jealous of her attention to her course work that she took to studying behind the locked door of the bathroom the love affair was forcing her to live a dual existence one part of her was still an aerospace engineer s shy daughter from los angeles a conservative single minded young woman with definite goals and few distractions at the same time barbra piotrowski the mistress was rapidly taking over the old personality she became dick s favored model in newspaper ads for the few health spas he still owned he wore her proudly on his arm at houston s finest restaurants they lived in a kind of dream world a world filled with halston gowns mercedes sls fancy jewelry and it was impossible for barbra piotrowski to resist it to the double knit aristocracy dick and barbra exemplified the best that the world of new money had to offer the couple cut a dashing romantic figure they were a perfectly matched set of bronzed blond beauties muscled healthy and sparkling and consciously or unconsciously they started playing to their audience dick began to replace his suits with outlandish denim outfits barbra had always been almost self consciously plain but with richard minns she was voluptuous and sultry some friends later said that she remade herself in the image she thought he wanted a minns piotrowski christmas card featured a silhouette of the two embracing before an acapulco bay sunset barbra was the second of four children born to wes and stella piotrowski polish immigrants who passed on to their children simple no nonsense values she had always wanted to be a doctor an ambition her square jawed father endorsed she was a good student with a keen memory for facts and a curiosity about science the same single mindedness applied to athletics she was a proficient diver and skier and seemed to have been born with the athlete s sense of internal discipline and competitiveness more than anything else though barbra was always daddy s little girl wes piotrowski sheltered his eldest daughter he handled her financial affairs even when she was grown and on her own and later when she took up with the rich texan he would help her with her homework long distance because she seemed so preoccupied it was a singularly unnotable childhood until during her early teens barbra had her first experience with violence after riding on a float as a beauty queen in a holiday season parade in hollywood she was accosted at gunpoint by a man who took her off to the mountains and raped her she later told a friend that the experience made her want to punish men but sometimes it seemed that she really wanted to punish herself she got mixed up with drugs and eventually was picked up at her catholic high school in mar vista for attempting to sell pills the arrest record says she had needle marks on her arms she also ran with some tawdry types she opened a small antique shop with a man who was eventually busted for passing counterfeit money barbra said later she was ashamed to have known him and in a couple of years she was back to her old self earning an l v n at marina mercy hospital an r n at ucla and taking pre med courses while working as a nurse barbra met dr paul berns a beverly hills internist both of them later characterized their relationship as a friendship that grew more out of their mutual interest in medicine than out of love but it was still barbra s first serious fling and when they broke up in 1975 she was despondent a year or so later she met dick minns the day barbra found out that her lover was married as she recalled during the minnses divorce proceedings i thought i would die he said he and his wife were separated and had an open marriage and that this had been the case for many years he told me that approximately five years before he had lived with another woman and that his wife was fully aware of this and didn t care and that he s had different girlfriends over the years he said he previously lied to me because he loved me so much that he would have done or said anything to convince me to move to houston he said that his wife knew about me and that she had even met me and that she didn t care as long as the money kept coming in i was in love with dick i accepted his explanation but the thought of another woman in dick s life made barbra intensely jealous it irritated her sense of loyalty and fidelity her account continued i don t sleep with anyone he doesn t sleep with anyone and by that i mean have any sexual relations and i ve asked him not even your wife that was one of the conditions dick became so obsessed with convincing barbra that he wasn t having sex with his wife that one day as she remembered it he told her i ll call mimi and you listen in on the other phone and i ll prove it to you with barbra listening dick said to his wife we ve had four kids together and things couldn t have been that bad were they yeah that s really funny mimi shot back well that didn t happen without sex but the last one happened sixteen years ago she said you re trying to say that we haven t had sex for sixteen years dick baited her no but it s been several years mimi said after they hung up dick gave barbra a big hug and said see mimi minns for her part was hardly pleased to find out that her husband had a mistress according to her deposition for the divorce proceedings she first became suspicious in september 1977 when she received in the mail several pictures of dick and barbra at snowmass colorado then one day while shuffling through some of her husband s papers at his office she found a mysterious address on arboles in southwest houston i had to see if what i thought was true she said so she drove home and called dick back at the office to see if he would be coming home that night he told her he was going to work out at one of the spas that evening mimi went by the spa to see if his car was there it wasn t she set her jaw and drove to the address on arboles she knocked on the door several times and yelled help barbra opened the door and said stop screaming people are turning on their lights you re making a scene mimi minns said my husband is in your house he s in the shower barbra said mimi said i don t care where he is i ve seen him naked before tell him to get down here now according to mimi barbra then slammed the door in her face after she beat on it several more times dick answered still dripping from the shower she told him she wanted to talk to him at home when dick arrived at the mansion on memorial he told her i wasn t there i heard that story once before mimi said referring to an earlier affair dick had refused to admit to for nearly twenty years but this time i saw you i want a divorce with his business in gradual liquidation the last thing richard minns wanted was a divorce and a nasty community property battle he hatched quite an innovative plan for reconciliation he had his lawyer draw up a legal contract of open marriage according to the terms of the contract he and mimi would each take 100 000 from joint assets to do with as they pleased they would set up separate households sexually they were each completely free to do whatever they wanted the only real restraint was that they stay legally married which protected their fortune mimi decided to sign the open marriage contract with his wife was a case of richard minns s having his cake and eating it too life was a series of skirmishes for him but the difference between him and most other men was that he usually won friends and even enemies attributed this to his natural charisma and charm his almost evangelistic powers of persuasion but it more likely had to do with another fundamental element in his personality an unwavering determination to have the upper hand to win an insurmountable competitiveness that made each and every little argument conflict act of disloyalty or snide joke a direct call to arms richard minns was always his parents favorite his sister later said that the folks thought he was jesus he had a nomadic middle class upbringing his father was a jack of all trades hustler and salesman the family lived in temple granger taylor allen san antonio and finally houston as dick s father moved from the ready to wear business to sporting goods to real estate the young dick minns was somewhat overweight bright and precocious a promoter and a prankster an instigator even in those days a good friend would later say he was no more mischievous than any other young boy but his sister who is currently at odds with minns in a probate suit says that at times his pranks and yearning for the limelight went to excess when he was young she says he would pick on the punk of the block by stripping him naked locking him up in a chicken coop and charging admission from other neighborhood kids to come tease him but there was a softer more artistic side too he loved to entertain and had an innate flair for drawing he attended san antonio public schools until he reached high school then went to two military schools peacock military academy and the texas military institute the academies were a disciplinary measure by his parents and a successful one dick trimmed down took up body building and made consistent a averages according to school records he eventually was named neatest cadet in the sophomore class at peacock he graduated and attended the university of texas where he majored in journalism he worked for both the campus newspaper and the magazine and is remembered by a friend as hardworking and a lover of pranks while finishing his journalism degree he met and married mimi levy after his graduation in 1950 he moved to houston and went to work for the houston chronicle as an advertising representative for the paper s sunday magazine by 1953 he was the ad manager though according to mimi the young couple had to struggle to make ends meet after the birth of their first child cathy dick quit his job at the chronicle to start his own advertising agency the family moved into an apartment in montrose and opened the agency in a small storefront just down the block it was just the two of them and by mimi s admission they got off to a rough start dick dragged some of his clients from the chronicle over to the all state advertising agency but it wasn t until he began doing ad work for american health studios that the business really took off dick seemed to know instinctively that people wouldn t part with their money for a health club membership unless in the process they were buying some kind of dream he knew how to create that dream using himself as the example in 1956 he got his big break american health studios his major client had fallen on hard times the company had expanded too rapidly and oversaturated the market among its many creditors was all state advertising which was owed roughly 250 000 an idea formed in dick minns s mind why not take over a few of the studios in lieu of cash payment for the debt he knew he could succeed where they had failed all it would take was a little persistence and a lot of hype in 1956 minns took over five of american health studios facilities and renamed them ace rican health studios he was a natural promoter who knew that the only way to make money in spas was to spend it on advertising he was also an energetic gadabout who quickly managed to have his name appear frequently in newspaper social columns he had a sense of how and when to expand associates and even competitors to this day say they ve never seen a better start up lease negotiator than dick minns his chain of spas again renamed this time president s first lady would eventually grow sixfold and stretch through half a dozen states and the company s finances were healthy enough even at the height of expansion for the enterprise to go public in addition to salesmanship minns was responsible for one other great idea in the health spa business he revolutionized the art of financing a contract when would be patrons filed in to give say 50 down and 50 a month for three years minns wasn t really gambling on the customer s solvency he got 650 up front because he sold all the contracts to a finance company if the patron had problems making his payments the finance company could handle it minns wasn t without his enemies there were some who came to see his notorious persistence as obnoxiousness his flamboyance as just so much hot air one was robert swartz a young spa manager for minns who after a falling out with the boss left the company and made plans to start up his own chain of spas swartz scraped together 10 000 and started what later became the slenderbolic health spa chain almost immediately he and minns were at each other s throats in 1964 minns filed suit against swartz alleging that his competitor was raiding his employees swartz countered with similar allegations against minns it was the beginning of a decade long legal row as the months dragged on the two filed and counterfiled allegations of copyright infringement over the advertising slogan what have you got to lose in late 1967 swartz added allegations that minns was using slander restraint of trade threats coercion and unlawful competition to try to drive slenderbolic out of business swartz also alleged that minns had told numerous individuals that his competitor was a homosexual and he filed a separate suit for slander during the ongoing dispute swartz found a most interesting method of keeping pace with his competitor he hired a private detective neal todd to rifle through the trash at minns s office to obtain his customer mailing lists and the like poor todd wasn t quite up to such subterfuge and derring do his first step was to contact the maid at the building and ask her to tie a blue ribbon around the sacks of trash that belonged to minns the maid relayed this information to minns who hatched his own counterplan he planted an expensive leather briefcase in a sack to be wrapped with the blue ribbon and when neal todd took the bag the next day he technically committed a felony theft minns promptly filed criminal charges against todd and swartz minns had former district attorney frank briscoe then in private practice appointed as a special prosecutor on the case a seldom allowed procedure the charges against swartz were quickly dismissed however and after a three day trial neal todd was acquitted all the rest of the suits were eventually either dropped or settled out of court the ten year legal battle with swartz is a paradigm of the minns style once you sink your teeth in don t let go but his associates say that minns also has a tendency to dream two who have known him for twenty years between them say it is virtually impossible to converse with him he hears only what he wants to hear and often seems to be in a kind of daze following some vision of his own it s a trait that undoubtedly helped make him a millionaire but it also made him a social eccentric and coupled with his abundant competitiveness made his life one protracted battle against various enemies both real and imagined if overzealous competitiveness became a trademark of the minns style so did the peculiar way he was able to retain the friendship respect and even love of his foes many employees who left the company as a result of disagreements with minns today count him a friend even his ex wife after a bloody contested divorce case has little negative to say about the man in 1969 president s first lady went public the initial stock offering at 10 a share quickly shot up to 18 but in just a few years trouble began to beset the empire it was growing too large and unwieldy to be effectively managed by someone like minns who had difficulty delegating authority also the federal trade commission was beginning to crack down on spa advertising and contracts minns s persistence had sucked a good fad dry it was time to get out while the getting was good when the stock plummeted to 2 in 1970 minns began buying it back from the shareholders returning the company to private status he subsequently entered into negotiations with the health and tennis corporation of america which bought fifteen of his clubs these two moves were a brilliant stroke minns was able to extricate himself from the company swiftly and at a handsome profit the stock he bought back so cheaply he sold for the equivalent of 8 to 10 a share the independently wealthy minns dabbled in real estate successfully of course but he seemed to turn more of his energy to personal pursuits that coupled with his lust for the limelight led to his birthday feats of strength and daring each august 17 according to newspaper accounts notably those of houston post society columnist marge crumbaker who became a sort of minns glorifier minns performed the following feats between the ages of 35 and 49 at 35 swam the length of acapulco bay in eight hours at 36 at a depth of 155 feet speargunned and brought up a record red snapper at 37 water skied at lake tahoe nonstop for eight hours sixteen minutes at 38 did 2000 consecutive situps in less than five hours at 39 became he claimed the first american to dive off the cliffs at acapulco at 40 dived off the cliffs again to dispel doubts about the initial exploit at 41 captured a three hundred pound sea turtle alive at a depth of more than 150 feet in acapulco at 42 free dived to a depth of 325 feet on a thirty minute air tank off the yucatan coast at 43 skied twice around enormous lake tahoe on a slalom ski at 44 killed a bull in an arena in acapulco at 45 performed 3050 situps in less than three hours at 46 skied the length of lake mead in nevada 123 miles at 47 skied four times around lake tahoe in less than nine hours at 48 hunted and killed a wild boar in kenya with only a pair of throwing knives and killed two great white sharks in the waters off antigua british west indies with a bang stick an explosive tipped lance despite a ruptured eardrum and broken ribs at 49 again skied the circumference of lake tahoe this time five laps totaling almost four hundred miles in ten and a half hours but how much of this did minns really do the knife killing of the wild boar in kenya has been questioned because minns did not have a valid u s passport at the time he said the hunt took place furthermore despite his claims that saga magazine had promised to help finance the trip the magazine says it never had any deal with minns the 325 foot dive was also doubted by professional divers who say that diving to that depth on so little air is physically impossible but by far the most controversial of minns s feats was his purported slaying of two great white sharks off antigua in the spring of 1977 to begin with great white sharks are hard to find in the caribbean second they are very difficult to kill even with a bang stick and third it is hard to continue a deep dive at all let alone fight sharks with injuries such as broken ribs and a ruptured eardrum of the photos that accompanied the event s coverage by the wire services one looks suspiciously like a picture in a book by jacques cousteau since the wire services freely admit that they accepted the photos from minns with no questions asked there is really no way to verify that they are genuine other people who went along on the trip say they never saw any evidence of the kills even the manager of the hotel where minns stayed in antigua disputes the story in the spring of 1978 richard minns found a town house at 312 lichfield for 87 000 and set his mistress up in style the move seemed perfectly natural they were after all practically man and wife barbra had only months before miscarried a child by dick but for mimi minns the town house was the last straw she could apparently tolerate her husband s sexual infidelity but not his spending money on another woman that was their money he was using to buy the town house she found a lawyer and finally did the one thing richard minns had hoped she would never do she filed for divorce the divorce proceedings stretched over eighteen months and filled a large box with depositions and filings and counterfilings the couple listed assets totaling about 10 million including 100 000 or so shares of blue chip stock many pieces of prime real estate and of course the holdings in president s first lady mimi minns listed jewelry including two brooches with a total of 84 diamonds and a bracelet with 119 diamonds the couple also owned an extensive art collection for the year 1977 they listed an income of 1 365 285 and expenses of 1 242 472 including 15 000 for travel and 7000 just to maintain their pool the divorce proceedings showed the darker side of dick minns he lit into his wife the same way he had robert swartz he called her a tramp and said they d had to get married when she was seventeen because she was pregnant he claimed he had married her in part to reform her he denied that she was any help in building the business and said i don t think she could run a health club if her life depended on it but mimi minns was more than a match for her pugnacious husband she said his public affair with barbra had humiliated her especially when he had begun spending community assets on the girl midway through the proceedings she alleged that minns had threatened her with physical harm barbra piotrowski was also seeing a different dick minns now he just wasn t the same after the divorce started he was grouchy at times his already irregular work and rest habits became more erratic he resorted to taking sleeping pills with his marriage ending vituperatively and his business in liquidation he began to take it out on barbra the divorce of richard and mimi minns was finally tried in the summer of 1979 mimi was awarded about 60 per cent of the assets friends say dick was crushed not so much at losing more than half of his hard won fortune but at losing the next winter the lovers finally decided to get married and announced as much in the houston papers dick minns very much wanted his fiancée to be a traditional wife and homemaker but barbra still clung to her dream of studying medicine the disagreement caused some minor friction but it didn t come to a head until march 17 1980 that morning barbra told dick that she was pregnant again as dick s friends tell the story she literally caught him at the door as he was rushing off to a morning business appointment he told her to call him and they would discuss it later according to barbra however the news caused him to become violent and threatening he told me we were through that he had another woman and that he wanted me out in either event barbra decided to leave she summoned a friend mary victoria spillers hired a moving company and cleaned out the town house by nightfall minns must not have been happy to arrive home to a nearly empty house not only was all the furniture gone but some of his personal possessions were as well he called the police from his point of view as recounted by close associates the events of march 17 were quite simple although he and barbra had been living virtually as husband and wife most of the items that she moved out had been purchased with his money and taking them constituted theft he would not press criminal charges if barbra would return them barbra didn t see the matter quite so simply she and dick had been living together for three years and now she was pregnant by him many of the things she had moved out had been purchased with his money but he had given it to her specifically to furnish the town house she felt she was due her rightful share of them on thursday march 20 according to an affidavit barbra later filed with the houston police department houston theft detective spider fincher an acquaintance of dick s went to the apartment that barbra had moved into with the help of victoria spillers barbra wasn t at home but fincher told neighbors that felony grand theft and arson charges would be filed against her he said she had stolen 200 000 in merchandise from the condominium and that houston arson investigator mickey brown had discovered rigged wiring in the house that implied an arson attempt although brown now confirms his role both fincher and his colleague officer charles wells take exception to barbra s version but refuse to elaborate further when fincher talked to barbra personally later that day he indicated that if she was willing to meet with him and be reasonable about the matter he would not arrest her if she didn t cooperate formal charges would be filed with the da s office and in all probability he said she would be arrested and jailed barbra called irving weissman a houston defense attorney who was the husband of dick s sister janis and a good friend of barbra s weissman said he would talk with fincher the next day the following morning detective fincher told weissman that the theft and arson charges against barbra were imminent fincher said he considered the matter not a criminal affair but a domestic one and he urged weissman to draw up a settlement agreement that would resolve the matter outside the courts weissman told barbra to call fincher when she did she found the detective brusque and offended that she had called her attorney rather than simply showing up at police headquarters herself he told her that unless she did something quickly arrest was inevitable he also told her to call mickey brown about the arson charges brown told her he considered the arson charge a serious one and he too urged her to make amends with minns at the same time minns s attorney harry brochstein contacted weissman to arrange a meeting the following monday march 24 barbra weissman minns and brochstein met at brochstein s office minns s attorney presented a typed settlement agreement and urged barbra to sign it the agreement said that barbra would receive all the furniture and furnishings that she had taken and 500 cash in consideration of any future action i might take against him including divorce breach of promise and paternity barbra and weissman both felt the offer was hasty and perhaps unfair and she refused to sign the same day mickey brown called barbra s father in los angeles and told him that his daughter was in trouble and urged piotrowski to prevail upon barbra to settle out of court the same week minns himself called piotrowski repeatedly alternately saying that he loved barbra and demanding a settlement or jail in early april minns asked through intermediaries to meet with barbra privately as she later put it because i loved him and wanted to see if there was any way of working things out i went to see dick at guest quarters i waited for dick outside his room until sometime past 2 30 a m dick stepped off the elevator with another woman we had some words and when dick put his arm around the woman i became outraged i hit him with my purse ran downstairs and out to my car and started to drive away dick stopped me he told me he loved me and wanted me back he asked me to spend the night with him he hugged and kissed me when they returned to the hotel the other woman was still in the lobby minns told barbra he needed to speak with the woman briefly to arrange to have her taken home i left again and dick came after me this time he took my car keys we went up to his suite the woman was there on the phone the three of us talked for a few minutes i begged dick to give me my keys and let me go he refused there was a knock on the door it was three policemen dick said there she is you have a warrant for her arrest at the police station fincher reiterated the deal cooperate with minns and you go free don t cooperate and we lock you up barbra asked to see her lawyer and remained in jail until the next morning when weissman posted bond barbra s case was postponed several times before it went to the grand jury in the meantime bob delmonteque a business associate of both brochstein s and minns s contacted weissman and barbra s family urging them to settle delmonteque even said that minns would pay 20 000 cash plus the furniture even with the leverage of criminal charges against barbra minns was obviously anxious to resolve the matter on april 18 barbra joined irving and janis weissman to celebrate janis s birthday later that evening when barbra returned home with her date she noticed a group of strange men congregated near her apartment according to her affidavit she asked her date to drive around the block they were followed barbra had her date pull up to a u totem so they could find out who was following them out of an unmarked car stepped detective fincher and officer wells fincher said they needed her to come with them that they needed to inspect her apartment barbra asked if they had a warrant fincher said no but they could get one instantly barbra said she wanted to call weissman she went into the store to the pay phone but before she had finished dialing the number wells grabbed the receiver he told her she was going with them now whether she liked it or not when they arrived at her apartment minns a group of his employees and two professional movers were waiting for them inside barbra was finally allowed to contact her attorney fincher got on the line too weissman said he was on his way meanwhile the detectives told barbra they wanted to bring minns up to the apartment to point out what had been stolen from him barbra refused requesting a warrant the detectives ignored her and brought the movers and minns inside minns proceeded to claim that most everything in the apartment was his barbra produced receipts in her name for much of the merchandise but the men continued to ignore her my apartment was left a shambles barbra later swore almost everything was removed everything that wasn t was thrown on the floor i was left without even a bed to sleep in a few minutes after the movers had gone barbra received a call from victoria spillers who said fincher and wells had just gone through her apartment also she said they were going to arrest her and when barbra the weissmans and her date prepared to leave at about five o clock in the morning they discovered that all four of weissman s tires had been slashed and the windows of the vehicles had been covered with hair spray barbra filed this chronology of the events with the internal affairs division of the houston police department but internal affairs agreed with the officers somewhat different version their explanation was simple the girl had committed theft charges had been filed and accepted by the da s office the complainant and the police had a right to take back the property as evidence until and unless she was cleared she had no right to resist recovery of the property the officers were completely exonerated minns s friends later produced affidavits from the movers claiming that victoria spillers had asked if they knew anyone she could get to kill minns they also produced affidavits from two employees of a western wear store who claimed that spillers had traded in an expensive belt buckle which turned out to belong to minns for a gold chain and had later exchanged the chain for about 500 cash there was also a story going around that barbra had done this sort of thing before that five years earlier she had ripped off paul berns the same way berns later flatly denied the charge and revealed that he had been contacted by a los angeles area private detective who told him he could have back that five thousand dollars barbra took if he agreed to testify against her on the theft charges after barbra was indicted by the grand jury a prosecutor asked weissman why don t you settle this thing but weissman wasn t about to do that since dick and barbra had lived together for three years and she had been pregnant by him twice there was a clear issue of common law marriage and paternity weissman was worried about barbra s safety to be sure but he wasn t about to be buffaloed into a settlement that was unfair to her he soon enough began worrying about his own safety as barbra moved in with the weissmans and the theft charges continued to dangle in limbo strange things began to happen to the tall avuncular defense attorney his office on westheimer was burglarized twice in each case nothing was taken but the burglars went through files where barbra piotrowski s personal papers and documents would have been located had weissman not moved them a few weeks before wes and stella piotrowski were also getting their fair share of trouble one afternoon not long after barbra s arrest mrs piotrowski was working in her front yard when a tall stranger drove up approached her and introduced himself as a city tax appraiser he asked if she knew the value on her home when she said she wasn t sure he left later that afternoon after wes piotrowski had come home the man returned with two uniformed los angeles police officers he introduced himself as dudley bell a houston private investigator who worked for richard minns he said he had photographs that proved that the gold necklace mrs piotrowski was wearing was one of the items stolen when barbra moved out on minns he said he was in california to recover the necklace as evidence after resisting for a while the piotrowskis finally handed over the necklace which had indeed been a present from barbra in the first week of may the grand jury indicted barbra for theft then weissman resigned as barbra s attorney his being minns s brother in law was only exacerbating the situation barbra shopped around for another lawyer and as a result of several recommendations decided on dick deguerin one of the rising stars of the houston criminal defense community barbra later said that she was certain her phone was being tapped and that bell was having her followed then one day while she was on her way to deguerin s office her car inexplicably stopped running when deguerin checked it out he found a mysterious apparatus under the hood that looked terrifyingly like a bomb the device turned out to be part of a sophisticated radio control instrument that allowed a passenger in a trailing car to shut down the engine of barbra s car by merely punching a button meanwhile barbra was desperately trying to pull her life together she got a new apartment she poured herself into personal pursuits work in the hermann hospital burn unit giving lessons at an aerobic dancing studio she dated a little one afternoon while jogging in memorial park she ran into an old acquaintance willie rometsch a houston restaurateur they chatted briefly and rometsch asked her to drop by later for dinner the next day rometsch got a phone call from minns who related verbatim his conversation with barbra in the park suggesting not only that barbra s claims that she was being followed were correct but that she was being taped as well such incidents as these began to wear on barbra her nerves were frazzled from the wear and tear of worry over the criminal charges against her she was also most friends would later admit still carrying a torch for richard minns she had had another miscarriage her character also included a streak of stubbornness and family members later said she almost made a crusade of her relationship with dick minns it wasn t just that she loved him she wanted it to work patrick steen 21 and nathaniel ivery 26 were cruising around southwest houston in search of their quarry on the evening of october 20 1980 the two drifters were not in a mood to be picky about sites for the hit for several weeks now they had followed barbra watched her jog at memorial park seen her go to and from classes at the university of houston checked out her new apartment on landsdale they were by now intimately familiar with the rhythm of her daily life all that remained was for them to end it the task seemed especially urgent on october 20 because they had come close very close the night before after making a quick pass by her apartment they d decided to knock on the door just to see what would happen barbra refused to open the door ivery made up a couple of girls names and asked her where they lived just to stall go next door she said in a small voice and ivery said he wanted to off her right then through the door steen finally talked him out of it one thing about this murder for hire business he told his partner was that you had to be sure which wasn t exactly possible with a locked door in the way today could be should be the day that is if they could find her cruising by her apartment they d seen her bright red firebird and decided to follow her but a few red lights and a few turns later they d lost her a week earlier they might have blown it off called it a day but on this monday evening as the mist of houston nightfall descended on the city patrick steen and nathaniel ivery decided that they would find her and that when they did they would kill her they finally spotted the firebird parked to one side of the winchell s donut house at gessner and beechnut inside the car was a gloomy barbra piotrowski she had decided to indulge in the worst of her guilty pleasures junk food a couple of gooey doughnuts then a nice ten mile jog in memorial park and maybe she would feel better that was when she looked up and saw a strange man approaching her car fumbling with a rumpled paper sack barbra knew right away that he meant to kill her instinctively she flipped on the ignition and tried to wrestle the gearshift into reverse the man stopped short raised his hand and fired the gearshift screamed into reverse and the car skidded backward there was a second shot then one two more the gunmen sped off in their cadillac but unfortunately for them a police patrol car happened to be driving past the doughnut shop houston police officers w e hamby and d j pannell must have thought they had died and gone to some special heaven for cops television mythology notwithstanding the average patrolman seldom if ever gets the opportunity to witness a crime of any kind in progress but here they were just cruising around and suddenly they found themselves watching an attempted murder as the two officers wove in and out of post rush hour traffic trying to keep pace with the fleeing cadillac other police and ambulance units arrived at the scene of the shooting without prompting the victim said in a wheezing voice my husband shot me and when asked her name she mumbled barbra barbra mimms after news of the shooting hit the papers detectives tom ladd kenny williamson and m f kadartzke were perhaps the only people in houston who had no time for speculation about richard minns cops especially homicide investigators learn early on that rumors are cheap their unsavory chore was to pin down the facts of the botched murder attempt at beechnut and gessner step one was to see if steen and ivery would sing and the two suspects couldn t have been more accommodating ivery who was the trigger man said that he and patrick steen had been on the streets in their hometown of riverside california selling drugs and passing counterfeit bills when they were offered the opportunity to sell a hot car which ultimately brought the two black men into contact with an older white man by the name of robert anderson after some troubles with the law over the hot car ivery said he and steen once again ran into anderson at rocco s restaurant in riverside this time anderson whom they also knew as jess wanted them to do some arson in colton california after performing that task for 100 apiece steen and ivery were offered a job in houston bob approached us with a deal about kidnapping a girl ivery told the detectives he told us that he did not know the reasons that the girl was supposed to be kidnapped but it had something to do with her possibly being pregnant and that she might cause trouble for this guy and his family he did not tell us the man s name but did say would you believe this is a judge he said that it would be better if she was dead but that the kidnapping would be all right after we arrived in houston bob picked out a motel somewhere on highway 45 the next morning we went to bob s farm which is located somewhere off spring cypress road bob took pat and i to another house where we picked up the cadillac that we were driving when we were caught there was another white man at the house where we picked up this cadillac he was in his early 50 s 5 7 165 pounds short crew cut hair i did not meet this man and was not told what his name was ivery went on to say that anderson provided them with a 44 pistol and certain details about the young blonde girl s daily schedule after spending a few days scoring some drugs steen and ivery met anderson at memorial park to watch the victim jogging we discussed the girl that was supposed to be kidnapped only this time he said that the girl was to be killed instead he told us that we could get 10 000 for the job the money was supposed to be split with bob getting 2000 and pat and i getting 4000 each bob told us that the man that wanted this done was a judge dudley smith and the reason that he wanted it done was because she was going to turn state s evidence against him after we agreed to do the job bob took us out to show us where the girl s apartment was located we had trouble finding the apartment bob stopped and called the guy he told bob that he would meet with him bob told us that the man was a big man and described him as being well over six feet tall maybe six three or six four ivery said he never saw judge dudley smith but he did see a black over gray cadillac that anderson said belonged to the judge at a marriott hotel the day of the shooting ivery said we were coming back to the apartment when we passed a red firebird i told pat that looked like her car pat turned around and we started following her we lost her and we had turned down this street when i spotted her car parked at the donut shop i got out of the car and started toward her i put my hand inside the bag and pulled the trigger twice but nothing happened i had the other gun that i had stolen from this white dude stuck in my belt and when the 44 did not fire i pulled the other one i fired the gun at her four times i knew that i had hit her because on the last shot i could see the laceration and i heard her go uh after running routine checks the detectives located robert anderson in far north harris county where he d been living for a couple of months with his wife and children anderson offered little resistance when he was picked up for questioning on friday october 31 unfortunately the big beefy 46 year old californian with the pancho villa moustache was not as willing to talk as his alleged accomplices had been in fact he wasn t talking at all worse the physical evidence that might corroborate his participation in the hit didn t hold up the 44 steen and ivery said anderson gave them for the murder was traced to wyoming nothing in the records on it linked it to anderson the cadillac was traced to the transport leasing company in rialto california a small town near riverside anderson had worked for transport and the detectives discovered had taken over sole ownership of the car when the company was sold that tended to support steen and ivery s version of the attempted hit but with anderson continuing to stonewall and one of the weapons out of the picture the evidence against the californian was questionable perhaps unusable the car was apparently anderson s but so what without further supporting evidence a defense attorney could easily argue that steen and ivery had merely stolen the car or that even if anderson had lent it to them he knew nothing about a murder for hire attempt the detectives and the da s office were now in a real bind steen and ivery had been firm and convincing when they implicated anderson in the crime but under texas law the word of one crook isn t enough to convict someone else objective corroborating evidence must support the confession the da s office decided to take anderson to the grand jury anyway after hearing his testimony the grand jurors refused to indict him in connection with the case the detectives one slim lead had evaporated as quickly and inexplicably as it had appeared the shooting at beechnut and gessner was once again a full fledged mystery as assistant district attorney ted wilson said ruefully after robert anderson was released we re stuck with uncorroborated witness accomplice testimony we re wondering where in the hell we re going to go from here it isn t like tv it isn t simple barbra s attorney dick deguerin decided to take the offensive in december after weeks of avoiding reporters queries about his client and her allegations against minns deguerin went into open court where he was representing barbra on the theft charges minns had filed against her months earlier and as he put it later decided to take the lid off the speculation deguerin told the court that he intended at the appropriate time to prove that richard l minns had been behind the attempted murder of barbra piotrowski we believe the complainant in this case is the person that hired through intermediaries the assassins after hearing the allegations minns took the opportunity to respond to the rampant speculation about him for the first time i m not a defendant he said angrily i ve been told i m not a suspect the only crime i committed was to fall in love with a beautiful girl from california he subsequently sued deguerin and his senior partner percy foreman for slander the detectives involved in the case still gamely say the case is open but anyone who knows anything about crime knows that with each day that passes a case becomes more unsolvable there are no new leads and no theories nothing implicates minns or anyone else as for barbra piotrowski deguerin has been forced to move her at least twice to different hospitals under different pseudonyms for fear her would be killers had discovered her whereabouts recently a fellow patient barbra had become acquainted with left the hospital and found all four of his tires slashed on march 30 patrick steen and nathaniel ivery were unceremoniously tried and convicted for the attempted murder of barbra piotrowski it was a spectacular anticlimax a fitting requiem to this bizarre big m since the two had confessed fully to the crime the state s case was short after three days they were each sentenced to 35 years in prison in the wake of the convictions the case has predictably faded from prominence one thing about big m s is that they cater to a fickle demanding public they must keep producing new twists of fate new characters and new revelations or they are quickly relegated to the status of mere statistics for followers of big m s the shooting at beechnut and gessner left too many unanswerable questions but as a love story it lingers barbra piotrowski now awakens each morning a cripple from the waist down spends her days in endless hours of therapy and her nights in a heavily secured hospital room under an assumed name her friends say she wonders sometimes if some part of her doesn t still love richard minns

uc berkeley boffins have found that strategies for squeezing extra profit out of ethereum transactions come at the cost of other cryptocurrency investors and threaten the security and stability of the entire ethereum ecosystem in a paper titled extracting godl from the salt mines ethereum miners extracting value doctoral students julien piet and jaiden fairoze with computer science professor nicholas weaver throw down a hat trick of allusions gold hodl and godel to make the case that mev or miner maximal extractable value undermines the integrity of the ethereum network the ethereum network relies on a blockchain made of cryptographically linked blocks of data those mining on the network perform proof of work calculations with a computer to aggregate a set of transactions into a block and add it to the chain doing so incurs transaction fees tied to computational effort known as gas mev as defined in the ethereum documentation refers to the maximum value that can be extracted from block production in excess of the standard block reward and gas fees by including excluding and changing the order of transactions in a block it exists because ethereum miners control the inclusion exclusion and ordering of transactions though miners are compensated for their contributions to the blockchain they can order transactions specifically to boost their reward as the university trio put it with mev miners make the lion s share of the profits rather than independent users of the private relays at its heart mev is a form of arbitrage taking advantage of a price difference or market inefficiency but it exists in flavors that would be illegal in regulated financial markets for example mev can be extracted via frontrunning capitalizing on the knowledge of a pending transaction before it gets committed to a block piet fairoze and weaver note that there s been concern about frontrunning in the ethereum community since 2014 and the problems with mev were made apparent in a 2020 paper titled flash boys 2 0 frontrunning in decentralized exchanges miner extractable value and consensus instability the threat posed by mev has been acknowledged by those overseeing the ethereum ecosystem who noted as defi grows and increases in popularity mev may soon significantly outweigh the base ethereum block reward with that comes a growing possibility of selfish block remining and consensus instability some consider this to be an existential threat to ethereum and disincentivizing selfish mining is an active area of research in ethereum protocol theory in their mev paper submitted for review at the 2022 workshop on the economics of information security the university of california berkeley academics describe how they developed an algorithm to analyze mev exploitation in previously mined blocks and found that ethereum miners were collecting most of the rewards at the expense of other participants they found most mev extractions rely on private transactions 73 percent of which hide trading activity or re distribute miner rewards they also found that 87 6 percent of mev collection is done through privately submitted transactions private transactions on the ethereum blockchain are rare only 2 07 per cent of all observed transactions in blocks were private nonetheless the researchers consider the impact of mev to be material to the viability of ethereum of more than 6m in mev profit over a 12 day period two thirds the researchers say went directly to miners and mev they said represented 9 2 percent of the miners profit from transaction fees or 22 7 per cent when restricted to income from defi transactions in total the mev extractions in our data generated 2 159 eth about 6 400 000 usd only over 12 days the paper says as a measure of comparison this represents 2 2 per cent of the total eth supply created during that same time and extrapolates to almost 200 000 000 usd in profits per year some of it is just plain arbitrage where you re just exploring inefficiencies between different exchange platforms to make money but most of it is arbitrage at the expense of other users mev they argue threatens the stability of the ethereum network because it creates network congestion increases transaction prices increases the cost of participation in dexs and most importantly threatens blockchain consensus mev is basically any strategy you can implement by reordering transactions in a blockchain in order to profit said julien piet a doctoral student at uc berkeley and the lead author of the paper in a phone interview with the register some of it is just plain arbitrage where you re just exploring basically inefficiencies between different exchange platforms to make money but most of it is arbitrage at the expense of other users so let s say a user wants to buy a lot of some token piet explained this person submits this transaction to buy that token what happens is that like in traditional finance the price of the token is going to increase because there s high demand and less offer the main strategy for mev is for a person that has more control to buy some token before the transaction and sell it right after and basically benefit from the price increase at the cost of the individual actually buying the token in the middle who s going to have a worse exchange rate thief milks cream finance for 18m in cryptocurrency after spotting security bug read more that buyer piet said would lose a few per cent on the transaction essentially the miners through their transaction ordering ability have financial superpowers that others participating in the system lack piet said there was a system put in place called flashbots that attempts to address this by making mev distribution opportunities more fairly available but what we found is basically despite the system for fair mev redistribution miners still make over 50 per cent of the profits he said piet said there are some potential defenses that might be worth investigating like random transaction order one of the interesting issues is that in ethereum like in many blockchains there s no regulation authority he said and so there s nobody to say well we want to ensure a specific ordering we want to make sure this doesn t happen in traditional finance this type of activity frontrunning and sandwiching is illegal given that a significant amount of profit is made today through mev and that those conducting transactions don t have visibility into costs until the transaction is recorded in a block piet said he believes

minera juanicipio had cash on hand of 18 972 on a 100 basis according to the operator fresnillo the juanicipio project construction is expected to be delivered on budget at 440 000 with the current ramp up of underground mine production and given hiring restrictions on contractors arising from new 2021 labour reform legislation the timing of various sustaining capital expenditures has been brought forward these sustaining capital costs are included in current juanicipio development costs but are not considered by the operator as part of the 440 000 initial project capital and the costs incurred are expected to reduce future sustaining capital costs and totaled approximately 41 388 on a 100 basis in the second half of 2021 in preparation for the legislation to come into effect the expected cash flow from the ongoing campaign processing until the juanicipio plant is commissioned along with the cash held by minera juanicipio at december 31 2021 of 18 972 are projected to

and year ended december 31 2021 was 542 g t and 470 g t three months and year ended december 31 2020 was 300 g t and 328 g t respectively this increased grade in the last quarter of 2021 reflects less diluted development material and more stoped vein material being processed processing plant construction outlook the juanicipio project team delivered the juanicipio plant for commissioning in the fourth quarter of 2021 however according to the operator fresnillo the state owned electrical company comision federal de electricidad cfe notified fresnillo late in december 2021 that the regulatory approval to complete the tie in to the national power grid could not yet be granted and the projected commissioning timeline has therefore been extended by approximately six months with commissioning of the juanicipio processing plant now expected to commence in q2 2022 with ramp up to 85 to 90 of the nameplate 4 000 tpd capacity by the end of 2022 according to fresnillo in order to minimize any potential adverse economic effect of the revised commissioning timeline fresnillo has indicated it will make available any unused plant capacity at its minera fresnillo and minera saucito operations to process mineralized material produced at juanicipio during this period and if possible match commissioning and ramp up tonnages that were previously expected the effect on cashflow generation from juanicipio therefore will also be mitigated while power connection approvals are pending with the plant ready to commence commissioning once connected to the power grid final construction costs are expected to wind down until final commissioning and testing commence meanwhile as noted above the amount of mineralized development material being processed at the two fresnillo plats since q4 2021 has been significantly higher than the original targeted rate of 16 000 tonnes per month the cash flow from this processing along with the cash held by minera juanicipio at december 31 2021 of 18 972 and the expected cash flows from continued processing until the juanicipio plant is commissioned are projected to substantially fund the remaining capital expenditures in the 440 000 initial project capital a cash call has not been needed since mid december 2021 which was 21 000 on a 100 basis with the current ramp up of underground mine production and given hiring restrictions on contractors arising from new 2021 labour reform legislation the timing of various sustaining capital expenditures has been brought forward labour reform on subcontracting and outsourcing in mexico was published on april 23 2021 and came into effect on september 1 2021 with various restrictions on hiring contractors fresnillo as operator has indicated a need to internalize a significant portion of its contractor workforce and perform much of the development work directly rather than outsourcing it to contractors this requires investment in equipment to be utilized in underground operations either not previously in the project scope or not envisaged to be required until later in the mine life as well certain underground development expenditures related to processing development material and some small items brought forward from project investments planned in the future are considered sustaining capital by fresnillo the costs incurred are expected to reduce future sustaining capital costs and totaled approximately 41 388 on a 100 basis in the second half of 2021 in preparation for the legislation to come into effect these costs are included in the current juanicipio development costs but are not considered by the operator as part of the 440 000 initial project capital should there be additional funding requirements in excess of the cashflow generated related to further commissioning delays or to additional sustaining capital that is being brought forward there may still be further cash calls required from fresnillo and mag juanicipio exploration update the planned expenditures for the 2022 exploration program total 7 000 with the programs designed to expand and convert the inferred mineral resources included in the deep zone into indicated mineral resources and

i come from a long line of strong independent women women who were brave and who took risks big risks women who possessed true grit the grit and determination that it would take to move your family across an ocean to a new country women who had guts the guts to rise above social norms to hunt and shoot a gun long before it was acceptable for a woman in honor of march and women s history month i would like to celebrate two trailblazers in my life women like my great grandmother anna lovisa larson an immigrant from sweden she crossed an ocean in 1891 along with her husband anders and their two small children august and annie also known as lovisa she will be forever memorialized in edith swain mcdermott s the pioneer history of greeley county nebraska edith described lovisa in the dedication of her book as the woman who left a rich home in sweden and found herself living in a dugout in greeley county lovisa s son alfred was interviewed by edith in september 1938 and explained having been used to more than comfortable surroundings in their native land they were somewhat shocked to find that the only place to live on the land that they had rented was a dugout on the side of a hill alfred continued with the fortitude which the pioneers of this new country displayed so frequently they accepted the situation and lived in a dugout a year then moved onto land which they had purchased northwest of wolbach within a few years they built one of the handsomest homes in the county lovisa left her family in sweden she would return only twice in 45 years to the old country to visit her beloved lunden the family farm which remains in our family to this day she had to learn english no small task in addition to august and annie she went on to have five more children daughter ellen and sons harry and alfred tragically she lost twin boys who died shortly after birth she was known throughout greeley county as the swedish pipeline this pipeline would host many young swedes who were looking for a new start in america many who were lovisa s nieces and nephews lovisa would host neighborhood gatherings her obituary in the wolbach messenger aug 1936 stated the larson home was noted for its hospitality and a warm welcome always being extended to neighbors and friends lovisa s granddaughter helen teilmann gregory of boise idaho comments in the early part of the last century the recently immigrated laron family lived in and about greeley county grandma larson loved to entertain and for these special occasions was certain to use her prized 12 piece setting of haviland limoges china to serve hardy farm meals to the family and their many nebraska friends helen continues my aunt nina teilmann told me that at least two meats two or more vegetables and several cakes were always prepared and with the help of her daughters and nieces lovisa saw that no swede dane or friend went away hungry due to the size of the crowd however it was usually necessary to serve the meal in two shifts after the first dozen folks were fed the dishes were then washed and dried by committee and the meal was presented again in its entirety to those who had waited patiently some perhaps consuming an occasional libation in the interim following her husband s death in 1922 lovisa would continue on with anders legacy owning and operating larson cattle company for the next 14 years along with their three sons august harry and alfred she survived on into the great depression of the 1930s by diversifying and trying new ideas in order to maintain the family farm which remains in her family to this day the wolbach messenger aug 6 1936 reported the news of lovisa s death mr mrs larson were true pioneers of this community they met and conquered the many hardships they encountered and in a short time built for themselves a comfortable home where mrs larson spent her declining years the deceased was respected by those who knew her for her honesty and uprightness of character my paternal grandmother ethel yax was a woman who possessed a true pioneer spirit along with a healthy dose of tenacity ethel was born feb 22 1906 to wallace and eliza clement maxwell in rural greeley county the family moved to wyoming and homesteaded when she was a teenager the family returned to scotia as a young girl in the mid 1920s ethel would work at the home hotel as a waitress for mother clark who operated the hotel and café later in life she would purchase this property and convert it into one of the first nursing homes in the state of nebraska she married leroy bud yax in 1927 at greeley sacred heart church they began their life as man and wife sharing a small house along fish creek with bud s uncle will halpin the growing yax family later would move to the halpin homeplace the great depression along with its many challenges would morph into a second world war along with gas and sugar rations ethel would diversify the farm s stock by adding flocks of turkeys which would become its saving grace she raised her five children worked on the family farm alongside her husband and at a time when most women would begin to slow down in life ethel was just getting started according to an article in the scotia register dated 1954 the home hotel in scotia closed the business had been one of the oldest in scotia it was known for its mighty fine family style cooking and clean rooms a lifelong dream of becoming a nurse fueled the endeavor to purchase the empty hotel in august 1957 the yax rest home held an open house after a four month restoration in which the old hotel had been remodeled modernized and partially refurbished ethel later would add a ceramics shop and the facility would flourish until 1971 when rigid state rules and regulations would force its closure i am blessed to have descended from women warriors who despite the challenges facing these greeley county gals stood strong and chased their dreams in the face of adversities and life s trials elizabeth king a nebraska resident periodically writes for the grand island independent in recognition of women s history month she writes about two of her relatives
bloomberg china s covid zero strategy has been drastic and effective saving lives and keeping the economy on track but a new wave of virus cases is highlighting the growing costs of that approach as well as the perils of any attempt to change it authorities are fighting to curb the spread of the omicron variant among a population that lacks natural immunity and only has access to home grown vaccines that are less effective than some of the global alternatives shanghai the country s financial center is locking down just weeks after the technology hub of shenzhen was forced to do so in the months ahead china will likely remain geared toward snuffing out the virus rather than learning to live with it western style still as the challenges of protecting public health and the economy with a covid zero policy become more apparent the debate is starting to shift any decision will have momentous consequences for a population of more than 1 4 billion and for a world economy already reeling from the war in ukraine bloomberg economics and bloomberg intelligence have analyzed the health and economic implications of three potential paths ahead the first is the status quo targeted local lockdowns to keep cases close to zero the second foresees a gradual opening backed by more advanced vaccines the third involves the nightmare of a widespread outbreak triggering a national lockdown how china can move forward politics weighs in favor of the first scenario president xi jinping is seeking a mandate for a third term at the end of this year suggesting any meaningful change of direction will likely have to wait until 2023 but moves toward opening in hong kong and recent comments by a covid advisor to the government of shanghai hint that an earlier shift is also possible with the costs of targeted lockdowns increasingly evident a gradual and controlled opening appears to be the least bad path forward and the one china is likeliest to take in the end the question is when and how there are no zero cost options but the evidence suggests that fatality rates under this scenario could be a fraction of the almost 1 million covid deaths that the u s has suffered and perhaps even below the 88 000 who die in china from the flu in a typical year in the worse case scenario of omicron spreading out of control hong kong s experience suggests the fatality rate on the mainland could reach 50 000 a day china s determination to avoid that outcome would likely entail a national lockdown that would potentially slow economic growth to 1 6 this year and send shock waves through the world economy among the likely results lower commodity prices and a more gradual pace of federal reserve interest rate hikes shanghai lockdown there have been about 40 00 confirmed cases in china s latest covid wave and substantially more if asymptomatic cases are included in most countries that number would be unremarkable in china it s the highest since the onset of the virus why china is sticking with its covid zero strategy quicktake shanghai on sunday announced it will lock down the city in two phases to carry out mass testing that follows more than a week of curbs in shenzhen and an ongoing lockdown in jilin an industrial center in the northeast altogether 20 provinces accounting for some 70 of gdp have areas where the risk of covid is now classified as high or medium the economic costs of lockdowns are plain to see china s industry has rebounded but consumption remains depressed the shenzhen shutdown contributed to a plunge in the stock market and sent a shudder through global supply chains foxconn a key supplier to apple was among those forced to close factories in shanghai tesla inc s plant had to suspend output then there are the social costs in november 2020 the sight of streets in shanghai crowded with marathon runners when the rest of the world was still socially distancing showcased china s success in managing the pandemic now the situation is reversed shanghai schoolchildren are back in remote learning whilst most of the world has opened up china hasn t seen anti vax protests like the ones in north america and europe still a population growing weary after two years of testing and controls adds another reason for beijing to shift away from covid zero china s omicron risk and opportunity above all the risk to public health is rising under the current covid zero approach china s priority has been to minimize infections while keeping the economy functioning as smoothly as possible that entails widespread testing and local lockdowns a process beijing calls dynamic clearing omicron is making this harder even with full vaccine cover and a booster shot international experience shows that protection against infection from omicron is limited in the u k two doses of the astrazeneca vaccine and an mrna booster delivered protection rates against symptomatic infection that fades from 60 one to two months after the final shot to just 40 three months later by contrast protection against the delta variant was above 90 since china s vaccines have proven less successful at stopping transmission than the mrnas though they ve generally been effective at preventing severe infections and death the risks there are likely higher making matters worse omicron s generation time the period for a person to become infectious is an abbreviated 1 5 3 days this means people may transmit the virus before they even know they have it asymptomatic cases common with the variant accelerate the spread still omicron may also represent an opportunity in a population with a good level of immunity from vaccines and with treatments increasingly available the severity of the disease is lower than other variants a point that s been noted by china s medical professionals if china can get enough effective shots into arms it would have a good chance of managing a controlled opening with a far lower cost in human life than in other countries here s what that might look like first china needs more mrna vaccines in late 2020 biontech said about 100 million doses would be available for china which would be enough to make a start on vaccinating the most vulnerable groups its local partner has filed for regulatory approval which hasn t been forthcoming as the government preferred to lean on locally developed shots but in february china signaled a potential shift away from its policy of preferring the domestic pharmaceutical industry by granting approval to pfizer inc s anti viral treatment paxlovid with those vaccines in hand china would identify a city or province to begin the controlled opening the entire local population would be dosed with an effective combination of vaccines and boosters outbound travel to the rest of china would require strict quarantine inbound travel would be opened up including from foreign countries when an infection occurs the virus would be allowed to spread across the local population pharmaceutical interventions like paxlovid could be used to limit the impact on the most vulnerable though supply constraints mean this would not be a panacea once the wave has run its course the local population now protected by both effective vaccines and natural immunity would have a high level of protection the process would then move to the next province or set of provinces until the entire country is inoculated immune and open economic output for 2022 in this scenario isn t much changed from the current covid zero track but the future gains are substantial both for growth and for public health the risk of a nationwide outbreak and lockdown will be removed travel with the rest of the world will reopen and life for households and businesses return to something like normality the following table illustrates some of the main covid policy options and their likely consequences for public health and the economy china s past performance suggests all of this could be accomplished fast in june 2021 it was administering almost 20 million vaccines a day at that pace delivering booster shots to the 127 million people of guangdong china s most populous province would take just a week estimating the health risks of controlled opening with any degree of accuracy is impossible because of all the unpredictable variables from demographics to the efficacy of vaccines and treatments that determine what share of the population suffers serious symptoms experts see china stuck in a slowly evolving covid zero loop in the netherlands the fatality rate during the omicron wave was 0 75 per million per day based on bloomberg intelligence calculations in the u s it was 5 2 for china assuming an outbreak that lasts a month an outcome at the bottom end of that range would mean around 31 000 deaths at the top end it would be closer to quarter of a million a number so high that even approaching it might trigger a change of course from beijing the costs of covid zero tragic though any such loss of life would be the cost of doing nothing might end up being even worse china s demonstrated capacity to impose strict controls means that an unchecked virus sweeping across the country is an unlikely scenario if it did occur the results would be disastrous the situation in hong kong isn t an exact parallel the former colony doesn t have the same capacity to impose lockdowns still it offers a glimpse of how bad things could get especially since china like hong kong has fallen short in vaccinating its oldest people with the health system overwhelmed the fatality rate in hong kong reached 37 4 per million on march 16 in mainland china this would translate into 50 000 deaths in a single day if there is a widespread outbreak the fight to prevent such a wave of deaths would require draconian lockdowns comparable in severity and scope to those imposed in early 2020 the result would be a severe blow to output with gdp growth for the year slumping to around 1 6 compared to bloomberg economics current expectations of 5 which assumes continued targeted local lockdowns the impact of such a sharp slowdown would not be confined to china global growth already reeling from the war in ukraine would take another hit the impact on inflation is harder to predict on the one hand slower growth is disinflationary and weaker chinese demand would hit commodity markets taking some of the heat out of energy prices on the other if china s factories and ports stop working supply chain snarls will worsen for the fed and other central banks lower growth and higher uncertainty would make a case for slower rate hikes back in 2015 the collapse in china s stocks and slump in the yuan was enough to delay the start and moderate the pace of fed hikes this time the impact could be bigger especially with europe already facing an energy squeeze what will xi jinping do next it s not just health and economic factors that will determine china s path forward politics also plays a role with xi positioning for a precedent breaking third term as party secretary and president a decision is expected at the communist party congress this fall the base case is for dynamic clearing to stay in place and any significant experiments in controlled opening to wait till 2023 there are benefits to delay china will have more time to acquire the billion plus mrna boosters it requires gather information on what combination of local and imported vaccines work best data from other countries shows a mix and match approach is effective procure more treatment drugs and move healthcare resources into place but there are also costs the outbreak in hong kong demonstrates that strict controls are no guarantee of covid zero success and that the consequences of failure can be severe hong kong s completely avoidable covid catastrophe perhaps for that reason there are tentative signs china is considering a change of approach beijing s top virus fighter has denied it but hong kong s march 21 announcement on easing restrictions could be an indication of what s to come on the mainland zhang wenhong a covid adviser to the municipal government in shanghai has said the next stage in fighting the virus will require vaccines treatments and medical resources a hint that preparations are already underway for a shift away from covid zero at a politburo meeting in march xi pledged to reduce the economic impact of his covid fighting measures still that doesn t herald a western style switch to living with the virus because in the calculus of china s government the benefits of snuffing out infections outweigh the costs it estimates the strategy has avoided 1 million deaths and 50 million illnesses as ren yi an influential and well connected commentator who goes by the name of chairman rabbit wrote in march china s initial path to control the virus was born of necessity and proved correct the question is what s next 2022 bloomberg l p

kyiv ukraine russia threatened thursday to turn off its gas taps to europe opening up a new front in its war in ukraine amid growing scepticism over moscow s claim it is scaling back its onslaught over a month into russia s invasion of its neighbour vladimir putin s troops have devastated cities like mariupol with shelling killing at least 5 000 people in the port city alone but they have struggled to take any significant territory moscow insisted things were going to plan as it said this week it would scale back attacks on capital kyiv and the northern city of chernigiv but ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky has dismissed the promise as a red herring and us president joe biden said he was sceptical instead the us and nato shared zelensky s reading that moscow may be seeking to regroup and resupply for its offensive in the eastern donbas region russia has moved about 20 percent of its troops from around kyiv after failing to capture the city which continues to be targeted by russian airstrikes pentagon spokesman john kirby said it s not exactly clear where they re going to go he said but we don t see any indication that they re going to be sent home he said the best assessment is that the troops are going to be repositioned probably into belarus to be refitted and resupplied and used elsewhere in ukraine he noted that russia has said it plans to reprioritize its operations in the donbas area putin isolated highlighting russia s underestimation of ukraine s dogged defence biden said there was some indication that putin was out of touch with the situation on the ground western intelligence has warned the russian leader s advisers may be afraid to tell him the truth about battlefield losses or the damage that sanctions have wrought on the country s economy but kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov rejected the assessments saying western officials don t understand president putin they don t understand the mechanism for taking decisions and they don t understand the style of our work biden was notably cautious putin seems to be self isolated and there s some indication that he has fired or put under house arrest some of his advisers the us president told reporters but he said he did not want to put too much stock into the reports as shells rained down on kyiv a ukraine foreign ministry spokesman accused russian troops of looting homes as they left one area electronics clothes shoes cosmetics this is not an army this is a disgrace tweeted oleg nikolenko shells also continued hitting the northern city of chernigiv where the governor of the region vicheslav chaus poured scorn on moscow s claim it was deescalating at the minimum it is regrouping he wrote on telegram the ukrainian commander in the eastern city of kharkiv also warned russian forces were regrouping to attack general pavlo maestro told afp his message to the russian invading force was go home while you re still alive though he warned against underestimating moscow ukraine did confirm russian troops had pulled back from the chernobyl nuclear site after occupying it for weeks reportedly taking an unspecified number of captured servicemen with them us taps oil stockpile with his economy crippled by unprecedented international sanctions putin on thursday sought to leverage russia s status as an energy power warning that eu members will need to set up ruble accounts from friday to pay for russian gas the eu has joined the united states in imposing sanctions however mindful of their own power needs the bloc has stopped short of an energy embargo if such payments are not made we will consider this a breach of obligations on the part of our buyers and existing contracts would be stopped putin said germany which before putin s offensive in ukraine imported 55 percent of its gas supplies from russia insisted that it will pay in euros or dollars as stipulated in contracts berlin and paris were also preparing for russian gas to simply stop flowing france s economy minister said biden moved to mitigate rising fuel prices by announcing a release from strategic us reserves of a million barrels daily for six months it is by far the largest tapping of the stockpiles in us history and amounts to augmenting global supplies by about one percent pivot to donbas military experts believe that with thousands of russian troops killed and many thousands more injured moscow has to ditch efforts to advance simultaneously in the north east and south its focus instead has turned towards capturing more urban centres in the donbas area including mariupol while continuing to fire long range assaults on other cities russia forces have encircled mariupol which the kremlin wants to capture to link the cities of donetsk and lugansk under de facto russian control and the crimean peninsula but a larger push into the donbas region could herald a more prolonged conflict pentagon spokesman john kirby said thursday it might not just be a matter of days and weeks it could be much longer than that he said in mariupol where tens of thousands have for weeks been under siege with little water food or electricity ukrainian authorities sent 45 buses in for a new rescue mission the international red cross said it was ready to lead the safe passage operation on friday previous repeated attempts to get civilians out have collapsed zelensky warned his war

supply of oil and achieving lasting american energy independence so i m going to turn it over to brian who s going to make some comments and then we ll take some of your questions mr deese thank you kate just wanted to say thank you kate laughter so i just wanted to give a little bit of additional background on a couple of the elements of what the president announced today and then happy to take your questions the first is on the release of the strategic petroleum reserve as you all just heard from the president he today authorized the largest release from the strategic petroleum reserve in american history 1 million barrels a day for six months and i just want to give you a little bit of context first the strategic petroleum reserve itself is our national asset to deal with emergency supply disruptions in energy markets there s currently 568 million barrels in the reserve which is actually in four locations across southern louisiana and texas and the president authorized this reserve under his extraordinary emergency powers associated with supply disruptions which we have seen in the market are associated with putin s unjustified actions and the reaction from the united states and alliesin the world in no longer purchasing russian oil the scale of the release is unprecedented so a million barrels a day and the duration is also unprecedented six months the duration is was really designed and calibrated to operate as a bridge a medium term bridge to the period where we anticipate and expect u s production to come back online the most estimates based on commit commitments by companies are that we will see an additional million barrels a day from u s industry by about the end of the third quarter of this year so this the time period operates as a bridge until then and the amount a million barrels today is unprecedented but feasible based on the technical capabilities of the strategic petroleum reserve itself we also know there is significant demand in the market we are operating in a supply constrained market that is the core challenge that is addressed that has driven prices up but we saw for example the last the last sale that the strategic petroleum reserve conducted was oversubscribed by about two and a half times so there is demand out there in the market the last thing that i would say is that a very important element of the president s announcement today was that the president authorized the sale but also the commitment to repurchase oil and that will happen in coming years at a lower price and that s important for two reasons one is yeah it provides that bridge to during this period of extraordinary supply constraint but it also provides stability to the market in the future that there will be a buyer to purchase oil at a lower price and it also allows us to actually maintain and increase the resilience of the strategic petroleum reserve over the long term we will be refilling the reserve and if we re buying at a lower price we ll actually be in a position to refill at a more barrels ultimately so the current 568 million barrels will come down but then will go back up and that s how the reserve functions secondly just briefly i wanted to touch on the presidential directive that the president signed today authorizing the defense production act for usage for the critical materials that go into large capacity batteries so the president took this action under title 3 of the defense production act which provides for prioritizing and subsidizing the production domestically of key inputs that are critical to the national defense so the secretary of defense has undertaken a study and identified that large capacity batteries are critical to the national defense and the components that go into them including lithium and nickel cobalt graphite manganese my guess is that s the first time in the white house briefing room someone has said manganese laughter these are critical minerals and we are currently vulnerable to unreliable supply chains which affects our national security it also affects our economic security as well so taking by taking this action the president is authorizing the government to use the dpa authorities to build domestic production capability in these key materials and this is going to be a key driver for building a domestically resilient supply chain to build large capacity batteries those are the batteries that go into electric vehicles but also used for storage in other applications and also to accelerate what the president talked about today of how we move to true energy independence by reducing our dependence on oil the amount of oil that we consume and reducing our dependence on fossil fuels so those are those are two we the president touched on other issues as well i m happy to take questions all about but i wanted to put a little bit more context on those two ms bedingfield great we ll start with kristen q great kate thank you two questions brian thank you for being here one to the figure 1 million barrels per day and to the skepticism that that sounds unrealistic why should americans have confidence that you re going to be able to meet that benchmark on a daily basis and when can americans expect to actually see the price of gas come down mr deese so on the first one the department of energy s strategic petroleum reserve have now committed per the president s direction to release a million barrels a day into the market number one we have the full operational capacity to do that as i mentioned there are actually four locations that make up the strategic petroleum reserve for purposes of this release we will be releasing from all four of those locations if you look at the actual operational capacity across all four of them it is actually up to 4 million barrels a day in operational capacity so actually executing a million barrels a day is well within the operational constraints and a big part of that is because a lot of that moves by pipeline and so they to established offtake points that s point number one point number two there s been some question about will there be sufficient market interest or sufficient demand including on the transport side and i would say there that the most the best indicator is what just happened in the market when in the last the last sale that the spr tendered was two and a half times oversubscribed so certainly there is significant demand in the market and that you would expect because supply is constrained and prices are high so we fully expect that the strategic petroleum reserve will execute against this per the president s direction to your question about the timing of of the impact we ve already seen and as we came in here you know oil is trading down about 6 percent today but the way that we think about this is in terms of supply and the market constraint and so the supply in the global market obviously the price of oil is set at the global at the margin the global market the global supply is down because of russian oil the million barrels a day plus what our allies and partners are intending to deliver and there s a there is a meeting tomorrow morning of the international energy agency in paris an emergency meeting and i won t get ahead of the specific commitments in that context but as the president said we re confident that our allies and partners will provide tens of millions of barrels additional into the market so we re looking at well in excess of a million barrels a day of additional supply onto the market for an importantly for several months that that is the most ambitious aggressive historic effort to try to replace supply in the short term so certainly there is uncertainty about pricing and lots of different factors affect price across time but we we are confident that this is about the largest effort that oil that countries with oil reserves have ever taken to supply the market in this way q and could prices come down in a matter of days or weeks i know it s difficult to pinpoint but just for americans who budget based on how much they have to spend on gasoline what should they be bracing for mr deese well the as the president spoke to today that is uncertain and so you know and being being very clear the market price is impossible to predict with certainty one thing that i will say for sure is that as the price of oil comes down it s incredibly important that the that it flows through to the consumer in terms of the price of gas as quickly as feasible we ve seen that be a problem in the past and it s definitely an issue that we are focused on ms bedingfield justin q hey brian i have two one is to follow on i think what you just said which is you ve identified there s been a problem between crude oil prices and what folks are paying at the pump and laid some of the blame for that at oil companies in the past the president today in his remarks spoke to some extent about how there were good actors and bad actors in terms of folks who are ramping up production right now versus the folks who are sort of banking profit so i wanted to give you an opportunity for americans who want to do the patriotic thing where should they be going to buy their gas right now are there are there good companies that have worked with the administration and folks that you re frustrated with right now and then my other question was on your former friends kind of in the green community that have expressed i think some level of frustration with the announcement today feeling like it s doubling down on fossil fuels obviously i know that you ve kind of made this argument that long term you re trying to pivot towards green energy especially with the second part of the announcement today but what do you say to climate activists who are sort of frustrated right now mr deese great so on the first on the first part of the question i would say our goal is to provide relief to all americans in all geographies across the country and that means doing everything we can to bring down the price of gas at the pump everywhere and so that s our that s our focus and the issue of the prices of gas going up very quickly and tracking oil prices and coming down much more slowly is not new it s old enough that economists have a particular term associated with it called rockets and feathers but just because we can identify it doesn t mean that it is it reflects an efficient market or a competitive market so that that has been that has been our focus on your second question i want to be really clear and i think the president you know the president said this better today but i will just underscore it the circumstances in global oil markets today and global energy markets today provide the clearest possible signal why the united states needs to do everything it can to accelerate toward energy security and true energy independence and the only way that we can ultimately do that is to reduce and eliminate our dependence on fossil fuels that s what the president was clear about today and that in fact in the very near term making sure that we have adequate supply is critically important for american families who are suffering but the opportunity to actually work in partnership with our european allies for example to help them reduce their own dependence by reducing demand for fossil energy by moving forward on the plan that the president underscored today we have a historic opportunity to do that and we are wasting no time and we are taking no this is not causing us to do anything but move even more quickly in the steps that we can take i think the message that we have is that not only not only can we do these things together but we have to do these things together ms bedingfield alex q yes thank you i just wanted to follow up about the allies and partners who would be participating can you give any additional detail will china be participating in the oil release mr deese so i don t want to get ahead of any specific commitments but i ll say a couple of things the first is that as with every action that we have taken in relation to the war in ukraine the president and our entire team have been consulting and working incredibly closely with allies and partners on this this was a significant topic in the president s call with the quint on monday at the leader level our teams have been working around the clock together before going into that and in the period since the iea is the body of countries that have significant stocks and reserves and the formal process that they under that they go into and the united states is a member of the iea is to bring forward a proposal for a collective release and the que the decision is whether there is a collective release and then how much each country will contribute into that so that s the process that will that will happen starting tomorrow morning i don t want to get ahead of it the only thing that i would say and i think this is probably implicit in what we have done here is we the united states and the president made an explicit decision that the united states would lead here and lead with a historic use of our reserves we have those reserves we have the capability to do that and so that was a that was an explicit decision at the same time looking to partner with allies and i think we will see that reflected over the course of the next couple of days q so all of the iea members are the only ones participating in the release is that accurate mr deese well what i can tell you is that the iea the meeting tomorrow will be of iea me of iea members and that will be the question will be about a collective release in that context we continue to engage with non iea members china and other countries around their reserves and we ll continue to do so but the immediate the immediate step at hand will be the iea q the president said gas might drop between 10 and 35 cents a gallon brian q on this q does sound about right to you 10 and 35 cents a gallon does that sound about right q do you q that s what president biden said q have any reaction to opec failing to q is that 10 35 cents q thanks brian on this use it or lose it push you know the president had discussions with leaders in the oil industry ahead of this announcement what if any assurances were given about increasing production were there any guarantees made mr deese so what we have engaged with oil companies and energy companies on they have been public about so you can see the reason why the market expectation has now increased to an expectation of about a million barrels a day of additional production online is because many of those companies have gone out and been quite explicit about their intention to ramp up production across time and that s an outgrowth of a number of the conversations that we have had and so the use or lose it approach is consistent in the sense that those companies that are looking to ramp production or to to bring back online shuttered wells those permitted areas would obviously be unaffected q so again does 10 to 35 cents sounds ms bedingfield april q i m asking a question q brian i m sorry brian mr deese as i said it s uncertain and so i ll let the president q brian so since q does that what s a fair price q sorry they called on me q what s a fair price q brian q that you would accept the white house for gas q brian as you just spoke about china what are the conversations with india another country that s dealing with major oil issues gasoline issues and also what are the guarantees with this 1 million a day for six months for americans mr deese so there our conversations with all countries that have reserves is similar in encouraging them to participate and to contribute in consistent with their stocks their available stocks and their and their circumstances we have seen to date a quite extraordinary willingness to participate including iea and non iea members to participate in those coordinated releases including the indian government to date and so the work of diplomacy and engagement with our allies and partners is aimed to make sure that that continues q but isn t it more about the united states china and india when you are looking at these three top three consumers of oil mr deese so in terms what when we re talking about collective releases the issue is actually where are the countr who are the countries that actually have the largest reserves not the largest consumers but the largest reserves so those are the iea q but consumption does play into this as well though mr deese certainly but in terms of releasing supply onto the market that s a function of the reserves q and then what are the guarantees for the american consumer in these six months in the midst of covid in the midst of this war in the midst of russia doing whatever it s doing mr deese well and i think this goes to the question the gentleman s question as well what the president what the president has said is is that in terms of guarantees he s going to do everything that he can he s going to stay at this even in a very uncertain period to do everything within his power to try to provide relief to families and we can now commit that we will deliver a million barrels a day into the into the market consistent with the president s directive across time ms bedingfield so i think brian has time for one more ed q thanks brian in talking about countries that may or may not get involved i m curious if there s been any more conversation with venezuela iran saudi arabia about boosting the production or about working out how we can potentially see more of their oil get back on the market and then on the use or lose it proposal he talked about the idea that companies would be fined if they don t use their leases is there existing legislation he s referring to or how would that work mr deese sure q and how is that if not legal how is that in keeping with sort of the capitalistic he says he s a capitalist mr deese of course q who is the government to be telling businesses what to do with something they ve leased i guess mr deese sure so on your first there are conversations engagements ongoing but i don t have any i don t have any new update on that front on the on the second the we start from the premise that all of these are leases on public land so it s federal it s federal land and so it s a your assets as a as citizens and as taxpayers and so the way the process works is that companies lease tracts of land they then in areas where they are more interested in potentially discovering they then seek a permit within their leased areas and so the way that this policy would operate would be to say going forward in those areas where you are holding leased land but you are not exploring then you then you would pay incrementally on that i would say two things one is when companies lease they ll lease with the federal government again this is companies operating with the federal government on public land the lease is to explore and to pursue production that s the stated those are the stated lease terms so it is it s appropriate for the federal and number two companies can always rescind their leases or transfer their leases as well so they can they can they can provide their leases back to the federal government if they no longer have any use for them or they could transfer them as well so this is really about a very practical issue which is everybody republicans democrats everyone is saying we need to figure out how to increase more supply and so in those areas where we already know that the leases have occurred the permits have occurred there s nothing more that needs to happen we should be encouraging companies to operate and if they don t intend to or they don t they don t want to then they could hand those leases back to the government q are you still concerned that gas prices could hit record highs this spring and this summer mr deese so the i m not i m not going to predict where the where the market will go you ll you ll find me not predicting on any particular forward data point what i will say is that because of the president s actions today because of a historic effort to put a million barrels a day of supply into the market and because of the effort to work with allies and partners and galvanize a global response on this front the market will be significantly more well supplied and prices will be lower than if we didn t take this historic action and that s you know that s what our focus is actions that we can take to make sure that the that prices come down as much as we can q brian one on food security real quick do you have updates on the president s efforts to prevent real food shortages sparked by the war mr deese so we are it s a issue of a top focus and we will have more to say on that issue in the coming days but i don t have a specific announcement for you today q any reaction to opec only incrementally raising production mr deese i think it s the same answer as the question earlier we continue to have those conversations but i don t have anything new for you today q any message to low income americans getting clobbered right now at the pumps mr deese you have a president who you have a president who is doing everything that he possibly can to try to address that situation including i would say the president announced today and i would encourage you all to to really cover it and look into it 3 2 million through the weatherization program that goes directly to low income families a low income family could get a 6 500 grant to make their home more energy efficient bring down their energy costs by hundreds of dollars a year and improve the health of their home that s something the president did this week putting that money out in addition to the other issues that we discussed today thanks ms bedingfield thanks brian thank you all very much so if you will just indulge me for a minute i have a few announcements i d like to make at the top here so just bear with me so today we re marking transgender the transgender day of visibility by celebrating transgender americans who are thriving and making their communities stronger unfortunately transgender americans particularly children continue to face unacceptably high levels of bullying and discrimination as you know the president signed one of the most comprehensive executive orders on lgbtqi rights in history shortly after taking office and this administration has repeatedly and forcefully called out state legislatures that are advancing legislation that discriminates against trans children and their families today the state department and department of homeland security announced new steps that will improve the travel experience for transgender americans and the department of health and human services has released new resources for transgender kids and their families to help protect their mental health and ensure they receive the care they need to thrive finally the president is reiterating his call for the senate to pass the equality act to provide long overdue civil rights protections to transgender and lgbtqi americans as the president told transgender americans in his state of the union address this administration will always have your back so you can be yourself and reach your god given potential today we re also celebrating the life and legacy of césar estrada chávez a champion for social justice an advocate for farmworkers and working people who build and sustain our nation a leader who has inspired generations of people to fight organize and expand opportunities for workers when president biden became president he placed a bust of césar chávez in the oval office as a reminder of the values and his vision to fight for respect social justice and equal dignity for all workers the biden harris administration remains committed to building an economy from the bottom up and the middle out that works for all we fought hard to pass the american rescue plan that helped latino workers families and small businesses to ensure that they had the support they needed through the pandemic and we created a historic task force on worker organizing and empowerment to help workers to organize to provide an earned pathway to citizenship today we join people across the country celebrating and honoring césar chávez s legacy while we continue to advance the rights and dignity of working people today new cdc data further underscored the mental health impact of the pandemic including the fact that nearly half of high schoolers reported that they felt persistently sad or hopeless during the past year as a mother of young kids i know this is a huge concern for so many parents the president has been acutely aware of the mental health impact of the pandemic on young people which is why he made it a day one priority to get schools reopened safely and secure much needed resources through the american rescue plan to address youth mental health a bill which every single republican i would note voted against we ve invested five and a half billion dollars in programs that support mental health and wellbeing including tens of millions for programs that specifically address youth mental health for instance schools across the country are using american rescue plan funds to hire school counselors and social workers to address this crisis according to this new cdc data the very kind of connection that helps protect youth mental health president biden remains deeply focused on this very real crisis and providing the resources to address it as part of the unity agenda that he laid out during the state of the union address and his budget the president put forward a historic increase in funding to strengthen and expand youth mental health services and we re going to continue to build on this progress and do everything we can to support the mental health and wellbeing of our young people and then lastly but certainly not least today we announced additional sanctions on russian technology companies that enable putin s war of choice we will prevent them from procuring western technology and evading our severe sanctions we re also expanding our sanctions authority to target additional sectors of the russian economy important to putin including aerospace maritime and the electronics sectors in the coming days the commerce department will also take further action to degrade russia s defense aerospace and maritime sectors by adding 120 entities in russia and belarus to the entity list bringing the number of russian and belarusian parties added to the list to over 200 since the invasion began being added to this list means that these entities can no longer get u s cutting edge technology without a license which will which will in most if not all of these cases be denied compared to the same time period last year u s exports to russia of items subject to our new export controls have decreased by 99 percent by value the power of these restrictions will compound over time as russia draws down any remaining stockpiles for example spare parts for certain planes and tanks we will continue to impose unprecedented costs strengthen ukraine s hand and make putin s war of choice a strategic failure so thanks for hanging with me i told you i had a lot and i m happy to take questions darlene q thanks kate a couple on russia can you elaborate first on the president s comment a while ago that there is some indication that putin has either fired some of his top officials or put some of them under house arrest what evidence or information does the white house have ms bedingfield well the president s words on that speak for thems for themselves i don t have a lot to add by the way of detail what i would point to is certainly information that we made public yesterday about putin and his military you know i think writ large we have seen this invasion has been a strategic failure for putin and for russia they are working to re define the intentional the the initial i should say the initial aims of their invasion and we ve seen time and again that the sanctions that have been applied are providing are exacting extreme costs on their economy so i don t have anything to add to what the president said except to say we have seen incontrovertible evidence that this has been a strategic disaster for russia q and the second question is the united states the uk have been working together to release intelligence information since before russia invaded ukraine and i was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the value of that relationship and how the white house thinks it s affected putin s conduct in the war releasing that kind of information ms bedingfield well i can t speak to how it s impacted putin s conduct that s again as i said yesterday i m not a spokesperson for the kremlin what i can say though is that we ve made every effort to be transparent even from the time before putin invaded we worked to make sure that we were providing information that gave a sense of what we knew russia was going to do i think it you know to call them out in that way and to be clear that we knew what their intentions were had the impact of putting them on their back foot i can t again i can t speak to how that s impacted their calculus that s for them to say but i think we ve seen writ large that the invasion has been a strategic error is leaving russia weaker putin himself has said that the sanctions have imposed unprecedented costs on the russian economy and our role in this our role is to continue to strengthen ukraine on the battlefield as we ve been doing with an unprecedented amount of security assistance and to continue to strengthen their hand at the negotiating table q and then just one more quickly going back to the information that you mentioned you all released yesterday is that some sort of an attempt to sow division among the russian leadership and if so does the white house think that is working ms bedingfield it is simply an effort to continue to paint the picture of what a strategic blunder this decision has been for vladimir putin mary q on that it seems you re releasing even more information today a u s official says you have information that indicates that some russian government senior officials likely disagreed with putin s decision to invade ukraine that their disillusionment is probably amplified by russia s military underperformance is it your understanding that putin is losing the support of some of his top officials and why release this as well ms bedingfield well again i don t have anything further to add to the specifics there i can only speak to what this underscores which is the larger sense that this has been a failure for russia you know i think we ve seen reporting that morale amongst the russian military is low and i think that would not come as a surprise to anyone who s seen what the russian military is is enduring here you have conscripts you have people who ve been brought in to fight this incredibly grueling battle so i don t think it s a surprise to anybody that morale is low but beyond that i don t have anything specific that i can add q on the president s comments about you know people being put under house arrest or arrested can you say is it your understanding that those who are being arrested under house arrest are ones who sort of broke the bad news to the president about the military s performance or are they ones who now are disagreeing with disagree with the decision to invade in the first place ms bedingfield i don t have any further additional detail that i can add mike q you keep saying though that though that this is to try and you know paint a picture of putin s strategic blunder or strategic error but it certainly seems like you re needling and trolling vladimir putin here ms bedingfield those are your words not ours i we have been very clear that we are everything that we are doing here is designed to advance our ultimate strategic aim which is strengthening as i said strengthening ukraine on the battlefield strengthening their hand at the negotiating table giving them what they need to push back on russian aggression and i think it is self evident based on what we ve seen since putin invaded on february 24 as we ve seen their economy collapse we ve seen the ruble collapse you know the impact of his choice has been significant and we re going to continue to advance our strategy of doing everything we can to ensure that ukraine is has what they need to continue to push back on russian aggression mike q this may be a little late late breaking i don t know but there have been reports in the last hour or so about concerns at chernobyl with russian with russians leaving the nuclear plant because of some kind of exposure do you have any does the u s government have any information about what might be going on there and whether sort of how broad the danger is there ms bedingfield i have not seen that since we came into this room but i m happy to go look into it and we can come back to you with answers yeah cleve q hey on covid i wonder if you can comment on reports that there s an agreement in principle for 10 billion in additional covid aid i think senator romney talked about it earlier today ms bedingfield so as we talked about yesterday we are obviously very hopeful that congress is making progress as we need to get this urgent funding that we need to fight covid 19 the president has been very clear there is a strong sense of urgency here you know you heard him say yesterday that congress s failure to act is already having severe consequences including on our supply of monoclonal antibodies and treatments for the immunocompromised so these are as you note ongoing active negotiations on this and so we re certainly not going to negotiate from the podium but i will say that the president has been very clear that there s an urgent need for this funding and we re very hopeful that congress is going to come to a solution on this q one more ms bedingfield sure q one follow on that ms bedingfield sure q i think the plan calls for slashing some of the foreign aid you know biden has said repeatedly that we can t just you know take care of ourselves that we have to you know the pandemic isn t going to stop there s no wall we can build would he sign a bill or would he veto a bill that doesn t include significant foreign aid ms bedingfield well what i would say to this is we have been very clear and the president has been very clear both publicly and in private about the acute need for funding of our global response for weeks if not months and in the past day our position has been very clear about the importance here right now countries in fact are declining our doses because they don t have the infrastructure in place to take our lifesaving vaccines funding will obviously help solve this issue and i actually want to read to you a letter to the president signed by 14 u s senators half of whom are republicans quote we urge you in the strongest possible terms to do more to lead global efforts to end this pandemic and increase global vaccine access so we hope that these senators will follow their own advice and provide resources for the global response because now is the time to act and we re not going to be able to put this pandemic behind us until we stop the spread and proliferation of new variants globally so the president has been very clear he believes this funding is important but again we re going to let congress work through and we re very hopeful that they are going to come to a solution q kate q a russia follow up ms bedingfield kristen q thanks kate i want to ask you again about the president s comments today when he was asked about the information that putin is being left in the dark by his advisors he seemed much less confident in the intelligence than you were from the podium and other top officials here when he was asked about it today he said it s an open question there s a lot of speculation he seems to be self isolating he said but we don t have hard evidence you said from the podium we have information that putin felt misled by the russian military why the disconnect ms bedingfield i don t see a disconnect there we were clear yesterday that we shared a piece of information that helps paint a picture about how this has been a strategic failure for russia there q the president said there s a lot of speculation he didn t say we have hard evidence we re confident ms bedingfield and there s there is plenty of discussion and that s part of what we did yesterday was put additional information into the public sphere into the conversation i don t think there s a disconnect between those two things the president was making a statement about where things currently stand where he understands things to currently stand i don t think that s i don t think that s in any way at odds with what we said yesterday q so is the administration confident that putin is being left in the dark by his top advisors you stand by everything you said from the podium yesterday ms bedingfield we put forward information yesterday and i think you can draw the appropriate conclusion from that we would not put it forward if we didn t have confidence in it q one more on hunter biden who has been in the headlines again recently during the last presidential debate then vice president biden was asked if there was anything inappropriate or unethical about his son s relationships business dealings in china and or ukraine the president said nothing was unethical he went on to say my son has not made money in terms of this thing about what you re talking about china does the white house stand by that comment that the then vice president made ms bedingfield we absolutely stand by the president s comment and i would point you to the reporting on this which reference statements that we made at the time that we gave to the washington post who worked on this story and but as you know i don t speak for hunter biden so there s not more i can say on that jacqui q thank you kate on releasing barrels from the strategic reserve this move does not resolve the structural deficit that we have in the last two times the administration released barrels of oil it didn t have a measurable impact on gas prices so what makes this administration believe that this move is going to have an impact this time ms bedingfield well this is as you heard brian say this is a historic and unprecedented release in terms of size it is going to help meet the mismatch between supply and demand in the market a million barrels a day is a significant addition to the marketplace and is going to as i say is going to address the some of the mismatch between supply and demand and i think what americans should take away from this announcement today is that president biden is relentlessly focused on doing everything he can to ensure that putin s price hike does not hit them at the gas pump so what they ve seen from him i think since the day he took office is a focus on doing what he can to address kitchen table issues to address the things that people across the country are worried about including gas prices and so today you know not only is it historic in scope but it as you heard brian talk about this has also been the president has led a global effort to galvanize a response to this because he knows that rising prices at the pump hurt families and he s doing everything in his power to bring those prices down q this is going to bring up the ms bedingfield oh q this is going to bring up the the supply in the short term but it s not you know a long term solution and you know one analyst has said that if the market maintains a structural deficit for a long period of time releasing reserves might actually keep prices higher so if this does not work in the way that you think it s going to work will the administration stop releasing a million barrels a day ms bedingfield we will cer well i won t i won t speak to what we might do in the hypothetical depending on where the market goes what i will say broadly is of course we would always adjust our strategy to do what is most effective to bring prices down what i would say about the long term to your to your question about the long term is you know and i think you heard brian articulate this really well and of course the president spoke to it very powerfully today too which is this ultimately shows that dependence on fossil fuels dependence on foreign oil is not in the sustainable long term best interests of the united states and that s why the president has put forward a really aggressive plan to move us to clean energy sources of energy that we can make here in the united states that s part of as you heard brian talk about the defense production act announcement that he made today to help us make electric vehicle batteries in the united states you know the president feels very strongly that we need to move we need to make significant strides toward a clean energy economy it s something he s been very focused on you ll remember for those of you who covered the campaign it s something he ran on and so he s very focused on ensuring that we re taking those strides because that is that is actually the long term solution here q on sanctions the russian ruble has almost returned to its pre war levels so does the administration believe that the sanctions are still working ms bedingfield absolutely yes and what i would say about what i would say about the ruble is what we re seeing here is an artificial propping up of the ruble by the russian central bank and by and by the russian government there are avenues that were closed off to allow the sale of rubles they are basically taking artificial measures to keep the ruble propped up i would also say that in the first q but what are we doing about that ms bedingfield you know in the first few days in the first i would say also in the first few days after the conflict began the ruble was a reliable measure of where the russian economy is but it is not any longer in part because of these artificial steps that are being taken so if you look at things like dramatic inflation in russia if you look at private investment pulling out of russia if you look at putin himself saying that the sanctions have imposed unprecedented costs i think that s a better metric of where the russian economy is right now steve q i want to follow up on kristen s question about the president s son is it your understanding it s the president s view that as he looks at all of hunter biden s business dealings with his uncle that neither hunter biden nor james biden committed any crimes or did anything that was unlawful ms bedingfield so i don t have anything further to add from this podium we addressed this with the washington post we pointed to statements that were made in the fall of 2020 when we addressed these questions and i don t have anything additional to add from this podium q can i ask you if there have been if you re aware if there have been any discussions here inside this white house about whether the president might use his pardon or commutation power with respect to either his son or his brother ms bedingfield that s not a hypothetical i m going to entertain i don t have anything to add from this podium justin q thanks kate the president met with progressive lawmakers last night here at the white house and afterwards they said that they d pressed him on sort of a laundry list of executive orders and actions that they d like him to take canceling student debt raising the overtime threshold prescription drug costs are any of those sort of live here in the white house right now are they under consideration especially i think relative to this negotiation that s going on about elements of build back better and whether you know push and pull with those executive actions might help or hurt that effort ms bedingfield well i don t have any specific announcements on any of those specific pieces what i would say more broadly is that from day one the president has used the full array of tools at his disposal to achieve his objectives and that s included legislative action regulatory action and executive orders and he will certainly continue to do so but i don t have any specific coming actions to preview for you right now q and then sorry real quick jordan ask you yesterday about the meeting in india with senior administration officials ms bedingfield mm hmm q i m wondering now that those have wrapped up do you have any newfound confidence that india will decide against maintaining oil trade with russia or a sense of you know what came out of the talks ms bedingfield so i don t have any specific i knew you were going to ask this and i need to follow up with specifics because i don t have any i don t have any additional specifics to read out beyond the fact that they were productive conversations you know daleep singh the deputy national security advisor for international economics had really good discussions with his counterparts and i know that the conversation was productive i don t have additional specifics to read out but i will and by the way i should be clear i meant generically i know you will ask not you specifically tarini q thanks kate so on the spr some republicans for example senator cassidy have said that the president with this move today in terms of the unprecedented drawdown of the spr that he s risking long term energy security to salvage poll numbers is that something that has played into the white house s calculus at all and how would you respond respond to that ms bedingfield absolutely not what the president is doing is using every tool available to him to bring prices down for the american people at the pump he s been clear that his focus is working to relieve the pain and the burden that working families middle class families are feeling as a result of price hikes so every policy decision that he makes is driven by a desire to do everything he can to ease that burden on working families ed q just two quick quick ones following up kristen s line of inquiry as well i know hunter biden is not a government employee you don t speak for him has the president read these reports do you guys take them to him when the inquires come in and what has been his reaction to them ms bedingfield i don t have anything additional to add on this from the podium but thank you kaitlan q thank q and on on title 42 you re preparing to end this policy at some point soon here there has been some concern expressed by democrats as well as republicans but democrats notably about how the administration is preparing to wind that down and prepare for a surge i believe some administration officials say they re anticipating a record surge what is the administration doing to not only alleviate those concerns from moderate democrats some of whom may face voter ire for that but then more broadly how is you know the administration preparing for that surge if you can sort of generally summarize ms bedingfield well so thank you for the question first i would note as i said yesterday and we have said many many times obviously this is a decision that the cdc will make that said of course we are preparing for contingencies and so what i would say is you know our goal is going to be to process migrants in a safe and orderly manner but also to be clear most individuals who cross the border without legal authorization will be promptly paced placed into removal proceedings and if they are unable to establish a legal basis to remain in the united states they ll be expeditiously removed and returned to their country of origin as a reminder economic need and flight from generalized violence is not a basis for asylum but rather asylum is for those with a well founded fear of persecution on a protected ground and so asylum and other legal migration pathways should remain available to those seeking protection and we re working to expand legal pathways in the region so that people don t make this treacherous journey obviously trying to enter the united states illegally carries consequences and no one should try to make this dangerous journey or try to unlawfully enter the united states the department of homeland security as i noted yesterday put together a preparedness plan to address the number of people coming to our border and work with our partners in the region to provide safe options for people outside the united states we are obviously working to deliver a more efficient and fair processing system through for example a dedicated docket to conduct speedier and fair immigration proceedings for families who arrive between ports of entry so there is a significant amount of work we obviously inherited when we came into this administration we inherited an immigration system that had been systematically dismantled by the previous administration there s been a tremendous amount of work from day one to rebuild that and we are certainly focused on continuing to assert order at the border q thanks kate one point of clarification when the president says he believes putin is firing or putting senior advisors on house arrest he s talking about military advisors right ms bedingfield i have nothing additional i can add beyond the president s comments on this q you can t say that he s referencing the russian foreign minister ms bedingfield i think his words speak for him speak for themselves q thank you and ms bedingfield alex q no no sorry i ve got one more ms bedingfield sure q president biden has not spoken to president putin in quite some time are there any plans being made for the two of them to speak ms bedingfield not currently we ve been very clear that any reengagement of diplomacy at that level would require significant demonstration from the russians of serious de escalation and we have not seen that q oh you need to see de escalation before he ll speak to president putin again ms bedingfield we ve been very clear about that yeah q do you take do you take any responsibility q the white house has previously q inaudible president biden approval q the white house has previously considered a gas tax holiday but basically kind of ruled against it i m curious if this is still off the table and what does the white house think about individual states that are considering or have already enacted their own gas tax holidays ms bedingfield so it is it is not off the table in fact the president is looking at every option to provide relief to consumers around around gas prices obviously a lot of these conversations are happening in congress but again the president is not taking anything off the table at this stage alex q european countries have rejected putin s demand to pay for gas in rubles does the u s stand with them in rejecting that as well ms bedingfield we do and the german chancellor i think has been very clear that the contracts exist as they exist and there s going to be no change there q kate do you do you i have a question q a follow up my question and a question of a colleagues who cannot be here my question is again on allies and partners and the oil reserves the president referred to 30 to 50 million barrels brian didn t want to name any countries but where did he get this number and canada being the main exporter of oil to the u s has it been has the country been inaudible ms bedingfield well i can t speak to specific bilateral engagements but i would note that obviously the president discussed this the g7 when he was in europe last week this is a continuing ongoing conversation with our allies and partners it is a key priority of maintaining stability in our energy markets so you know those conversations are ongoing and we obviously consult very closely with our allies and partners q thank you kate q kate sorry sorry but from the colleague q thank you kate q sorry from the colleague who cannot be here it s about the prime minister of pakistan accused the u s of working with the opposition to remove him from power he just said that today what s the white house reaction ms bedingfield there is absolutely no truth to that allegation q thanks kate to go back to the covid deal i know you say you re not going to negotiate from the podium and the president has obviously warned about the severe consequences if there is no funding but if there is a 10 billion deal which some of the top negotiators say they re getting close to what would the administration then be able to cover that long list the president went through yesterday of everything that stops over the coming months what is saved over the coming months and what is still then at risk ms bedingfield well obviously the specifics of this deal are continuing to be worked out so i don t have a breakdown for you of exactly where that funding would go this is a live negotiation and again obviously we re not going to negotiate from here except to say broadly that this is incredibly an incredibly urgent need and we really hope that the congress is coming to a solution on this q is there a top priority that you say that is the must thing we have to find over the next couple of months ms bedingfield i m not going to lay that out as the negotiation is happening obviously this is being worked through on capitol hill and we re hopeful that they re going to come to a solution q yeah kate i wanted to ask about the use it or lose it policy that the president announced today it requires congressional approval and i know brian was briefly asked about this but i just wanted to clarify i mean has the white house prepared legislation on this does it have support lined up in congress and what is the timeline you re hoping to pass this measure and is it really even realistic in an evenly divided senate right now with midterms coming up in the fall ms bedingfield well you know the proposal would actually build on the version that s in the house bill so there s a version of this q right ms bedingfield that is already yeah there s a version of this that s already been put forward obviously the president looks forward to working with congress on it he believes it s a it s a critically important piece of helping to move our energy dependence from overseas back home and to move us toward a clean energy economy so we intend to work very closely with congress this will be a priority for the president but i don t in terms of a specific timeline i don t have any anything further on that q so you re going to pass it with that house bill or you re you saying you re building on that what does that look like ms bedingfield that will be an ongoing negotiation we will continue to build on it that s a discussion that we ll have with congress obviously this announcement just came today so that work will be ongoing q thank you kate ms bedingfield thank you all very much appreciate it end 4 18 p m edt

be careful what you post on social media after a night out getty images grossly offensive a man in the united kingdom has come under fire for a tweet that he posted after a night out drinking if you ve ever woken up to a bevvy of notifications and or texts about something that you posted the night or morning before and felt immediate shame or embarrassment it probably hopefully wasn t something so bad that a government agency would find it so grossly offensive that you wind up with community service or worse usually you ll probably just have to delete the post from social media maybe text call or message a few people to apologize and then it ll be a distant memory or joke getty images it seems that there are situations though if the post was offensive enough that simply deleting it won t suffice it happened to one man in the united kingdom who subsequently received a hefty punishment and the post was only up for around 20 minutes according to gizmodo a 36 year old man from glasgow scotland felt the heat last february following the death of captain sir tom moore who was a british army veteran who had previously helped raise over 30 million for healthcare workers during the pandemic by doing 100 laps around his garden back yard in the uk on his 100th birthday how to get arrested for social media post after hearing about his passing and in an alleged drunken state the man decided to tweet the only good brit soldier is a deed one burn auld fella buuuuurn as you can imagine even in said drunken state it didn t take long for him to realize that was not a good idea at all as it was deleted around 20 minutes after it was first sent out while not being up for long someone took note and it was brought to the attention of authorities who decided to charge him with violating section 127 of the uk s communications act which criminalized posts deemed grossly offensive or of an indecent obscene or menacing character the man s lawyer argued that he had been drinking and under stress when he sent the tweet out that didn t stop the court from sentencing him to 150 hours of community service now i don t know for sure that this would necessarily constitute authorities getting involved in the united states it might but best not to try your luck in other words just don t be an jerk

click into seattle channel s livestream here update replaced with archived video we ll add notes as it goes note the video feed seems to be lagging so we re taking notes from a listen line when you know it s time to go it s time to go opens best saying she has no regrets i love this department i love this city and she tells her staff they will always be in her heart she says she is grateful to deputy chief adrian diaz for agreeing to serve as interim chief and declares him more than ready for the role she says she has an ask for the community find a way to work together to put aside personal political conflict to create solutions for the city s future her tone is very upbeat as she thanks a variety of supporters and co workers including department heads who are at the event i m sorry to leave in some ways and she turns the mic over to the mayor durkan begins with her voice cracking with emotion we re facing an unprecedented crisis from the pandemic to systemic racism it s been a hard hard year and today s a hard hard day she hails best s leadership and says she s certain she ll be leading elsewhere i wish she was staying durkan says she and best have had many conversations in recent weeks about her desire to retire losing her is a deep loss for our city she says best has dramatically diversified both the department and its leadership team she says best would have been the right person to reimagine policing in this city and says deep conversation with community was already under way as were changes including collaborative policing and the return of community service officers after much touting of best s attributes durkan turns to recent events in the midst of disagreement i hope we can find common ground and then says she is mystif ied that the council didn t consult best she assails the council for voting to cut best s salary and no other department heads my message to the city council is and has always been i remain willing to work with you but she also says she ll uphold contracts and she says transformation is hard painful work the road is long she adds council if you want to go far we have to go together 11 34 am now she is talking about deputy chief diaz i am certain he will continue this hard work he then takes the microphone first with words of appreciation for the departing chief our department has had some hard times in his years but this is the most challenging he says then insisting the department is committed to reform the department already has the nation s most robust accountability system he says but we know much more is demanded of us and he promises we re listening to you 11 41 am now q a would best work with the council now if they asked she says now it s up to chief diaz was there a last straw she said she was disappointed not to see a plan going forward and then reads a gratitude email from a recently hired black officer then saying she would likely have to lay him off under the council s plan subsequently saying can t do it she then says the council s decisions show a lack of respect for the officers in response to another question she says their vote to cut her pay and that of her command staff seemed vindictive and personal so maybe departing will help the city and department move forward in response to another question she says again that she doesn t want to have to lay people off and also in terms of political grandstanding she says i m done with that the mayor says she does not plan to launch a search for a permanent police chief this year what job would they be applying for a short time later she also notes that the unpredictable budget climate would likely make it impossible to attract a good candidate 12 pm the mayor also gets in a dig at the council by noting none of them called to ask about the officers injured in protests that turned violent the chief says she was particularly offended that the council would even consider cutting her command staff s salaries a move she also called illegal the mayor then accused the council of playing mini police chief in trying to micro manage the spd budget they could and should have given the chief a number to meet in cuts and to let her decide how how will chief diaz try to work with the council as the 2021 budget process gets under way he says he looks forward to them contacting him the mayor meantime has said multiple times that she wants to hear from all of seattle in crafting the future of public safety she s asked a while later about her harsh words for the council and how that ll lead to collaboration i am willing to work with them and i think we need to work together she says i want to work with this council 12 23 pm best gets the final word as the event ends saying she has faith the city and the people in it will do what s right we ll substitute the archived video above when it s available 1 30 pm west seattle south park councilmember lisa herbold has issued a statement about the

in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements the notes thereto and other financial information included elsewhere in the report year ended december 31 2021 compared to year ended december 31 2020 revenue revenue increased by 10 536 120 or approximately 20 to 62 212 148 for the year ended december 31 2021 from 51 676 028 prior year the increase in revenues is primarily attributable to an increase in specialty foodservice revenues which was driven by the nationwide opening of restaurants and other foodservice establishments previously affected by covid 19 as more foodservice establishments and restaurants have re opened we have experienced improving foodservice revenues although revenues still remain slightly below historical levels the increase in specialty foodservice revenue was partially offset with decreases mainly associated with e commerce revenues though e commerce revenue remains significantly above historical levels the decreases during the current period were the result of decreases in covid 19 driven demand in 2021 compared to 2020 we continue to assess the potential of new revenue sources from the manufacture and sale of proprietary food products private label products and additional sales channel opportunities in both the foodservice and consumer space and will implement a strategy which based on our analysis provides the most beneficial opportunity for growth any changes in the food distribution and specialty foods operating landscape that materially hinders our current ability and or cost to deliver our products to our customers could potentially cause a material impact on our net revenue and gross margin and therefore our profitability and cash flows could be adversely affected currently a small portion of our revenues comes from imported products or international sales our current sales from such markets may be hampered and negatively impacted by any economic tariffs that may be imposed in the united states or in foreign countries see transactions with major customers and the securities and exchange commission s sec mandated fr 60 disclosures following the liquidity and capital resources section for a further

slightly during the current period to 27 2 compared to 26 7 during the comparable period primarily due to variation in product and revenue mix across our various selling channels in 2022 we continue to price our products in order to increase sales gain market share and increase the number of our end users and customers we currently expect if market conditions overall economic conditions and our

circumstances would have a material adverse effect on its business prospects financial condition and results of operations 2022 plans since 2020 the world has been in the grip of a pandemic which has wreaked havoc on economies world wide including in the u s which is our primary market as a result of the pandemic restaurants hotels country clubs casinos catering houses and other of our primary customers have either been closed completely or are only partially open with significantly reduced operations accordingly foodservice revenues which historically have been a significant overall portion of our revenues have been significantly reduced as most foodservice establishments cross the united states closed or had limited operations as a result foodservice revenue commencing in the second half of march 2020 and continuing throughout the year and into 2021 experienced unprecedented declines as the pandemic has begun to decline in the united states and foodservice establishments have begun to reopen we have experienced improving foodservice revenues although our revenues have not yet reached its previous historical levels for the full year while the decline in the pandemic and the re opening of bricks and mortar stores resulted in a decline of e commerce revenues compared to the comparable quarter in 2020 ecommerce revenues remained significantly above pre pandemic historical levels in april 2020 we applied for and received a loan of approximately 1 650 221 under a program established under a congressionally approved program which is administered by the u s small business administration in 2021 we applied for and received 1 748 414 in new loans under a similar government program administered by the u s small business administration during the year ended

had been forgiven at december 31 2021 the balance due under the ppp loans was 0 between cash on hand access to outside capital and our current expectations of incoming revenues we believe we have sufficient resources to continue operating for at least the next 12 months however inasmuch as we cannot predict the timing and the effect of the pandemic on general economic activities we cannot predict the trajectory of the pandemic and the amount of economic stress we could experience if the pandemic were to worsen in the united states and worldwide while we intend to continue to focus on executing on our strategic growth plans given the current economic conditions we are not able to determine the exact timeframe in 2022 if at all that we can then again consider fully implementing portions of the plans described below during 2022 we plan to expand our business by expanding our focus to additional specialty foods markets and by leveraging our e commerce platform to launch and grow either organically and or through acquisition new d2c brands and e commerce sites within targeted consumer areas on the company s e commerce platform in addition we will continue exploring potential acquisition and partnership opportunities with influencers and other celebrities to continue to extend our focus in the specialty food market through the growth of the company s existing sales channels and through a variety of additional potential sales channel relationships in addition we are currently exploring the introduction of or have introduced into the market a variety of new product categories and new product lines including private label products and proprietary branded products to leverage our existing foodservice and consumer customer base furthermore the company intends to continue to expand its activities in the direct to consumer space and the overall consumer packaged goods cpg space through leveraging its overall capabilities in the consumer space including leveraging its direct to consumer e commerce platform to reach both additional customers in multiple channels and to expand availability of its e commerce capabilities to additional products

washington united nations reuters u s government images seen by reuters showed what a u s official said was damage to grain storage facilities in eastern ukraine and was indicative of the severity of russian attacks that are impacting the global food supply the two black and white images showed long rectangular buildings in eastern ukraine first seen intact in january and then with damaged roofs and what a key calls impact craters in march the u s official commenting on the unclassified images said the united states has information that russian forces are repeatedly damaging grain storage facilities in eastern ukraine as of late march at least six grain storage facilities had been damaged as a result of these attacks the official said the development comes as officials around the world worry about the fallout to the global food supply from the invasion of ukraine the world s fourth largest grain exporter in the 2020 21 season russia s reckless damaging of these grain silos is a clear cut example of how putin s war directly affects civilians in ukraine and threatens food security around the world the official said with countries across africa and the middle east reliant on ukrainian wheat exports the destruction of these food stocks and storage facilities could result in shortages and drive up prices in already vulnerable economies the official said russian president vladimir putin describes his country s feb 24 invasion of ukraine as a special military operation that aims to destroy ukraine s military infrastructure the biden administration has repeatedly shared its intelligence publicly to put pressure on putin over his invasion of ukraine deputy secretary of state wendy sherman at a u n security council meeting on ukraine on tuesday said russia has bombed at least three civilian ships carrying goods from black sea ports to the rest of the world including one chartered by an agribusiness company sherman said ukraine had told counterparts that russia is actively targeting grain silos and food storage facilities the black sea is a major shipping route for grain oil and oil products its waters are shared by bulgaria romania georgia and turkey as well as ukraine and russia sherman said the russian navy is blocking access to ukraine s ports essentially cutting off exports of grain and reportedly preventing approximately 94 ships carrying food for the world market from reaching the mediterranean it s no wonder many shippers are now hesitant to send vessels into the black sea even to russian ports given the danger posed by russian forces she said russia s u n ambassador vassily nebenzia refuted sherman s statement he accused ukrainian troops and nationalists of shooting at fleeing civilians then added and yet today we re being told that we re allegedly bombing vessels with grain as well as grain storage warehouses ukraine accused russia on wednesday of planting mines in the black sea and said some of those munitions had to be defused off turkey and romania as risks to vital merchant shipping in the region grow reporting by steve holland and michelle nichols editing by heather timmons and leslie adler by steve holland and michelle nichols

chinese tech giant alibaba said last week it will increase its share buyback program from 15 billion to 25 billion phone maker xiaomi also announced a buyback of up to 10 billion hong kong dollars 1 28 billion this week we have seen an accelerating trend of chinese companies announcing buyback plans morgan stanley said nomura said in a note that a combination of generally modest stock valuations and reasonably strong balance sheets will drive up share buybacks morgan stanley and goldman sachs picked out asia stocks that are best placed or likely to carry out buybacks asia has seen a wave of stock buybacks and bank analysts say it s not stopping anytime soon chinese tech giant alibaba said last week it will increase its share buyback program from 15 billion to 25 billion phone maker xiaomi announced tuesday a buyback of up to 10 billion hong kong dollars 1 28 billion while jd health jd s online healthcare arm said it would buy back shares of up to 3 billion hong kong dollars the news sent stocks of those firms soaring chinese companies are behaving similarly to their american counterparts by announcing large stock buyback programs on weakness in an effort to shore up investor confidence as their business growth slows said ben silverman director of research at investment consulting firm verity here s how share buybacks work when a company repurchases its own stock the move reduces the number of shares that are publicly traded the buyback can push the price of each share higher because some common metrics used to evaluate a stock price are spread across fewer shares as a result the stock can look more attractive the trend isn t just confined to chinese tech giants british bank hsbc insurance giant aia and japanese automaker toyota have also announced stock buybacks in the past few weeks accelerating trend in stock buybacks china s tech stocks have fallen since last year on the back of regulatory crackdowns in china as well as u s china tensions among other factors we have seen an accelerating trend of chinese companies announcing buyback plans against the backdrop of broad based chinese equities valuation derating morgan stanley said in a march 24 note we believe this trend will continue for longer as it is reinforced by the statement last week explicitly encouraging listed companies to conduct share buybacks analysts from the investment bank said there was speculation that tencent could be next although markets were disappointed when the chinese gaming giant did not announce a buyback recently the market definitely expected tencent to announce a buyback i think this was mainly because alibaba had and the positive price reaction to it said neil campling head of technology media and telecom research at mirabaud equity research did note their own stock price has dropped significantly too which may be a sign that they would consider a buyback so i don t think that possibility should be ruled out in its entirety he added nomura said a combination of generally modest stock valuations and reasonably strong balance sheets will drive up share buybacks the trend suggests scope for higher shareholder returns the japanese investment bank said we think this theme is likely to be the focus in the weeks ahead especially after a rally in the shares of after it boosted its share buyback program by usd10bn said the march 24 note in the short term markets will react favorably to buyback announcements especially for u s listed chinese stocks according to morgan stanley s analysis of data from 2014 to 2021 of such stocks as well as a

1 pull the emergency brake the ecocidal accumulation of capital threatens the very conditions of human life on the planet the covid pandemic confirms this insofar as the increase in zoonoses over the last forty years is attributable to the destruction of ecosystems the global ecological limits of sustainable human development have been crossed in several areas climate biodiversity nitrogen and land use they are in the process of being crossed in chemical and plastic pollution while there is great uncertainty about other key factors of sustainability freshwater resources fine particle pollution the phosphorus cycle etc capitalist progress has always been incompatible with the rational management of exchanges of matter between humanity and the rest of nature but the current situation is unprecedented the system s basic productivism which necessarily implies consumerism has become a destructive telluric force that has brought the earth into a new geological era the anthropocene the dangers are enormous but capital continues its course despite scientific warnings the catastrophe is deepening on the one hand it is hitting the working classes harder and harder especially in the global south on the other hand the capitalists are taking advantage of the ecological crisis to increase their privileges beyond measure increasingly resorting to violence to defend them a new far right is banking on the elimination of the poor as a way out of the ecological crisis the malthusian spectre of a plunge into barbarism is growing only the convergent struggles of the exploited and oppressed will be able to stop it but these struggles are and will be increasingly overdetermined by the ecological crisis which objectively imposes a radical reduction in the extraction of materials and the final consumption of energy those who fight for emancipation must draw all the conclusions from this the old perspective of lifting capitalist barriers to the quantitative development of the productive forces must therefore be explicitly abandoned in the anthropocene framework anti capitalism requires breaking the destructive force of capitalist productivism its extractivism its colonialism and its patriarchal ideology of domination of nature the brakes must be pulled urgently both to combat social inequalities and to open the way to qualitative development centred on caring for people through the satisfaction of real human needs disalienated from commodities democratically determined in careful respect for ecosystems 2 the fiasco of capitalist policies global warming articulates most of the capitalist ecological destruction it is accelerating and poses the threat of rapid upheaval that threatens the lives of hundreds of millions of people the livelihoods of billions more and the survival of ecosystems that are the product of millions of years of natural history climate scientists have been sounding the alarm for more than thirty years but capitalist policymakers have done nothing to curb or even limit the catastrophe worse their climate policies are widening inequalities between north and south and between rich and poor within countries greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise they have increased by 60 since 1990 more fossil co2 has been emitted in three decades 1990 2019 including no less than 25 climate summits than in the 240 years from 1750 to 1990 the framework convention on climate change unfccc was adopted in rio 1992 with the aim of preventing dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system it was not until 2015 paris cop21 that governments adopted on paper the ceiling of 1 5 c of warming compared to the pre industrial era the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and capabilities is at the heart of the framework convention it should have guided the equitable sharing of the remaining carbon budget between north and south but the us and the eu had it de facto abandoned in copenhagen as a result each government is encouraged to do less than the others so that the commitments communicated at cop26 glasgow put the planet on a catastrophic path to at least 2 4 c of warming the uk presidency of the conference is trying to maintain the myth that the cop machinery can still deliver on the 1 5 c target but nobody is fooled cop26 could not even decide on an immediate halt to coal use a halt even advocated by the very capitalist international energy agency glasgow is in fact a complete failure a failure of the presidency a failure of the bottom up process concocted in paris to raise the ambitions of states a failure of neoliberal attempts to combat global warming through market mechanisms and a failure of the climate economists who hide their neoliberal dogmas in mathematical models in order to disguise them as science more fundamentally this failure is that of capitalism which claims that the world economy could both continue to grow and therefore consume more and more energy in order to produce more and more and decarbonize by replacing the 80 fossil fuel based energy system with a new renewable energy system however all things being equal the construction of the new system necessarily requires an increase in fossil energy consumption and therefore in greenhouse gas emissions it is therefore impossible to simultaneously boost growth and cancel the net emissions due to the combustion of fossil fuels as this is a physical impossibility but the law of profit takes precedence over the laws of physics for capitalist leaders the failure of their climate policy is the clearest and most dramatic illustration of the bankruptcy of this productivist system of its monstrous irrationality and its criminal class nature 3 false and dangerous solutions in its logic of value accumulation all that is left for capital to do as a solution is to try to push back the physical barriers through technological headlong rush by perverting the objective of carbon neutrality or zero net emissions it is deviating from the real but limited possibility of absorbing the share of carbon emissions that will remain inevitable in order to reduce emissions and try to mop up the excess co2 while continuing to extract profits and pile up dead capital the productivist sorcerers apprentices compete with each other in terms of recipes from a technical point of view each of their pseudo solutions is fraught with specific contradictions considering natural gas as transitional energy is obviously a farce apart from the always possible accidents and the danger of proliferation of atomic weapons the only sustainability of civil nuclear power is that of its waste geological capture sequestration implies pharaonic works and a hazardous bet on the watertightness of the reservoirs energy intensive hydrogen is above all a means of painting the chemical petroleum and nuclear industries in green as a temporary and relatively paltry stopgap measure the massive planting of trees increases the already excessive pressure on land use and freshwater reserves thus putting human food biodiversity and climate protection in competition reproducing on earth the nuclear fusion that the sun achieves remotely and safely by recycling its waste only makes sense from the point of view of the increasing concentration and centralization of capital and its power in any case this technology would come too late to respond to the climate emergency from a social point of view neoliberalism obliges the implementation of these recipes is entrusted entirely to green finance which in the name of net zero by 2050 is offered enormous opportunities for speculation greenwashing and appropriation by dispossession at the expense in particular of indigenous peoples and rural communities at the same time governments are increasingly using neoliberal mechanisms incentives taxes etc to penalize mass consumption behaviour and thus open up opportunities for green capitalism which deepens inequalities generally speaking the urgency and scale of the emissions reductions that need to be made very quickly to stay below 1 5 c without going overboard by 2030 5 year on average worldwide for one chance in two of staying below 1 5 c 10 year for two chances in three are such that these pseudo solutions are doomed to failure this is why there is a growing danger that the system will embark on the worst kind of technocratic folly geoengineering i e the deployment of devices to reduce solar radiation entering the atmosphere this geoengineering would not reduce the atmospheric concentration of co2 so it would not stop the acidification of waters that threatens marine life but it would open up a new field of valorization for capital it would also sharpen the rivalry between the imperialist powers which could manipulate the climate according to their geostrategic interests at the expense of the poorest peoples 4 the objective necessity of revolution all the conditions seem to be in place for the catastrophe to turn into a cataclysm only a world ecosocialist revolution could stop it but it is not on the agenda capital is strengthening its grip everywhere the unions are clinging to the capitalist revival as if it were a lifeline social movements are on the defensive democratic and social rights are receding the political field is shifting to the right and to the far right in most countries capitalism has plunged humanity into such a dark situation before especially on the eve of the first world conflict as nationalist hysteria gripped the masses and social democracy betraying its pledge to respond to war with revolution gave the green light to slaughter lenin defined the situation as objectively revolutionary in the sense that only revolution could stop the slaughter hence the slogan bread peace land history proved him right the revolution in russia and its tendency to spread forced the bourgeoisies to put an end to the massacre the comparison obviously has its limits it is one thing to heroically brave death so as not to risk one s life by killing other human beings for the profit of the gun merchants the imperialist division of the world and the glories of the generals another thing is to rise up against capital because by incorporating the labour power that produces surplus value it dehumanizes proletarians to the point of making them alienated instruments of the destruction of their inorganic body thus endangering future generations the mediations towards revolutionary action are infinitely more complex here nevertheless the same awakening of consciousness is necessary yet in the face of the ecological crisis an anti capitalist revolution is even more objectively necessary it is this fundamental judgement that must serve as a sub base for the elaboration of a programme a strategy and a tactic because there is no other way faced with the climate crisis in particular there are therefore two traps to avoid that of an abstract revolutionary maximalism on the one hand and that of a pragmatism obsessed with immediate responses on the other the first in the name of ideological purity leads to sectarian propagandism and isolation the second in the name of feasibility tends to accommodate green reformism and thus green capitalism as such including in its imperialist relationship with the global south 5 a transitional programme for today bridging the huge distance between what is objectively necessary and what seems subjectively possible requires a programme that bridges the gap between the present situation and the conquest of power a programme with both a set of proposals that outline a global anti capitalist response to the objective situation and forms of action based on the democratic self organization of the exploited and oppressed a programme whose demands are feasible within the capitalist framework but whose overall coherence makes it incompatible with the normal functioning of the system so that it leads to the conclusion that it is necessary to seize political power in order to revolutionize society from top to bottom this approach of the transitional programme is more relevant than ever but meeting the challenges of the 21st century implies a decisive novelty the programme must organize a global decrease in final energy consumption and hence in material production and transport this is the sine qua non for rebalancing the earth s energy balance and thus for stabilizing the climate this degrowth is obviously not a societal project it is an objective physical constraint to which humanity must submit for a certain period of time while it is obvious that certain types of production must grow to meet the huge unsatisfied needs of very large sections of humanity they can only grow within a decreasing global envelope of final energy consumption this fact cannot be circumvented it must be placed at the centre of the programme from the outset because it is at the centre of the climate ecological crisis that now overdetermines the entire social political situation only the truth is revolutionary said rosa luxembourg this means not only that lies are counter revolutionary but also that truth has the power to direct the masses towards revolution the need for material degrowth is a key part of this truth but only a part the full truth the whole truth is that the physical constraint of degrowth is necessary because the capitalist social mode of production has pushed humanity beyond ecological limits and will push it into the abyss if the productivist illusions are not uprooted the necessary degrowth must therefore be both ecological and social ecosocialist it must strengthen the social struggle to make the real perpetrators of the disaster pay the capitalists who enrich and strengthen themselves through the catastrophe it must encourage the struggle for the sharing of wealth knowledge and power between rich and poor not only between north and south but also within societies in the north and south it has to be shown that putting the principle of differentiated responsibilities and capacities on ice is the materialization of the capitalists will to go in exactly the opposite direction it must be made perfectly clear that if these vampires are left to their own devices if the poor do not make the capitalists pay for degrowth this will be imposed by the human catastrophe in the socially barbaric form of the elimination of some of the poor for the benefit of the rich physics do not negotiate the political expression of this solution is fascism so the choice is clear ecosocialism or barbarism the conclusion is also clear we need an ecosocialist transition programme for a just degrowth that abolishes exploitation and oppression 6 the rich are destroying the climate to the ideologues who claim that the ecological climate crisis is completely blurring the lines between social camps we reply that the fight for the climate is a class struggle in the most immediate sense of the term a struggle between rich and poor staying below 1 5 c means that each human being will emit 2 3 tons of co2 year on average in 2030 together the richest 1 of the world s population currently emits almost twice as much as the poorest 50 to reach 2 3t person year while respecting responsibilities and differentiated capacities the 1 would have to divide their emissions by thirty while the poorest 50 could multiply them by three the climate policies of governments since cop21 2015 paris go in the other direction the share of global emissions of the 1 has risen from 13 in 1990 to 15 in 2015 it will reach 16 in 2030 it will then be 25 higher than in 1990 and sixteen times higher than the global average the share of the poorest 50 meanwhile will rise from 8 to 9 in 2030 with per capita emissions well below 2 3 tco2 year in fact the reduction commitments by 2030 are inversely proportional to income the 1 will do one twentieth the 10 one eighth and the middle income 40 one sixth of what climate justice should dictate capitalist climate policies that target the carbon footprint of mass consumption leave the much larger carbon footprint of luxury consumption superyachts private jets multiple residences suvs space tourism in the shade 50 of air travel is done by the richest 1 but only 1 of climate action is targeted at the airline sector the 1 also take advantage of the opacity of finance to hide the carbon footprint of their capitalist investments in the face of this the major injustice is that the 50 who have a marginal responsibility for global warming will only use one thirteenth of the carbon budget in 2030 to which they would be entitled if the principle of differentiated responsibilities were respected this injustice is compounded by the fact that imperialism refuses to compensate for loss and damage in the south and does not honour the commitment to pay one hundred billion dollars per year to the green climate fund however the injustice to the rich in the north and the south affects all working classes to varying degrees the 50 are in relatively similar situations by 2030 in four out of five of the major emitting countries us eu uk china the emissions of the poorest 50 will remain slightly above or slightly below 2 3t pers year in india they will remain much lower at the global level the proportionately largest emission reductions will be imposed on the lowest income earners in developed countries this data dots the possibility of a majority eco social bloc on a class line certainly the 40 of the so called middle class must cut their emissions by more than half in the eu and britain by three in china and by about four in the us to stay below 1 5 c winning a social majority will therefore not be without conflict and sometimes painful revisions but the strategic conclusion to be drawn from the figures is not that unpopular market measures must be imposed on workers in the north to allow the south to develop experience shows that such measures are ineffective they can only divide those who need to be united while playing into the hands of climate negationist demagogues the strategic conclusion is that it is necessary to fight to make the rich pay in the north and the south and that these struggles create the conditions for clarifications that will allow us to progress towards the majority ecosocial bloc this is what has been shown by the yellow vests revolt in france which starting from the refusal of a fuel tax has decanted to the left to the point of sometimes joining the climate movement end of the world end of the month same fight and even with the feminist movement against violence against women 7 some urgent ecosocial measures developing this strategic conclusion requires a plan of structural reforms anti neoliberal and anti capitalist the ecological crisis obviously requires a specifically ecological programme based on sound science but this programme will not solve anything without a package of measures that makes the rich and the capitalists pay to repair society nature and the relationship between society and nature in the sphere of consumption the carbon intensity of the lifestyle of the rich is far greater than that of the lifestyle of the working classes in the sphere of production the carbon efficiency of the public sector is much higher than that of the private sector and that of agroecology is infinitely higher than that of agribusiness in the sphere of social reproduction the promotion of autonomy and respect favours a culture of care for the living opposed to the capitalist patriarchal ideology of domination and death in general demands that reduce the capture of surplus value by the rich whether to finance their consumption to finance their investments to increase their hold on the world and on bodies or to create new financial markets respond not only to the social emergency but also to the ecological emergency these measures are part of the real possibility that all people can lead a good life by consuming little energy and reducing overall impacts on ecosystems they can be grouped under five headings 1 urgent regulations at the expense of the rich and their businesses in the face of governments and the media who are constantly urging us to change our behaviour make immediate demands that target the consumption of the rich private jets superyachts space tourism formula 1 must be outlawed the production of suvs must be stopped without delay air travel must be blamed flight shame and subjected to an annual quota in the face of the failure of market mechanisms use the precedent of the montreal protocol phasing out cfcs with support funds to help adaptation in the countries of the south to demand strict regulatory measures at the expense of the capitalists stop methane leaks stopping methane leaks from the gas grid oil wells and coal mines is a one shot but presents no technical difficulties and corresponds to 0 5 c of warming mitigation stop fluorinated gas emissions from 1990 to 2019 250 increase in the release of these gases whose radiative power is several hundred to several thousand times greater than that of co2 and which remain in the atmosphere for up to several tens of thousands of years zero deforestation and stop the destruction of wetlands ban on the exploration exploitation of new fossil reserves binding phasing out of coal gas and oil power plants in line with the iea and ipcc timing immediate agro ecological reform of agricultural policies according to via campesina s climate programme transformation of transport modes development of public transport reduction of the place of the private car 2 tax justice social justice climate justice a dollar in the pocket of the 1 thirty times more co2 than a dollar in the pocket of the 50 and fifteen times more than in that of the 40 introduction of a maximum wage and increase in the minimum wage extension of social protection free services water heating lighting urban mobility up to the level of basic needs with rapidly progressive pricing beyond that to hit waste and luxury consumption the applications of this model on water for example beat the liberal propaganda of the tragedy of the commons free services encourage self control not abuse re fund the public sector immediate payment of the hundred billion dollars per year of the green climate fund in the form of grants not loans no to strangling the south with debt compensation for loss and damage the resources of the countries of the south must be cut off no to carbon offsetting the debts of the south must be abolished patents on green technologies must be lifted to enable people to satisfy their needs with renewable energy sustainable agriculture and production the solar resource must be at the service of the

human relations non gendered sharing and socialisation of tasks once the material conditions for a comfortable life are guaranteed to all time social relations and immersion in nature are the real wealth relaunch the anti productivist struggle for the radical collective reduction of working time without loss of pay or increase in work rates only a policy that is resolutely committed to a new truly human civilization can create the societal conditions that are conducive to the large scale questioning of unsustainable individual behaviour particularly in the field of leisure and food with a drastic reduction in meat consumption in particular 5 disarming the men who do not like life we will not get out of capitalism we will not stop the catastrophe by multiplying alternative local experiences saving the climate and biodiversity will remain a chimera as long as capital keeps its hand on the key sectors these must be socialized through expropriation starting with energy and finance to take up the challenge of the democratic planning that is indispensable at all levels from local to global while respecting differentiated responsibilities requires the conquest of power and the construction of a new type of power network based on the mobilization of the popular classes and controlled by them a network of power inspired by the experience of the paris commune to regain democratic control over the production of social existence to equitably reduce emissions for all to repair ecosystems and to ensure a comfortable and energy efficient life for all 8 building an ecosocialist hegemony the contribution to the development of an ecosocialist programme in the framework of the necessary reduction of global material production is not a pure propaganda exercise but a guide for action action requires a strategic hypothesis it is a truism to say that the mode of production of social existence will not be changed without the conscious participation of producers how do we train workers to counter the productivist madness on which their daily existence depends this is the crucial question the answer can only come from struggles and the convergence of struggles we have to work systematically on this which implies building inventive militant teams in the different social movements capable of exchanging and accumulating experience knowledge and know how despite the very defensive situation this strategy must be ambitiously coupled with a battle for hegemony in society the double historical failure of social democracy and stalinism has certainly plunged the socialist project into a deep crisis but the ethical message that has always underpinned this project can resonate more strongly than ever for the simple reason that the ecological crisis is undermining our health and endangering our survival and that of our children capitalism is drowning the world its beauty its riches in the icy waters of selfish calculation the tireless denunciation of this absurd and appalling reality can on occasion be transformed on a mass scale into a powerful categorical imperative opening up gaps in the class collaboration of the pro growth trade union leaderships only chance will decide when we can only prepare for it the chances of success will depend on the uncompromising radicality of the struggles of those who are practically at the forefront

putin s gas threat as ukraine west dismiss de escalation claim files in this file photo taken on march 30 2022 russian president vladimir putin meets with ingushetia s regional head at the kremlin in moscow president joe biden said on march 31 2022 that russian president vladimir putin may be isolated and could have placed some of his advisors under house arrest kyiv ukraine russia threatened thursday to turn off its gas taps to europe opening up a new front in its war in ukraine amid growing scepticism over moscow s claim it is scaling back its onslaught over a month into russia s invasion of its neighbour vladimir putin s troops have devastated cities like mariupol with shelling killing at least 5 000 people in the port city alone but they have struggled to take any significant territory moscow insisted things were going to plan as it said this week it would scale back attacks on capital kyiv and the northern city of chernigiv but ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky has dismissed the promise as a red herring and us president joe biden said he was sceptical instead the us and nato shared zelensky s reading that moscow may be seeking to regroup and resupply for its offensive in the eastern donbas region russia has moved about 20 percent of its troops from around kyiv after failing to capture the city which continues to be targeted by russian airstrikes pentagon spokesman john kirby said it s not exactly clear where they re going to go he said but we don t see any indication that they re going to be sent home he said the best assessment is that the troops are going to be repositioned probably into belarus to be refitted and resupplied and used elsewhere in ukraine he noted that russia has said it plans to reprioritize its operations in the donbas area putin isolated highlighting russia s underestimation of ukraine s dogged defence biden said there was some indication that putin was out of touch with the situation on the ground western intelligence has warned the russian leader s advisers may be afraid to tell him the truth about battlefield losses or the damage that sanctions have wrought on the country s economy but kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov rejected the assessments saying western officials don t understand president putin they don t understand the mechanism for taking decisions and they don t understand the style of our work biden was notably cautious putin seems to be self isolated and there s some indication that he has fired or put under house arrest some of his advisers the us president told reporters but he said he did not want to put too much stock into the reports as shells rained down on kyiv a ukraine foreign ministry spokesman accused russian troops of looting homes as they left one area electronics clothes shoes cosmetics this is not an army this is a disgrace tweeted oleg nikolenko shells also continued hitting the northern city of chernigiv where the governor of the region vicheslav chaus poured scorn on moscow s claim it was deescalating at the minimum it is regrouping he wrote on telegram the ukrainian commander in the eastern city of kharkiv also warned russian forces were regrouping to attack general pavlo maestro told afp his message to the russian invading force was go home while you re still alive though he warned against underestimating moscow ukraine did confirm russian troops had pulled back from the chernobyl nuclear site after occupying it for weeks reportedly taking an unspecified number of captured servicemen with them us taps oil stockpile with his economy crippled by unprecedented international sanctions putin on thursday sought to leverage russia s status as an energy power warning that eu members will need to set up ruble accounts from friday to pay for russian gas the eu has joined the united states in imposing sanctions however mindful of their own power needs the bloc has stopped short of an energy embargo if such payments are not made we will consider this a breach of obligations on the part of our buyers and existing contracts would be stopped putin said germany which before putin s offensive in ukraine imported 55 percent of its gas supplies from russia insisted that it will pay in euros or dollars as stipulated in contracts berlin and paris were also preparing for russian gas to simply stop flowing france s economy minister said biden moved to mitigate rising fuel prices by announcing a release from strategic us reserves of a million barrels daily for six months it is by far the largest tapping of the stockpiles in us history and amounts to augmenting global supplies by about one percent pivot to donbas military experts believe that with thousands of russian troops killed and many thousands more injured moscow has to ditch efforts to advance simultaneously in the north east and south its focus instead has turned towards capturing more urban centres in the donbas area including mariupol while continuing to fire long range assaults on other cities russia forces have encircled mariupol which the kremlin wants to capture to link the cities of donetsk and lugansk under de facto russian control and the crimean peninsula but a larger push into the donbas region could herald a more prolonged conflict pentagon spokesman john kirby said thursday it might not just be a matter of days and weeks it could be much longer than that he said in mariupol where tens of thousands have for weeks been under siege with little water food or electricity ukrainian authorities sent 45 buses in for a new rescue mission the international red cross said it was ready to lead the safe passage operation on friday previous repeated attempts to get civilians out have collapsed zelensky warned his war torn nation to brace in particular for a new russian onslaught in the donbas there is an accumulation of russian troops for new strikes in donbas and we are preparing for it he said in a video message late wednesday we will fight for every metre of our land
chinese tech giant alibaba said last week it will increase its share buyback program from 15 billion to 25 billion phone maker xiaomi also announced a buyback of up to 10 billion hong kong dollars 1 28 billion this week we have seen an accelerating trend of chinese companies announcing buyback plans morgan stanley said nomura said in a note that a combination of generally modest stock valuations and reasonably strong balance sheets will drive up share buybacks morgan stanley and goldman sachs picked out asia stocks that are best placed or likely to carry out buybacks asia has seen a wave of stock buybacks and bank analysts say it s not stopping anytime soon chinese tech giant alibaba said last week it will increase its share buyback program from 15 billion to 25 billion phone maker xiaomi announced tuesday a buyback of up to 10 billion hong kong dollars 1 28 billion while jd health jd s online healthcare arm said it would buy back shares of up to 3 billion hong kong dollars the news sent stocks of those firms soaring chinese companies are behaving similarly to their american counterparts by announcing large stock buyback programs on weakness in an effort to shore up investor confidence as their business growth slows said ben silverman director of research at investment consulting firm verity here s how share buybacks work when a company repurchases its own stock the move reduces the number of shares that are publicly traded the buyback can push the price of each share higher because some common metrics used to evaluate a stock price are spread across fewer shares as a result the stock can look more attractive the trend isn t just confined to chinese tech giants british bank hsbc insurance giant aia and japanese automaker toyota have also announced stock buybacks in the past few weeks accelerating trend in stock buybacks china s tech stocks have fallen since last year on the back of regulatory crackdowns in china as well as u s china tensions among other factors we have seen an accelerating trend of chinese companies announcing buyback plans against the backdrop of broad based chinese equities valuation derating morgan stanley said in a march 24 note we believe this trend will continue for longer as it is reinforced by the statement last week explicitly encouraging listed companies to conduct share buybacks analysts from the investment bank said there was speculation that tencent could be next although markets were disappointed when the chinese gaming giant did not announce a buyback recently the market definitely expected tencent to announce a buyback i think this was mainly because alibaba had and the positive price reaction to it said neil campling head of technology media and telecom research at mirabaud equity research did note their own stock price has dropped significantly too which may be a sign that they would consider a buyback so i don t think that possibility should be ruled out in its entirety he added nomura said a combination of generally modest stock valuations and reasonably strong balance sheets will drive up share buybacks the trend suggests scope for higher shareholder returns the japanese investment bank said we think this theme is likely to be the focus in the weeks ahead especially after a rally in the shares of after it boosted its share buyback program by usd10bn said the march 24 note in the short term markets will react favorably to buyback announcements especially for u s listed chinese stocks according to morgan stanley s analysis of data from 2014 to 2021 of such stocks as well as a shares or mainland listed stocks us listed chinese equities reacted the most positively compared with hong kong listings and a shares the investment bank s analysts said stocks best positioned to

8 470 in the fourth quarter of 2021 from keur 6 695 in last year s fourth quarter the company sold seven new and two used and refurbished 3d printers in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to six new and two used and refurbished 3d printers delivered in last year s fourth quarter revenue from the sale of 3d printers increased in 2021 compared to last year due to the slightly higher number of transactions but also due to the product mix as we sold more larger scale platforms in the fourth quarter of 2021 as opposed to smaller platforms in the comparative period in 2020 systems revenues also include all systems related revenues from consumables spare parts and maintenance those systems related revenues also increased in the fourth quarter year over year which confirms the positive trend of the recovery from the economic slow down mainly due to the ongoing global pandemic of covid 19 disease the covid 19 situation systems revenues represented 77 8 of total revenues in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to 75 6 in last year s fourth quarter revenues from our services segment which focuses on the printing of on demand parts for our customers increased by 11 6 to keur 2 415 in the fourth quarter of 2021 from keur 2 164 in the comparative period of 2020 this increase was mainly due to higher revenue contributions from the german operation as well as from our subsidiary voxeljet china co ltd voxeljet china which reflects the economic recovery from the covid 19 situation revenues from our subsidiary voxeljet america inc voxeljet america remained almost on the same level as the fourth quarter of 2020 cost of sales was keur 7 327 for the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to keur 5 881 for the fourth quarter of 2020 gross profit was keur 3 558 in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to keur 2 978 in the fourth quarter of 2020 gross profit for our systems segment increased to keur 2 812 in the fourth quarter of 2021 from keur 2 401 in the fourth quarter of 2020 the gross profit margin for this segment slightly decreased to 33 2 in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to 35 9 in the fourth quarter of 2020 the increase in gross profit was mainly due to a more favorable product mix as we sold more larger scale platforms in fourth quarter of 2021 as opposed to smaller platforms in the comparative period while gross profit from system related goods and services including consumables spare parts and maintenance decreased this was mainly due to the year over year change in the reserve for slow moving inventory amounting to keur 685 negative compared to keur 0 in the comparative period this is also the reason for the decrease in gross profit margin from systems related revenues gross profit margin from the sale of 3d printers slightly increased gross profit for our services segment increased to keur 746 in the fourth quarter of 2021 from keur 577 in the fourth quarter of 2020 the gross profit margin for this segment increased to 30 9 in the fourth quarter of 2021 from 26 7 in the fourth quarter of 2020 this was mainly due to the significant improvement of gross profit and gross profit margin contribution from the german and the chinese service center which was in line with the increase in revenues resulting in a higher utilization of the service center this was partially offset by lower gross profit and gross profit margin contributions from voxeljet america selling expenses were keur 2 035 for the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to keur 1 680 in the fourth quarter of 2020 and therefore significantly increased which was in line with the increase in revenues shipping and packaging expenses as a main driver of the selling expenses could vary from quarter to quarter depending on quantity and types of products as well as the destinations where those goods are being delivered administrative expenses were keur 1 572 for the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to keur 1 713 in the fourth quarter of 2020 and therefore slightly decreased this was mainly due to lower personnel expenses related to a lower number of employees in these department research and development r d expenses decreased to keur 1 377 in the fourth quarter of 2021 from keur 1 763 in the fourth quarter of 2020 these expenses are usually driven by individual projects especially through the consumption of material as well as the demand of external services and may differ on a quarter to quarter comparison the quarter over quarter decrease was mainly due to lower material expenses as well as lower labor costs related to a lower number of employees supporting in various existing and future research and development projects this was partially offset by higher expenses for external services other operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2021 were keur 132 compared to keur 841 in the prior year period this was mainly related to lower losses from foreign currency transactions amounting to keur 59 for the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to keur 686 in the last year s fourth quarter in the fourth quarter of 2021 an amount of keur 25 was recorded in other operating expenses related to the fully write off of the investment in the joint venture dscs digital supply chain solutions gmbh in course of the wind up process of the company other operating income was keur 767 for the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to keur 345 in the fourth quarter of 2020 the increase was mainly due to higher gains from foreign currency transactions amounting to keur 490 compared to keur 360 in the last year s fourth quarter furthermore the increase in other operating income is due to cost reimbursement keur 110 and the receipt of government grant keur 59 for r d expenses incurred in the fourth quarter of 2021 the changes in foreign currency losses and gains were primarily driven by the valuation of the intercompany loans granted by the parent company to our us subsidiary operating loss was keur 791 in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to an operating loss of keur 2 674 in the comparative period in 2020 the improvement was mainly due to a positive net impact of the quarter over quarter changes in other operating expenses and other operating income amounting to keur 1 131 in addition gross profit for the fourth quarter of 2021 increased by keur 600 compared to last year s fourth quarter further research and development expenses as well as administrative expenses declined by keur 386 and keur 141 respectively this was partially offset by higher operating expenses from our functions sales and marketing showing an quarter over quarter increase of keur 355 financial result was positive keur 1 955 in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to a negativefinancial result of keur 1 286 in the comparative period in 2020 this was mainly due to a finance income related to the revaluation of derivative financial instruments amounting to keur 2 693 in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to a finance expense of keur 807 in the last year s same period the derivative financial instruments are related to a performance participation interest ppi for the first tranche a and second tranche tranche b1 of the loan granted by the european investment bank eib and are revalued on each balance sheet date with changes in the fair value between reporting periods recorded within financial result of the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss an increase in our share price results in a finance expense while a decrease leads to a finance income in addition interest expense included interest from long term debt amounting to keur 552 for the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to keur 508 in the comparative period in 2020 net profit for the fourth quarter of 2021 was keur 1 047 or eur 0 15 per share as compared to net loss of keur 3 722 or eur 0 77 per share in the fourth quarter of 2020 year ended december 31 2021 results revenues for the year ended december 31 2021 increased by 15 1 to keur 24 826 compared to keur 21

3d printers during the year ended december 31 2021 compared to eight new and five used and refurbished 3d printers in the prior year period revenue from the sale of 3d printers significantly increased in 2021 compared to last year due to a morefavorable product mix as we sold more larger scale platforms in 2021 as opposed to smaller platforms in the comparative period in 2020 systems revenues also include all systems related revenues from consumables spare parts and maintenance those systems related revenues also increased which reflects the recovery from the economic slow down mainly due to the ongoing covid 19 situation currently we are able to perform installations of 3d printers as well as to offer service visits in most regions of the world there remain some covid 19 government regulation constraints which could delay service visits however the situation is normalizing progressively systems revenues represented 63 4 of total revenue for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to 58 2 for the last year s same period services revenues were keur 9 098 for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to keur 9 011 for the same period last year the slight increase was mainly due to higher revenue contributions from the german operation but also our chinese service center recorded a slight growth in revenues this was partially offset by lower revenue contributions from our subsidiary voxeljet america even though there was an increase in revenues starting in the third quarter of 2021 it did not fully compensate for the negative impact of the covid 19 situation in the first half of 2021 cost of sales for the year ended december 31 2021 was keur 16 876 which represents increase of keur 2 064 compared to cost of sales amounting to keur 14 812 for the same

4 compared to 35 4 for the prior period the increase in gross profit was due to higher gross profit from the sale of 3d printers while gross profit from system related goods and services including consumables spare parts and maintenance decreased this was mainly due to the year over year change in the reserve for slow moving inventory amounting to keur 851 negative this is also the reason for the decrease in gross profit margin from systems related revenues gross profit margin from the sale of 3d printers was almost flat gross profit for our services segment increased to keur 2 699 for the year ended december 31 2021 from keur 2 314 in the same period of 2020 the gross profit margin for this segment increased to 29 7 for the year ended december 31 2021 from 25 7 for the same period in 2020 this increase was mainly related to significantly higher gross profit as well as gross profit margin contribution from our subsidiary voxeljet america as a result of an improved utilization of the american service center due to the recovery since the third quarter of 2021 also regarding the german service center both gross profit and gross profit margin slightly improved these positive trends were partially offset by weaker gross profit and gross profit margin contribution from our chinese subsidiary selling expenses were keur 6 420 for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to keur 5 816 in the same period in 2020 representing a significant increase of keur 604 or 10 4 this was mainly due to higher distribution expenses primarily corresponding to the increase in revenues

are being delivered administrative expenses increased by keur170 to keur 6 577 for the year ended december 31 2021 from keur 6 407 in the prior year period the increase was mainly related to higher legal advisor fees related to our stock market listing as well as our communication to financial institutions in connection with funding activities research and development expenses decreased to keur 6 149 for the year ended december 31 2021 from keur 6 500 in the same period in 2020 a decrease of keur 351 or 5 4 this was mainly due to lower personnel expenses as well as lower material expenses partially offset by higher usage of external services other operating expenses for the year ended december 31 2021 were keur 618 compared to keur 2 799 in the prior year period this was mainly due to lower losses from foreign currency translations foreign currency losses amounted to keur 460 for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to keur 2 545 in the same period in 2020 other operating income was keur 2 970 for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to keur 1 603 in the prior year period the increase was mainly due to higher gains from foreign currency transactions of keur 1 812 in 2021 compared to keur 849 in 2020 in addition we received government grants awarded for research and development project funding in 2021 amounting to keur 617 in 2020 our subsidiary voxeljet america received a government grant from the united states small business administration sba under the covid 19 funding program amounting to keur 295 the full amount was recognized in profit and loss in the second quarter of 2020 as the related costs for which the grant is intended to compensate occurred in this period and we assume that we comply with the conditions of the funding the assessment of sba which was finalized in september 2021 resulted in voxeljet being fully in compliance with the conditions the changes in foreign currency losses and gains were primarily driven by the valuation of the intercompany loans granted by the parent company to our us subsidiary operating loss was keur 8 844 for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to an operating loss of keur 13 164 in the comparative period in 2020 this was mainly due to a positive net impact of the year over year changes in other operating expenses and other operating income amounting to keur 3 548 in addition gross profit for 2021 increased by keur 1 195 compared to last year research and development expenses declined by keur 351 this was partially offset by higher operating expenses from our functions sales and

ended december 31 2021 compared to negative keur 2 405 in the comparative period in 2020 this was mainly due to the impact from the revaluation of derivative financial instruments amounted to positive keur 752 compared to negative keur 715 in 2020 which leads to a year over year change of keur 1 467 positive this was partially offset by higher interest expense for long term debt which amounted to

news the us was ready to release oil from its strategic reserve clearly the day was all about end of quarter profit taking after a solid month of march rally wall street did exactly the same last night so our futures are down 42 points this morning a drop in the oil price was anticipated and as to whether the new quarter will begin with a sell off is not a given materials was the standout

we sold off yesterday and the us followed suit last night for the end of the quarter so whether we need to be down 42 points today is questionable end of quarter ii as was the case here wall street

in order to combat surging us fuel prices as has long been expected this equates to about 1 of global oil production and 5 of us consumption but as oil analysts agree it won t hurt it s really little

putin s gas threat as ukraine west dismiss de escalation claim moscow russia threatened yesterday mar 31 to turn off its gas taps to europe opening up a new front in its war in ukraine amid growing scepticism over moscow s claim it is scaling back its onslaught russianukraineviolencedeathmilitarypolitics by afp friday 1 april 2022 08 31 am a kremlin spokesman says western officials don t understand president putin they don t understand the mechanism for taking decisions and they don t understand the style of our work photo afp over a month into russia s invasion of its neighbour vladimir putin s troops have devastated cities like mariupol with shelling killing at least 5 000 people in the port city alone but they have struggled to take any significant territory moscow insisted things were going to plan as it said this week it would scale back attacks on capital kyiv and the northern city of chernigiv but ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky has dismissed the promise as a red herring and us president joe biden said he was sceptical instead the us and nato shared zelensky s reading that moscow may be seeking to regroup and resupply for its offensive in the eastern donbas region russia has moved about 20 of its troops from around kyiv after failing to capture the city which continues to be targeted by russian airstrikes pentagon spokesman john kirby said it s not exactly clear where they re going to go he said but we don t see any indication that they re going to be sent home he said the best assessment is that the troops are going to be repositioned probably into belarus to be refitted and resupplied and used elsewhere in ukraine he noted that russia has said it plans to reprioritize its operations in the donbas area putin isolated highlighting russia s underestimation of ukraine s dogged defence biden said there was some indication that putin was out of touch with the situation on the ground western intelligence has warned the russian leader s advisers may be afraid to tell him the truth about battlefield losses or the damage that sanctions have wrought on the country s economy but kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov rejected the assessments saying western officials don t understand president putin they don t understand the mechanism for taking decisions and they don t understand the style of our work biden was notably cautious putin seems to be self isolated and there s some indication that he has fired or put under house arrest some of his advisers the us president told reporters but he said he did not want to put too much stock into the reports as shells rained down on kyiv a ukraine foreign ministry spokesman accused russian troops of looting homes as they left one area electronics clothes shoes cosmetics this is not an army this is a disgrace tweeted oleg nikolenko shells also continued hitting the northern city of chernigiv where the governor of the region vicheslav chaus poured scorn on moscow s claim it was deescalating at the minimum it is regrouping he wrote on telegram the ukrainian commander in the eastern city of kharkiv also warned russian forces were regrouping to attack general pavlo maestro told afp his message to the russian invading force was go home while you re still alive though he warned against underestimating moscow ukraine did confirm russian troops had pulled back from the chernobyl nuclear site after occupying it for weeks reportedly taking an unspecified number of captured servicemen with them us taps oil stockpile with his economy crippled by unprecedented international sanctions putin yesterday sought to leverage russia s status as an energy power warning that eu members will need to set up ruble accounts from today to pay for russian gas the eu has joined the united states in imposing sanctions however mindful of their own power needs the bloc has stopped short of an energy embargo if such payments are not made we will consider this a breach of obligations on the part of our buyers and existing contracts would be stopped putin said germany which before putin s offensive in ukraine imported 55 of its gas supplies from russia insisted that it will pay in euros or dollars as stipulated in contracts berlin and paris were also preparing for russian gas to simply stop flowing france s economy minister said biden moved to mitigate rising fuel prices by announcing a release from strategic us reserves of a million barrels daily for six months it is by far the largest tapping of the stockpiles in us history and amounts to augmenting global supplies by about 1 pivot to donbas military experts believe that with thousands of russian troops killed and many thousands more injured moscow has to ditch efforts to advance simultaneously in the north east and south its focus instead has turned towards capturing more urban centres in the donbas area including mariupol while continuing to fire long range assaults on other cities russia forces have encircled mariupol which the kremlin wants to capture to link the cities of donetsk and lugansk under de facto russian control and the crimean peninsula but a larger push into the donbas region could herald a more prolonged conflict pentagon spokesman john kirby said yesterday it might not just be a matter of days and weeks it could be much longer than that he said in mariupol where tens of thousands have for weeks been under siege with little water food or electricity ukrainian authorities sent 45 buses in for a new rescue mission the international red cross said it was ready to lead the safe passage operation today previous repeated attempts to get civilians out have collapsed zelensky warned his war torn nation to brace in particular for a new russian onslaught in the donbas there is an accumulation of russian troops for new strikes in donbas and we are preparing for it he said in a video message late wednesday we will fight for every metre of our land

president joe biden s deputies have a plan for dealing with the huge wave of young illegal migrants expected at the border once they lift the title 42 epidemic barrier get more buses to deliver the migrants to jobs in u s cities their plan is to move people into the country faster sen james lankford r ok said wednesday that s their whole plan he said they re now presenting their plan to us of what they re going to do when they take title 42 off what they have worked on apparently for a year is a way to expedite people crossing the border and moving into the interior at a faster rate they talk about how do we actually move people to the interior faster so they don t get clogged up at the border and the images that all of you saw last summer don t occur again at the border with thousands and thousands of people that is not a plan to help us with illegal immigration said lankford whose record on immigration and oklahoma wages is mixed the administration s policy is not to make it better but to actually make it worse said sen john cornyn r tx the biden plan was outlined on march 30 by the department of homeland security dhs which is run by pro migration zealot alejandro mayorkas the strategy includes 1 acquiring and deploying resources to address increased volumes 2 delivering a more efficient and fair immigration process in its fy22 appropriations bill congress provided an additional 1 45 billion for a potential southwest border surge including 1 06 billion for cbp soft sided facilities medical care transportation and personnel costs 239 7 million for ice for processing capacity transportation and personnel costs and 150 million for fema s emergency food and shelter program at the southwest border dhs will fund operational requirements by prudently executing its appropriations reprioritizing and reallocating existing funding through reprogrammings and transfers requesting support from other federal agencies the dhs process is already sending many migrants to nearby non profits which then use taxpayer funds and corporate donations to bus and fly the migrants to new jobs throughout the united states breaking the federal government continues to mass release single adult male migrants at a parking garage in brownsville we ve seen 4 of these groups in last 2 hours some have ankle monitors on all being released to bus stations or the airport not title 42 d foxnews pic twitter com mnneunhfc1 bill melugin billfoxla january 25 2022 mayorkas plan would let the new migrants compete for jobs and apartments against many millions of disadvantaged and ordinary americans those americans are already facing inflation rising rents drug addiction and extended jobless ness said mark krikorian director of the center for immigration studies cnbc reported on march 30 roughly 20 of employees regularly run out of money between paychecks up from 15 last year according to the survey of more than 3 000 working adults in february as a result about one quarter of those polled said it s harder to afford necessary expenses and one third are unable to build savings issues that are particularly problematic for low to moderate income workers mayorkas refuses to detain asylum seekers until their cases are adjudicated despite federal law requiring detention the mayorkas inflow will drive down the americans wages and raise families rents so boosting ceo s profits and investors stock values on wall street mayorkas is backed up by progressives who wish to transform the united states from a society governed by european origin civic culture into a progressive led empire of competing identity groups we re trying to become the first multiracial multi ethnic superpower in the world a mayorkas ally rep ro khanna d ca told the new york times on march 21 it will be an extraordinary achievement we will ultimately triumph he insisted mayorkas strategy of efficient and fair processing basically means laundering the status and then releasing them into the country said krikorian he added it s no coincidence that they extended title 42 until late may because what else happens in late may the new asylum rule goes into effect so the point of this was to keep title 42 in place until they can just rubber stamp all of these illegal immigrants as asylum recipients and then poof there s no more illegal aliens the asylum rule is giving low level bureaucrats authority equivalent to congress as a whole to decide how many foreigners should move to the united states and become american citizens krikorian said the goal of the regulation is to dramatically increase the number of people successfully getting asylum and to speed that process up as much as possible he said mayorkas s deputies are also drafting a regulation that would expand the number of reasons that people can use to win asylum current rules provide asylum for people facing political persecution but mayorkas wants to provide asylum to people who say they are afraid of non political crime mayorkas is a cuban born pro migration zealot and the asylum regulation is the centerpiece of his bureaucratic campaign to build a network of new migration pathways that operate outside the numerical limits set by congress mayorkas migration network is intended to take market share from the labor trafficking networks run by the cartels criminal networks there will be a deluge at our southern border rep roy gives congress a dire warning about what will happen if they do not act to secure the border and reinstate title 42 before it s too late more pic twitter com 79ebtwep6f rep chip roy press office repchiproy march 30 2022 in 2021 dhs secretary mayorkas allowed more than cartel delivered 1 million economic migrants across the southern border alongside the legal inflow of myriad visa workers and roughly 1 million legal immigrants the inflow adds about two million people to the nation every year just as 4 million americans begin searching for jobs once biden lifts the title 42 barrier mayorkas and his deputies expect perhaps 500 000 migrants to arrive at the border each month that number would be higher than the number of americans who turn 18 each month progressives want biden and mayorkas to go further this will continue to be a profoundly difficult problem to manage admit two progressives who write the newspaper s plum line progressive blog so a better political approach might be to explain these challenges forthrightly to the public explain that this is a hard problem that excluding all asylum seekers isn t an answer and that rationalizing the system is worth attempting deserves public patience and could produce a better outcome than mass expulsion has the progressives do not consider the damage of migration to ordinary americans wages and rents mayorkas plan has rattled some democrats who worry it may be too soon to return to pre pandemic immigration rules at the border said the washington post in 2014 a rush of migrants at the border wrecked public trust in the border policies set by president barack obama those 2014 poll numbers derailed obama s hopes for a mass amnesty and encouraged a new york tv personality to run for president in september 2021 biden s polls were badly damaged by the tv news coverage of the invasion by roughly 30 000 migrants at del rio in texas a supercharged repeat of the mass migration during the 2022 election year may help americans to recognize their shared opposition to labor migration that public opposition is revealed in polls but it is suppressed by claims by investor funded progressives that the united states is a nation of immigrants since at least 1990 the d c establishment has used a wide variety of excuses and explanations for example nation of immigrants to justify its policy of extracting tens of millions of migrants and visa workers from poor countries to serve as workers consumers and renters for various u s investors and ceos the self serving economic strategy of extraction migration has no stopping point it is harmful to ordinary americans because it cuts their career opportunities shrinks their salaries and wages raises their housing costs and has shoved at least 10 million american men out of the labor force extraction migration also distorts the economy curbs americans productivity reduces voters political clout undermines employees workplace rights and widens the regional wealth gaps between the democrats coastal states and the republicans heartland states an economy built on extraction migration also radicalizes americans democratic compromise promoting civic culture because it allows wealthy elites to ignore despairing americans at the bottom of society the economic strategy also kills many migrants splits foreign families and extracts wealth from the poor home countries not surprisingly the wealth shifting extraction migration policy is very unpopular according to a wide variety of polls the polls show deep and broad public opposition to labor migration and the inflow of temporary contract workers into jobs sought by young u s graduates the opposition is growing anti establishment multiracial cross sex non racist class based bipartisan rational persistent and recognizes the solidarity that americans owe to one another

place their home had been distraught and they tried putting on a happy face they tried being strong it just didn t stop the sadness the crew even went out for drinks after the ceremony was over they ran into the chief before they left the chief spoke privately to andy and she promised to do all that she could to see andy back at 19 which is the best that andy could hope for andy was the reason that 23 closed she has only told one person about the part she played and it was thankfully someone who wouldn t judge her sullivan understands why she did it sullivan once sacrificed several friendships for the sake for ambition sullivan has since gotten better not better enough to save his marriage but better and that s what he reported his captain he suspected his captain was drinking on the job he reported it to the chief she brought in someone who could help and then they talked to captain beckett beckett had to pee in a cup in front of a witness he also was warned that he had to go home as they await results of this drug test and so he couldn t finish out his shift he had to go straight home after the urine sample beck had been ticked out by the demands and he would have offered some pushback if the chief hadn t brought in reinforcements chief ross knew that beck knew about her relationship with sullivan she also correctly guessed he knew who made the anonymous complaint against him and so she made everything official even if beck said something it would just make him look like he was lashing out beck also didn t get a chance to talk to his team after he gave the urine sample and so the chief later announced to 19 that beck had to step away sullivan was now the acting captain this ticked off bishop who felt the job should have gone to her and she was going to demand an explanation from sullivan when they got called to a fire the fire was in a parking lot there were two missing civilians sullivan sent them in for the rescue mission and 23 was still at the bar andy got sloppy as she got drunk she confessed to theo that she inadvertently got 23 closed down and he repeated it in front of the probie the probie then announced it to the whole bar it was bad andy s secret was now out in the open and firefighters weren t going to respect someone who closed one of their own andy was going to be hated she was already receiving hate in the bar when a firefighter from oregon who was there on a visit had come to her defense his name is jeremy andy thinks he s cute she would have talked to him more only she made that no sex pact for a year because the last guy she slept with had been a serious mistake but once she got left alone in a bar with no one to talk to jeremy s appeal went up she was talking to him as montgomery was having a painful dinner with emmett s parents emmett and montgomery had just gotten back together things were still a little tense between them then they had dinner with his parents and it went south fast emmett s parents are jerks montgomery at least knew about emmett s father who once served as fire chief dixon only dixon was pushed out of the job he got to keep his pension and to tell everyone he retired he went back to seattle police he was now considering a run for mayor and so his wife told him that one of his campaign promises was to eliminate crisis one dixon pretended to approve of crisis one at first he even said he cut down calls to the police and how that was good his wife on the other hand called him out for being a two face she said that her husband was going to get all the programs that firefighters created to help the community it didn t matter to him that the programs were doing good or that emmett had been on the ground as a founding member of crisis one montgomery finally had enough of the guy he told him what he thought of him and emmett told him to stop but then montgomery reminded emmett of all the work he did and he continued to talk over emmett to yell at dixon he called dixon a hater dixon hit back that montgomery was the one who made emmett into a laughing stock by making him gay it didn t matter to the man that s not how sexuality works there was no making anyone gay they re either gay or they re not dixon was never going to forgive his son for being gay and yet emmett had got upset when montgomery failed to let him stand up for himself emmett stormed out montgomery went after him they talked and emmett said that he applied to an art school in florence he applied when they were barely talking and now he wants to go emmett and montgomery had their moment and it s over their relationship is over they said goodbye and they parted on good terms sullivan and the others returned from their call to find beck back he passed his drug test and he made sullivan come clean about reporting him after he made them run several rounds as punishment for reporting him and sullivan s flirting with jeremy came to an end after he tried to rape her but she fought him off and she ran away the end

a key market gauge of the risk of future recessions flashed a warning signal on thursday afternoon the yield on two year treasury bonds climbed above the yield on 10 year treasury bonds a phenomenon known as an inverted yield curve the yield curve is regarded as a reliable predictor of recessions having inverted before each of the last eight recessions as measured by the national bureau of economic research the yield curve inverted in 2007 foreshadowing the recession of 2008 09 and spookily it inverted in 2019 the yield on the 10 year treasury fell to 2 331 percent on thursday when the yield on the two year treasury was at 2 337 percent after the brief inversion the curve righted itself as the two year fell to 2 335 percent while the 10 year rose to 2 345 percent with the curve that flat however another inversion is a real risk the difference between the yields on the two year and the 10 year has been narrowing for weeks other parts of the yield curve had already inverted with the three year treasury bond yielding more than the five year and the five year more than the seven year those yields however are not regarded as particularly reliable barometers normally longer maturity bonds have higher yields than shorter maturity bonds as investors demand a premium for locking up capital for longer an inverted curve suggests that investors expect lower interest rates in the more distant future than they anticipate in the near future typically investors expect lower rates because they anticipate the fed will have to lower its target to reverse or prevent an economic downturn in this case it seems that the investors suspect that the federal reserve s current path of tightening monetary policy by raising its interest rate target increasing the interest it pays on reserves and allowing its huge stockpile of bonds to shrink as bonds mature will have to be reversed in the future it may indicate that investors think the fed will overdo the tightening pushing the economy into a recession analysts dispute exactly why an inverted yield curve predicts recessions so reliably clearly the 2019 inversion was not due to investors foreseeing the pandemic and lockdown that briefly threw the economy into a recession in 2020 some analysts think an inversion can cause a recession mechanically perhaps by reducing the willingness of banks to lend others say an inversion merely reflects murkier information that indicate a recession lies ahead when the yield curve inverted in 2019 there were many who claimed it was different this time that s the case again some believe that the yield curve s signal has been scrambled by the fed s expanded balance sheet and perhaps by the economic turbulence stirred up by the pandemic there s also a question of whether the yield curve s signal might be scrambled by the fact that treasuries of all maturities now have negative yields meaning they would lose money if inflation remains at the current level or even at lower levels expected for the next several years some economists insist that it s not the difference between 10 year and two year yields that matters but the difference between the 10 year and three month yields with the three month yield at 0 518 that part of the curve remains un inverted there have been false alarm inversions in the past the curve inverted in 1966 and briefly in 1998 without leading to a subsequent recession some would count the 2019 inversion as a false alarm also although we cannot know whether we would have got a recession if not for the pandemic for now there may be some comfort to be taken in the fact that the inversion was so brief that it had to be confirmed by cnbc looking at the digital ticker tape moment by moment many economists and analysts claim that only a lasting inversion is telling but if the curve inverts again which is all too possible given its flatness that thread of hope will be cut there is a silver lining to inversions stocks tend to do quite well in the months following an inversion energy stocks in particular seem to do well in the aftermath of an inversion according to research from bank of america at the conclusion of the roughest quarter for stocks in years that s sure to be a welcome reprieve
ailsa chang host president biden is ordering 1 million barrels of oil per day to be released from strategic reserves every day for the next six months his announcement comes as democrats face mounting political pressure to do something about consistently high gas prices npr white house correspondent asma khalid is covering this story and joins us now hey asma asma khalid byline hi ailsa chang so what exactly is the president ordering here to make all of this happen khalid well as you mentioned he is authorizing the largest release of oil from the strategic petroleum reserve in u s history the scale and duration has never been done before in total we re talking about 180 million barrels of oil over the next 280 days chang wow khalid and just for some perspective i mean that is more than three times the size of the last big release the white house is really trying to frame this all as a war time bridge you know in the last few months gas prices have gone up by about a dollar a gallon and sanctions over the war in ukraine have really hit the oil market biden has been trying to pin the blame on greedy corporations and russian president vladimir putin you know i have heard biden deliver a number of speeches in recent weeks about the war in ukraine but this one sounded different because of something he kept saying soundbite of archived recording president joe biden as russian oil comes off the global market supply of oil drops and prices are rising now putin s price hike is hitting americans at the pump khalid putin s price hike and the president referred to putin by name 14 times in this speech chang fourteen times ok well how much of an impact asma could a release of oil on this scale have khalid i will say that is really unclear at this point the president told reporters that prices could come down 10 to 35 cents a gallon but white house advisers wouldn t really hazard a guess at least not publicly so i decided to pose this question to a couple of outside experts jason bordoff was involved in tapping oil reserves in 2011 with the obama white house jason bordoff it s causing oil prices to fall today and that may continue we don t know exactly for how long there s also uncertainty about whether european countries will join the united states in releasing strategic oil stocks as the biden administration has called on them to do khalid so part of this depends on allies and how many barrels are going to be released by allies i also talked to bob mcnally he s a consultant with a firm called rapidan he worked on these issues in the george w bush white house and he said there s just no way that president biden can make up for the disruption in the market caused by this war bob mcnally i doubt that even this big of a release is going to keep crude oil prices and therefore gasoline prices from rising further and that s because russia is the world s largest oil exporter khalid and ailsa some analysts say that it ll take more than just one tool to actually bring gas prices down consistently they say something that could have a dramatic impact is if countries like saudi arabia or the united arab emirates begin producing more oil or if say iran reenters the nuclear deal and sanctions on iranian oil are lifted but i will say we have not seen any really substantial movement on any of those fronts at this point chang well biden has made this decision and in arriving at this decision can you talk about all the different political pressures that he s been facing on this khalid i mean a lot i will say republicans have been hammering the president over rising gas prices for many months at this point you know they are actually hosting midterm campaign events at gas stations in competitive states and democrats i should say more specifically president biden have been under a lot of political pressure to do something the last two times that this administration released millions of barrels of oil from reserves in just the last couple of months it has not actually had a measurable impact on prices but for months democratic analysts have told me that the president needs to look like he s trying chang that is npr white house correspondent asma khalid thank you asma khalid happy to do it transcript provided by npr copyright npr

by matthew rusling washington march 31 xinhua despite surging inflation u s markets are near all time highs and some economists believe they will remain so for the next 12 months while markets have seen some turbulence the nasdaq dow jones and s p 500 index are considerably higher than their pre pandemic levels of january and february 2020 roughly 5 000 7 000 and 1 300 points respectively despite a 7 9 percent year on year inflation hike in february the largest increase in 40 years average hourly earnings have increased by 5 1 percent according to the u s bureau of labor statistics benefits for corporations market while that is bad for working folks corporations have benefitted and so has the u s stock market indeed corporate profit margins are the fattest they ve been in 70 years according to data from the u s department of commerce the profit boom that s going on is keeping the stock market aloft john blank chief equity strategist and economist at zacks investment research told xinhua companies are raising prices more than they re paying workers he said profits have never been higher do i think it ends not for at least a year blank said james paulsen chief investment strategist of the leuthold group noted in an article on the company s website that in the midst of widespread panic about runaway inflation the financial markets are remarkably calm consider the response of the major financial markets today compared to the last time the u s was experiencing runaway inflation during the 1970s paulsen said thus far in the face of surging inflation the contemporary behavior of the stock market relative to the 1970s experience could not be more different paulsen added much higher inflation resulted in much lower stock prices by comparison today the stock market seems fairly unconcerned about inflation paulsen contended from 2019 forward the stock market has had a positive correlation with the inflation rate and that is still the case even since the start of 2021 when inflation began to rise significantly paulsen argued yes the stock market has recently suffered a correction in part due to inflation fears but the size of this correction is quite mild at least so far versus the outsized inflation upswing of the last twelve months according to paulsen fear over recession meanwhile fed chair jerome powell recently said the central bank would be willing to show more aggression in hiking interest rates in a bid to tamp down inflation investors fear that if the fed moves too fast and furious that could put a major damper on markets or even spark a recession others believe that powell does not have the backbone to raise rates at a pace quick enough and high enough to spark an economic downturn some u s media are comparing the current economic conditions to those of 1977 after two years of robust growth in 1975 and 1976 the dow jones plunged more than 17 percent in 1977 due to several factors including easy money policies since the early 1970s soaring oil prices rising unemployment and increasing consumer prices noted insider monkey a finance website in an article reprinted in yahoo finance in 1977 investors were concerned about the widening u s trade deficit and worried that the fed might tighten credit which would trigger an increase in interest rates in addition a combination of the recession and struggling industrialized democracies also contributed to bearish sentiments the article reported some but not all of those conditions are reflected in today s economy but the jobless rate is not nearly as high as it was in the two years preceding the crash some have criticized this comparison saying today s market climate is nothing like that of the 1970s
chinese tech giant alibaba said last week it will increase its share buyback program from 15 billion to 25 billion phone maker xiaomi also announced a buyback of up to 10 billion hong kong dollars 1 28 billion this week we have seen an accelerating trend of chinese companies announcing buyback plans morgan stanley said nomura said in a note that a combination of generally modest stock valuations and reasonably strong balance sheets will drive up share buybacks morgan stanley and goldman sachs picked out asia stocks that are best placed or likely to carry out buybacks asia has seen a wave of stock buybacks and bank analysts say it s not stopping anytime soon chinese tech giant alibaba said last week it will increase its share buyback program from 15 billion to 25 billion phone maker xiaomi announced tuesday a buyback of up to 10 billion hong kong dollars 1 28 billion while jd health jd s online healthcare arm said it would buy back shares of up to 3 billion hong kong dollars the news sent stocks of those firms soaring chinese companies are behaving similarly to their american counterparts by announcing large stock buyback programs on weakness in an effort to shore up investor confidence as their business growth slows said ben silverman director of research at investment consulting firm verity here s how share buybacks work when a company repurchases its own stock the move reduces the number of shares that are publicly traded the buyback can push the price of each share higher because some common metrics used to evaluate a stock price are spread across fewer shares as a result the stock can look more attractive the trend isn t just confined to chinese tech giants british bank hsbc insurance giant aia and japanese automaker toyota have also announced stock buybacks in the past few weeks accelerating trend in stock buybacks china s tech stocks have fallen since last year on the back of regulatory crackdowns in china as well as u s china tensions among other factors we have seen an accelerating trend of chinese companies announcing buyback plans against the backdrop of broad based chinese equities valuation derating morgan stanley said in a march 24 note we believe this trend will continue for longer as it is reinforced by the statement last week explicitly encouraging listed companies to conduct share buybacks analysts from the investment bank said there was speculation that tencent could be next although markets were disappointed when the chinese gaming giant did not announce a buyback recently the market definitely expected tencent to announce a buyback i think this was mainly because alibaba had and the positive price reaction to it said neil campling head of technology media and telecom research at mirabaud equity research did note their own stock price has dropped significantly too which may be a sign that they would consider a buyback so i don t think that possibility should be ruled out in its entirety he added nomura said a combination of generally modest stock valuations and reasonably strong balance sheets will drive up share buybacks the trend suggests scope for higher shareholder returns the japanese investment bank said we think this theme is likely to be the focus in the weeks ahead especially after a rally in the shares of after it boosted its share buyback program by usd10bn said the march 24 note in the short term markets will react favorably to buyback announcements especially for u s listed chinese stocks according to morgan stanley s analysis of data from 2014 to 2021 of such stocks as well as a shares or mainland listed stocks us listed chinese equities reacted the most positively compared with hong kong listings and a shares the investment bank s analysts said stocks best positioned to

every editorial product is independently selected by our editors if you buy something through our links we may earn commission the stationary bike has infiltrated popular culture through memes parodies and even our favorite tv shows and it has quickly become the trendiest exercise machine to introduce to your home gym but even if your interest in an at home bike can be traced back to that saturday night live skit you know the one there s no denying that a stationary bike is also incredibly effective in helping you get fit or stay active surely peloton and echelon are already on your radar but which of these top brands is right for you some swear by echelon s workouts while others could never part with their favorite peloton instructors both offer an immersive fitness experience in the form of interactive rides so it all comes down to your personal goals training style and feature preferences if you re not quite sure which stationary bike to commit to here s everything you ll want to consider before making the decision peloton vs echelon pricing pelotons and echelons are stationary bikes yes but they also have built in fitness programs that means instead of a single set price there are multiple packages to choose from depending on what you want out of your workout routine for example the echelon ex 5 1 000 originally 1 500 and up features a 10 or 22 inch hd touchscreen display while the echelon gt 900 originally 1 300 must be paired with your own tablet but comes in four bold colors to perfectly suit your style echelon s four connect bike packages start at 900 and go up to 2 300 while peloton offers eight different bike and bike options that range from 1 495 to 3 035 not included with either bike is the monthly subscription which includes access to all the live and on demand classes for echelon the added cost is 35 a month and for peloton it s 39 a month plus an additional 13 a month if you want to use it in conjunction with the peloton app peloton vs echelon function in terms of basic function peloton and echelon are similar in that they use the same technology to get the job done the bikes themselves both have a steel frame with manually controlled magnetic resistance levels that reach a max strength of 32 for echelon and 100 for peloton the upgraded peloton bike 2 495 and up however uses digitally controlled resistance which can automatically adjust to match the resistance level of your instructor while you re taking a class you ll get a smooth ride out of both the peloton and echelon but there is a slight difference in the pedal design on the peloton cleats latch onto a 3 screw hole while on the echelon shoes attach with a clip and toe cage so you re preference may differ based on what you re used to at your studio spin classes peloton vs echelon customization while you could easily use your peloton or echelon according to its original design customizing it to your liking aside from the standard height adjustments of any stationary bike can make your workout experience that much better for both the dimensions of the seat can fit universal size bike cushions but echelon s pedals offer more room for customization compared to peloton s because peloton bikes use a three screw hole you ll have to invest in a pair of cycling cleats specifically designed to fit it echelon s double sided pedals on the other hand are compatible with any shoe so you can use your regular sneakers peloton does have the upper hand if you want to make any display customizations because you can modify your bike to have a swiveling screen enable wi fi and even set up netflix echelon s connectivity is limited to bluetooth peloton vs echelon classes peloton and echelon users alike agree that much of the appeal of working out on either one of the bikes is their interactive capabilities with both bikes you re able to go on scenic rides take classes in real time and see live rankings on a leaderboard the two are neck and neck in that aspect but if you re looking for variety peloton has a much larger selection peloton releases live classes up to 15 times a day whereas echelon s are livestreams of in person studio sessions regardless there are still plenty of beginner friendly to advanced on demand rides to choose from with one major difference guidance echelon instructors give riders a little more liberty during classes they won t specify resistance levels during rides while peloton instructors will tell you exactly when you should add resistance and what number you should be at a given point echelon also offers audio guided workouts so you don t have to always keep your eyes glued to the screen while you pedal if you want to pause midclass or stack a class with another one to create a seamless workout flow however that s a feature only available for peloton
the most well known geoglyphs in the world are undoubtedly the nazca lines of coastal peru yet scattered across the globe are thousands of other geoglyphs that are equally as impressive the earth carvings remain one of archaeology s greatest mysteries despite a plethora of research on these amazing creations the purpose of geoglyphs continues to elude researchers and remains a matter of conjecture some scientists believe they are linked to the heavens representing constellations in the night sky other experts believe that the lines played a role in pilgrimage with one walking across them to reach a sacred place yet another idea is that the lines are connected with water something vital to life yet hard to get in the desert here we examine ten alluring geoglyphs from across the planet aerial view of the nazca lines owlman astronaut peru cezary wojtkowski adobe stock located in the arid peruvian coastal plain some 400 km south of lima the geoglyphs of nazca cover an incredible 450 km2 they are among archaeology s greatest enigmas because of their quantity nature size and continuity the geoglyphs depict living creatures stylized plants and imaginary beings as well as geometric figures several kilometers long the startling feature of the nazca geoglyphs is that they can only really be appreciated from the air raising questions about how and why they were created the nazca lines number in their thousands and the vast majority of them date from 200 bc to 500 ad a time when a people referred to as the nazca inhabited the region the earliest lines created with piled up stones date as far back as 500 bc although the lines can in fact be seen from the ground there is nothing remotely exciting about seeing them from this perspective however from the air their true beauty and the wonders of their creation can be realized despite a plethora of research on these amazing creations the purpose of the lines continues to elude researchers and remains a matter of conjecture some scientists believe they are linked to the heavens with some representing constellations in the night sky however research has found that there are just as many lines not related to constellations as those that are meaning that this theory cannot provide a complete explanation other experts believe that the lines played a role in pilgrimage with one walking across them to reach a sacred place such as cahuachi and its adobe pyramids yet another idea is that the lines are connected with water something vital to life yet hard to get in the desert and may have played a part in water based rituals however the fact the lines have remained enigmatic have promoted alternative theorists to float ideas about extraterrestrial communication or messages to the gods the atacama giant cc by sa 2 0 with superimposed outline sketch of the geoglyph public domain the geoglyphs of the atacama desert in south america are less familiar than the world renowned nazca lines yet they are far more numerous in number more varied in style and cover a much larger area one of the most intriguing and controversial aspects of the atacama desert geoglyphs is the so called atacama giant which continues to stir debate regarding its true meaning and interpretation the atacama giant is an anthropomorphic geoglyph measuring 119 meters 390 feet in height making it the largest known geoglyph in the world it is characterized by a square head and highly stylized long legs four lines can be seen coming out from the top of the giant s head as well as on each side of its head there has been no shortage of explanations and theories to account for the strange features of this enormous geoglyph according to one interpretation it was a sort of astronomical calendar that indicated the movement of the moon with this knowledge it is said that the day the crop cycle and the seasons could be calculated another interpretation maintains that the atacama giant represents a deity worshipped by the local population other theories suggest extra terrestrial visitations marking of a pilgrimage route or that it reflects an ancient type of language although the function of the geoglyphs of the atacama desert still remain a mystery it is undeniable that they held great importance to the people who lived in the region it is hoped that the geoglyphs will be preserved for future generations and that further research may one day uncover their secrets more than 50 geoglyphs have been discovered in northern kazakhstan many of them are made of earthen mounds although timber was used to make this swastika image copyright digitalglobe courtesy google earth archaeologists are calling them the nazca lines of kazakhstan more than 50 giant geoglyphs formed with earthen mounds and timber found stretched across the landscape in northern kazakhstan they are designed in a variety of geometric shapes including crosses squares rings and even a swastika an ancient symbol that has been in use for at least 12 000 years the geoglyphs which are very difficult to see on the ground were first spotted on google earth since then a team of archaeologists from kazakhstan and lithuania have investigated the giant structures using aerial photography and ground penetrating radar their results revealed a wide variety of shapes ranging from 90 to 400 meters 295 to 1300 feet in diameter mostly made of earthen mounds but one the swastika was made using timber researchers have not yet dated the structures but their characteristics suggest they are around 2 000 years old as of today we can say only one thing the geoglyphs were built by ancient people by whom and for what purpose remains a mystery said archaeologists irina shevnina and andrew logvin of kostanay university in an email to live science a view of two rock lines that mark the june solstice with a person for scale charles stanish live science a study published in the journal proceedings of the national academy of sciences revealed the discovery of a complex set of geoglyphs constructed by the mysterious paracas people of peru the archaeological features which date back 2 300 years were found to be aligned to the sunset during the winter solstice and are believed to have been created to mark ceremonial mounds and residential sites charles stanish the director of the cotsen institute of archaeology at the university of california and his team found 71 geoglyph lines or segments 353 rock cairns rocks forming circles or rectangles two u shaped mounds and one point at which a series of lines converged in a circle of rays many of the archaeological features were found to have astronomical alignments others point to special places in the landscape like some of the ancient pyramids in the region the research team hypothesized that the lines served diverse purposes some appear to have marked time others may have attracted participants to attend important events and yet others could have pointed the way to sacred structures ancient geoglyphs of the middle east clusterflock stretching from syria to saudi arabia thousands of ancient geoglyphs built from stone stretch across the desert plains known as the works of old men some display a kite like structure while others have wheel like designs similar to the nazca lines of peru they come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes with much diversity between structures the geoglyphs are virtually invisible to those on the ground but can be easily discerned by those flying overhead the local bedouins refer to them as the works of old men but have been unable to provide further insights into their creators some of the circular structures contain two spokes that form a bar pointing in the same direction in which the sun rises and sets while others contain spokes that do not appear to have any astrological meaning it is believed that one type of structure referred to as a kite was actually used as part of a system for hunting the long stone walls form a wide open area which then funnels into a smaller enclosed area wild animals would funnel from the larger area through the neck into the narrow area which was called the killing floor this would make it easier to hunt wild animals as their movement would be constricted once they reached the killing floor there are an estimated 2000 kite structures across the deserts of syria jordan southern israel and saudi arabia illustrating that this hunting method must have been widely used the newly discovered geoglyph in arequipa peru21 archaeologists recently carrying out excavations in arequipa in southern peru were surprised to find a large geoglyph which resembles the famous nazca lines the massive geoglyph is the first of its kind discovered in the region it has been linked to the pre inca wari culture 1200 1300 ad although it is not clear how the researchers reached this conclusion the geoglyph which measures 60 meters 197 feet by 40 meters 131 feet consists of a large rectangular image with geometric shapes and lines within it if indeed the newly discovered geoglyph was created by the wari people the finding may serve to shed new light on their cultural practices which could have been influenced by the nazca people the wari spanish huari civilization flourished from about 600 ad in the andean highlands and forged a complex society widely regarded today as ancient peru s first empire their andean capital huari became one of the world s great cities of the time relatively little is known about the wari because no written record remains although thousands of archaeological sites reveal something about their lives moose geoglyph in ural mountains russia picture stanislav grigoryev recent research revealed that an enormous geoglyph of a moose in the ural mountains russia is among the oldest examples of land art in the world dating back some 6 000 years the moose measures approximately 275 meters 900 feet in length at its longest point and was formed by ditches 30 centimeters 12 inches deep and between 4 5 meters 15 feet and 10 meters 32 feet wide the ditches were dug out and then filled with stones with larger stones usually placed along the edges and smaller stones used to fill in the middle the hooves of the moose were filled in with a mixture of clay and crushed stones an analysis of stone tools found at the site revealed a style of lithic reduction that corresponds to the period between 3 000 and 4 000 bc perhaps one of the most interesting discoveries to emerge from recent excavation work at the site is that an examination of more than 150 tools found around the geoglyph suggests that children were involved in its construction as well as adults but it was not a kind of slave labor of children said stanislav grigoryev a senior researcher from the chelyabinsk history and archaeology institute they were involved to share common values to join something important to all the people mysterious big circle archaeology of the middle east apaame huge stone circles in the middle east have been imaged from the air but researchers remain puzzled as to why they exist and who made them eleven big circles dot the landscape across jordan and syria they date back at least 2 000 years but may even be pre historic created in a time before the invention of writing the geoglyphs are very large some of them approximately 1 300 feet in diameter and are composed of short stone walls built from local rocks researchers say the circles would have required some planning as many of the circles are very precise it was likely there was some sort of architect to head up each project researchers question whether the circles were used to maintain animal herds or may have been areas of burial but so far no contemporary remains or any obvious practical uses have been recovered or gleaned from the sites thousands of other ancient structures have been found across the middle east such as wheels walls pendants lines to and from burial cairns and kites stone walls used to drive animals into kill areas much like the enigmatic nasca lines of peru giant geoglyphs half a world away from jordan the intentions of the builders and the purpose of the designs remain for now a very baffling mystery the sajama lines bolivia bolivian government list of wonders in western bolivia thousands and thousands of perfectly straight paths are etched into the ground creating an amazing sight these lines were carved into the ground over a period of 3 000 years by indigenous people living near the volcano sajama it is unknown exactly when or why they were constructed and it is hard to imagine how the construction of something of such magnitude could pre date modern technology the sajama lines cover an area of approximately 22 525 square kilometers or 8 700 square miles they are perfectly straight lines formed into a web or network each individual line is 1 3 meters or 3 10 feet wide the longest lines measure 20 kilometers or 12 miles in length the creation of these lines without the aid of modern technology is a marvel they were etched into the ground by scraping vegetation to the side and scouring away dark surface material consisting of soil and oxidized rock to reveal a light subsurface the precision of the sajama lines is remarkable while many of these sacred lines extend as far as ten or twenty kilometers and perhaps further they all seem to maintain a remarkable straightness despite rugged topography and natural obstacles some believe that the indigenous people used the lines as a navigational tool during sacred pilgrimages wak as shrines chullpas burial towers and hamlets are interspersed among the lines creating a cultural landscape the paracas candelabra cc by sa 2 0 the paracas candelabra is a prehistoric geoglyph found in the paracas peninsula at pisco bay peru with a large branchlike appearance the purpose and meaning of the candelabra remains unknown the paracas candelabra is estimated to be approximately 595 800 feet 181 244 meters tall and can be seen from as far as 12 miles 19km out at sea the geoglyph was created by cutting two feet deep into the hardened soil with rocks placed around the figure the shape of the geoglyph is mysterious and somewhat difficult to describe some have likened it to a cactus plant while others believe it looks more like a three branched candlestick hence the name candelabra the meaning and purpose of the paracas candelabra are unknown to this day the conquistadors supposedly believed the geoglyph represents the holy trinity and took it as a good omen and a sign that they should proceed with their quest to conquer and christianize the locals although no clear historical records authenticate this assertion some believe the paracas candelabra is a representation of a hallucinogenic plant called jimson weed while others have suggested that the geoglyph represents a lightning rod of the god viracocha who was the great creator god in the pre inca and inca mythology in the andes region of south america the true meaning and purpose of the paracas candelabra remain elusive to this day and may be forever lost to history nevertheless the enormous geoglyph continues to attract people from all over the world who marvel at its sheer size and wonder about its origin and creation top image montage of article images source various by april

with more attention being placed on investments that meet environmental social governance esg standards it s becoming easier to secure financing to buy or build apartment buildings if the apartments have rents that are relatively affordable or if the buildings are designed to be good for the environment you get more capital sources interested in developments that meet esg says rob hinckley senior managing director in the new york office of jll capital markets americas related focus on esg goals is encouraging more cre players to invest in affordable housing that s because many capital sources have made bold promises to their stakeholders to make investments that not only return a dependable yield on investment but also meet high esg standards that includes large institutional investors like state pension funds which are often responsible to their pension holders publicly held companies like commercial banks are often eager to show stock investors they have that they have made investments that meet their own esg standards we all believe that there will be more focus by the entire industry and more benefits and incentives going forward to achieve and comply with esg standards says kelli carhart head of multifamily debt production for cbre equity partners come forward for esg developments related the role of esg indicators in cre investment decisions is only expected to grow further these esg standards can now help developers attract equity partners to their projects to build new apartments for example jll is now helping a developer gather the financing to build a new apartment tower in downtown brooklyn the new apartments will have to be sustainably designed and benchmark their utility use to comply with all of new york city s rules those green features help the project attract a joint venture partner that now plans to contribute enough equity to the project to cover 20 percent of its development cost the partner is an insurance fund that favors investments that meet its new standards the particular terms that capital providers offer to properties that meet their esg requirements can vary widely esg has yet to be standardized specifically in the social and governance categories says carhart the evolving nature also has the measurement of esg a bit more subjective within the industry workforce housing gets better deals for permanent loans apartment buildings can also continue to get lower interest rates on permanent loans from some lenders if they meet esg standards that s especially true for properties that qualify as workforce housing freddie mac and fannie mae lenders offer permanent loans with lower interest rates often dozens of basis points less than their usual fixed interest rates to these workforce housing properties other lenders are also eager to make permanent loans that will help them satisfy promises to be more socially responsible but these lenders often do not offer better interest rates for these loans yet while life companies are tracking esg and trying to find ways to measure it in their portfolio there is no pricing difference for loans with esg criteria at the moment says cbre s carhart the officials at the federal housing finance agency fhfa who oversee freddie mac and fannie mae now demand that at least half of the loans to apartment properties that freddie mac and fannie mae buy in 2022 will be to properties with rents affordable to moderate and low income households apartment communities can get even lower interest rates from agency lenders if their rents are affordable enough to earn government subsidies like federal low income housing tax credits the current focus on esg and social impact investing has also generated significant interest from the private sector in looking at creative ways to help create and preserve affordable and workforce housing says maria barry national executive of community development banking for bank of america freddie mac and fannie mae must make sure that at least a quarter of the apartment loans they buy in 2022 will be to properties with rents affordable to households earning up to 60 of the area median income freddie mac and fannie mae also continue to offer premium interest rates to apartment properties that use fewer utilities like electricity and water the environmental of the esg requirements have been incentivized by the agencies for several years via their green programs says cbre s carhart

philly local news weather forecasts sports and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc philadelphia newsletters the news sent stocks of those firms soaring chinese companies are behaving similarly to their american counterparts by announcing large stock buyback programs on weakness in an effort to shore up investor confidence as their business growth slows said ben silverman director of research at investment consulting firm verity here s how share buybacks work when a company repurchases its own stock the move reduces the number of shares that are publicly traded the buyback can push the price of each share higher because some common metrics used to evaluate a stock price are spread across fewer shares as a result the stock can look more attractive the trend isn t just confined to chinese tech giants british bank hsbc insurance giant aia and japanese automaker toyota have also announced stock buybacks in the past few weeks accelerating trend in stock buybacks china s tech stocks have fallen since last year on the back of regulatory crackdowns in china as well as u s china tensions among other factors we have seen an accelerating trend of chinese companies announcing buyback plans against the backdrop of broad based chinese equities valuation derating morgan stanley said in a march 24 note we believe this trend will continue for longer as it is reinforced by the statement last week explicitly encouraging listed companies to conduct share buybacks analysts from the investment bank said there was speculation that tencent could be next although markets were disappointed when the chinese gaming giant did not announce a buyback recently the market definitely expected tencent to announce a buyback i think this was mainly because alibaba had and the positive price reaction to it said neil campling head of technology media and telecom research at mirabaud equity research did note their own stock price has dropped significantly too which may be a sign that they would consider a buyback so i don t think that possibility should be ruled out in its entirety he added nomura said a combination of generally modest stock valuations and reasonably strong balance sheets will drive up share buybacks the trend suggests scope for higher shareholder returns the japanese investment bank said we think this theme is likely to be the focus in the weeks ahead especially after a rally in the shares of after it boosted its share buyback program by usd10bn said the march 24 note in the short term markets will react favorably to buyback announcements

the spy has it on good authority that on monday next week after the markets close apple will announce the takeover of one time rival ibm for a cash and stock package valued at 162b just under a 25 premium over where the latter s stock was trading this week given that apple s own market cap at nearly 3t is some 23 times that of the company that once dominated the tech world tim cook apple s ceo brushes the purchase off in as to be released presser acquired on the sly by the spy as a minor acquisition designed to somewhat enhance our enterprise footprint elsewhere he comments we were actually more interested in certain of the ibm subsidiaries particularly red hat but in the end decided that buying the parent company extracting what we wanted then selling off or closing down the rest was our best strategy their brand though somewhat tarnished still has value so perhaps a careful re packaging of some assets under the ibm name might make a sufficiently attractive buy for someone else allowing us to both satisfy regulatory authorities on anti trust matters recoup most of our investment and keep the pieces we really want for a net win win bargain another source informed the spy that in view of supply chain difficulties with chinese sources and the loss of russian markets apple was considering purchasing several unnamed small countries and setting up manufacturing in locations that would be entirely under cupertino s control but intensive focus sessions with influencers including a certain unnamed futurist author columnist subsequently drove the conclusion that such actions might not be well received because of potential concerns about the affected populations becoming captive markets the spy can report that even the suggestion that apple move all manufacturing to north america assist with the immigration of and then hire a couple of million ukranian refugees raised focus group concerns over possible accusations of labour exploitation so corporate executives reluctantly dropped or at least temporarily shelved the plan however the company s on the quiet purchase of thousands of square kilometres of canadian tundra as a separate hedge against global warming rendering its current texas and california locations uninhabitable has according to unimpeachable sources now successfully closed the eight locations in question could each one day house and provide work for the corporate giant for up to ten million people the plan is to install heat harvesting farms in the by that time uninhabitable south and pump both heat and electricity to the north where people could by then actually live apple s new cities a century hence would in that thinking have become models for many other corporate imitators as most of the southern states empty of people and canada inherits the mantle of the world s major superpower the potential fly in the ointment however is by that time canada may being by then predominantly ukrainian speaking have become a target for vlad the invader who regards all such people as renegade russians whom he has the right by might to place under his personal and absolute rule the western world having established its reluctance to defend the old ukraine in 2022 would no doubt be equally supine before an invasion of the new ukraine to its north in 2050 when the unnamed futurist author columnist previously introduced above mentioned this in a focus group the suggestion then advanced was that apple purchase greenland and claim antartica for its future settlements as a hedge against said possible russian expansion to its

ap washington us president joe biden on thursday announced to release 1 million barrels of oil per day from the nation s strategic petroleum reserve for the next six months as part his efforts to keep the oil prices under control which have been spiralling in the aftermath of the russian invasion of ukraine i m authorizing the release of 1 million barrels per day for the next six months over 180 million barrels from the strategic petroleum reserve biden said making the announcement in this regard this is a wartime bridge to increase oil supply until production ramps up later this year and it is by far the largest release from our national reserve in our history he said the revenue generated from selling the oil would be used to restock the strategic petroleum reserve when prices are lower so that the country is ready for future emergencies he said biden said he has been talking to other allies and partners around the world already we have commitments from other countries to release tens of millions of additional barrels into the market together our combined efforts will supply well over a million barrels a day nations coming together to deny putin the ability to weaponize his energy resources against american families and families and democracies around the world he said the president also announced plans about declaring real american energy independence in the long term so that the us never has to deal with this problem again ultimately we and the whole world need to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels altogether we need to choose long term security over energy and climate vulnerability we need to double down on our commitment to clean energy and tackling the climate crisis with our partners and allies around the world he said later national economic council director brian deese told reporters that there are currently 568 million barrels in the reserve which is in four locations across southern louisiana and texas the president authorized this reserve under his extraordinary emergency powers associated with supply disruptions which we have seen in the market are associated with putin s unjustified actions and the reaction from the united states and allies in the world in no longer purchasing russian oil deese said according to him the duration of six months was designed and calibrated to operate a medium term bridge to the period where they anticipate and expect us production to come back online the most estimates based on commitments by companies are that we will see an additional million barrels a day from us industry by about the end of the third quarter of this year so the time period operates as a bridge until then he said the united states he said has been in touch with several countries including india on the release of strategic reserves our conversations with all countries that have reserves are similar in encouraging them to participate and to contribute consistent with their available stocks and their circumstances dees said we have seen to date a quite extraordinary willingness to participate including iea and non iea members to participate in those coordinated releases including the indian government to date so the work of diplomacy and engagement with our allies and partners is aimed to make sure that that continues he said biden also signed an executive order authorizing the defense production act for usage for the critical materials that go into large capacity batteries biden took this action under title 3 of the defense production act which provides for prioritizing and subsidizing the production domestically of key inputs that are critical to national defence this follows a study by the secretary of defense lloyd austin which identified that large capacity batteries are critical to the national defence and the components that go into them including lithium and nickel cobalt graphite manganese my guess is that s the first time in the white house briefing room someone has said manganese these are critical minerals and we are currently vulnerable to unreliable supply chains which affects our national security it also affects our economic security as well he said
protesters from across sri lanka descended on the nation s capital in february shouting above the street noise and pumping their fists in the air in frustration the group was made up of fishermen and their supporters and their rage was sparked by the indian boats that regularly sail into sri lankan waters by the thousands hauling away valuable sea cucumbers and prawns sri lankan fishermen say they ve lost business and some have lost their lives in confrontations with foreign crews the protesters demanded more action from the government even as sri lanka s navy has used force to guard its fisheries destroying indian fishing gear charging at the vessels and in at least one violent episode firing shots five indian fishermen were reportedly killed last year in encounters with the navy although sri lankan authorities deny they killed or shot at crews and say they were not the aggressors the intensity is increasing the level of violence is increasing deaths are increasing said n manoharan who has researched the conflict as director of east asian studies at bangalore s christ university warnings and arrests he said have failed to keep indian trawlers from crossing into sri lankan waters in part because their own shores are overfished they are so desperate for the catch and they go and lose their lives this 600 mile stretch of the indian ocean is far from the only place where tensions over fishing run high elsewhere in the region fishermen in india and pakistan are also entangled in an ongoing boundary dispute between the two nations in the arabian sea according to indian news reports pakistan s maritime authority has shot at indian fishing boats at least twice in the past two years around the world from sri lanka to argentina to the south china sea the ocean has become an expanding front in the armed conflict between nations over illegal fishing and overfishing practices that deplete a vulnerable food source for billions of people worldwide jessica spijkers a researcher for australia s national science agency found a rise in global fishing conflicts when she studied a four decade period ending in 2016 conflicts this century she said often involved claims of illegal and overfishing her analysis included nonviolent disputes that sometimes precede the outbreak of violence an associated press review of conflict databases compiled by non governmental organizations government tallies and media reports found in the past five years more than 360 instances of state authorities ramming or shooting at foreign fishing boats sometimes leading to deaths during that same time another 850 foreign fishing boats were seized by authorities and systematically crushed blown up or sunk the figures cover incidents across six continents but are likely an undercount since no single entity tracks violent conflicts over fishing rights worldwide the ap analysis did not include routine citations and arrests but focused on where and how violence has escalated in fishing grounds around the world environmental and national security experts say countries that depend on fishing both as a source of food and commerce are at risk of greater conflict in the coming years already industrial fishing boats extract droves of fish from the sea with distant water fleets from china and other countries roaming far beyond their domestic waters in search of stocks that have been depleted closer to home the search for new sources of fish comes as nations are tasked with feeding growing populations and climate change further endangers ocean life it is getting significantly worse said johan bergenas a world wildlife fund expert on oceans who first warned of a rise in global fishing conflicts five years ago we are now seeing armed conflict and tensions and strains as a result of fish stocks and competition over in west africa in the west indian ocean in latin america he said there s going to be conflicts and armed engagements over these incredibly important fish stocks around the world in early february the 400 foot u s coast guard cutter stratton docked in fiji and welcomed three local officials aboard for one week the combined crew toured the oceans around fiji s islands in search of fishing boats that might be flouting the rules boarding eight boats and flagging 22 customs and fishing violations fiji s exclusive economic zone is an area of water 70 times larger than its landmass vilisoni tarabe a fisheries policy officer at the wwf office in fiji said many pacific island countries suspect fishing boats of catching more tuna or sharks than they report
faculty from the departments of microbiology medicine genetics and genomic sciences and pathology and molecular cell based medicine at the icahn school of medicine at mount sinai play key roles in a national institutes of health nih program set up to provide a real time risk assessment of variants of sars cov 2 the virus that causes covid 19 the program called sars cov 2 assessment of viral evolution save and described in a paper published march 31 in nature assesses how the variants might affect transmission virulence and resistance to both disease induced convalescent and vaccine induced immunity the save program was established by the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases niaid part of nih in january 2021 to address the global public health threat caused by increasing sars cov 2 genomic diversity and the emergence of viral variants that jeopardize the protective antiviral immunity following infection or vaccination it uses a coordinated approach to identify and curate data about these variants their impact on immunity and their effects on vaccine protection collaborative science and open sharing of results in near real time amongst an international team of scientists has defined the save program and has facilitated rapid prioritization reagent development testing and assessment of sars cov 2 variants the save program serves as a template for response to not only sars cov 2 variants but for other emerging pathogens florian krammer phd mount sinai professor of vaccinology at icahn mount sinai co chair of the save program s in vitro group and co corresponding author of the paper the save program is composed of an international team of scientists with expertise in virology immunology vaccinology structural biology bioinformatics viral genetics and evolution it was formed as a critical data generating component for the u s department of health and human services sars cov 2 interagency group sig and to facilitate rapid data sharing with global partners and the scientific community each team member is responsible for key contributions ranging from curation of viral mutations bioinformatics analysis development of novel reagents assay development and testing in vitro characterization and in vivo model development to countermeasure testing the save program is divided into three working groups 1 early detection and analysis group 2 in vitro group 3 in vivo group the early detection group uses public databases and analysis tools to curate and prioritize emerging sars cov 2 variants the in vitro group evaluates the impact of sars cov 2 variants on humoral and cell mediated immune responses using in vitro assays the in vivo group uses small and large animal models to test vaccine efficacy and define immune mechanisms and correlates of protection collaborative efforts between the early detection geneticists and evolutionary biologists and the in vitro group of virologists immunologists allow for rapid determination of relationships between viral evolution and neutralization sensitivity in turn these results enable the in vivo team to assess and evaluate protection provided by vaccination and or previous infection in animal studies the emergence of the b 1 1 529 variant omicron which includes ba 1 ba 1 1 and ba 2 which contains more than 30 mutations in the spike protein threatened to reduce the effectiveness of clinically approved covid 19 monoclonal antibody therapies and infection and vaccine induced immunity to the virus the save program rapidly responded by generating plasmids and spike protein identifying the first omicron cases ba 1 in new york city isolating propagating and distributing authentic omicron viral stocks sharing reagents performing binding and neutralization assays and evaluating virus infection across different animal models the data from these studies were rapidly shared with government agencies and submitted as manuscripts on pre print servers to inform the wider scientific community icahn mount sinai faculty members who are key to this effort include harm van bakel phd serves as a member of the early detection and analysis group his lab leverages data they generated as part of the mount sinai pathogen surveillance program as well as data from public repositories to identify and prioritize novel emerging

variants said viviana simon md phd professor of microbiology and medicine and faculty member of the global health and emerging pathogens institute at icahn mount sinai and a member of the in vitro group of the save program partnerships like the save program must continue to include scientists from around the world to ensure that variants are rapidly identified and characterized so that we can effectively counter the constant threat emerging pathogens pose against global public health all mount sinai members of the save program want to emphasize the major role that institutional support and collaborations with other icahn mount sinai groups have played in our ability to participate in the save program this would have not been possible without the biosafety supervision of randy albrecht and the support from the institution in expanding our biocontainment capabilities as well as without collaborations with many clinical and basic research colleagues at mount sinai said adolfo garcia sastre phd director of the global health and emerging pathogens institute and member of the in vivo group of the save program and of course we do not want to forget our young members of our group the

a crocodile bellows as a rope is hooked around its teeth and pulled after the reptile is heaved out of a cool concrete pool onto sun cooked pavement a wrangler steps on its snout and binds its jaw shut the crocodile s bellows turning to hisses within an hour more than 20 crocodiles are tied up and piled into the bed of a truck these are siamese crocodiles some of more than 2 500 at a farm in the cambodian city of siem reap cambodia s crocodile farms breed and sell live crocodiles often to buyers in china thailand and vietnam where they are harvested to make crocodile leather and other products but the animals being collected today are not destined for sale or slaughter instead they are a donation from the farm to conservationists trying to save the last wild populations of siamese crocodiles in cambodia the siamese crocodile was believed to be extinct in cambodia until 2000 when a survey led by conservation organisation fauna flora international rediscovered a remnant population in the cardamom mountains in the southwest of the country scientists estimate only a few hundred siamese crocodiles survive in the wild in southeast asia today cambodia is home to the largest wild population numbering 200 to 400 individuals according to a 2015 study meanwhile a regional study published the following year estimated that around 2 800 farms in cambodia thailand and vietnam house more than 1 53 million crocodiles including siamese cuban and saltwater species and hybrids juvenile siamese crocodiles at phnom tamao wildlife rescue center open their mouths to keep cool a process similar to panting image anton l delgado how farming drove the disappearance of southeast asia s crocodiles the international union for conservation of nature iucn has classified the siamese crocodile as critically endangered on its red list of threatened species since 1996 despite being historically abundant in wetlands across mainland southeast asia through to borneo and java the siamese crocodile was extinct across most of its range by the 1990s the most recent iucn assessment in 2012 estimated the global population of the species to number no more than 500 to 1 000 individuals in isolated populations in cambodia laos indonesia thailand and vietnam hunting of wild populations for their skins was the main driver behind huge declines in the mid 20th century cambodia s first commercial crocodile farms where wild caught individuals were kept and bred for their body parts were established in the 1940s the first farms in thailand were recorded five years later according to an iucn crocodile specialist group report siamese and hybrid crocodiles in a pool at a crocodile farm in siem reap cambodia the farm which was established in 1990 and registered with cites in 2017 to allow export of the protected species is home to approximately 2 500 to 3 000 crocodiles image anton l delgado wild populations got absolutely demolished because of farmers capturing crocodiles in the wild to build up their own stock joe rose captive breeding project officer at fauna flora international in cambodia tells the third pole he says this was particularly common in cambodia during the 1980s to 1990s as the industry grew by 2016 approximately 900 farms in cambodia were estimated to have a stock of more than 250 000 crocodiles with farms often purposefully interbreeding species for commercial reasons the study couldn t determine how many were pure bred siamese crocodiles beyond cambodia commercial farming of siamese crocodiles occurs in thailand and vietnam which are estimated to have 800 and 1 100 crocodile farms respectively so many farms in cambodia and in the region were just sucking animals out of the wild jenny daltry fauna flora international siamese crocodiles are protected under cambodia s 2006 law on fisheries which prohibits the unlicensed take of certain aquatic animals with penalties under the law up to five years imprisonment and fines of several million cambodian riels 1 million riel equating to usd 246 a subsequent sub decree no 123 lists siamese crocodiles as one of the protected aquatic species along with the endangered irrawaddy dolphin and mekong giant catfish siamese crocodiles are also protected internationally being listed on appendix i of the convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora cites this means international commercial trade in the species is generally prohibited but there are exceptions a list of cites registered captive breeding operations permitted to raise and export siamese crocodiles includes 28 in thailand 21 in cambodia and 10 in vietnam a robust international market for siamese crocodile products from skins and skulls to leather products and live individuals is recorded on the cites trade database a siamese crocodile being collected from a pool at a crocodile farm in siem reap image anton l delgado from 2010 to 2020 cambodia thailand and vietnam reported the export of more than 547 000 live siamese crocodiles with china listed as the importer of nearly 80 of these crocodiles all were recorded as being bred in captivity according to a study on global trade in crocodilians from 2017 19 large numbers of siamese crocodiles exported to china are destined for consumption as food over the same period the three countries reported the export of almost 400 000 skins and more than 80 000 siamese crocodile bodies to countries around the world including the united states and several eu countries crocodile leather is widely used to make shoes bags and other accessories for markets worldwide the biggest exports recorded involved more than 100 000 live siamese crocodiles exported from vietnam to china in 2019 and 78 040 bodies exported from thailand to hong kong in 2013 crocodile farms as unlikely conservation partners in response to the critically low numbers left in the wild the cambodian crocodile conservation project a collaboration between fauna flora international and the forestry administration of cambodia established a captive breeding programme with 35 pure bred siamese crocodiles at phnom tamao wildlife rescue center in 2009 since 2012 the project has released 136 pure bred siamese crocodiles into the cardamom mountains according to pablo sinovas flagship species manager with fauna flora in cambodia as part of this programme conservationists have turned to the source of by far the biggest populations of siamese crocodiles alive today commercial farms until recently there wasn t much of a relationship between farmers and conservationists says rose in the last year or so we managed to meet a few open minded farmers interested in conservation crocodile wrangler noo hok sang carries a captured crocodile in siem reap that is being donated to a conservation organisation image anton l delgado a third of the siamese crocodiles released to date were from farms says sinovas in total he says approximately 300 crocodiles have been donated by farmers to the captive breeding and release programme farm donations are really important for conservation because siamese crocodiles have gotten to such small stocks adds rose it would take a very long time for to breed and build the population up releasing additional crocodiles helps diversify the gene pool and boosts numbers in those remaining wild stocks jenny daltry a technical adviser for fauna flora who was part of the survey team that rediscovered cambodia s wild siamese crocodiles says that initially farms were the biggest threat to the region s crocodiles so many farms in cambodia and in the region were just sucking animals out of the wild she says it was quite difficult to partner with the industry at that stage she adds but while developing a relationship with the industry has proven challenging at times she says it is now going in the right direction a truck full of crocodiles prepares to drive from a farm in siem reap to phnom tamao wildlife rescue center near phnom penh image anton l delgado while opportunistic small scale poaching might occur farms likely no longer take from wild populations says sinovas given the very small numbers of siamese crocodiles in remote wild locations it would not be worth the effort to seek them out thousands are breeding in farms in thailand the thai crocodile farmer association in association with the department of national parks and mahidol university released 20 pure bred siamese crocodiles in 2020 says yosapong temsiripong chairman of the association which represents 20 cites registered farms we help wild populations by releasing crocodiles every year not only to rebuild wild stocks but also to rebuild our reputation and change the perception of crocodile farmers in thailand and southeast asia says temsiripong who is general manager of sriracha moda a farm with more than 20 000 crocodiles from 2023 the association plans to release 20 juvenile siamese crocodiles into the national park every year says temsiripong a farm donated pure bred siamese crocodile is released into the sre ambel river that flows through cambodia s southern cardamom national park image anton l delgado sim khmao leader of a patrol team of community wardens who protect crocodile sanctuaries in the cardamom mountains releases a donated siamese crocodile crocodile into the sre ambel river image anton l delgado and the only reason we release so few or so relatively few is because we have no habitat left temsiripong continues all we have to work with is pang sida national park is wildlife farming a sustainable model for conservation whether commercial farming and trade of endangered species can help wild populations is a hotly debated topic among conservationists advocates for a sustainable use model of conservation contend a legal trade of farmed wildlife products can satisfy demand thereby reducing pressure on wild populations other conservationists argue that legal trade often increases the demand for wildlife products and that the strict regulation needed to ensure wild populations are not negatively affected is difficult to achieve in practice in a 2016 study laura tensen a postdoctoral researcher at the university of koblenz landau proposed conditions that have to be met for farming to benefit conservation these cover economics farming must be cheaper than wild capture to sourcing farms must not restock from the wild or launder illegally sourced animals and demand farming must not increase customer demand and customers must show no preference between wild or farmed products without very good governance or monitoring mechanisms in place farms work to the detriment of wild populations of crocodiles steven platt herpetologist at the wildlife conservation society the minute any of these criteria aren t met there will be a negative effect on wildlife populations says tensen adding that situations which meet all the criteria are very very rare significant enforcement and monitoring are needed to ensure these criteria are met at every farm and without this wildlife farming can have disastrous effects says tensen there are several examples of wild populations plummeting after the launch of commercial farming from tigers in laos to giant salamanders in china while china has recently restricted farming of wild animals at least for food consumption the nepal government is moving to launch commercial wildlife farming i don t have anything against farming per se but there are no conservation benefits to farming says steven platt a herpetologist at the wildlife conservation society who has worked on crocodile conservation in southeast asia since 1999 when you have states that don t have very good governance or monitoring mechanisms in place those farms work to the detriment of wild populations of crocodiles recommended patrick aust a member of the iucn s crocodile specialist group argues that the problem with the region s crocodile farming is the way it has developed rather than the concept itself there wasn t any forward thinking research or multidisciplinary environmental social development work accompanying the expansion of the industry says aust it was driven by the almighty dollar and the almighty dollar alone according to aust who studies the potential of reptiles as a sustainable food source at the university of oxford small scale crocodile farms could overcome issues such as extreme weather and disease outbreaks that impact the farming of other species they are a very versatile agricultural species to add to agrifood systems in a small scale context in fragile small communities the problem was the production model got centralised into bigger and bigger farms detracting from that small scale resilient sustainable model says aust but he argues an optimal model of sustainable use conservation has already been proven to work crocodile ranching in australia can australia s ranching success be replicated regulated and sustainable trade works sustainable use works said inger andersen executive director of the un environment programme during her opening remarks at the 2019 cites summit andersen s first and only example was the trade of crocodiles in australia a 2019 cites case study on crocodiles in australia s northern territory found that after hunting during the 1940s to 1960s caused severe declines in saltwater crocodile populations a programme of sustainable use contributed to the recovery of wild populations the programme is frequently referenced as a case study of successful sustainable use in broader debates on the commercial exploitation of wild animals the main model used in australia s crocodile industry is ranching which relies on collection of wild eggs or young crocodiles that are statistically unlikely to survive to adulthood and rearing them in captivity they are then killed and processed when they reach a commercially viable size the model is meant to incentivise landowners to protect crocodile habitats as the model depends on wild populations siamese crocodile hatchlings under a year old at the siamese crocodile breeding facility in phnom tamao wildlife rescue center there are 12 hatchlings at the facility as of february 2022 image anton l delgado charlie manolis interim co chair of the iucn crocodile specialist group recognises the success of australia s sustainable use programme but believes its applicability in other contexts and countries has limitations this style of conservation doesn t work for everyone or every species but for crocodilians in australia it has worked says manolis who is also chief scientist at wildlife management international a sustainable use conservation company in some countries there is a limit to what you can do because of nature and demographics a key factor for australia s success was the vast potential habitat in the northern territory which manolis says many countries in southeast asia have lost in other countries like thailand there is so little habitat left where are you going to put your siamese crocodiles in contrast with australia s ranching model southeast asia s crocodile farms use a closed cycle system in which crocodiles of all ages were originally captured from the wild to create captive bred populations adult crocodiles are now bred in captivity to produce eggs which are reared until the crocodiles reach commercial size and are sold or slaughtered in this system the farms do not rely on healthy wild populations in march 2022 fauna flora international conducted its largest siamese crocodile release in cambodia satellite tags were attached to the biggest crocodiles released into steung kampong tachey a section of the sre ambel river in the cardamom mountains image anton l delgado the relationship formed between landowners ranchers and conservationists was another key aspect of australia s success says manolis however he warns that given the tiny numbers of wild siamese crocodiles declines in suitable habitat and limited infrastructure for government regulation replicating australia s crocodile ranching success in countries like cambodia is unlikely daltry warns that attempting to implement ranching as an alternative to southeast asia s farming model would be risky since so many livelihoods depend on the industry she says it would be very hard to put the toothpaste back in the tube crocodiles are in more restricted areas and with the aid of indigenous people and local authorities those populations can be protected and monitored more effectively says daltry it is probably safer to stick with farming than try to set up anything too complicated that would need a lot of regulation despite the crocodile farming industry s historical role in the demise of wild crocodiles in southeast asia daltry says that conservationists need to find ways to work with farmers because as long as there is international demand for crocodile products the industry will remain a fixture in the region s wildlife trade i am not saying you should stop the farming industry or close it down it is there it exists she says what we need to look at is how do we work with the industry to ensure some of these animals live in the wild hor leng left and sam han right veteran members of the cambodian crocodile
