the sides are expected to battle it out in court on friday elon musk made official what he d been hinting at for months formally announcing that he wishes to walk away from his deal to buy twitter and take it private however that doesn t mean that the deal is simply dead instead a lengthy court battle is likely as twitter plans to show that musk has not met the conditions to exit the deal musk announced his intention to leave the deal in a letter from his attorneys as further described below mr musk is terminating the merger agreement because twitter is in material breach of multiple provisions of that agreement appears to have made false and misleading representations upon which mr musk relied when entering into the merger agreement and is likely to suffer a company material adverse effect musk s lawyers said in the letter the reasons for the departure included that twitter has failed or refused to provide information requested by musk including what his side considers accurate information about the number of spam or fake accounts among twitter s users twitter did make its hose of daily information available to musk but his attorneys considered that insufficient while twitter has provided some information that information has come with strings attached use limitations or other artificial formatting features which has rendered some of the information minimally useful to mr musk and his advisors the letter said for example when twitter finally provided access to the eight developer apis first explicitly requested by mr musk in the may 25 letter those apis contained a rate limit lower than what twitter provides to its largest enterprise customers twitter only offered to provide mr musk with the same level of access as some of its customers after we explained that throttling the rate limit prevented mr musk and his advisors from performing the analysis that he wished to conduct in any reasonable period of time musk s legal team said twitter meanwhile said in a statement of its own that it plans to hold musk to the deal we are committed to closing the transaction on the price and terms agreed upon with mr musk and plan to pursue legal action to enforce the merger agreement we are confident we will prevail in the delaware court of chancery the company said after purchasing a stake in the company musk reached a deal in april to buy twitter for about 44 billion which came with a 1 billion breakup fee in the months since musk has repeatedly threatened to put the deal on hold or even leave it altogether this behavior has led to much speculation that musk either never intended to become the owner of twitter at all that he is using the bot excuse to get out of a deal he wasn t interested in or perhaps that the collapse of tech stocks has made musk s position less tenable matt levine of bloomberg news whose money stuff newsletter has provided some of the most trenchant analysis of the potential deal broke down the situation in a special saturday edition after the announcement that musk wanted out elon musk had a well thought out business and financial plan for twitter that worked in the economic conditions of early april 2022 but conditions have changed and the model no longer works does not strike me as the most plausible description of what is going on here levine wrote elon musk whimsically thought it might be fun to own twitter so he signed a merger agreement without taking it too seriously and then lost interest a week later feels more true to the situation my first reaction to his proposal to buy twitter that it was a joke may have been the correct one he was just a lot more committed to the bit than i expected he continued levine added that there is not a whisper of evidence for the claim that twitter had misrepresented the number of bot accounts in its user base so what comes next the sides are expected to battle it out in an extremely unusual case in which the buyer of a public company has sought to pull out of the deal and the company plans to make him buy it per bloomberg news twitter is planning to hire a legal team from the law firm wachtell lipton rosen katz which specializes in merger law specifically in poison pills to deal with its case against musk in addition in reaction to the news earlier in the week that musk had fathered two more children with a woman who works for his company neuralink about a thousand people on twitter made similar jokes about musk and the act of pulling out stephen silver a technology writer for the national interest is a journalist essayist and film critic who is also a contributor to the philadelphia inquirer philly voice philadelphia weekly the jewish telegraphic agency living life fearless backstage magazine broad street review and splice today the co founder of the philadelphia film critics circle stephen lives in suburban philadelphia with his wife and two sons follow him on twitter at stephensilver image reuters

live richer reviewed by experts trusted by millions of readers in june tesla filed its annual proxy statement with the securities and exchange commission and it included a provision for the company to split its stock 3 1 shareholders approved the split on aug 5 and set aug 24 as the date for the split to occur shares began trading at the new split adjusted price on aug 25 what does this mean for tesla shareholders and if you re not a shareholder is it time to buy here s what you need to know how the tesla stock split worked a company can split its stock if it thinks shares have become too expensive preventing the average investor from buying it by splitting the stock existing investors will hold more shares but at a lower price per share it s common to split stock 2 1 meaning that each shareholder gets two shares for each one they currently own and each new share is worth half what the old ones were worth true to its tendency toward the uncommon tesla initiated a 5 for 1 split in august 2020 two years nearly to the day before the most recent split note that the value of each investor s position doesn t change if you have 10 shares of a 100 stock before a 2 for 1 split you ll have 20 shares of a 50 stock after the split your position is 1 000 in either case the 2022 tesla stock split tesla s latest split is 3 1 in the 2022 tesla stock split each shareholder as of aug 17 received a dividend of two additional shares for each share held on that date the shares were distributed after the close of trading on aug 24 and began trading at their new split adjusted price when the markets opened on aug 25 shares were trading for 891 29 when the market closed on aug 24 according to reuters shares opened at 302 36 on the 25th shareholders owned three times as many shares on the 25th as they d owned on the 24th with each share worth one third of the price of a single share prior to the split the value of each shareholder s position thus remained unchanged why companies split stock the reasoning behind the split is that a stock with a single share price of 900 or so can be psychologically prohibitive for some investors the stock may feel overpriced at that level so the company decides to divide the stock into small shares each of which has a lower price not every company agrees with this philosophy berkshire hathaway has famously never split its stock even as investors bid up the price a single share of berkshire hathaway class a stock nyse brk a closed at 424 290 on sept 1 however berkshire hathaway also issues class b stock which gives investors a lower priced alternative the company s class b stock closed at 282 43 on the same day is it a good idea to buy tesla stock tesla stock has been a wild ride on jan 1 2020 it was selling at 130 11 two years later the price was 936 72 however if you bought tesla on nov 1 2021 you d have paid 1 144 76 in fact if you bought tesla just about any time between november 2021 and june 1 of this year your investment is down as of sept 2 analysts are shall we say split on the company s prospects as well of the 45 analysts who followed the stock in august as reported by yahoo finance 26 rated it a buy or strong buy 16 rated it a hold or underperform and three rated it a sell of the 23 analysts following the stock in september eight rate it a buy or strong buy 14 rate it a hold or underperform and one recommends selling this resulted in a recommendation rating of 2 3 on a scale of 1 5 the one year average target price estimate is 298 80 in a range of 24 33 to 461 the price as of midday on sept 2 was 278 09 conventional wisdom says that a stock s price usually rises a bit after it splits simply because the split has the desired effect of allowing more investors to participate this isn t always the case however and the company s fundamentals are a better indicator of how the stock price will behave after a split how will the split affect tesla stock whereas tesla stock rose over 81 in the two weeks following its 2020 stock split according to benzinga shares lost nearly 8 in the days following the announcement of the 2022 split they were still down slightly on aug 24 and they fell more in the day or two immediately after the split before recovering slightly no one has a crystal ball so it s impossible to say what the stock will do in the coming weeks and months it is safe to say however that since the split was announced most of the impact had been largely baked in to the pre split trading price in other words investors in the know were basing their purchases and sales of tesla stock with the split in mind the company hopes that the lower price will encourage more investors to buy tesla stock and most analysts seem to think that could be the case some have increased their price targets as a result of the split but even the most bullish are basing their predictions more on the market conditions and the company s strength than the stock split bearish analysts are also looking primarily at the fundamentals is tesla a good growth stock tesla s growth has been robust that s for sure but it hasn t been immune from the market pullback in recent months and the back and forth between elon musk and twitter has made the stock even more volatile than usual but the electric car market appears to be here to stay and tesla has been a leader in the technology required to make electric vehicles viable institutional investors provide valuable insight into how wall street thinks a stock might perform at least in the near term deutsche bank and jefferies both have indicated since the split that they re maintaining their buy recommendations piper sandler and morgan stanley have maintained their overweight ratings wedbush has maintained its outperform rating is tesla good for long term investment the outlook for tesla over the long term appears positive according to most analysts even if the company s growth trajectory continues on an upward trend however it s unlikely to see the amount of growth the company has experienced in the last few years this is true of most companies particularly those in the technology sector they grow rapidly at first but then growth slows down as more competitors enter the market but slower growth is still growth and analysts seem to agree that tesla remains well positioned to continue to grow over the long term investors should be prepared for some bumps along the way however if the company s history is any indication takeaway the bottom line is that there may be little benefit to buying tesla stock immediately after the stock split the factors that make the stock attractive to investors are the company s fundamentals and its ability to remain at the forefront of the technology that will bring electric vehicles into the mainstream daria uhlig contributed to the reporting for this article data is accurate as of sept 2 2022 and is subject to change
federal reserve bank of atlanta president raphael bostic said the u s economy can cope with higher interest rates and repeated his support for another jumbo move when the central bank meets later this month right now i m pretty comfortable he told reporters in a conference call monday i m confident that the economy will be able to withstand this next move i would support a 75 basis point increase policy makers pivoted to aggressively lifting interest rates this year as they work to tame the hottest inflation in four decades a shift they acknowledge could slow u s economic growth and weaken the labor market raphael bostic president and chief executive officer of the federal reserve bank of atlanta speaks during a television interview at the jackson hole economic symposium on aug 24 2018 bloomberg news bostic who does not vote on policy this year said last week that he is fully supportive of raising rates by 75 basis points later this month the policy maker said on monday that he thinks it is possible for the fed to raise interest rate to about 3 a level that he considers neutral without sparking a recession while financial markets have gyrated as investors fret the fed will cause a recession recent data show the economy still has some things going for it u s employers added 372 000 jobs in june and the unemployment rate remained near a 50 year low confirming that the labor market is still tight fed officials will have a fresh inflation reading to consider on wednesday when the labor department releases the consumer price index for last month economists forecast that consumer prices increased by 8 8 in june from a year earlier above the 8 6 increase seen in may while a majority of the 18 officials on the policy setting federal open market committee have declared themselves open to raising rates by 75 basis points in july following a move of that size last month at least one is worried about going too quickly kansas city fed president esther george who dissented last month in favor of a 50 basis point increase cautioned earlier on monday that rushing to tighten policy could backfire this is already a historically swift pace of rate increases for households and businesses to adapt to and more abrupt changes in interest rates could create strains either in the economy or financial markets she told the mid america labor management conference in lake ozark missouri bostic said the fed s moves are starting to put downward pressure on demand and said there are some signs that supply constraints are easing however the invasion of ukraine and other forces are pushing inflation up he said he is watching for signs that monthly inflation changes are falling and will monitor how broad based price increases are the atlanta fed chief said the central bank can be methodical as it raises rates to remove the support it provided during the pandemic asked what it would take for him to support a rate hike larger than 75 basis points such as a full percentage point bostic said he would consider being more aggressive if data suggested that inflation is moving further away from the fed s 2 target or that longer run inflation expectations were rising but he doesn t expect it will be necessary i do think the evidence that we ve seen in the last few days suggests that those scenarios are not playing out so i m not expecting that we ll have to do that bostic said but i try to keep my mind as open as possible to any possibility investors fully expect the u s central bank to raise rates by 75 basis points again when officials meet on july 26 27 fund futures show

twitter says its 44 billion sale to elon musk is still on and it will go to court to make it happen despite the mercurial billionaire s declaration he is breaking it off the agreement is not terminated twitter s lawyers wrote in aletter to the tesla and spacex ceo on sunday disclosed in a filing on monday musk knowingly intentionally willfully and materially breached his agreement to buy the company they alleged twitter reserves all contractual legal and other rights including its right to specifically enforce the musk parties obligations under the agreement they wrote back in april musk launched a surprise bid tobuy twitter for 54 20 a share which the social media company initially resisted beforeaccepting musk has accused twitter of violating the sale agreement which he argued gives him grounds to walk away without paying a 1 billion penalty it all sets twitter and musk up for a lengthy and expensive legal battle in the delaware court of chancery which deals with corporate disputes the only sure winners in this situation are the lawyers said joseph grundfest a law professor at stanford and former commissioner at the securities and exchange commission because a lot of money is going to be spent litigating this question twitter will seek to force musk to go through with the deal legal experts say twitter has a strong case the agreement they signed includes a clause that allows twitter to sue to force musk to buy the company that means he promised to buy the company for a price well he d better show up and buy the company for that price grundfest said courts have forced buyers to complete deals even after they ve gotten cold feet in 2001 tyson foods tried to back out of an agreement to buy a meat processor after raising questions about its business but the delaware court ordered it to go through with the purchase forcing musk to buy twitter hinges on his financing for the deal remaining in place musk is on the hook to pay 33 5 billion himself and has lined up 13 billion in loans from banks one key question is will musk s declaration that he wants out of the deal cause the banks to change their minds the court could order musk to pay damages instead even though there is precedent to force a buyer to complete a deal donna hitscherich a professor at columbia business school said the court may be reluctant to do so typically the court is going to put the parties in the position they were in before the unhappy events occurred she said in that case the court might not order musk to buy twitter but could stick him with billions of dollars in damages while that would likely amount to less than the 44 billion musk agreed to pay it would avoid the awkward situation of forcing musk to buy a company he says he no longer wants to own musk has shown little interest in following legal orders after the sec fined him and tesla 40 million in 2018 over his claims he had funding secured to take the electric carmaker private the regulator said a lawyer needed to vet his tweets musk has been accused of violating that order and he s now trying to get his 2018 settlement with the sec thrown out musk will argue that twitter broke their agreement in his letter friday to twitter saying he was terminating the purchase musk accused the company of making false and misleading representations about its estimates of how many accounts on the platform are fake or spam he also accused twitter of refusing to share information that would help him verify its estimates and of violating other parts of the legal agreement while musk initially cited cleaning up twitter s longstanding problem of spam accounts and automated bots as a reason he wanted to buy the company in recent weeks he s flipped he now cites the issue as his rationale for backing out of the deal musk says he thinks the prevalence of fake and spam accounts on the platform is far higher than the 5 twitter estimates twitter has said it uses private data to make those estimates so they can t be easily replicated by outsiders legal experts say even if twitter s figures were incorrect that would probably not be a big enough problem to get musk out of his agreement to buy the company that s a pretty heavy lift said hitscherich there has to be something very very significant in the business for the courts to say you know what you re right the very nature of this contract has changed so substantially that you don t have to go through with it pressure could mount for a settlement many deal disputes end with a settlement involving a price cut that s what happened in 2020 when the luxury conglomerate lvmh moët hennessy louis vuitton tried to scupper an agreement to buy jewelry icon tiffany company but ultimately went through with the purchase at a 425 million discount accepting less than 54 20 a share from musk could open twitter up to lawsuits from unhappy shareholders still a settlement could spare both sides from further headaches and reputational damage some have speculated that musk has wanted to buy twitter for a lower price all along since he agreed to the deal global markets have fallen with tech stocks hit especially hard that s made a 44 billion price tag for twitter look more expensive even as the value of tesla shares musk s main source of wealth have plummeted it s hard to see twitter emerging from the legal battle as a winner even if it s a victor in court a protracted legal battle would weigh on the company morale has already taken a hit since the deal was announced some employees are wary of musk s potential ownership and the changes he s floated to protect his vision of free speech meanwhile twitter has been cutting costs including implementing a hiring freeze and even laying off some employees as it seeks to strengthen its business amid a weakening online advertising market no matter who ends up owning it a courtroom drama would cast a further cloud of uncertainty over the company how long do you want to go through with this hitscherich said you re taking your eye off the business everything that takes your eye off the business is an issue copyright 2022 npr to see more visit
a bloomberg report says the company might be making a play for the wholesale business of a large retailer in india what happened is amazon amzn 1 35 currently shopping for a big asset overseas according to a media report published monday morning it is the company is apparently among several entities mulling a bid for a unit of big german retailer metro based in india although the american company has very deep pockets this could be a pricey buy on that thought investors traded out of amazon stock which fell more than 3 in price on the day so what citing people familiar with the matter bloomberg said that several large companies are vying for the wholesale indian operations of that german company metro thailand s pokphand group and indian conglomerate reliance industries are two of these suitors according to the sources the third is amazon the non u s companies are apparently further along in their quest for the metro business bloomberg said that pokphand and reliance have both submitted non binding offers for the unit at the moment according to the article amazon is considering making a bid the report s sources say that the metro unit could be worth the equivalent of 1 billion to 1 2 billion it was not clear how much pokphand and reliance might be bidding with their offers metro has not yet commented on the report nor have any of the supposed suitors named in the article including amazon now what at that kind of price the metro unit would be a mere drop in the bucket for amazon financially after all it had more than 36 billion in cash alone on its books at the end of march still 1 billion is a big swallow and investors might be concerned that the cash could be put to better use in other ways although the company is a dominant retailer in the u s and has a great and rather stealthy business unit in amazon web services both segments are hotly competitive and certain to remain so going forward
what is bitcoin halving and when will it happen again nanostockk getty images commitment to our readers gobankingrates editorial team is committed to bringing you unbiased reviews and information we use data driven methodologies to evaluate financial products and services our reviews and ratings are not influenced by advertisers you can read more about our editorial guidelines and our products and services review methodology 20 years helping you live richer reviewed by experts trusted by millions of readers bitcoin halving is a pivotal event in the cryptocurrency s lifespan that reduces the number of bitcoins in circulation by one half it cuts the reward for mining bitcoin in half and reduces the inflation rate by the same amount it also slows down the introduction of new bitcoins into circulation which often induces inflation by reducing supply halving occurs roughly every four years on a pre set schedule key takeaways bitcoin is mined via verification of blockchain transactions the reward for mining bitcoin is halved every four years or so bitcoin halving can often spike its price but those effects may be temporary the next bitcoin halving is expect to take place in april 2024 what is bitcoin mining bitcoin mining is the process of independent third party verification of every transaction on the blockchain using cryptography bitcoin miners have machines set up to run transaction data through a cryptographic algorithm this creates a hash or a random string of numbers and letters that doesn t reveal transaction data hashing is designed to get more difficult over time according to techtarget as time goes on solving the cryptographic algorithms requires more computing resources and energy miners receive bitcoin rewards for using their computers bandwidth and energy to confirm each bitcoin transaction on the ledger large transactions may require as many as six confirmations or more while some smaller transactions only require one confirmation this means that by design bitcoin mining will continue to get harder and harder particularly after each halving event what is bitcoin halving when bitcoin is halved miners receive half as much bitcoin as they would have received previously for each verified transaction for instance when the first bitcoin were mined back in 2009 miners were awarded 50 btc per block halving occurs each time 210 000 blocks have been mined which happens about every four years experts predict that this will continue until roughly 2140 when the entire supply of 21 million coins will have been mined about 19 million of bitcoin s total supply have been mined since inventor satoshi nakamoto mined the first million coins in 2009 according to the blockchain council less than 2 million new bitcoin will be created between now and 2140 a brief history of bitcoin halving in 2012 about four years after the first bitcoin was mined the reward for mining dropped to 25 btc in 2016 miners received just 12 5 btc per block in 2020 rewards dropped to 6 25 btc future bitcoin halving dates are expected every four years going forward in 2024 2028 2032 2036 2040 and 2044 this scarcity tends to make btc more valuable for a time but of course the price of btc does not exist in a vacuum and the rest of the economic climate the stock market consumer demand for btc and consumer confidence surrounding investing all have an effect on btc prices will halving increase bitcoin s price in general the answer to the question is halving good for bitcoin is a resounding yes while it may be more challenging for miners to acquire bitcoin after a halving event this scarcity often makes the btc they already hold more valuable in 2020 the price of bitcoin rose by 40 up 85 from its historic low just prior to the halving event however this event was clouded by a down economy and economic fears sparked by the covid 19 pandemic the year 2020 will always require a footnote for statistical data halving sparked bull runs nevertheless the halving events in november 2012 and july 2016 also drove the price of bitcoin up ultimately this deflationary event has historically signaled the start of bitcoin s most dramatic bull runs over a period of several years although not before a brief sell off reuters reported between 2012 and 2014 btc rose by 10 000 according to reuters in mid 2016 through the end of 2017 it increased by roughly 2 500 bitcoin halving and value increases there s more to the story experts point out that the rise in bitcoin s value following a halving event is not usually immediate as their btc rises in value many times investors will sell off what they are holding to cash in on the profits that s why a halving event often creates a sell off which drives prices down prior to a bull run this occurred in both 2012 and 2016 and also in 2020 in spite of other economic factors at play factors to consider some experts state that halvings are already priced in to the coin s value which means that a halving event and bitcoin price increase may not be directly correlated binance founder changpeng zhao pointed out to reuters reporters historic events don t necessarily predict future events noting that there is a psychological aspect to each halving event zhao had mentioned in 2020 that miners might be less willing to sell off their existing crypto investments because it will cost the miners almost double to produce bitcoin however by may 2021 bitcoin had increased in value by 533 in fact the most recent halving event exceeded investors wildest expectations for a bitcoin bull run in november 2021 the cryptocurrency achieved its all time high of over 68 000 temporary effects the effects of a bitcoin halving event can t be expected to last forever either an overall market slump record high inflation of the u s dollar rising interest rates supply chain issues and other pandemic related factors drove bitcoin s price down in 2022 plunging the market into a crypto winter what date is the next bitcoin halving experts predict that the next bitcoin halving event will take place around april 18 2024 after 840 000 blocks have been created on the bitcoin blockchain that means bitcoin is more than halfway to the next halving event from the previous one which occurred on may 11 2020 it s important to note that halving events occur after a specific number of bitcoins have been mined not based on a specific time schedule therefore halving dates are approximate what will happen when bitcoin halves in 2024 after the next halving event in 2024 miners will receive just 3 125 btc for every block mined experts calculate that if the daily average number of blocks mined stays consistent 450 coins will be released each day following the april 2024 halving event final take it s impossible to predict a specific date for the next halving however it is expected to take place in april 2024 it could end the current crypto winter if other factors don t send bitcoin on a rally before then faq here are some quick answers to common questions about bitcoin halving when in 2024 is the next bitcoin halving the next bitcoin halving will likely happen around april 18 2024 however because halving occurs each time 210 000 blocks have been mined it is possible the halving will happen before or after this day in july 2022 the date for the next bitcoin halving was estimated for may 4 2024 how many bitcoin halvings are left there will be 29 more bitcoin halvings because bitcoin is halved after every 210 000 blocks mined halving will occur a total of 32 times there have been three halvings in the past so there are 29 left is bitcoin going to be halved yes bitcoin will be halved every time 210 000 blocks have been mined the next halving is expected to happen around april 18 2024 is there a bitcoin halving in 2028 if mining continues at its current pace there will likely be another bitcoin halving in 2028 here are some quick answers to common questions about bitcoin halving john csiszar

look for twitter this is nightmare scenario and now the stock is going to be under pressure with the must deal done because this is gonna be clear headwinds going forward employee turnover advertiser issues and really credibility i think it s gonna be viewed at least in the near term damaged goods from public market perspective airing dirty laundry in public in the courts in delaware i mean that s really gonna be i think for all the world to see now if it s 5 or less which twitter has claimed then ultimately they re proven right must likely has to pay some punitive damages including the breakup faith and twitter really ultimately wins in that situation problem is is that if this starts to ultimately cascade and the twitter body issue is much bigger and that comes out in court i think that really calls into question lot of issues about the business model modernization and others and that s why from twitter board perspective backs against the wall and the last thing they ever wanted to be was in court proceeding with the richest person in the world twitter legally could force sale to go through i think if you could historically likely it s in some sort of settlement but but no doubt i mean twitter is gonna sharpen the knives going in advertisement twitter s legal team calls elon musk s attempt to exit acquisition deal invalid and wrongful share copy link copy elon musk wants to cancel his deal to buy twitter but the social media company is having none of it on friday musk moved to terminate the 44 billion acquisition agreement alleging that twitter breached the deal by failing to hand over data he says he needs to evaluate the number of bots and spam accounts on the platform twitter s legal representatives hit back in a letter to musk s lawyers sunday calling the billionaire s claims invalid and demanding that musk follow through with the takeover mr musk s and the other musk parties purported termination is invalid and wrongful and it constitutes a repudiation of their obligations under the agreement reads the letter which was signed william savit a lawyer at wachtell rosen lipton and katz which is representing twitter in the dispute the letter was disclosed in a regulatory filing monday musk has for weeks expressed concerns without any apparent evidence that there are a greater number of bots and spam accounts on the platform than twitter has said publicly in his friday letter his lawyer alleged that twitter has not complied with its contractual obligations to provide musk with sufficient data to evaluate the issue despite having handed over its firehose of tweets on the platform in its monday response the twitter team said that twitter has breached none of its obligations and alleged instead that musk has knowingly intentionally willfully and materially breached the agreement it added that twitter has and will continue to provide information reasonably requested by musk to close the transaction the agreement is not terminated the bank debt commitment letter and the equity commitment letter remain in effect and twitter demands that mr musk and the other musk parties comply with their obligations under the agreement the letter states unless musk backs down or a settlement is reached the dispute appears almost certain to end up in court following musk s announcement that he wanted to exit the deal twitter board chair bret taylor said in a tweet friday that the board is committed to closing the transaction on the price and terms agreed upon with mr musk and plans to pursue legal action to enforce the merger agreement we are confident we will prevail in the delaware court of chancery taylor added it does not appear that a formal suit has yet been filed meanwhile twitter stock tanked on the news of the dispute closing down more than 11 on monday nearly 40 below musk s deal price suggesting deep skepticism about the deal going through many analysts have suggested that musk may be trying to use the bot issue as a pretext to get out of a deal that appears overpriced in light of the recent market downturn tesla shares which musk is planning to use in part to finance the deal have also fallen in recent weeks
the company s war with elon musk has only just begun what happened so the elon musk twitter twtr deal is apparently moot and the company s stock suffered for it on monday on friday afternoon the tesla tsla 5 59 ceo disclosed in a regulatory filing that he aimed to withdraw from the arrangement and investors promptly traded the stock down by more than 11 the following trading day so what tech stocks have been out of favor with investors lately and musk s attempted retreat isn t helping boost sentiment on twitter while many correctly speculated that the mercurial tesla leader wouldn t go through with his 44 billion play for the micro messaging company others clearly believed in it that s why the company s share price spiked when news of the offer hit the headlines in late april musk s pull out is ostensibly happening because the company didn t provide enough information for his side to make an independent assessment of the prevalence of fake or spam accounts on twitter s platform as stated in a letter to the company cited in the regulatory filing for its part twitter denies it was in breach of its arrangement with musk it said it aims to file a lawsuit in delaware s chancery court as per the terms of the deal to force the businessman to follow through with the acquisition now what this means that twitter is going to have to marshal at least some time effort and resources on battling musk not only in the courtroom but in the ever critical court of public opinion the company has always had shakier finances and more struggles with profitability than many other top tech titles and this current brouhaha probably won t help it s understandable that investors bailed from the stock on monday
triblive s daily and weekly email newsletters deliver the news you want and information you need right to your inbox crunch time has finally arrived for president joe biden s economic agenda as congressional democrats scramble for a deal on a slimmed down version of what was once a multi trillion dollar overhaul of domestic policy the senate aims to pass the revised package before its summer recess begins aug 8 a move that would line up a win for democrats defending their slim congressional control ahead of november s midterm elections democrats appear to have learned from last year when progressives and the white house tried to force holdout senator joe manchin to accept a bill of up to 6 trillion they later scaled it down to 2 2 trillion but the moderate west virginian whose vote is pivotal in the 50 50 senate ended up walking away this time senate majority leader chuck schumer has worked closely with manchin to reach agreement on prescription drug price cuts and extending medicare s solvency more contentious details on energy spending and tax provisions aren t finalized between the two senators but democrats hope to unveil deals on those this week the new bill is expected to raise about 1 trillion in revenue half of which would be used on new spending and half on cutting the deficit over a 10 year period to pass the bill by a simple majority using the budget process all 50 members of the senate democratic caucus will need to be present and vote for the legislation but the fragility of the democrats majority was highlighted in late june when senator patrick leahy of vermont broke his hip his office says the 82 year old democrat will be available to vote as soon as this week but it s unclear whether he could withstand the hours long late night voting typical of the budget process meanwhile another holdout arizona senator kyrsten sinema hasn t publicly signed on to the potential plan there s also no guarantee of passage in the house where democrats can afford few defections many progressives there could balk at a bill that has shrunk from the 10 trillion social plan they once envisioned how the biden budget reconciliation bill shakes out will influence what else congress can accomplish before the midterms here is the status of the components of the democratic agenda health care the two pieces of the budget bill that senate democrats have negotiated so far drug pricing and raising taxes on the wealthy to extend the solvency of medicare have the best prospects for passage in the coming weeks as long as the senate s parliamentarian concludes that they comply with stringent budget rules the drug bill would allow medicare to negotiate the prices of some drugs generating substantial savings for the government and cap out of pocket costs for seniors at 2 000 per year the medicare piece would require so called pass through businesses to pay a 3 8 health surcharge on some income democrats also want to shoehorn into the package an extension of expanded subsidies for obamacare premiums that would avoid the cost of some plans tripling in january when the enlarged subsidies phase out an issue that would certainly turn off some middle class voters ahead of the midterms separately schumer has decided to hold a vote soon on a bipartisan measure that would cap monthly out of pocket insulin costs for those on medicare and with private health insurance at 35 energy items the house in november passed a bill with 550 billion in funding for climate related initiatives the senate is looking to pare that back to appease manchin on the possible chopping block are direct pay subsidies to renewable energy firms and expanded tax credits for the purchase of electric vehicles the final package is expected to include some kind of fee on methane emissions from oil and gas operations democratic senator tom carper of delaware said manchin also continues to press the administration to fast track permitting for fossil fuels tax reform a 15 corporate minimum tax on so called book profits is expected to make it into the budget package but negotiations continue on a 15 global minimum tax and a surtax for high earners so far it s unclear how democrats will deal with demands by a key group of house members for lifting the 10 000 cap on the federal deduction for state and local taxes salt that change would benefit voters in high tax states like new jersey new york and california democrats including new jersey s josh gottheimer have said their votes hinge on lifting the salt cap revenue in the current proposal also comes from expanded funding for tax audits and a 1 tax on stock buybacks a so called millionaires surtax however is on the verge of being cut from the package china competition a bipartisan bill aimed at boosting u s industrial competitiveness against china and investing in the domestic semiconductor industry is in jeopardy after senate minority leader mitch mcconnell said he would block it because democrats are now pushing the reconciliation bill to ram through biden s economic agenda democrats are exploring options to get around the mcconnell blockade including the house simply passing the version of the china bill that the senate passed last year it s unclear however whether there are enough votes fiscal 2023 spending the oct 1 start of the coming fiscal year is approaching and congress is far from completing the necessary annual federal spending bills the house plans to pass a package of six bills the week of july 18 but it s almost certain the federal government will require a stopgap continuing resolution come october since senate republicans don t support the house bills the house s 1 6 trillion top line spending level is sure to change given bipartisan support for higher military spending in the face of high inflation and the fresh security challenges posed by russia s ukraine invasion a push by democrats to allow taxpayer funding for abortions in the wake of the supreme court ruling overturning roe vs wade could make talks with the gop difficult antitrust policy the senate s tentative plans for a july vote on a bipartisan antitrust measure risks getting pushed into september or beyond given the focus on the biden economic agenda the legislation would bar major online companies from favoring their own service over those of rivals who use their platforms amazon inc alphabet inc s google apple inc and meta platforms inc the companies most likely to be affected by proposed legislation have spent millions of dollars lobbying against it the bill has support from a wide range of lawmakers as well as smaller tech companies like yelp match group and spotify defense policy the house this week will vote on the annual defense authorization bill which calls for a 37 billion boost to the national security budget above biden s request but appropriators would need to sign off on it in order for the higher level of spending to come into effect the senate armed services committee s version of the policy bill authorized a 45 billion increase the senate likely won t take up the defense bill until at least september and it could become a vehicle for elements of the stalled china competition bill
the topic of housing wasn t even on the agenda for lawmakers in arlington county but residents streamed into one recent meeting with a sea of posters to express their dueling views on the issue save our neighborhood no upzoning one sign read in our neighborhood density means diversity another declared one group near the front insisted that arlington is for everyone a few rows back the arlington way has gone astray at one point a few people leaving the room repeatedly shouted no upzoning that raucous meeting offered a taste of what promises to be one of the most contentious political battles in recent memory in arlington a proposal to legalize missing middle housing from townhouses to duplexes to eight unit buildings that many are treating as an existential debate over the future of this affluent deep blue northern virginia suburb advertisement the draft framework which county lawmakers will begin taking up tuesday would do away with single family zoning across arlington a county of 240 000 that sits on the doorstep of the nation s capital it is a product of a years long study on how these medium density homes might expand the housing supply in an increasingly expensive metropolitan area at the end of the day the question is should we legalize forms of housing other than one house on one lot in about 80 percent of the county katie cristol d the county board chair said in an interview but in a county where different neighborhoods can sometimes feel like different worlds quiet tree lined streets in some areas and bustling high rises near metro stations in others it s a question that has residents preparing for battle as in other communities around the region and across the country potential changes to single family zoning have sharply divided residents who see wildly divergent consequences for their neighborhoods longtime arlington homeowners who moved here decades ago fear that greater density would take away the tree canopy that attracted them to the area while crowding roads and schools and potentially leading to higher taxes other community advocates many of them renters argue that the plan would lower skyrocketing housing prices and accommodate the growing number of residents in the d c metro area advertisement civic groups have already traded barbs on the role of developers how much do they stand to benefit the question of parking minimums are they necessary and the impact on the lowest income residents will they be helped or displaced ahead of a county work session tuesday some groups are sounding an alarm saying major changes have been rushed through without sufficient input the vast majority of homeowners have absolutely no idea that there is such a proposal and they have absolutely no idea what it might mean for them said peter rousselot a leader of the group arlingtonians for our sustainable future and a condo owner in virginia square an online feedback survey launched by county staff is not an objective approach to something that is so profoundly different to the way arlington has developed until now his group has taken to labeling tuesday as d day urging the county board to delay any formal discussion without a more robust effort to measure public opinion and forecast the effect of more housing and more residents on arlington s budget advertisement jane green president of the yimbys of northern virginia which supports greater density said there s no reason to further delay the process while the draft framework was released at the end of april it is the latest phase of a broader effort by county planners since fall 2020 to study different housing types and draw feedback from thousands of arlington residents on the topic share this article share we re in a housing crisis we need more homes said green who rents a two bedroom apartment in the radnor fort myer heights neighborhood so let s do everything we can to allow more homes that builders want to build arlington has a proud history of careful suburban planning and it has for decades operated under one guiding principle development and growth belong around a few high density corridors tapering off into the single family homes and green lawns that occupy the vast majority of the county advertisement but as major companies and more residents have moved to arlington and housing prices have shot up county planners have sought to reconsider whether existing land use policies are the best fit for this former bedroom community other jurisdictions across the country have already taken steps toward a similar goal portland ore and minneapolis have relaxed their zoning laws in recent years to allow for the construction of more townhouses and duplexes across the potomac river in montgomery county md county planners are considering similar changes as an explicit way to promote racial equity at the federal level president biden is pushing a 10 billion plan that would incentivize states and localities to relax single family zoning laws the extraordinarily high cost of housing in northern virginia the average price of a detached single family home in arlington was more than 1 2 million in december as well as unusually large lot sizes means that the county s framework could be one of the most transformative zoning changes nationwide advertisement to achieve lower home prices amid a hot real estate market county planners are pushing for a level of density unusual for many suburbs eight plexes small buildings divided into eight apartments could be built by right avoiding red tape costly approval processes and potential pushback from neighbors what that may look like is likely to be amended in greater detail over the coming months the current draft framework dictates that any structure must not be bigger than whatever is allowed by right as a single family house and the lot size would determine the maximum number of units on a given property so six plexes and eight plexes would generally be allowed only on larger lots of at least 12 000 square feet cristol said the county will create additional engagement opportunities in particular for residents to speak with one another about their diverse experiences as renters and homeowners as planners revise the draft framework and shape it into draft ordinances advertisement but as she vows to see through some sort of zoning overhaul by the end of her one year term as chair in december some clashes are likely to lie ahead when some critics at the meeting in june interrupted her and began booing she attempted in vain to shush the crowd instead it was county board member libby garvey d who managed to grab the audience s attention offering a booming rebuke excuse me excuse me can everyone please behave garvey said you may be seeing how people behave elsewhere in this country and across the river yelling and screaming has never been a way to solve problems

energy companies saw the biggest losses since ipo the median value of shares was only 71 77 of their ipo value and the report shows they do not hold the best long term opportunities for investors the report reveals real estate had the highest market capitalisation in uk and hong kong markets and there s huge scope for investors within this sector looking to expand their portfolios february 2022

brokerage solutions provider has revealed which sectors and have seen the best result following ipos and how this reflects in where investors should look to invest in the future ig prime looked at companies listed on nasdaq and nyse in the us as well as the london stock exchange in the uk and the stock exchange of hong kong and compared performance of ipos across sectors over time since launch and the location of the company key takeaways for investors in the us and uk markets shares that gained greater value over the long term often suffered in the short term suggesting that investors need to be consistent and patient to see a return with both us and uk exchanges showing decreasing value for the energy sector it seems that investors may wish to maintain caution when reviewing energy ipo options real estate had the highest market capitalisation in the uk market and chinese real estate within hong kong while not necessarily the best investment for share value there is definitely profitable return within this market and scope to explore how these could positively contribute to a portfolio the research indicates that in the long term companies are more likely to see steady growth using ipos as those that went public in the past are now worth more in comparison with their original share price chinese regulation the recent tensions from us and chinese regulators has meant the market is shifting from chinese influence towards an interest by the us stock exchanges in south east asian markets with the risk of interference by chinese and us regulators chinese listings have become more scarce but nasdaq remains optimistic seeing the entire region as ripe for ipo activity however time will tell whether the most recent years reflect the us and chinese descrepincies in the performance of funds spacs the spac special purpose acquisition company has been booming recently with deals in 2021 within the us jumping 6 5 but there is concern over how long term this will be as investors rush to bid analysis has also shown it s not a sustainable investment for growth and near universally it sees negative returns currently spacs don t appear to be slowing the rate of ipos instead there is rapid investment in both upcoming ipos this year the us digital banking business chime and vegan friendly meat impossible were valued at 25 billion and 4 billion according to forbes meaning investors should watch out for ipos within this space burger king zopa and monzo have also been talking around the idea of ipo listings sometime in 2022 following the financial conduct authority relaxation of listing rules us ipos as of 24th january 2022 363 future ipos are listed for the us market with nearly 5 billion shares in total recorded to be offered generally these companies saw growth since their ipo and this was reflected in their median share prices which sat at 102 61 of the value they possessed when initially launched the sector that saw the greatest growth across the nyse and nasdaq was the broad area of basic industries this covers the discovery development and trade of raw materials used in other industries the share prices stood at a median of 160 38 of their original value this compared to the sector that suffered the most energy including coal mining and consumer electronics in which the median value of shares was only 71 77 of their ipo value the strongest performing state listed on us exchanges for companies since ipo was vermont us where the median share value of companies sat at 483 83 of their value at ipo this was followed by iowa us where the share value stood at 358 72 of their ipo value london ipos companies listed on the london stock exchange saw marginally higher returns overall than their counterparts in the us with median share prices at 104 73 of their ipo value in january 2022 there were six new listings on the lse the median number of companies curated per year since 2000 is 2 5 indicating there has been an influx

annuities at their core are simply tax deferred investments sold by insurance companies to supplement financial security during retirement at the same time there are many different types of annuities that make annuities more complex as a result americans may be scared of annuities when considering their financial goals with that said one of the most frequent questions people have regarding annuities is what happens to my principal well here s what you need to know get our activist investing case study get the full activist investing study in pdf q2 2022 hedge fund letters conferences

financial goals get started now what is annuity principal one of the main concerns of many retirees is running out of money in fact this is the top concern for almost half of americans thankfully purchasing an annuity can prevent this from happening how by securing your investment and providing a guaranteed lifetime income stream as a condition of this you promise to abide by specific rules these include when you ll start getting payments your annual withdrawal amount what penalties apply when you withdraw your principal in short the purpose of annuities isn t really to grow your money they re more of an income protection product and the principal plays an integral your annuity principal is the money you pay when you buy it some of these payments are made in one lump sum but most are made in a series of monthly contributions the annuity principal is invested for the annuitant and because of this it forms the basis of payments they start receiving after the first withdrawal but can you actually lose your principal well that depends annuities 101 there are two kinds of annuities immediate and deferred moreover you can buy either a fixed fixed indexed or variable annuity with deferred annuities principals are affected differently by each of these options as such to protect your retirement investment and to start you need to understand how annuities treat the principal immediate annuities owners of immediate annuities pay one lump sum to get a stream of income right away it lasts a specified number of years or for the remainder of the annuitant s life you can t cancel or adjust an immediate annuity once bought the reason payments begin as soon as the annuity is purchased they can be paid monthly quarterly or yearly by annuity companies therefore the insurance company absorbs the principal paid into the contract to pay operating expenses and invest in maintaining the income for a long time to come some annuity companies offer a product called a principal income annuity this is nothing more than an income annuity for those who don t know this is a contract that pays you an income right away income annuities are immediately annuitized after being fully funded providing either a fixed period of time or lifetime payments the payments cannot change after being annuitized also known as a single premium immediate annuity this is usually purchased with a lump sum premium people who are retired or getting close to retirement typically buy this type of annuity deferred annuities the cash value of a deferred annuity grows over time this is because whenever the owner pays premiums the principal value increases and the cash value increases the reason is that they will have time to grow before you start getting paid if you liquidate an annuity the principal amount is usually guaranteed as such any penalties or fees won t affect the principal the same is not true however for variable annuities in mutual fund subaccounts owners invest premiums due to the fact these accounts are unguaranteed the principal fluctuates with each mutual fund change some companies offer a principal deferred annuity the benefit of this plan is that you pay a lump sum or make regular installments over time in exchange you ll receive a guaranteed income for a specific period of time or the rest of your lifetime in addition you won t have to worry about market fluctuations with deferred income annuities the downside those funds are no longer accessible fixed annuities you can t lose either your principal or any interest you ve accumulated if you buy a fixed annuity you can t lose either your principal or any interest you ve accumulated if you buy a fixed annuity fixed indexed annuities with a fixed indexed annuity the insurance company guarantees your principal won t be lost also every year on the anniversary of your purchase your gains are locked in known as an annual reset which becomes the starting point for the following year you re still going to get your interest because the index value is reset annually so if the index drops in the future it won t affect your interest with a fixed indexed annuity the insurance company guarantees your principal won t be lost also every year on the anniversary of your purchase your gains are locked in known as an annual reset which becomes the starting point for the following year you re still going to get your interest because the index value is reset annually so if the index drops in the future it won t affect your interest variable annuities the downside of variable annuities is that neither your principal nor investment gains are protected in a variable annuity your money is invested such as in mutual funds according to the performance of those investments your annuity s value changes qualified vs non qualified annuities annuities are either qualified or non qualified but what s the difference with qualified annuities the principal is pretax and grows deferred the annuity gets taxed when it is withdrawn and the premiums can also be deducted from taxes in a non qualified annuity the principal is the base you earn from however after tax premiums will not be taxed after distribution because of that premiums are not deductible so while the earnings can grow tax deferred they will be taxed when they re distributed losing your principal it may be odd to think you could lose money with an annuity considering that they re marketed as special guaranteed investments specifically designed to protect us from that outcome writes jordan bishop in a previous due article this is a rather common misconception however because not all annuities are the same and not all of them come with the same level of principal protection even so annuities are generally considered to be safer than other types of investments for retirement however this depends on the type of annuity you purchase the contract you enter and the financial strength of the insurer issuing the annuity in short it s still possible to lose money specifically your principal in the following scenarios you own a variable annuity deferred and immediate variable annuities don t protect your principal and don t guarantee how much you ll be paid however since they invest your savings in stocks and bonds they base the income on market performance deferred and immediate variable annuities don t protect your principal and don t guarantee how much you ll be paid however since they invest your savings in stocks and bonds they base the income on market performance if you die sooner than expected you can lose money on fixed income annuities the principal for fixed income annuities is calculated to last as long as the holder s average life expectancy so if you die early then you ll lose the unpaid portion the principal for fixed income annuities is calculated to last as long as the holder s average life expectancy so if you die early then you ll lose the unpaid portion inflation increases money today isn t worth what it was ten fifteen or twenty years ago because inflation makes today s money less valuable than it used to be money today isn t worth what it was ten fifteen or twenty years ago because inflation makes today s money less valuable than it used to be early withdrawals if you have a deferred annuity and tap into it before the surrender period you ll have to pay a surrender charge in addition if you do this before age 59 ½ the irs will impose a 10 penalty if you have a deferred annuity and tap into it before the surrender period you ll have to pay a surrender charge in addition if you do this before age 59 ½ the irs will impose a 10 penalty the insurance company goes under if the insurance company goes bankrupt you won t get your money back frequently asked questions how much does an annuity cost the minimum to open a new contract is usually 5 000 but there are some annuities you can buy for 100 a month and unlike other retirement plans like 401 k s and iras there are no contribution limits is annuity income truly guaranteed annuities can offer many choices for guaranteed income notes craig hawley head of nationwide advisory solutions among these are the simplicity of an immediate annuity to a range of different optional living benefit riders that are designed to protect portfolio assets or income payments when markets decline depending on the investments living benefits can provide a guaranteed income regardless of performance a guarantee on the initial investment is another way to protect yourself against market risk besides getting a return on premium because annuities are contracts with an insurance company the payment guarantee is up to the insurance company insurance companies are highly regulated with strict requirements related to their investments and capital reserves adds hawley their financial strength is regularly reviewed and rated by five independent firms a m best fitch kroll bond rating agency kbra moody s and standard poor s each with their own rating scale and rating standards there are also guaranty associations in every state that protect policyholders if an insurance company goes belly up a study by the u s government accountability office determined that even following the profound effects of the 2008 financial crisis the impact on the majority of insurance companies and their policyholders was limited with a few exceptions he states how do guaranteed principal annuities work all your money is guaranteed to be repaid to you someday by the insurance company you ll get your money back if you invest in a variable annuity and lose money fixed annuities however work much better this is because your account doesn t fluctuate so the insurance company just returns your money with a bit of interest as for indexed annuities there are return restrictions moreover the minimum guaranteed rate of return on indexed annuities doesn t cover all your premiums the minimum guaranteed by most states is 87 5 of the principal plus 1 to 3 interest in addition this principal protection only applies if you hold the annuity to maturity if you use a variable annuity you ll have to pay the price for guaranteed principal protection annuities usually come with an add on or rider that supercharges your annuity the rider costs more maybe 0 65 percent more per year in addition you have to wait 5 10 years before taking advantage of most guaranteed principal protection programs what is annuitization annuitization is the process of turning a lump sum of money into a guaranteed stream of income payments for life explains jordan bishop in a previous due article when you annuitize an annuity you essentially convert your account balance into an income stream you can do this for a set period of time like a decade or a lifetime annuities can be either immediate or deferred an immediate annuity pays out income right away while a deferred annuity allows you to grow your account balance over time before receiving income payments he adds in other words with a deferred annuity you are deferring the income payments until a later date this may make you think ok so that means that i can only annuitize deferred annuities because immediate annuities are immediately annuitized right even with immediate annuities you can decide whether or not to annuitize this is true even for vanilla annuities those without contract riders however with deferred annuities you have to choose what date you re going to defer payments to moreover annuitizing means you lose access to your principal mainly because it s pooled with the other annuitants saving the only way to regain some of this cash value is to sell future income payments at a discount you re losing money if you do that what happens to the principal when you die now we get to the question on everyone s mind what if i annuitize and die in a month does the annuity return any of the principal unfortunately it s not that simple that depends on what options you picked when you bought the annuity simple lifetime payout the payments end when you the annuitant die the payments end when you the annuitant die joint and survivor lifetime payout so long as one of the people on the annuity is alive the insurance company keeps paying there is a possibility that the payment will decrease after the first death in either case the second person continues to receive payments until they pass so long as one of the people on the annuity is alive the insurance company keeps paying there is a possibility that the payment will decrease after the first death in either case the second person continues to receive payments until they pass lifetime payout with period certain the scenarios above can be mitigated how by adding a period certain to your payout that option guarantees payments for at least as long as the fixed period of your lifetime what if you die before the term ends your beneficiaries will get your principal back the scenarios above can be mitigated how by adding a period certain to your payout that option guarantees payments for at least as long as the fixed period of your lifetime what if you die before the term ends your beneficiaries will get your principal back lifetime with a refund there s also a refund option the insurance company pays your beneficiaries the remaining principal but that means smaller payments there s also a refund option the insurance company pays your beneficiaries the remaining principal but that means smaller payments period certain only the payments end after a set number of years even if you re still alive the insurer doesn t base the payments on your life expectancy as such you ll usually get your money back article by john rampton due about the

new york wall street got back to slumping monday to kick off a week full of updates about how bad inflation is and how corporate profits are handling it the s p 500 fell 1 2 and gave up the majority of its gains from the prior week the dow jones industrial average slipped 0 5 and the nasdaq composite dropped 2 3 stocks of smaller companies were some of the biggest losers with the russell 2000

the larger losses in the s p 500 twitter lost even more 11 3 in the first trading after billionaire elon musk said he wants out of his deal to buy the social media platform for 44 billion twitter said it will take musk to court to uphold the agreement advertisement other big technology companies were also particularly weak it s a continuation of this year s trend where rising rates most hurt the investments that soared highest earlier in the pandemic the struggles pulled the nasdaq down 262 71 points to close at 11 372 60 the s p 500 dropped 44 95 to 3 854 43 and the dow dipped 164 31 to 31

investments seen as holding up better in a downturn it remains below the two year treasury yield which fell to 3 07 such a thing doesn t occur often and some investors see it as a sign that a recession may hit in the next year or two other warning signals in the bond market that some see as more reliable which focus on shorter term yields still aren t flashing but they also are showing less optimism regardless of whether a recession is imminent investors likely need to brace for much more volatile markets than they ve become accustomed to over the last 40 years strategists at blackrock said monday for decades an era of great moderation smoothed out swings in economic growth and inflation and rewarded investors for buying the dip whenever prices dropped now with production constraints driving inflation higher heavy debt levels weighing on economies and the hyper politicization of everything affecting policy decisions blackrock strategists say they re expecting more volatility and shorter time periods between recessions advertisement the goldilocks option is now off the table where stocks and bonds can rise in concert said wei li global chief investment strategist at blackrock investment institute the blackrock strategists say they prefer stocks over bonds for the long term but that they re nevertheless shying away from stocks for the next six to 12 months one reason is that profit margins for companies are at risk of falling from their historically high levels companies this week are set to begin reporting how their profits fared during the spring big banks and other financial companies dominate the early part of the schedule with jpmorgan chase and morgan stanley set for thursday blackrock citigroup and wells fargo are among those reporting on friday expectations for second quarter results seem to be low analysts are forecasting 4 3 growth for companies across the s p 500 which would be the weakest since the end of 2020 according to factset even if companies end up reporting better results than expected which is usually the case analysts say the heavier focus will be on what ceos say about their profit trends for later in the year the roughly 19 drop for the s p 500 this year has been due entirely to rising interest rates and changes in how much investors are willing to pay for each 1 of a company s profit so far expectations for corporate profits have not come down much if they do that could lead to another leg downward for stocks advertisement many on wall street expect those expectations to come down the recent rise of the u s dollar against other currencies adds another challenge to companies already contending with high inflation and potentially weakening demandaccording to michael wilson equity strategist at morgan stanley one euro is worth close to 1 now down 15 from a year earlier for example that means sales made in euros may be worth fewer dollars than before the main point for equity investors is that this dollar strength is just another reason to think earnings revisions are coming down over the next few earnings seasons wilson wrote in a report beyond earnings updates reports

twitter says its 44 billion sale to elon musk is still on and it will go to court to make it happen despite the mercurial billionaire s declaration he is breaking it off the agreement is not terminated twitter s lawyers wrote in aletter to the tesla and spacex ceo on sunday disclosed in a filing on monday musk knowingly intentionally willfully and materially breached his agreement to buy the company they alleged twitter reserves all contractual legal and other rights including its right to specifically enforce the musk parties obligations under the agreement they wrote back in april musk launched a surprise bid tobuy twitter for 54 20 a share which the social media company initially resisted beforeaccepting musk has accused twitter of violating the sale agreement which he argued gives him grounds to walk away without paying a 1 billion penalty it all sets twitter and musk up for a lengthy and expensive legal battle in the delaware court of chancery which deals with corporate disputes the only sure winners in this situation are the lawyers said joseph grundfest a law professor at stanford and former commissioner at the securities and exchange commission because a lot of money is going to be spent litigating this question twitter will seek to force musk to go through with the deal legal experts say twitter has a strong case the agreement they signed includes a clause that allows twitter to sue to force musk to buy the company that means he promised to buy the company for a price well he d better show up and buy the company for that price grundfest said courts have forced buyers to complete deals even after they ve gotten cold feet in 2001 tyson foods tried to back out of an agreement to buy a meat processor after raising questions about its business but the delaware court ordered it to go through with the purchase forcing musk to buy twitter hinges on his financing for the deal remaining in place musk is on the hook to pay 33 5 billion himself and has lined up 13 billion in loans from banks one key question is will musk s declaration that he wants out of the deal cause the banks to change their minds the court could order musk to pay damages instead even though there is precedent to force a buyer to complete a deal donna hitscherich a professor at columbia business school said the court may be reluctant to do so typically the court is going to put the parties in the position they were in before the unhappy events occurred she said in that case the court might not order musk to buy twitter but could stick him with billions of dollars in damages while that would likely amount to less than the 44 billion musk agreed to pay it would avoid the awkward situation of forcing musk to buy a company he says he no longer wants to own musk has shown little interest in following legal orders after the sec fined him and tesla 40 million in 2018 over his claims he had funding secured to take the electric carmaker private the regulator said a lawyer needed to vet his tweets musk has been accused of violating that order and he s now trying to get his 2018 settlement with the sec thrown out musk will argue that twitter broke their agreement in his letter friday to twitter saying he was terminating the purchase musk accused the company of making false and misleading representations about its estimates of how many accounts on the platform are fake or spam he also accused twitter of refusing to share information that would help him verify its estimates and of violating other parts of the legal agreement while musk initially cited cleaning up twitter s longstanding problem of spam accounts and automated bots as a reason he wanted to buy the company in recent weeks he s flipped he now cites the issue as his rationale for backing out of the deal musk says he thinks the prevalence of fake and spam accounts on the platform is far higher than the 5 twitter estimates twitter has said it uses private data to make those estimates so they can t be easily replicated by outsiders legal experts say even if twitter s figures were incorrect that would probably not be a big enough problem to get musk out of his agreement to buy the company that s a pretty heavy lift said hitscherich there has to be something very very significant in the business for the courts to say you know what you re right the very nature of this contract has changed so substantially that you don t have to go through with it pressure could mount for a settlement many deal disputes end with a settlement involving a price cut that s what happened in 2020 when the luxury conglomerate lvmh moët hennessy louis vuitton tried to scupper an agreement to buy jewelry icon tiffany company but ultimately went through with the purchase at a 425 million discount accepting less than 54 20 a share from musk could open twitter up to lawsuits from unhappy shareholders still a settlement could spare both sides from further headaches and reputational damage some have speculated that musk has wanted to buy twitter for a lower price all along since he agreed to the deal global markets have fallen with tech stocks hit especially hard that s made a 44 billion price tag for twitter look more expensive even as the value of tesla shares musk s main source of wealth have plummeted it s hard to see twitter emerging from the legal battle as a winner even if it s a victor in court a protracted legal battle would weigh on the company morale has already taken a hit since the deal was announced some employees are wary of musk s potential ownership and the changes he s floated to protect his vision of free speech meanwhile twitter has been cutting costs including implementing a hiring freeze and even laying off some employees as it seeks to strengthen its business amid a weakening online advertising market no matter who ends up owning it a courtroom drama would cast a further cloud of uncertainty over the company how long do you want to go through with this hitscherich said you re taking your eye off the business everything that takes your eye off the business is an issue copyright 2022 npr to see more visit
house democrats aided by some republicans are using the pending 2023 defense bill to subordinate the careers of u s professionals to the interests of investors and fortune 500 executives the proposed amendment to the 2023 national defense authorization act would allow any alien with a claimed ph d in science to apply for a green card from the secretary of homeland security a position alejandro mayorkas currently holds the amendment sets the bar for migrants so low that it provides green cards to an unlimited number of indian chinese and other foreigners who earn degrees in their home country universities foreigners who get u s degrees from a lower tier historically black college or university in the united states would also be allowed to get green cards the amendment would also expand an existing law that allows u s ceos to hire foreign graduates with dangled promises of green cards that law is now used by executives to reward roughly 70 000 foreign graduates for taking jobs from u s professionals the three cornered amendment would allow government officials to flood the labor market and so suppress salaries for american professionals it would even make it more difficult for the professionals children to get places in good universities this is the kind of that when reported as the supporters are framing it sounds plausible enough said mark krikorian director of the center for immigration studies but he added there is literally no way that it would be limited it just cannot happen over and over and over again we ve seen immigration proposals that sound plausible on their face end up being perverted there ll be a guy who has a phd in economics and say well this is a stem field so okay and then there ll be a phd in home economics and they ll say well okay you too there s no way they ll limit it the democrat party is increasingly reliant on votes from white collar professionals yet it keeps trying to outsource their jobs to migrants said kevin lynn founder of u s tech workers what they re signaling is there is no place for professionals in the democratic party they re literally voting the professionals out of the party and replacing them with immigrants that can t vote the outsourcing amendment is being pushed by democrat reps zoe lofgren d ca and jim langevin d ri and by republican reps john curtis r ut and peter meijer r mi lofgren represents the investors in silicon valley who use visa workers to spike the stock value of their companies meijer is an heir of the wealthy meijer fortune he is facing a stiff primary challenge this year after already voting for a 2021 plan to massively increase the inflow of cheap blue collar migrants into jobs held by american residents of rural districts that cheap labor policy impoverishes rural districts because the migrants earn little and buy much less in local shops and communities the democrat run committee on rules will decide tuesday afternoon whether or not to allow the amendment and other migration related amendments to stay in the bill if they keep the lofgren measure it will pressure all democrats to publicly vote on the house floor against the core economic and civic interests of their professional class voters the committee is chaired by rep jim mcgovern d ma and it includes several pro migration democrats such as rep deborah ross d nc and rep joe neguse d co ross for example has drafted an amendment that would further reward indian graduates who take outsourced jobs from her home district american college graduate voters the reward would consist of guaranteed no cost green cards for their indian born children that government delivered reward is hugely valuable for indians so it serves as a hidden subsidy for the ceos who cheap indian graduates for jobs that can be done by american professionals in ross own district her giveaway amendment is backed by rep cindy axne d ia and gop rep brian patrick r pa another amendment would offer green cards to any russian with master s degrees in science and technology that amendment is being pushed by rep jackie speier d ca whose district includes part of silicon valley the gop minority on the rules committee is led by pro migration rep tom cole r ok but also includes rep michael burgess r tx the lofgren meijer amendment comes as west coast investors are lobbying congress to expand the inflow of foreign graduates for jobs that would otherwise go to u s professionals one of the leading investors is eric schmidt the former chairman of google he is now an investor who wants to maximize his supply of cheap controllable skilled labor in 2013 he helped form the secretive fwd us lobby group which consists of wealthy west coast investors such as bill gates and mark zuckerberg in 2015 schmidt called for the government to import more consumers for google s advertisers in 2020 schmidt demanded the importation of top tier talent to help u s companies outpace china s government aided companies many of which rely on chinese born u s trained workers however the visa worker programs cited by schmidt are mostly used by ceos to displace american professionals with inexperienced cheap and controllable foreign graduates from very low grade indian universities in 2022 schmidt pushed the claim that an uncapped inflow of foreign graduates is needed for national security jobs such as cyber security or for manufacturing computer chips that plan was added to an anti china technology bill by democratic leaders in the house but it has been rejected by gop senators principally sen chuck grassley r ia and sen todd young r in partly because the schmidt plan would sideline many professionals in their midwestern states this july schmidt is pushing two new claims via the london based financial times the first claim is that the foreign scientists will help launch a new industry in the united states eric schmidt former ceo of google became one of the wealthiest people in the us by specialising in software engineering yet if he was starting out again today schmidt says he would not be targeting bits and bytes alone the 67 year old thinks the next big thing is the bioeconomy not the internet one is the science has advanced more slowly than many hoped another is government regulation there s a more fundamental problem too whereas a couple of teenage computer nerds can build an internet company out of a garage creating a bioscience business requires lots of expertise specialised talent manufacturing plant capacity and time these are not things that the us venture capital industry that funded the tech revolution is widely used to handling however there is no shortage of trained u s college graduates with science technology engineering or math stem degrees a 2021 study by the census bureau reported that most work in non tech jobs the vast majority 62 of college educated workers who majored in a stem field were employed in non stem fields such as non stem management law education social work accounting or counseling in addition 10 of stem college graduates worked in stem related occupations such as health care the path to stem jobs for non stem majors was narrow only a few stem related majors 7 and non stem majors 6 ultimately ended up in stem occupations between 1982 and 2011 american universities awarded 800 000 ph d degrees in science and engineering lynn told breitbart news adding but there were only 100 000 tenured job openings this tells you there is a surplus of advanced stem degree holders in the u s as a result approximately one in five stem ph d s work in non stem non academic fields the joblessness rate among stem ph d s is only going to increase if immigration provisions ensure that anyone with a stem degree could come to the united states and get pushed to the front of the line but many u s technology graduates are pushed out of jobs by ceos preference for visa workers ceos prefer visa workers because their low salaries maximize stock prices and bonuses for example a brookings study said president donald trump s temporary 2020 curbs on visa workers cut 100 billion from the fortune 500 s stock value but those salary cuts caused by the employment of at least 1 5 million visa workers in the united states radiate into many other professional sectors most college graduates have actually seen their real incomes stagnate or even decline since 2000 new york times columnist paul krugman wrote in april 2022 executives also prefer visa workers because the foreign graduates cannot emulate the ability of u s professionals to form their own innovative companies that spur competition in the tech sector the visa workers cannot even quit not even complain about work hours or abuse because they need the ceos to approve green card applications it s imperative for policy makers to understand that foreign stem phd holders will not spur innovation said a june 9 letter by u s tech workers instead they ll keep innovation within the range of the status quo the executives also use the visa workers to subordinate demands by u s professionals that some company revenues be allocated to public priorities such as basic research information security crisis reliability and compliance with federal laws unsurprisingly companies that subordinate u s professionals tend to have more public disasters for example intel boeing theranos and ernst young faced with these congressional rejections schmidt and his lobbyists are also dangling the promise of high tech jobs to skeptical midwestern senators he told the july 6 financial times it s the new industrial age applied to the rural parts of america he told me noting that unlike current tech innovation these jobs are not in silicon valley and they re not in the north east they re in the republican states they re in the states with an awful lot of farming he hopes that the fact that these rural agricultural states tend to be red not blue gives his pitch bipartisan appeal since it will get republican politicians involved but top democrats aligned with president joe biden s east coast network openly oppose the displacement of u s graduates for example commerce secretary gine raimondo again spoke out fended off the pro migration push in an interview with nbc s chuck todd with respect to immigration you know that s an issue for congress to take up she said on july 10 schmidt and his fellow investors prefer to import foreign workers than to hire foreign graduates in their home countries regardless of the damage to u s professionals in general u s operations are less threatened by technology theft local rivals security failures and government regulations thes white collar migration amendments are more nails in the coffin of the professionals in the united states said lynn legislators and corporate lobbyists are stripping out that bottom rung and preventing americans from having careers in stem he said they know this is going on but the financial opportunities are just too great to not take advantage lynn said adding they re not rewarded by market share and productivity they re rewarded by earnings per share extraction migration since at least 1990 the d c establishment has extracted tens of millions of migrants and visa workers from poor countries to serve as legal or illegal workers temporary workers consumers and renters for various u s investors and ceos this federal economic policy of extraction migration has skewed the free market in the united states by inflating the labor supply for the benefit of employers the inflationary policy hurts ordinary americans because makes it difficult for them to get married advance in their careers raise families or buy homes extraction migration has also slowed innovation and shrunk americans productivity partly because it allows employers to boost stock prices by using cheap stoop labor instead of productivity boosting technology migration undermines employees workplace rights and it widens the regional wealth gaps between the democrats big coastal states and the republicans heartland and southern states the flood of cheap labor tilts the economy towards low productivity jobs and has shoved at least ten million american men out of the labor force

new york shares of twitter slid more than 6 in the first day of trading after billionaire elon musk said that he was abandoning his 44 billion bid for the company and the social media platform vowed to challenge musk in court to uphold the agreement twitter is now preparing to sue musk in delaware where the company is incorporated while the outcome is uncertain both sides are preparing for long court battle musk alleged friday that twitter has failed to provide enough information about the number of fake accounts it has however twitter said last month that it was making available to musk a fire hose of raw data on hundreds of millions of daily tweets when he raised the issue again after announcing that he would buy the social media platform twitter has said for years in regulatory filings that it believes about 5 of the accounts on the platform are fake but on monday musk continued to taunt the company using twitter over what he has described as a lack of data in addition musk is also alleging that twitter broke the agreement when it fired two top managers and laid off a third of its talent acquisition team musk agreed to a 1 billion breakup fee as part of the buyout agreement though it appears twitter ceo parag agrawal and the company are settling in for a legal fight to force the sale for twitter this fiasco is a nightmare scenario and will result in an everest like uphill climb for parag co to navigate the myriad challenges ahead around employee turnover morale advertising headwinds investor credibility around the fake account bot issues and host of other issues abound wedbush analyst dan ives who follows the company wrote monday the sell off in twitter shares pushed prices close to 34 each far from the 54 20 that musk agreed to pay for the company that suggests strongly that wall street has serious doubts that the deal will go forward while the outcome of any protracted legal battle cannot be known experts in the legal and business sectors believe twitter likely has a stronger case morningstar analyst ali mogharabi noted that regarding the spam user count musk is so focused on twitter has for years explicitly stated in regulatory filings that the below 5 spam count may not be accurate given that it is based on a sample and requires a lot of judgment given current market conditions mogharabi said twitter may also have a solid argument that the layoffs and firings of the past weeks represent an ordinary course of business many technology firms have begun to control costs by reducing headcount and or delaying adding employees he said the resignations of twitter employees cannot with certainty be attributed to any change in how twitter has operated since musk s offer was accepted by the board and shareholders tech industry analysts say musk s interlude leaves behind a more vulnerable company with demoralized employees with musk officially walking away from the deal we think business prospects and stock valuation are in a precarious situation wrote cfra analyst angelo zino twitter will now need to go at it as a standalone company and contend with an uncertain advertising market a damaged employee base and concerns about the status of fake accounts strategic direction the uncertainty surrounding twitter could also lead advertisers to curtail their spending on the platform mogharabi said but the drama surrounding the deal he added will also likely attract new users to the platform and increase engagement especially given the upcoming midterm elections which could convince advertisers to cut a bit less in the long run we think twitter will remain one of the top five social media platforms for advertisers

the highest award for ieee the medal of honor through this considerable history of success you re a serial entrepreneur you ve had exits you ve invented and created many many different kinds of technologies which you instantiated into research but also translated it into companies and then you are advising companies and investments and so on it s just really remarkable to have one person sit across all of these different domains so again thank you for coming in and first of all providing inflection points in your life that led to your remarkable history of success asad madni 00 36 stephen thank you actually i should be the one saying thank you looking at the outstanding and exemplary interviews that you have conducted with so many people and just the unique manner of the depth and breadth with which you conduct these interviews has been very inspiring so let me tell you that i am a fan of yours and so with that perhaps i should say in response to your question the digital revolution of late 1960s started defining architectures of next generation electronic systems and instrumentation the advent of semiconductor memories high speed and resolution analog to digital converters adcs and microprocessors offered capabilities that were not possible to realize with analog systems alone this coupled with electronic miniaturization and digital signal processing dsp techniques allowed systems to be smaller smarter cheaper and more reliable i had graduated from ucla with my undergraduate and graduate degrees in electrical sciences and engineering with specialization in electronic systems and was enthusiastically seeking creative challenges and employment where i could utilize my education in advancing my field in a significant way the opportunity arrived in 1975 when systron donner corporation s microwave division sdmd offered me a position as a project engineer to develop the company s first spectrum analyzer with digital storage display sd was one of 3 leading companies specializing in radio frequency rf and microwave components and instrumentation the other 2 being hp and tektronix the company s line of spectrum analyzers utilized the bulky expensive analog variable persistence storage tubes which had severe limitations including display flicker poor reliability and the inability to view multiple waveforms simultaneously i was promised a technician a junior engineer and an assembler who would be devoted solely to my project gullible as i was in those days i believed in receiving this support only to realize shortly thereafter that due to emergencies on other projects i would be the lone warrior championing this project in hindsight i believe that this was the greatest learning experience of my life not only did i end up designing and developing the world s first digital storage spectrum analyzer but i learnt the value of proper soldering circuit layout interface between analog and digital circuits noise reduction techniques and above all designing for cost this system replaced the analog storage tube with the recently introduced semiconductor random access memory based digital display this led to a revolution of features in spectrum analyzer capabilities including simultaneous viewing of multiple images adaptive sweep digital baseline clipper electronic cursor data normalization automatic bandwidth adjustment network analysis capabilities voice interaction etc it transformed the landscape of not only spectrum analysis but spawned a whole new era of low cost highly powerful digital based instrumentation including network analyzers sweep generators frequency synthesizers etc the innovations and resulting patents with me as the sole inventor were truly seminal they established a multi million dollar test and measurement market and the basis for powerful test and measurement capabilities that we enjoy today with this success i was now on my way to bigger challenges i will focus on 3 truly revolutionary technologies that i spearheaded and that were inflection points in my career stephen ibaraki 05 39 that s pretty remarkable the work that you did and you re coming in and creating and inventing new methods and utilizing the latest chip technologies let s continue the story of all of this innovation asad madni 06 03 1 0 world s first stand alone communications systems analyzer the analysis of communications systems comprised of transmission lines and antennas was considered complex and time consuming by the microwave industry for years when multiple faults impedance mismatches existed on a line it was impossible to accurately measure their severities due to line attenuation losses and power reflections from previous faults and locations using historical measurement techniques such as conventional reflectometers cr time domain reflectometers tdr and swept frequency techniques sf additionally each of these techniques were a paralyzed in the presence of in band external interfering signals b unable to separate harmonics from reflections due to equally spaced faults in general caused by connections between equal length waveguides or cables and c could not provide usable location accuracy when the transmission line was connected to an extremely narrow band antenna in the mid 1970 s the naval surface weapons center nswc dahlgren virginia established the combat readiness electromagnetic analysis and measurement cream program as part of this program nswc issued a rfp soliciting innovative solutions to provide an accurate and fast analysis of rf and microwave communication systems that included waveguides coaxial cables antennas and in certain cases directional couplers it was further mandated that the system operation and interpretation should be simplified to a point where an e 3 technician would be capable of performing the entire test reliably determine system faults and be able to fix them i introduced the concept of using dsp techniques in conjunction with frequency domain reflectometry fdr to develop a stand alone system which would be capable of identifying the true severities and locations of multiple faults along a coaxial or waveguide transmission line antenna system within inches and within minutes it is worthwhile to note here that besides my small team which included a full time technician a junior engineer and occasional part time software programmer no one in upper management had sufficient confidence or understanding to believe that my concepts would work and result in a usable system needless to say my project was classified as extremely high risk and i was funded in a most frugal manner i was however extremely fortunate that the late dr robert j haislmaier office of chief of naval operations and the cream project manager robert b windle believed in me and assured me that if i could develop a prototype system that could perform the tasks in the time that i claimed i would be funded sufficiently well to take this system into flown blown production and that it would become a standard equipment for testing the communication system on every us naval vessel the resulting system that i subsequently invented was referred to as the an psm 40 antenna test set and its commercial version as the transline analyzer this was a landmark contribution in the area of rf and microwave instrumentation and system design it also served as the topic of my doctoral dissertation the patented correlation and interpolation techniques of microwave signals was a major breakthrough in overcoming the limitations identified above and this stand alone system replaced 9 instruments that took weeks to perform the measurements by highly trained personnel with much lower accuracy key feature of the new technique included determination of the severity and location of multiple mismatches in a single pass nswc had me making presentations to various departments of the navy in order to receive production funding my big moment came when dr haislmaier arranged for me to make a presentation to a select group of admirals at the pentagon followed by a shipboard test on the uss john f kennedy cv 67 at norfolk virginia my presentation was extremely well received by the admirals but the shipboard test posed some unique challenges the system showed that there was a discontinuity at a particular location in the waveguide antenna communication system the engineers swore that the system made an erroneous measurement since at the specified location there was only a curved piece of waveguide with the curve pointing downwards and there were no connectors remotely close to it i requested them to carefully disconnect that entire section of the waveguide without re orienting it when i received the waveguide i turned it vertical only to show that a large amount of water had collected at the curve we replaced the waveguide after removing the water and re ran the test which indicated that the particular location in question was now fine this convinced every skeptic in the area and i received my first million dollar contract for sdmd the system performance was tested extensively under laboratory conditions field conditions and shipboard performance and it eventually went into full blown production and continues to be in the us navy inventory this system has unlocked revolutionary innovation value from the us navy s 160b annual budget has long become standard test equipment for the us navy while exponentially enhancing its combat readiness as well as those of our allies that adopted it when the year end time came for bonuses my technician and i received several handshakes and numerous words of praise while the marketing and engineering upper management shared the cash bonus for winning this major award i realized then that when i reached a position of authority i would rectify these types of practices and i indeed did so stephen ibaraki 15 40 again remarkable innovation but also sitting at the boundary of what you know instead of the near impossible making it possible and resiliency perseverance and commitment this concept of grit from angela duckworth sort of a variation of grit but combined with perseverance and optimism and pushing through against incredible challenges and yet succeeding and then learning the lessons of reward and recognition and providing another way of balancing that so let s continue this journey asad madni 16 20 2 0 servo control system for the hubble space telescope since the acquisition of the major assets of systron donner by bei technologies inc in 1990 i was involved in the development of several advanced systems each of which posed their own unique challenges in particular i would like to highlight the development of an extremely slow motion dual axis servo control system for hubble space telescope s hst star selector that provided the hst with unprecedented pointing accuracy and stability resulting in truly remarkable images that have enhanced our understanding of the universe this system allows a fine lock to the guidance system thereby providing a highly stable reference required for pointing the hst and maintaining a pointing accuracy equivalent to pointing at the face of a us quarter dollar as seen from 200 miles away and the pointing stability less than the width of the quarter dollar over a 24 hour period this required development of optical encoding technology with accuracies previously unachieved up to 23 bits of resolution together with advanced actuation and signal processing techniques that would allow hst to scan a portion of the sky while orbiting earth at approximately 18000 mph the system is still in use 30 years since it was launched in 1990 with its pointing accuracy stability resulting in over one million truly remarkable images such as the discovery of pluto s moons and the formation of galaxies thousands of light years away stephen ibaraki 19 43 you have this revolutionary mems gyro chip technology it s quite remarkable and something that consumers and business people can relate to but it s beyond the domain of the military and chip guidance and things like that and systems and testing systems on chips also it s used in the consumer marketplace with stability control can you talk a little bit more about that asad madni 20 18 3 0 world s first commercialized mems gyroscope technology this material is adapted from previous published articles by madni et al in the early 1990s after bei had acquired the major assets of systron donner corp the sd inertial division sdid celebrated 40 years of excellence in satisfying the inertial needs of aerospace defense a d markets primarily with a product line of high precision accelerometers for space missile and aircraft applications the company acquired a new mems rate gyroscope technology concept based on a coriolis force tuning fork but the technology had yet to be commercialized for high volume production the end of the cold war forced a significant reduction in sdid s overall business as older product demand declined while the new technology had not yet penetrated significant markets the quartz rate sensor qrs exhibited promise for manufacturing with high volume methods however the low production volume demand before 1995 could not justify the capital expense to automate the low volume labor intensive manufacturing methods we clearly needed a growth strategy to take advantage of the promise of the qrs after performing an extensive market survey we identified a significant growth opportunity for an extremely low cost solid state rate gyroscope for automotive stability control brake systems since gyroscopes had never been engineered and adapted to automotive service the application represented a new challenging and emerging market stability control sc systems measure the vehicle yawing turning rate and a brake computer compares it to the desired yaw rate from the driver steering wheel command a skid condition is detected by an out of tolerance comparison in a software algorithm this detection causes a momentary automatic application of either left or right brake s to correct or stabilize the vehicle sc systems enhance the safety of traditional antilock brake systems abs for a relatively small increase in cost the automotive application required a gyroscope with extreme reliability very low cost built in test capability and high volume manufacturability the mems qrs conceptually met all of these requirements a strategic decision was made by myself in my capacity as president coo and cto of bei together with charles crocker bei chairman to target the automotive requirement and to initiate conversion from an exclusively a d business among the most formidable challenges that the company faced were the massive cultural and infrastructure changes which had to be made over the next five years to accommodate this new business mentality while not abandoning the a d business several areas were impacted including the quality system enterprise resource planning erp computer system electronic data interchange edi customer ordering statistical process controls factory automation technology road mapping techniques for continuous cost reduction engineering design and validation techniques for lowest unit cost and development of a global supplier and customer base under my leadership qrs manufacturing processes and techniques were re designed for mass production primarily in fork fabrication fork balancing and hermetic packaging and final assembly calibration and test all labor intensive processes were replaced by automation and proofing against human error continuous cost reductions were planned with five year technology roadmaps products achieved the primary customer needs of performance specifications and continuous fault detection capabilities for safety critical applications a common quartz fabrication facility served both a d and automotive product lines other low cost high volume automotive components were fed into selected a d products for extremely favorable cost benefits these major changes based on leveraging the a d technology into the automotive and transportation markets and reverse leveraging high volume low cost automotive components back into a d markets allowed sdid to dramatically ramp up production shipping millions of units while it continued serving the a d market the qrs technology eventually called the gyrochip met key performance characteristics that were orders of magnitude better than the automotive application in the a d gyroscopes which were focused on micro miniature inertial measurement units imu and other high performance solid state rate gyro applications the automotive challenge hinged on reducing unit cost of the gyrochip to double digit dollar levels from the three and four digit levels common to a d products the cost reduction occurred primarily through selective investments in automation significant advances in design techniques and mass production techniques the classic semiconductor industry technique of more chips per silicon wafer was embraced by progressively moving from one tuning fork per wafer to 2 4 8 16 and 56 all these designs utilized the same size wafer this batch manufacturing together with laser trimming and electronically programming calibration techniques radically reduced the cost per tuning fork performance degradation caused by fork size reduction in such mass based sensors was not only significantly mitigated but the revolutionary tuning fork designs actually improved the performance another major hurdle was to implement self monitoring for safety critical systems rate gyroscope applications frequently occur in systems that create a dangerous situation if the gyro fails without the host system detecting that the rate sensing device is providing faulty information automotive stability control brake systems generate direction changing brake commands independent of the driver for this reason this safety system may become an unsafe system if it erroneously activates the brakes unlike other limited self tests the bei gyrochip was embedded with a patented technique called continuous built in test cbit which can monitor end to end sensor and electronics health continuously during operation cbit is a major contributor to stability control brake system safety the first high volume production of the gyrochip yaw rate sensor commenced in june 1996 for application in the cadillac stabilitrak brake system an unexpected event in the fall of 1997 determined that the market would mushroom at rates that were multiple of 100 percent per year this event was the loss of control and rollover of a new european vehicle by a swedish automobile magazine editor while executing a maneuver to simulate avoidance of an animal such as an elk crossing the road this created a firestorm of adverse publicity and in reaction to the elk maneuver episode the manufacturer committed to fit all future vehicles with stability control european manufacturers seized on a marketing opportunity and decided to significantly ramp up their offerings of stability control gyrochip demand skyrocketed by a factor of 10 to over 400 000 in the first full year of production for europe by 2002 sdid had shipped well in excess of 5 000 000 gyrochips we had to learn how to walk and run at the same time with a focused leadership and pioneering technical innovations the gyrochip evolved from a single axis yaw rate sensor to a fully packaged automotive inertial measurement unit using the success and knowledge gained through this low cost manufacturing experience sdid leveraged this engine of low cost high volume products back into the a d market and made major inroads in the commercial aviation market the gyrochip technology revolutionized navigation and stability in aerospace and automotive systems its applications range from satellites to airliners and cars it is in use worldwide in over 80 models of passenger cars for automotive stability and rollover protection systems in over 90 types of aircraft including the ace pitch stability control of boeing 777 stretch 777 as yaw damper for over 3000 boeing 737s in most business jets for attitude heading and reference and for guidance navigation control in major missile uav helicopter space programs it is also the main technology for rockwell collins pro line 21 ghc 3000 avionics suites nasa s sojourner eva robotic camera aercam sprint numerous satellites and archer airborne hyperspectral imaging system used by civil air patrol in search rescue and disaster management missions the re engineering of bei that i led resulted in one of the most successful defense conversion stories the gyrochip cost was reduced by orders of magnitude and met with unprecedented acceptance by the automotive industry electronic stability and roll over prevention are of paramount importance to human safety which thanks to our efforts we all enjoy when driving a car or flying on an airplane by 2005 over 55 million gyrochips were produced their use for stability augmentation in passenger cars has saved millions of lives around the globe this technology together with associated sensing technologies that my team and i developed generated over 2 billion in revenues for bei while enabling hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue for its customers across the globe simply put the gyrochip is to autonomous vehicles what the atom is to matter it is a fundamental building block without which today s progress in reaching a place of autonomous vehicle ubiquity would not be possible we paved the way for a new industry that will span most of the 21st century under my leadership bei became the world s largest independent supplier of mems yaw and roll stability control rsc sensors for cars in 2005 together with charles crocker i spearheaded the sale of bei technologies to schneider electric for approximately 600 million in addition to serving as president coo and cto of bei technologies i was appointed chief technology officer for schneider electric s custom sensors technologies cst group 2005 2006 which included all the bei companies kavlico and crouzet automation revenues one billion dollars and 3000 employees i declined the ceo position for schneider s cst in favor of planned retirement from bei in 2006 in order to pursue activities with the us national academy of engineering and as a distinguished adjunct professor and distinguished scientist at ucla cst s commercial portion of the business which consisting of products and technologies that my team and i invented or led the research and development of was sold to sensata in 2015 for one billion dollars stephen ibaraki 40 33 so let s take a minute here i m just going to summarize a little bit for the audience because you ve covered so much initially you describe your tenure as an engineer with systron donner corporation where you were there for 18 years you worked developed and pioneered had tremendous challenges seminal and pioneering developments in rf and microwave systems and instrumentation which is proliferated in combat readiness with the us navy and the department of defense and to simulate more threat representative ecm environments current and future advanced warfare training and so on just just a remarkable history you eventually became chairman president and ceo because it s just repeated contribution after contribution after contribution you then went into a company called bei technologies inc headquartered in california you were responsible for the development and commercialization of intelligent micro sensors and systems for aerospace and military transportation commercial including and let s separate this now extremely slow motion servo control system for the hubble space telescope s star selector system which is unprecedented in its accuracy and stability and you gave some really interesting measures this idea at a long distance seeing a quarter dollar and really resulting in all the remarkable images that we see separately from that you led this journey of the revolutionary mems gyrochip technology which today is used worldwide in commercial innovation stability control and rollover protection in passenger vehicles future autonomous vehicles saving millions of lives a very very successful innovation you became president and chief operating officer cto of that organization there was a 600 million acquisition by schneider electric but then within schneider you in turn had an executive position and continue this innovation journey of remarkable contribution of which those portions of schneider which were acquired later for over a billion just literally a continual series of translational leadership taking research into commercialization and taking on that cost factor which is something that a lot of researchers don t understand as you indicated if you have an unlimited budget you can develop to any kind of performance standard but when you have to do it with a cost constraint or to keep it affordable so that it could be scalable globally that introduces this whole number of other challenges which you have repeatedly surmounted i now want to go into the more engineering contribution side and for example ucla and so on did i capture that summary correctly asad madni 43 45 i think you captured it extremely well the only thing i would say is that bei technologies was formed and listed on nasdaq when the parent company of systron donner corporation decided to divest all that us aerospace and defense companies and bei electronics the company which was in motion control systems and pointing systems and sensors like pressure sensors and position sensors acquired the major assets of systron donner corperation which included the inertial division included other sensing divisions but not the microwave division where i was but i was at that point leading the sale of systron donner major assets to bei technologies in 1990 so the combined company was known as bei technologies charles crocker stayed as the chairman and ceo i as the president chief operating officer cto just as a clarification stephen ibaraki 44 44 i can see this journey that s a narrative of continuing development but also with colleagues that you trust and form relationships with and a similar mindset as you continue from systron donner to bei technologies and then to excel okay now let s get into your current areas of interest and your view of trends we only have about 15 minutes left asad madni 45 08 okay we ve got very little time left so i will now do what you d asked me i ll tell you a few things that i m working on right now and then i ll give you a little bit of my vision for the future 1 0 ultra high data throughput and wideband instrumentation for the detection of rare events it is a different technical approach based on the photonic time stretch technology that was developed in prof bahram jalali s lab at ucla i provided the innovations in time and frequency domain signal processing techniques in our digital world we convert real time analog signals by digitizing them with analog to digital converters adc and then process them this however places a limit on the bandwidth of the signal that we wish to digitize based on the conversion speed of the adc as a result extremely high frequency signals or one time rare event occurrences cannot be digitized placing a limit on the system performance as opposed to traditional approaches time stretch transformation of wideband waveforms boosts the performance of adcs and digital signal processors by slowing down analog electrical signals before digitization and enabling ultra high throughput and precision capture of wide band analog signals so they can be digitized in real time with a slower higher resolution more energy efficient adc the photonic time stretch front end consists of a femto second mode locked laser mll creating a linearly chirped optical signal which is modulated by the incoming electrical data as a second step the data signal is stretched in time by the propagation through a dispersive fiber which reduces its analog bandwidth to fit within that of the digitizer photonic time stretch has enabled the development of various high throughput real time instruments for science medicine and engineering applications the technology has been employed for the discovery of rare events such as optical rogue waves mariners have known for centuries that freak giant waves can appear out of the blue in the ocean and soliton explosions striking nonlinear dynamics in dissipative systems in this state a dissipative soliton collapses but returns back to its original state afterwards time stretch was used to directly observe the relativistic electron bunch microstructures with sub picosecond resolution in a storage ring accelerator it has enabled the record throughput of instruments such as serial time encoded amplified microscopy steam and high speed quantitative phase imaging for label free detection of cancer cells in blood with a sensitivity of one cell in a million a time stretch accelerated processor tisap was used to perform real time in service signal integrity analysis of 10 gigabit s streaming video packets for the first time on a commercial optical networking platform and for ultra wideband single shot instantaneous frequency measurements various research groups across the world have adopted time stretch as a technique for the characterization of ultrafast phenomena and for increasing the resolution limits of high speed adcs 2 0 computational sensing and wearable sensors utilizing ai and ml techniques to create cost effective high performance sensors that can be commercialized for various applications wearable sensors utilizing wireless sensing technologies for non intrusive monitoring of biological data what is the state of the art now current trends today we have unbelievable technology at our disposal three important examples are a low cost miniaturized sensors utilizing mems and nanotechnology which makes them ubiquitous in everyday applications b miniaturization and increased density of memory chips together with cloud computing for data storage computation manipulation of data and signal processing and c ai and ml to provide intelligence that can handle large amounts of data and perform previously unimagined tasks heterogeneous integration and performance scaling interpret and implement moore s law to include all aspects of heterogeneous systems and develop architectures methodologies designs components materials and manufacturable integration schemes that will shrink system footprint and improve power and performance an area of great importance where advances are being made as engineering strives to better human lives is human centered technologies enabled by converging engineering advances in sensing computing machine learning and data communication which will draw on machine intelligence mi to help understand support and enhance the human experience the challenge is to create technologies that work for everyone while enabling tools that can illuminate the source of variability or difference of interest future predictions i believe that ai and ml will play extremely important roles in taking us to the next level in several areas ai relates to a form of execution demonstrated by machines that traditionally has been associated with humans or animals from simple robots talos in ancient greece 2000 years ago to the self driving cars of today that seek to replace a human driver these examples both ancient and modern fall under the realm of weak ai that is pre programmed to address tasks that would have been given to a human the question that arises is where will the field go next professor achuta kadambi of ucla and i wrote an essay for 50th anniversary commemorative edition of nae s journal bridge on this topic we emphasized that the untapped future of ai where revolutionary progress awaits lies in strong ai where machines act as a teacher to humans when humans learn from such machines it is possible to receive unexpected insights that yield a change in practice one future of strong ai lies in scientific discovery a disruptive tool to unblock stagnated fields of science where a human can only apply the same known techniques in their arsenal the unexpected insights from an ai might be the wiggle that is needed to get the wagon wheel out of the rut consider the field of physics the last 30 years have seen little progress on fundamental questions like explaining the wave collapse do a search for these key topic areas and or use wikipedia as noted by asad in quantum mechanics wave function collapse occurs when a wave function initially in a superposition of several eigenstates reduces to a single eigenstate due to interaction with the external world this interaction is called an observation part of the challenge is that physical observations have become much more expensive to collect the so called big science and also difficult to interpret by humans from newton to einstein we have seen a remarkable jump in the complexity of the observations required to validate a theory today however we have something that neither einstein nor newton had ever increasing computational power this motivates a new paradigm for physics which we refer to as artificial physics the artificial physicist could operate in a way that is almost contradictory to a human where a human can test a small set of curated theories on a sparse set of data a machine can test a huge number of combinatorial possibilities on massive datasets it is certainly a radical change in approach but hopefully one that can yield a radical change in results for example consider a computer program that can re discover einstein s famous equations we have not yet observed a technology that can automatically intuit these equations one of the challenges is that einstein s equations are a human interpretable construct but a solution might build upon work in symbolic equation generation however the road ahead to scientific discovery is not easy for the moment human engineers and computer scientists will have to create the artificial physicist we will struggle with questions of interpretability if the artificial physicist were to be based on a deep neural network how does one enforce human interpretability in other words how does the output of the artificial physicist guarantee an output equation that meaningfully maps to what humans can interpret the future of ai lies in grappling with these nuanced challenges there are multiple frontiers that could be explored a first frontier lies in interpretability if a machine is to teach humans new insights both partners must speak the same language imagine if a hybrid team could be formed where two physicists work together one is an artificial intelligence the other real a second frontier relates to novel algorithms and architectures to implement ai today neural networks deep learning is the dominant approach to implementing weak ai however such methods are pre programmed rather than self thinking yet a third frontier of ai lies in unblocking traditional fields not just physics but chemistry medicine and engineering the word choice of unblocking is deliberate it is one thing to use ai as a tool to augment human performance in a field much as computers augment the author searching for a word definition it is entirely different to have the ai drive the research field in unexpected and meaningful directions an example of unblocking in action can be found in the optical sciences progress in optical design long held that fourier coded apertures were optimal with the advent of ai optical scientists have been successfully using ai algorithms to create unexpected aperture masks that depart from yet also outperform fourier masks for thousands of years humans have been teaching ai to do our chores it might be time that we let ai teach us how to innovate in new and unexpected ways stephen ibaraki 54 58 i m going to inject some ideas because we re getting into time constraints now i think the work of judea pearl at ucla is really interesting and sort of causal models that he s created i think that it s interesting that lamda from google gpt x beyond the current widely used gpt 3 from openai gato from deep mind and added hybrid models multimodal models that are coming out in terms of agi more of a generalization combined with all of the aspects you talked about and exascale supercomputing in the intersection of that with quantum computing computing see my forbes article with jack dongara pioneer in high performance computing and perhaps even analog computing even the work of pattie maes at fluid interfaces mit media lab see my forbes article with pattie i just want to inject that into the audience of areas of confluence of many interesting ideas that you just suggested now let s now go to your final recommendations to the audience asad madni 55 58 recommendations to the audience 1 believe in yourself 2 you will encounter ultracrepidarians ignore them ultracrepidarian is a person who expresses opinions on matters outside the scope of their knowledge or expertise 3 don t operate out of fear of failure 4 do not become a victim of your successes learning individual and learning organization i was educated once it took me years to get over it mark twain deeper truth than one

twitter has vowed to sue elon musk here s what could happen in court enlarge this image toggle caption patrick pleul ap patrick pleul ap twitter says its 44 billion sale to elon musk is still on and it will go to court to make it happen despite the mercurial billionaire s declaration he is breaking it off the agreement is not terminated twitter s lawyers wrote in a letter to the tesla and spacex ceo on sunday disclosed in a filing on monday musk knowingly intentionally willfully and materially breached his agreement to buy the company they alleged twitter reserves all contractual legal and other rights including its right to specifically enforce the musk parties obligations under the agreement they wrote back in april musk launched a surprise bid to buy twitter for 54 20 a share which the social media company initially resisted before accepting musk has accused twitter of violating the sale agreement which he argued gives him grounds to walk away without paying a 1 billion penalty it all sets twitter and musk up for a lengthy and expensive legal battle in the delaware court of chancery which deals with corporate disputes the only sure winners in this situation are the lawyers said joseph grundfest a law professor at stanford and former commissioner at the securities and exchange commission because a lot of money is going to be spent litigating this question twitter will seek to force musk to go through with the deal legal experts say twitter has a strong case the agreement they signed includes a clause that allows twitter to sue to force musk to buy the company that means he promised to buy the company for a price well he d better show up and buy the company for that price grundfest said courts have forced buyers to complete deals even after they ve gotten cold feet in 2001 tyson foods tried to back out of an agreement to buy a meat processor after raising questions about its business but the delaware court ordered it to go through with the purchase forcing musk to buy twitter hinges on his financing for the deal remaining in place musk is on the hook to pay 33 5 billion himself and has lined up 13 billion in loans from banks one key question is will musk s declaration that he wants out of the deal cause the banks to change their minds the court could order musk to pay damages instead even though there is precedent to force a buyer to complete a deal donna hitscherich a professor at columbia business school said the court may be reluctant to do so typically the court is going to put the parties in the position they were in before the unhappy events occurred she said in that case the court might not order musk to buy twitter but could stick him with billions of dollars in damages while that would likely amount to less than the 44 billion musk agreed to pay it would avoid the awkward situation of forcing musk to buy a company he says he no longer wants to own musk has shown little interest in following legal orders after the sec fined him and tesla 40 million in 2018 over his claims he had funding secured to take the electric carmaker private the regulator said a lawyer needed to vet his tweets musk has been accused of violating that order and he s now trying to get his 2018 settlement with the sec thrown out musk will argue that twitter broke their agreement in his letter friday to twitter saying he was terminating the purchase musk accused the company of making false and misleading representations about its estimates of how many accounts on the platform are fake or spam he also accused twitter of refusing to share information that would help him verify its estimates and of violating other parts of the legal agreement while musk initially cited cleaning up twitter s longstanding problem of spam accounts and automated bots as a reason he wanted to buy the company in recent weeks he s flipped he now cites the issue as his rationale for backing out of the deal musk says he thinks the prevalence of fake and spam accounts on the platform is far higher than the 5 twitter estimates twitter has said it uses private data to make those estimates so they can t be easily replicated by outsiders legal experts say even if twitter s figures were incorrect that would probably not be a big enough problem to get musk out of his agreement to buy the company that s a pretty heavy lift said hitscherich there has to be something very very significant in the business for the courts to say you know what you re right the very nature of this contract has changed so substantially that you don t have to go through with it pressure could mount for a settlement many deal disputes end with a settlement involving a price cut that s what happened in 2020 when the luxury conglomerate lvmh moët hennessy louis vuitton tried to scupper an agreement to buy jewelry icon tiffany company but ultimately went through with the purchase at a 425 million discount accepting less than 54 20 a share from musk could open twitter up to lawsuits from unhappy shareholders still a settlement could spare both sides from further headaches and reputational damage some have speculated that musk has wanted to buy twitter for a lower price all along since he agreed to the deal global markets have fallen with tech stocks hit especially hard that s made a 44 billion price tag for twitter look more expensive even as the value of tesla shares musk s main source of wealth have plummeted it s hard to see twitter emerging from the legal battle as a winner even if it s a victor in court a protracted legal battle would weigh on the company morale has already taken a hit since the deal was announced some employees are wary of musk s potential ownership and the changes he s floated to protect his vision of free speech meanwhile twitter has been cutting costs including implementing a hiring freeze and even laying off some employees as it seeks to strengthen its business amid a weakening online advertising market no matter who ends up owning it a courtroom drama would cast a further cloud of uncertainty over the company how long do you want to go through with this hitscherich said you re taking your eye off the business everything that takes your eye off the business is an issue

on july 8 2022 the pension benefit guaranty corporation pbgc published its much anticipated final rule on the special financial assistance sfa available to certain troubled multiemployer plans under the american rescue plan act of 2021 arpa as we previously described in our client alert arpa provided for cash payments from the pbgc to eligible plans that were supposed to be in the amount necessary for the plans to pay benefits and administrative expenses through the plan year ending in 2051 in july 2021 the pbgc released an interim final rule the ifr which provided various details on the sfa program including how the sfa amount would be calculated for an eligible plan as we previously explained in detail but the devil is always in the details and there were a number of questions raised by the ifr including whether the assumptions and conditions established by the ifr would provide enough sfa for all eligible plans to remain solvent through 2051 responding to a number of comments on the ifr the pbgc s final rule made several changes to the ifr most notably the final rule attempted to address the concerns that some plans would not receive sufficient sfa to remain solvent through 2051 it also addressed concerns that plans that previously implemented benefit suspensions under the multiemployer pension reform act of 2014 mpra would be disadvantaged if they sought arpa relief and as required revoked their mpra suspensions these and other key changes made by the pbgc in the final rule are summarized below methodology and assumptions to calculate special financial assistance separate investment return assumptions for sfa and non sfa assets in order to calculate the amount of sfa to which an eligible plan is entitled the ifr prescribed a single investment return assumption equal to the lesser of the interest rate used for funding standard account projections in the most recent zone status certification completed before 2021 or 200 basis points plus the third segment rate in the last four months prior to the filing of the application approximately 6 7 based on current rates at the same time the ifr required a plan to invest its sfa in investment grade bonds which were yielding far less than that rate for many plans this meant that the pbgc would provide sfa necessary to maintain solvency through the plan year ending in 2051 assuming the sfa it provided would earn more than it actually could in light of the investment restriction the result was that some of these plans would become insolvent before 2051 even with the sfa the final rule addressed this issue by calculating sfa using separate investment return assumptions for sfa and non sfa assets for sfa assets the assumption is 67 basis points plus the average of the three segment rates approximately 4 85 today for the month in which the average is the lowest among the four months prior to the filing of the application for non sfa assets the assumption is the one that previously applied except that the third segment rate for the cap is the lowest in the last four months prior to the filing of the plan s application proskauer observation the assumptions provided in the final rule are more likely to match a plan s actual experience making eligible plans more likely to maintain their solvency through 2051 sfa amount for mpra plans the final rule increases potentially significantly the amount of sfa available to plans that implemented suspensions under mpra as of march 11 2021 in response to concerns that trustees of such plans had to grapple with whether to avoid insolvency indefinitely the standard required to implement suspensions under mpra and forego sfa or accept sfa and reinstate benefits as required by arpa to receive sfa and jeopardize the plan s long term viability the final rule allows a mrpa plan to apply for the greatest of 1 the sfa amount for non mpra plans 2 the amount sufficient to ensure that the plan will project increasing assets at the end of the 2051 plan year or 3 the present value of reinstated benefits including both make up payments for previously suspended benefits as well as payments of the reinstated portion of the benefits expected to be paid through 2051 proskauer observation by providing for sufficient sfa to ensure that a plan will project increasing assets at the end of the 2051 plan year the pbgc is using a standard that approximates the position the plan would be in if it maintained its mpra suspension thus trustees of plans with mpra suspensions are no longer in the unenviable position of having to decide whether to sacrifice long term solvency to obtain arpa relief sfa amount for non mpra plans under the final rule the amount of sfa to a non mpra plan is calculated as the lowest dollar amount for which as of the last day of each plan year during the sfa coverage period which ends in 2051 this methodology was changed from the present value methodology in the ifr because of concerns raised about how the present value calculation was affected by the timing of cash flows proskauer observation although many commenters hoped that the pbgc would provide all plans with sfa in amounts similar to those available to mpra plans the pbgc stated that it believed that doing so would be inconsistent with the congressional intent behind apra contribution rate increases after july 9 2021 in projecting a plan s resources to calculate its sfa amount the final rule disregards contribution rate increases that are agreed to on or after july 9 2021 the pbgc noted that this rule eliminated the incentive for bargaining parties to wait until after the plan receives its sfa to negotiate contribution increases proskauer observation this appears to exclude increases that are required by a rehabilitation plan that were not incorporated into an employer s collective bargaining agreements as of that date 2 permissible investments the ifr only allowed plans that receive sfa to invest the sfa assets in high quality investment grade bonds and certain other permissible investments that would be expected to yield similar returns many commenters expressed concern that this would make it harder if not impossible for many eligible plans to stay solvent until 2051 particularly in light of the investment return assumption described above the final rule pivoted from the ifr and altered the requirements for permissible investments of sfa assets the final rule allows plans to invest up to 33 of its sfa assets in return seeking assets e g publicly traded u s dollar denominated common stock equity funds that invest primarily in public shares and certain debt instruments of domestic issuers that are not investment grade bonds the remaining 67 of sfa must still be invested in investment grade fixed income instruments proskauer observation the pbgc acknowledged that it took a conservative position in the ifr because arpa expressly authorized pbgc to approve investments in asset classes other than investment grade bonds however pbgc stated that it wished to go through the notice and comment period under the ifr before expanding to other asset classes by allowing a limited amount of additional diversification in the investment of sfa the final rule attempts to balance the security of the taxpayer funded sfa and the need to achieve investment returns to maintain solvency special withdrawal liability rules phased recognition of sfa under the ifr all of the sfa received by a plan was immediately treated as plan assets for withdrawal liability calculations the final rule modifies this approach by phasing in the treatment of sfa of a plan asset over time the phase in period begins from the first year the plan receives sfa through the end of the plan year that the plan is projected to exhaust sfa assets the pbgc is seeking public comments on this aspect of the final rule use of mass withdrawal assumptions the ifr required plans that receive sfa to calculate withdrawal liability for all withdrawing employers using the conservative mass withdrawal interest rate assumptions established by the pbgc the final rule continues to require plans to use these rates until the later of 1 10 years after the end of the plan year in which the plan receives payment of sfa or 2 the last day of the plan year in which the plan no longer holds sfa or any earnings in a segregated account however it refined the second date to prevent plans from holding a small amount of sfa just to extend the period during which this rule applies by providing that it is the last day of the plan year by which the plan projects it will exhaust its sfa assets extended by the number of years if any that the first plan year of payment is after the plan year that includes the sfa measurement date conditions on a plan that merges with a plan that receives sfa in response to comments and uncertainty as to the restrictions and conditions that apply when a plan that receives sfa merges with another plan the pbgc clarified the conditions that apply to those merged plans as detailed in the following chart application of restrictions and conditions after a merger applies to merged plan does not apply to merged plan other restrictions on uses of sfa transfer or merger approval withdrawal liability settlement approval must file annual compliance statement comply with periodic audit from pbgc restrictions on prospective benefit increases restrictions on allocation of plan assets restrictions on allocating expenses retroactive benefit increase plan may apply for a waiver but absent a waiver continues to apply to participants in the sfa plan contribution decreases plan may apply for a waiver but absent a waiver continues to apply to employers who had obligation to contribute to sfa plan allocating contributions and other income plan may apply for a waiver but absent a waiver continues to apply to contributions or income relative to the sfa plan before the date of the merger withdrawal liability calculation no waiver conditions required to be applied to determine unfunded vested benefits uvbs that arose under the sfa plan before the date of the merger for purposes of allocating uvbs under erisa 4211 d and determining withdrawal liability other conditions for sfa pbgc generally maintained the other conditions it imposed on plans that receive sfa however the final rule made a few changes to the conditions for example with respect to the prohibition on benefit increases it added a process pursuant to which a plan may request approval from pbgc to increase benefits if 10 years have passed since the end of the plan year in which sfa was paid and the plan will avoid insolvency notwithstanding the benefit increase application process the final rule maintained the ifr s priority and metering process however it also added a new process that allowed plans that file after march 11 2023 and before the end of 2025 as well as plans in priority groups 5 and 6 to file a lock in application if the pbgc closes the application process temporarily due to metering this pro forma e mail application would allow the plan to lock in its base data i e sfa measurement date census data and interest rates even though it cannot yet formally apply due to the temporary closure proskauer observation the new lock in application process avoids a situation in which a plan that has already performed all of the work necessary to complete its application has to redo all of its calculations because the application process is temporarily shut down due to metering to further address timing concerns raised by commenters the pbgc also changed the definition of the sfa measurement date from the last day of the calendar quarter immediately preceding the initial filing date to the last day of the third calendar month immediately preceding the initial filing date plans that previously applied for sfa are permitted to supplement their applications to take advantage of the final rule and plans that have already received their sfa may receive a second sfa payment based on the supplemental application the final rule is effective august 8 2022 and will generally apply to both new sfa applications and previously submitted sfa applications if the plan submits a supplemental application the final rule contains several other changes and nuances that we have not described here plans employers and other interested parties should consult with counsel regarding these details the pbgc s website also provides a host of additional resources regarding the sfa program the authors thank summer associate mallory knudsen for her contribution to this blog post

cited cleaning up twitter s longstanding problem of spam accounts and automated bots as a reason he wanted to buy the company in recent weeks he s flipped he now cites the issue as his rationale for backing out of the deal musk says he thinks the prevalence of fake and spam accounts on the platform is far higher than the 5 twitter estimates twitter has said it uses private data to make those estimates so they can t be easily replicated by outsiders legal experts say even if twitter s figures were incorrect that would probably not be a big enough problem to get musk out of his agreement to buy the company that s a pretty heavy lift said hitscherich there has to be something very very significant in the business for the courts to say you know what you re right the very nature of this contract has changed so substantially that you don t have to go through with it pressure could mount for a settlement many deal disputes end with a settlement involving a price cut that s what happened in 2020 when the luxury conglomerate lvmh moët hennessy louis vuitton tried to scupper an agreement to buy jewelry icon tiffany company but ultimately went through with the purchase at a 425 million discount accepting less than 54 20 a share from musk could open twitter up to lawsuits from unhappy shareholders still a settlement could spare both sides from further headaches and reputational damage some have speculated that musk has wanted to buy twitter for a lower price all along since he agreed to the deal global markets have fallen with tech stocks hit especially hard that s made a 44 billion price tag for twitter look more expensive even as the value of tesla shares musk s main source of wealth have plummeted it s hard to see twitter emerging from the legal battle

mexico city mexico in a sign that president andres manuel lopez obrador is increasingly serious about his promise to prosecute corruption mexico s anti money laundering agency has accused ex president enrique pena nieto of having been paid millions of dollars in possibly illegal funds despite previous allegations of corruption during his 2012 2018 administration the move is the first formal legal accusation against pena nieto the criminal complaint by the government s financial intelligence unit against pena nieto does not constitute formal charges but the unit s head pablo gomez said federal prosecutors have received the complaint alleging use of illicit funds and are investigating gomez said a company run by pena nieto s family while he was president had a symbiotic relationship with a firm that received about 500 million in government contracts pena nieto had received money transfers from a relative apparently linked to the two companies for about 1 3 million after leaving office gomez added noting that pena nieto s accounts and those of the companies have not been blocked this week pena nieto who moved to spain after leaving office wrote on his twitter account that his money was legally obtained i am certain that the appropriate authorities will allow me to clear up any questions about my holdings and to prove their legality through legal channels i have confidence in legal institutions he said the former head of mexico s state run oil company under pena nieto emilio lozoya has claimed that pena nieto and his right hand man then treasury secretary luis videgaray directed him to bribe lawmakers including five senators to support controversial energy and other structural reforms in 2013 and 2014 videgaray has denied the accusations the failure to prosecute any top figures from previous administrations and the failure of attorney general alejandro gertz manero to build a strong legal case based on lozoya s allegations have embarrassed the lopez obrador administration the previous hands off approach towards pena nieto has caused speculation that lopez obrador had reached a gentleman s agreement with the ex president in 2018 yet last year lopez obrador sponsored a national referendum for mexican voters regarding whether to prosecute former leaders accused of wrongdoing but it failed to reach the 40 percent participation required to make the vote binding

twitter says its 44 billion sale to elon musk is still on and it will go to court to make it happen despite the mercurial billionaire s declaration he is breaking it off the agreement is not terminated twitter s lawyers wrote in aletter to the tesla and spacex ceo on sunday disclosed in a filing on monday musk knowingly intentionally willfully and materially breached his agreement to buy the company they alleged twitter reserves all contractual legal and other rights including its right to specifically enforce the musk parties obligations under the agreement they wrote back in april musk launched a surprise bid tobuy twitter for 54 20 a share which the social media company initially resisted beforeaccepting musk has accused twitter of violating the sale agreement which he argued gives him grounds to walk away without paying a 1 billion penalty it all sets twitter and musk up for a lengthy and expensive legal battle in the delaware court of chancery which deals with corporate disputes the only sure winners in this situation are the lawyers said joseph grundfest a law professor at stanford and former commissioner at the securities and exchange commission because a lot of money is going to be spent litigating this question twitter will seek to force musk to go through with the deal legal experts say twitter has a strong case the agreement they signed includes a clause that allows twitter to sue to force musk to buy the company that means he promised to buy the company for a price well he d better show up and buy the company for that price grundfest said courts have forced buyers to complete deals even after they ve gotten cold feet in 2001 tyson foods tried to back out of an agreement to buy a meat processor after raising questions about its business but the delaware court ordered it to go through with the purchase forcing musk to buy twitter hinges on his financing for the deal remaining in place musk is on the hook to pay 33 5 billion himself and has lined up 13 billion in loans from banks one key question is will musk s declaration that he wants out of the deal cause the banks to change their minds the court could order musk to pay damages instead even though there is precedent to force a buyer to complete a deal donna hitscherich a professor at columbia business school said the court may be reluctant to do so typically the court is going to put the parties in the position they were in before the unhappy events occurred she said in that case the court might not order musk to buy twitter but could stick him with billions of dollars in damages while that would likely amount to less than the 44 billion musk agreed to pay it would avoid the awkward situation of forcing musk to buy a company he says he no longer wants to own musk has shown little interest in following legal orders after the sec fined him and tesla 40 million in 2018 over his claims he had funding secured to take the electric carmaker private the regulator said a lawyer needed to vet his tweets musk has been accused of violating that order and he s now trying to get his 2018 settlement with the sec thrown out musk will argue that twitter broke their agreement in his letter friday to twitter saying he was terminating the purchase musk accused the company of making false and misleading representations about its estimates of how many accounts on the platform are fake or spam he also accused twitter of refusing to share information that would help him verify its estimates and of violating other parts of the legal agreement while musk initially cited cleaning up twitter s longstanding problem of spam accounts and automated bots as a reason he wanted to buy the company in recent weeks he s flipped he now cites the issue as his rationale for backing out of the deal musk says he thinks the prevalence of fake and spam accounts on the platform is far higher than the 5 twitter estimates twitter has said it uses private data to make those estimates so they can t be easily replicated by outsiders legal experts say even if twitter s figures were incorrect that would probably not be a big enough problem to get musk out of his agreement to

yields still aren t flashing but they also are showing less optimism regardless of whether a recession is imminent investors likely need to brace for much more volatile markets than they ve become accustomed to over the last 40 years strategists at blackrock said monday for decades an era of great moderation smoothed out swings in economic growth and inflation and rewarded investors for buying the dip whenever prices dropped now with production constraints driving inflation higher heavy debt levels weighing on economies and the hyper politicization of everything affecting policy decisions blackrock strategists say they re expecting more volatility and shorter time periods between recessions the goldilocks option is now off the table where stocks and bonds can rise in concert said wei li global chief investment strategist at blackrock investment institute the blackrock strategists say they prefer stocks over bonds for the long term but that they re nevertheless shying away from stocks for the next six to 12 months one reason is that profit margins for companies are at risk of falling from their historically high levels companies this week are set to begin reporting how their profits fared during the spring big banks and other financial companies dominate the early part of the schedule with jpmorgan chase and morgan stanley set for thursday blackrock citigroup and wells fargo are among those reporting on friday expectations for second quarter results seem to be low analysts are forecasting 4 3 growth for companies across the s p 500 which would be the weakest since the end of 2020 according to factset even if companies end up reporting better results than expected which is usually the case analysts say the heavier focus will be on what ceos say about their profit trends for later in the year the roughly 19 drop for the s p 500 this year has been due entirely to rising interest rates and changes in how much investors are willing to pay for each 1 of a company s profit so far expectations for corporate profits have not come down much if they do that could lead to another leg downward for stocks many on wall street expect those expectations to come down the recent rise of the u s dollar against other currencies adds another challenge to companies already contending with high inflation and potentially weakening demandaccording to michael wilson equity strategist at morgan stanley one euro is worth close to 1 now down 15 from a year earlier for example that means sales made in euros may be worth fewer dollars than before the main point for equity investors is that this dollar strength is just another reason to think earnings revisions are coming down over the next few earnings seasons wilson wrote in a report beyond earnings updates reports this week on inflation will likely dominate trading on wednesday economists expect a report to show that inflation at the consumer level accelerated again last month up to 8 8 from 8 6 in may

example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video the average price of a gallon of regular gas in oregon has dropped about 12 cents from a month ago portland ore the price of gas in oregon has fallen steadily for the past three weeks although probably not fast enough to prompt the average local driver to start celebrating the average cost of regular gas in the state stood at 5 392 per gallon as of sunday according to gasbuddy aaa pegged the average price at a nearly identical 5 398 per gallon as of monday with the portland area average a bit higher at 5 471 per gallon oregon hit its highest ever average price point on june 15 at 5 538 per gallon of regular gas according to gasbuddy the decrease since then has been relatively modest but the trend has been consistent average prices have decreased on all but one day since june 21 washington s prices have also cooled off slightly falling from 5 547 per gallon on june 15 to 5 311 as of sunday according to gasbuddy the national trend over the past two weeks has been similar with the nationwide average price of regular gas falling 19 cents over the past two weeks to land at 4 86 per gallon supply and demand the decreases continued despite a surge in demand as drivers hit the road for the fourth of july weekend according to marie dodds director of government and public affairs at aaa of oregon and idaho the biggest driver of the prices we pay at our neighborhood gas station continues to be the high price of crude oil and we ve seen crude oil prices fall she said crude oil hit a recent high of about 122 per barrel on june 8 and has fallen to about 103 per barrel as of monday that s still significantly higher than a year ago she said but it s about a 14 drop over the last month the higher demand from drivers over the holiday weekend put some pressure on the market and caused gasoline stocks to decrease a bit she said but the drop in crude oil prices was enough to counteract the impact demand is likely to fall slightly after the holiday weekend but remain elevated for the rest of the summer she said in keeping with usual seasonal patterns that appear to have reasserted themselves after a shakeup during the pandemic but while demand at the pump might be getting back to normal the price of crude oil is much harder to predict she said making it difficult to answer what is likely the foremost question for oregon drivers is the current downward trend going to continue one of the biggest driving factors behind higher crude oil prices has been the war in ukraine the russian invasion of ukraine she said russia is one of the world s major oil producers it is the number three oil producer in the world behind the u s and saudi arabia any any time you have a conflict involving a major oil producer crude oil prices can and will be very volatile the 2022 atlantic hurricane season is also underway she said raising the possibility of weather related production disruptions along the gulf coast in the coming months which could push prices back upward west coast pricing the national average cost of a gallon of gas is now back below 5 but oregon still has a ways to go before it hits that mark aaa and gasbuddy both still rank the state fourth highest in the country in terms of average gas prices other western and west coast states round out most of the top 10 which is how things tend to shake out no matter which way gas prices are trending dodds said we have the dubious distinction here on the west coast of usually having some of the most expensive gas prices in the nation she said that s partly due to geography the western states are farther away from big oil production hubs on the gulf coast and there aren t as many pipelines in the western half of the country she said so gas has to travel farther and with fewer route options to reach west coast pumps

we previously discussed which portions of an artificial intelligence machine learning ai ml platform could be patented or protected under trade secret such as related to biotech and synthetic biology equally important to the discussion of how to protect components of an ai ml platform however is the extent to which copyright protection may be useful or beneficial to the developer of the platform in this post we explain what can be protected by copyright in an ai ml platform we also explore when it is appropriate to protect portions of ai ml platforms using a copyright how to properly enforce copyrights as well as when to consider using copyright protection over patent or trade secret protection what can be protected by copyright in an ai ml platform copyright allows an entity to protect tangible original and reproducible works such as music films photographs books software code and websites rather than protecting ideas or processes in protectable works copyright can protect how ideas are expressed including protecting how information is organized and structured in a body of work or how information is conveyed in software code copyright owners enjoy many exclusive rights to their work including the right to reproduce distribute perform and display their work copyright protection can last several decades far surpassing the period of time that a patent may be enforceable copyright law affords protection for many components of an ai ml platform from the software itself to data used within the platform for example a copyright on source code can prevent others from reproducing the source code verbatim to use or distribute to others reproducing the source code in a different computer language and in some circumstances reproducing features of the source code such as structure or non functional features of the source code even if not copied verbatim from the protected source code many companies have successfully protected their software from others using copyright protection see e g microsoft corp v buy more inc 703 fed appx 476 2017 u s app lexis 11454 2017 wl 2790693 where a court granted microsoft 1 950 000 in statutory damages upon a summary judgment determination that buy more had infringed microsoft s copyright on windows 7 and office 2007 oracle america inc v envisage technologies llc no 3 21 cv 03540 n d c a and oracle america inc v nec corp for america no 5 21 cv 05270 n d c a where oracle reached settlements in less than a year in both cases whelan assocs v jaslow dental lab inc 797 f 2d 1222 3rd cir 1986 unlike with patents there are no subject matter eligibility requirements to obtain copyright protection for software copyright protection can also cover characteristics of the software that cannot be protected by patents such as how an algorithm is expressed in source code in instances where an ai ml platform is patent ineligible or where the value of the platform does not only rely on the underlying algorithms implemented in source code copyright protection can be a suitable alternative many other components of an ai ml platform may also be protected by copyright for example if an entity takes photographs that are subsequently used as training data the photographs may be copyrightable an entity may also obtain copyright protection over a compilation of data that by nature of its arrangement selection or similar characteristics is creative or original see 17 u s c 103 noting that compilations can be protected by copyright but see feist publications inc v rural telephone service co 499 u s 340 1991 where a telephone book was not copyrightable because the telephone information was uncopyrightable facts and the way in which the information was selected and arranged was unoriginal another example includes an ai ml platform that uses training data generated from stock images that are publicly available or obtained from a third party the specific compilation of images that it selects for training sessions can potentially be protected by copyright even if the company cannot obtain a copyright on the images themselves how and when to protect copyrightable material a qualifying work is automatically protected by copyright once it has been created a software developer obtains exclusive right to their software code for example the moment it has finished drafting the source code for the software however the developer cannot sue others for copyright infringement using this automatic right alone the copyright act requires registration with the u s copyright office to enforce a copyright against others see 17 u s c 411 a 501 b to register a copyright an applicant can file an application for registration with the u s copyright office and include a copy of the copyrighted work after a review of the work and application the copyright office can register the copyright and issue a confirmation to the owner allowing the owner to then enforce their copyright in legal actions against infringing parties in some limited circumstances an applicant can pre register their work to allow the copyright owner to file copyright infringement suits while waiting for the copyright office to register the copyright once registered owners are encouraged but not required to provide notice to others as to their copyright e g by placing a copyright notice within the work the copyright act also requires an entity to register their copyright within three months of its first publication or within a month of learning of an infringing act to obtain statutory damages or attorney s fees see 17 u s c 412 a failure to seek copyright registration early can close off the possibility of obtaining statutory damages and attorney s fees entirely see e g southern credentialing support services l l c v hammond surgical hospital l l c 946 f 3d 780 5th cir 2020 a failure to timely register can also result in any lawsuits filed prior to registration being dismissed outright see e g fourth estate public benefit corp v wall street com 586 u s ____ 2019 no 17 571 dismissing the plaintiff s copyright infringement suit as the copyright office had not registered a copyright for the work in question at the time the complaint was filed as long as an entity registers their copyright within the three year statute of limitations for copyright infringement the entity can file a suit against the infringing party and can also seek non statutory damages for infringing acts performed prior to the date of registration that fall within the statute of limitations timeframe see id slip op at 10 it is therefore imperative to think about copyright protection prior to public disclosure to preserve these rights in the event that another party infringes the copyright copyright protection versus patent or trade secret protection in some circumstances copyright protection may protect portions of an ai system that cannot be protected using patents or trade secrets alone or can provide supplemental protection not afforded through these other ip rights below are some key considerations to keep in mind when deciding what type of protection may be optimal for a particular platform protection eligibility as noted in a previous blog post some aspects of an ai ml platform may not be patent eligible such as the specific source code used to implement the ai ml platform or the training data for the platform trade secret protection may not always be a viable choice for all components of the ai ml platform either for example if an entity provides an ai ml model to end users alongside a training data set to use with the model the training data set may lose its trade secret status once the entity has exposed the data to the end user the composition of the training data set however may still be copyrightable allowing for protection even if the training data set is exposed to others similarly even if the training data set is not provided directly to the end user the end user may be able to infer the composition of training data sets through normal use of the software platform under these conditions trade secret protection would not prevent the end user from creating its own training data set after studying the public facing functionality of the platform or from distributing their training data set to others however the developer may be able to prevent the end user from distributing the training data set using copyright protection even if it was reversed engineered through normal use of the platform thus at times copyright protection may better protect aspects of the ai ml platform compared to trade secrets and or patents note however that there are many components of an ai ml platform that may not be copyrightable such as intangible algorithms or processes used to implement the ai ml platform unoriginal sets of training data or output values generated by the algorithms for example oracle learned the hard way in a recent supreme court loss that google s use of portions of its java se api did not constitute copyright infringement patents trade secrets and copyright can each serve as valuable ip solutions depending on what can and should be protected within the platform effect of development on protection patent protection grants an exclusive right to the invention as described in the patent owner s claims which may cover many different iterations or implementations of the same ai ml platform while trade secret protection is not as broad in scope a developer can protect new iterations or implementations of a platform simply by following the same protocol and procedures to maintain each new iteration as a trade secret copyright protection in contrast is limited to the scope of the protected work if there are plans to frequently update or change implementations of the same platform and processes then patent or trade secret protection can be preferable over copyright protection as copyright protection may not always afford broad enough protection to include modifications to the platform on the other hand if a company has no plans to make any substantive changes to its platform then copyright protection can be a more cost effective way to protect aspects of the platform exclusivity copyright protection similar to patents provides an exclusive right to the protected content patent protection provides an exclusive right to practice or sell a claimed invention while copyright protection provides an exclusive right to distribute reproduce perform and otherwise use the work this protection can sometimes be preferable to trade secrets which do not provide exclusive rights to protected information conclusion copyright protection can allow a company to protect content that is not patent eligible through a process that is much less expensive than patent prosecution copyright protection can also allow a company to protect information that it cannot protect through trade secrets i e due to potential exposure to other parties through normal use when assessing what component of an ai ml platform can be protected as well as the best forms of protection to use for each component copyright protection should always be discussed prior to any potential public disclosure and included in discussions alongside patent and trade secret protection to ensure optimal protection of key assets within the platform

look for twitter this is nightmare scenario and now the stock is going to be under pressure with the must deal done because this is gonna be clear headwinds going forward employee turnover advertiser issues and really credibility i think it s gonna be viewed at least in the near term damaged goods from public market perspective airing dirty laundry in public in the courts in delaware i mean that s really gonna be i think for all the world to see now if it s 5 or less which twitter has claimed then ultimately they re proven right must likely has to pay some punitive damages including the breakup faith and twitter really ultimately wins in that situation problem is is that if this starts to ultimately cascade and the twitter body issue is much bigger and that comes out in court i think that really calls into question lot of issues about the business model modernization and others and that s why from twitter board perspective backs against the wall and the last thing they ever wanted to be was in court proceeding with the richest person in the world twitter legally could force sale to go through i think if you could historically likely it s in some sort of settlement but but no doubt i mean twitter is gonna sharpen the knives going in advertisement twitter s legal team calls elon musk s attempt to exit acquisition deal invalid and wrongful share copy link copy elon musk wants to cancel his deal to buy twitter but the social media company is having none of it on friday musk moved to terminate the 44 billion acquisition agreement alleging that twitter breached the deal by failing to hand over data he says he needs to evaluate the number of bots and spam accounts on the platform twitter s legal representatives hit back in a letter to musk s lawyers sunday calling the billionaire s claims invalid and demanding that musk follow through with the takeover mr musk s and the other musk parties purported termination is invalid and wrongful and it constitutes a repudiation of their obligations under the agreement reads the letter which was signed william savit a lawyer at wachtell rosen lipton and katz which is representing twitter in the dispute the letter was disclosed in a regulatory filing monday musk has for weeks expressed concerns without any apparent evidence that there are a greater number of bots and spam accounts on the platform than twitter has said publicly in his friday letter his lawyer alleged that twitter has not complied with its contractual obligations to provide musk with sufficient data to evaluate the issue despite having handed over its firehose of tweets on the platform in its monday response the twitter team said that twitter has breached none of its obligations and alleged instead that musk has knowingly intentionally willfully and materially breached the agreement it added that twitter has and will continue to provide information reasonably requested by musk to close the transaction the agreement is not terminated the bank debt commitment letter and the equity commitment letter remain in effect and twitter demands that mr musk and the other musk parties comply with their obligations under the agreement the letter states unless musk backs down or a settlement is reached the dispute appears almost certain to end up in court following musk s announcement that he wanted to exit the deal twitter board chair bret taylor said in a tweet friday that the board is committed to closing the transaction on the price and terms agreed upon with mr musk and plans to pursue legal action to enforce the merger agreement we are confident we will prevail in the delaware court of chancery taylor added it does not appear that a formal suit has yet been filed meanwhile twitter stock tanked on the news of the dispute closing down more than 11 on monday nearly 40 below musk s deal price suggesting deep skepticism about the deal going through many analysts have suggested that musk may be trying to use the bot issue as a pretext to get out of a deal that appears overpriced in light of the recent market downturn tesla shares which musk is planning to use in part to finance the deal have also fallen in recent weeks
twitter says its 44 billion sale to elon musk is still on and it will go to court to make it happen despite the mercurial billionaire s declaration he is breaking it off the agreement is not terminated twitter s lawyers wrote in aletter to the tesla and spacex ceo on sunday disclosed in a filing on monday musk knowingly intentionally willfully and materially breached his agreement to buy the company they alleged twitter reserves all contractual legal and other rights including its right to specifically enforce the musk parties obligations under the agreement they wrote back in april musk launched a surprise bid tobuy twitter for 54 20 a share which the social media company initially resisted beforeaccepting musk has accused twitter of violating the sale agreement which he argued gives him grounds to walk away without paying a 1 billion penalty it all sets twitter and musk up for a lengthy and expensive legal battle in the delaware court of chancery which deals with corporate disputes the only sure winners in this situation are the lawyers said joseph grundfest a law professor at stanford and former commissioner at the securities and exchange commission because a lot of money is going to be spent litigating this question twitter will seek to force musk to go through with the deal legal experts say twitter has a strong case the agreement they signed includes a clause that allows twitter to sue to force musk to buy the company that means he promised to buy the company for a price well he d better show up and buy the company for that price grundfest said courts have forced buyers to complete deals even after they ve gotten cold feet in 2001 tyson foods tried to back out of an agreement to buy a meat processor after raising questions about its business but the delaware court ordered it to go through with the purchase forcing musk to buy twitter hinges on his financing for the deal remaining in place musk is on the hook to pay 33 5 billion himself and has lined up 13 billion in loans from banks one key question is will musk s declaration that he wants out of the deal cause the banks to change their minds the court could order musk to pay damages instead even though there is precedent to force a buyer to complete a deal donna hitscherich a professor at columbia business school said the court may be reluctant to do so typically the court is going to put the parties in the position they were in before the unhappy events occurred she said in that case the court might not order musk to buy twitter but could stick him with billions of dollars in damages while that would likely amount to less than the 44 billion musk agreed to pay it would avoid the awkward situation of forcing musk to buy a company he says he no longer wants to own musk has shown little interest in following legal orders after the sec fined him and tesla 40 million in 2018 over his claims he had funding secured to take the electric carmaker private the regulator said a lawyer needed to vet his tweets musk has been accused of violating that order and he s now trying to get his 2018 settlement with the sec thrown out musk will argue that twitter broke their agreement in his letter friday to twitter saying he was terminating the purchase musk accused the company of making false and misleading representations about its estimates of how many accounts on the platform are fake or spam he also accused twitter of refusing to share information that would help him verify its estimates and of violating other parts of the legal agreement while musk initially cited cleaning up twitter s longstanding problem of spam accounts and automated bots as a reason he wanted to buy the company in recent weeks he s flipped he now cites the issue as his rationale for backing out of the deal musk says he thinks the prevalence of fake and spam accounts on the platform is far higher than the 5 twitter estimates twitter has said it uses private data to make those estimates so they can t be easily replicated by outsiders legal experts say even if twitter s figures were incorrect that would probably not be a big enough problem to get musk out of his agreement to buy the company that s a pretty heavy lift said hitscherich there has to be something very very significant in the business for the courts to say you know what you re right the very nature of this contract has changed so substantially that you don t have to go through with it pressure could mount for a settlement many deal disputes end with a settlement involving a price cut that s what happened in 2020 when the luxury conglomerate lvmh moët hennessy louis vuitton tried to scupper an agreement to buy jewelry icon tiffany company but ultimately went through with the purchase at a 425 million discount accepting less than 54 20 a share from musk could open twitter up to lawsuits from unhappy shareholders still a settlement could spare both sides from further headaches and reputational damage some have speculated that musk has wanted to buy twitter for a lower price all along since he agreed to the deal global markets have fallen with tech stocks hit especially hard that s made a 44 billion price tag for twitter look more expensive even as the value of tesla shares musk s main source of wealth have plummeted it s hard to see twitter emerging from the legal battle as a winner even if it s a victor in court a protracted legal battle would weigh on the company morale has already taken a hit since the deal was announced some employees are wary of musk s potential ownership and the changes he s floated to protect his vision of free speech meanwhile twitter has been cutting costs including implementing a hiring freeze and even laying off some employees as it seeks to strengthen its business amid a weakening online advertising market no matter who ends up owning it a courtroom drama would cast a further cloud of uncertainty over the company how long do you want to go through with this hitscherich said you re taking your eye off the business everything that takes your eye off the business is an issue copyright 2022 npr to see more visit
protestors gather at 200 east and st george boulevard thursday evening st george utah may 6 2022 photo by e george goold st george news salt lake city ap a utah judge on monday granted a request from planned parenthood to delay implementing the state s trigger law banning most abortions as implications of the u s supreme court overturning roe v wade reverberate nationwide with the decision abortion remains legal up to 18 weeks in utah which is among a group of states where abortion rights have been thrown into limbo amid the legal and political challenges shaping the post roe landscape with states now holding the power to restrict abortion what i m really doing is saying we have serious things to talk about judge andrew stone said after granting an injunction delaying the trigger law he said the status quo should remain in effect until a challenge from the state s planned parenthood affiliate can be heard fully the decision comes two weeks after stone put a temporary hold on the law which bans abortions with exceptions for rape incest or maternal health utah is among more than a dozen states with trigger laws designed to limit abortion upon the overturning of roe v wade the decision on monday comes two weeks after the court put a temporary hold on the law which bans most abortions with exceptions for rape incest or maternal health stone who was appointed by a republican governor blocked its enforcement for 14 days after the state s branch of planned parenthood sued his decision effectively extends the temporarily hold placed on the law and allows planned parenthood clinics to continue providing abortions until the case is resolved attorneys for utah argued language in the state constitution allowed for abortions to be banned and said delaying the implementation of the trigger law would amount to overruling the will of legislature and utah voters julie murray planned parenthood s attorney said not delaying the implementation of the law could open its staff to criminal charges and hurt roughly 200 patients with scheduled appointments in the month ahead stone granted a preliminary injunction which would let planned parenthood clinics continue to provide abortion care up to 18 weeks of pregnancy under another recently passed limit until the court rules on the constitutional questions the implications of the u s supreme court overturning roe v wade are being sorted out nationwide last month s dobbs v jackson ruling overturned the 1973 roe v wade ruling that found that the right to abortion was protected by the u s constitution the issue reverted to the states setting off new court battles and ballot initiatives as many states act to curtail or ban abortions a minnesota judge declared most of that state s restrictions on abortion unconstitutional in michigan a campaign turned in a record breaking number of signatures so voters can be asked on the november ballot whether to enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution the judge in minnesota also declared most of the state s restrictions on abortion unconstitutional including a 24 hour waiting period and a requirement that both parents be notified before a minor can get an abortion ramsey county district judge thomas gilligan also struck down requirements that only physicians can perform abortions and that abortions after the first trimester must be performed in hospitals his order took effect immediately meaning the limits can t be enforced gender justice and other abortion rights supporters argued that the restrictions were unconstitutional under a 1995 minnesota supreme court holding that the state constitution protects abortion rights the judge called that case significant and historic and said it s unaffected by the recent u s supreme court ruling these abortion laws violate the right to privacy because they infringe upon the fundamental right under the minnesota constitution to access abortion care and do not withstand strict scrutiny gilligan wrote opponents of abortion rights condemned the decision minnesota citizens concerned for life said the laws challenged in the case are common sense measures that support and empower pregnant women and striking them down blocks residents from enacting reasonable protections for unborn children and their mothers a republican attorney general candidate called on the democratic attorney general to appeal in a louisiana state court monday legal efforts to stave off the permanent closure of the state s three abortion clinics were renewed a new orleans judge refused last week to extend a temporary restraining order blocking enforcement of the state s abortion ban saying the case belonged in baton rouge attorneys for a north louisiana clinic and an abortion rights group are now seeking a new restraining order from a baton rouge judge attorney general jeff landry s office says a temporary restraining order cannot be renewed once it has expired in arizona a federal judge on monday blocked a 2021 personhood law that gives all legal rights to unborn children abortion providers argued the law can lead to criminal charges such as assault or child abuse and say it is unconstitutionally vague judge douglas rayes agreed in his ruling all abortions in arizona stopped last month but they could restart in at least one county following the ruling alongside lawsuits to challenge bans abortion rights supporters are trying to add ballot questions to enshrine abortion rights in state constitutions more than 750 000 signatures were turned in by the campaign in michigan on monday close to double the number needed the democratic governor and attorney general in the battleground state have both made abortion rights a centerpiece of their reelection campaigns the number of signatures showed that here in michigan we trust women we trust people we trust doctors not politicians to make decisions about our body our pregnancy and parenthood reproductive freedom for all spokesperson shanay watson whittaker said during a news conference in lansing the signatures still must be verified and validated a judge has temporarily blocked a 1931 michigan law that would make abortion a felony except when necessary to preserve the life of such woman gov gretchen whitmer has said that the law is invalid under the due process and equal protection clauses of the state constitution the injunction which stems from a planned parenthood lawsuit could be revoked at any time last week backers of a last minute effort to enshrine abortion rights in the arizona constitution failed to collect enough signatures to make the november ballot in california voters will decide in november whether to guarantee the right to an abortion in their constitution democrats who control the government in california fear the state s abortion laws could be vulnerable to legal challenges update july 11 2022 7 35 p m adds details on rulings in louisiana and arizona

by lucy bayly cnn business consumer expectations for prices to continue rising over the next year increased to the highest level on record according to the latest survey of consumer expectations from the federal reserve bank of new york released on monday median short term inflation expectations ticked up to 6 8 in june from 6 6 in may the monthly survey showed expectations for longer term inflation over the next three years fell to 3 6 from 3 9 indicating a sliver of confidence that us officials and policymakers can eventually succeed in their battle to bring down surging prices consumer price increases hit 8 6 in may the highest level in 40 years after russia s invasion of ukraine triggered a global energy shakeup that exacerbated pandemic related supply chain pressures that pushed up prices for everything from furniture to food the federal reserve which has been raising interest rates in order to tame rising prices is seeking to lower inflation to its 2 target rate however consumers don t expect all prices to keep rising over the next year the survey showed respondents said they anticipate home prices to fall by 4 4 over the next 12 months the lowest level since february 2021 and down sharply from the 5 8 price increase recorded in may having initially categorized the nation s inflation as transitory us officials have shifted away from that message admitting that they were slow to recognize the ongoing impact of rising prices i think i was wrong then about the path that inflation would take treasury secretary janet yellen told cnn last month there have been unanticipated and large shocks to the economy that have boosted energy and food prices and supply bottlenecks that have affected our economy badly that i didn t at the time fully understand but we recognize that now she said at a central bank forum in portugal last month fed chairman jerome powell acknowledged the challenges of inflation saying i think we now understand better how little we understand about inflation in march the federal reserve began pulling back from its pandemic era easy money policy by slowly raising interest rates and withdrawing the monetary support that had bolstered the us economy as the pandemic spread critics say the central bank s languid approach allowed inflation to fester in recent months the fed has adopted a more aggressive stance hiking interest rates by 50 basis points in may and by 75 basis points in june instead of the usual 25 basis points that aggressive action could lead companies to rein in their spending and hiring leading to job loss powell has acknowledged a point that is reflected in the june consumer survey people s expectations for job seekers to find a position in the next 12 months fell to 56 8 from 58 2 while expectations for losing a job rose slightly to 11 9 from 11 1 the mean probability of leaving a job voluntarily in the next 12 months dipped to 18 6 in may well below the pre pandemic reading of 22 2 in february 2020 the overall picture for household finances amid the fed s rate hikes remains pessimistic with more respondents reporting that they are financially worse off now than they were a year ago 31 1 said they were somewhat worse off compared to 28 6 in may and 13 6 said they were much worse off up from 10 8 in may in addition the survey showed an uptick in fears of deterioration in access to credit missing the minimum payment on a debt and expectations that us stock prices won t be higher 12 months from now the cnn wire 2022 cable news network inc a warnermedia company all rights reserved
the kalashnikov usa kr 103 sfs the ak for shooters too young to have bought arsenals at a good price who want an accurate clone of a modern ak 100 series rifle what exactly that means i ll get into shortly but for the sake of brevity this means that the kr 103 sfs includes several desirable features found on current issue aks that are very cost prohibitive to add to more traditional akm rifles that said the kr 103 sfs is by no means a cheap rifle not in the qualitative or monetary sense of the word although i did find it at atlantic firearms for under msrp naturally some shooters will be on the fence about spending their hard earned money on one so let s delve into all the details and determine if the kalashnikov usa kr 103 sfs is worth the money the kr 103 sfs is a semi automatic clone of the russian ak 103 rifle despite its appearance it is 100 ak under the hood meaning the kr 103 sfs is a long stroke piston driven locked breach magazine fed rifle chambered in 7 62x39mm consequently the kr 103 has all the pros and cons associated with the ak platform features thus shooters can expect flawless reliability top notch durability and a little more felt recoil than a direct impingement carbine like the ar 15 but before i get too far ahead of myself let s start at the muzzle and work our way back to cover every noteworthy feature of this rifle speaking of the muzzle the included ak 74 style two port brake is the first clue that this isn t a standard akm rifle the muzzle itself isn t actually threaded but the combination gas block front sight tower assembly features an extended portion threaded to m24x1 5 rh so your standard slant brake won t fit on this rifle without an adaptor and even with the adaptor this should be avoided as the included brake is much more effective and attractive in my opinion behind this threaded portion the gas block features an integral front sight post which is adjustable for windage and elevation but requires a special tool to do so beneath and behind the block the kr 103 sfs features a 16 33in cold hammer forged chrome lined barrel ideal for shooting standard and corrosive ammunition the chrome lining also benefits the rifle by making the barrel much more resistant to rust and wear attached to the bottom of the barrel is a combination bayonet lug and cleaning rod retainer further back the barrel features a collar that retains the front of the bottom handguard while the rear tab of the handguard fits snugly underneath the barrel trunnion above the barrel the kr 103 sfs features a steel gas tube with a 90 degree gas block port that also functions as an upper handguard retainer and speaking of handguards both the upper and lower are built from black polymer and feature a steel heat shield inside to prevent them from melting during extended shooting sessions behind the gas tube and barrel the kr 103 sfs features a forged barrel trunnion that also acts as a rear sight housing this rear sight is adjustable only for elevation and features markings designating the zero distance from point blank out to a very optimistic 1 000 meters behind the trunnion and rear sight the kr 103 sfs features the proper smooth dust cover and a receiver with the correct rivet style for a legit ak 100 series rifle as well as the catch for the folding stock it also features magazine dimples to reduce magazine wobble on slightly out of spec mags speaking of which i tried every magazine in my collection in the kr 103 sfs and they all locked up fed and extracted flawlessly more on that in a moment just behind the magazine well the kr 103 sfs features your standard magazine release paddle that in testing was perfect neither too stiff nor too loose above this on the left side of the receiver the rifle includes the standard akmn side rail for installing optic mounts on the other side of the receiver the kr 103 sfs utilizes the standard ak 47 safety lever that is extremely positive and large enough to actuate with gloved hands easily just behind this is the folding stock release button and a russian pattern 5 5mm rear trunnion as well as a black polymer pistol grip and black polymer folding stock that features a spring loaded release on the buttpad magazine compatability as mentioned above i tested the kr 103 sfs with a wide variety of magazines and accessories while ar shooters might find this pointless ak guys are definitely familiar with the fact that not all aks work with all accessories including magazines and i m not speaking about the difference between odd ball pattern guns like yugoslavian n paps but standard akm or ak 100 series guns can sometimes struggle with certain mags or even optic mounts in my testing i utilized the following magazines without issue bulgarian steel bulgarian slabside polymer both reinforced and commercial bulgarian circle 10 waffle chinese flat back chinese drum european steel hungarian tanker steel korean steel kci magpul ak pmag all gens romanian steel romanian drum russian steel russian bakelite and as far as scope mounts i had no issues with arsenal las vegas midwest industries russian commerical belorusian posp rs regulate or a venezualan pk a reflex sight everything was installed fine and held zero flawlessly performance paramount to any firearm test is reliability and in this regard the kr 103 sfs was nearly flawless i fired 1 850 rounds of ammo through the kalashnikov usa gun and encountered only a single malfunction a failure to chamber during a shooting match when i rested the gun and all my weight on the magazine to stabilize it other than that single malfunction the kr 103 sfs has performed flawlessly as far as accuracy i didn t do any bench shooting with the kr 103 sfs but i did take it out to a friend s property and shot steel man sized targets out to 500 yards without issue for me that s more valuable information than mechanical accuracy groupings lastly i want to talk about the longevity of the rifle a few years ago most shooters never bothered checking their ak s carrier bolt or chamber for soft steel and signs of mushrooming but the introduction of several sub standard american made aks has made this a must for shooters looking to really push their weapon s limits that said i m happy to report there was no visible damage or peening to the bolt itself though the tail of the carrier showed mild signs of wear and peening but given that i ve run 400 of the rounds through this gun suppressed that s not terribly surprising the good news is that the amount of wear shown on the tail isn t alarming or cause for concern live inventory price checker kalashnikov usa kr 103 guns com 1527 00 kalashnikov usa kr 103 kp 9 kr 9 cheese grater top cover steel ventilated upper handguard

black families experience higher and more volatile inflation impacting prices on groceries and household essentials according to a report published monday with research from uc san diego s school of global policy and strategy the study published by the federal reserve bank of richmond looked at inflation for black compared to white households from 2004 to 2020 and found inflation is 13 more volatile for black families study author munseob lee assistant professor of economics at ucsd said black families spend a larger portion of their income on essential goods and services such as electricity and wireless phone services compared to white households that spend more on luxury items less likely to fluctuate in price black and low income households are more likely to live in food deserts and have limited access to affordable and nutritious food lee said as we saw recently in those areas retail products became more expensive and shelves in the retail stores became frequently empty because of increased shipping costs and supply chain disruption this volatility makes it more difficult for households to predict and recalibrate consumption and savings lee said lee s research suggests income inequality in the u s is rising faster than current estimates his data also revealed that black households tend to have fewer options when inflation increases he found white households would shop at less expensive supermarkets and convenience stores however many black households were already shopping at these markets additionally with high gas prices it becomes more difficult for these families to use transportation to find essential goods so if a product is out of stock it often means low income shoppers can t buy it at all lee said the study used survey responses from 60 000 u s households from 2004 to 2020 that continually provided information about what products consumers buy and when and where they make purchases according to the data race is self reported by households by one of four options white black asian and other most households 82 2 identified as white and 10 identified as black last month federal reserve chairman jerome powell said in order to combat inflation an increase in interest rates was necessary lee said while this was certainly a step towards reducing inflation it was far from the only policy action available it is so true that the fed should increase the interest rate to fight against historically high overall inflation rates he told city news service that is an efficient tool to reduce overall inflation and it will naturally benefit the poor and minority too however monetary policy is not an efficient tool to address distributional consequences lee said therefore it should be combined with fiscal policy targeting households in need by providing support on necessary goods and services with high inflation especially because i anticipate that it will take a few months or a year to reduce the inflation lee s research came to several conclusions regarding policy and inflation first government agencies should consider measuring inflation by race and income there are no official statistics in the u s on inflation rates by any demographic meaning that estimates of poverty and inequality under the assumption everyone experiences inflation in similar ways can be misleading he wrote second fiscal policy can better serve households in need by providing targeted support on necessary goods and services with high inflation such as past due utility relief free public transit and child care fee waivers my research shows that income alone may be an incomplete measure to determine if households are eligible for government assistance such as food stamps lee said with inflation at its highest level in decades the poorest communities are bearing the brunt of rising costs

opinion by joseph h davis for cnn business perspectives the united states economy is in jeopardy higher prices for essentials like food and energy are crimping household incomes while stronger consumer demand has pushed up the prices for a range of goods and services from travel to apartments given this backdrop many economists believe that recession is inevitable either this year or next to be sure our own economic forecasts show the path to a continued expansion has narrowed quite considerably with the odds of recession at more than 50 over the next 18 months but there are ways the us economy can still avoid a recession here s what needs to happen in the coming months in order to avert a downturn lower consumer inflation expectations today s creep up in inflation expectations pales in comparison to the rapid rise seen in the 1970s yet they are still high research by the cleveland fed shows that most individuals do not expect their future income gains to offset the expected rise in future inflation meaning they expect inflation to reduce their purchasing power this does not bode well for future consumer spending the federal reserve should continue their aggressive hikes of the federal funds target rate to at least 3 by the early fall vanguard s view has been that 3 is the minimum rate needed to cement the public s belief that price increases will ease soon given the lags in monetary policy getting there quickly would reduce longer term tail risks by throwing more cold water on rising inflation expectations oil prices below 100 a barrel according to the bureau of labor statistics the consumer prices for gasoline and other fuels have increased 34 6 over the past 12 months helping to push inflation to 8 6 today my calculations reveal that consumers have spent an additional 280 billion on just food and energy alone over the past 12 months a major contributor to the decline in personal savings rates if oil prices dropped below 100 a barrel and stayed there that drop in fuel costs would help offset the entire increase in food costs lower energy prices would also reduce the cpi inflation rate by 2 5 percentage points by year end according to my calculations bigger retail inventories since the start of the pandemic economies have been buffeted by one supply shock after another outside of food and energy shortages of consumer products ranging from cars to home furnishings have helped lead to price increases retailer inventories are starting to build up again as consumers pull back on certain spending and supply chains straighten out but they are not yet at levels that would be enough to lower prices which is key to bringing the consumer price index down this summer we need to see an additional 100 billion in retail inventories for consumer products which would bring inventory and sales ratios back to more normal levels at us retailers according to my calculations more stocked shelves would also help shave 1 5 percentage points off inflation in the coming months americans returning to the labor market the lack of workers is presently a bigger supply headwind to us economic growth than the supply chain disruptions with nearly two job openings for every one unemployed american this condition may be the toughest to meet this summer but it is possible over the past 12 months the us labor force has added nearly three million people more are likely to enter if covid cases remain low or they feel the pressure of higher prices indeed the number of people who are not searching for work due to concerns over getting covid has dropped by one million since the start of the year according to the u s census bureau another million americans returning to the labor force through the early fall would help fill some of the job openings and thereby cool wage growth to a still healthy 4 pace according to my calculations wage growth at that rate would reduce the need for the federal reserve to raise rates to 4 or higher which could forcefully destroy labor demand all four of these conditions will need to be met in the months ahead in order for the us economy to avoid a recession taken together they would bring headline inflation down below 4 by the end of 2022 that would stabilize financial markets and improve consumer confidence later this summer indicators that the economy has avoided a recession soft landings are rarer than recessions and are far more difficult to navigate but even though the us economic expansion s path is narrowing the road ahead isn t blocked just yet the cnn wire 2022 cable news network inc a warnermedia company all rights reserved

it will surprise absolutely no one that twitter does not agree with elon musk s announcement that he is terminating his acquisition of the social media company in a letter dated july 10 and included in a regulatory filing on july 11 twitter s lawyers said musk is still obligated to continue with the deal mr musk s and the other musk parties purported termination is invalid and wrongful and it constitutes a repudiation of their obligations under the agreement contrary to the assertions in your letter twitter has breached none of its obligations under the agreement and twitter has not suffered and is not likely to suffer a company material adverse effect twitter s lawyers wrote shares of the company fell by more than 11 percent on monday but they still remain well above where most analysts think they would trade if the deal really did die analysts at mkm partners compared the company with peer valuations and found that the stock would likely find support around 24 to 26 per share if investors start to assign a greater probability that this merger will not happen the stock closed at 32 86 which would seem to indicate at least some hope remains that musk and twitter will work things out shares of tesla were down on monday that was unexpected the acquisition of twitter has generally been thought of as a distraction for musk from his car company and shares of tesla analysts have estimated the deal hurt tesla s value by 5 percent to 15 percent so the death of the deal would have been expected to give tesla a lift it may be that investors think fighting about whether the twitter deal really is terminated will be an even bigger distraction than actually buying the company it s almost hard to believe that it was just april when twitter seemed to be desperately trying to avoid being acquired by musk new york fed s consumer misery survey the federal reserve bank of new york today released the june 2022 survey of consumer expectations it showed an increase in short term inflation expectations but a decline in medium term and longer term inflation expectations the median one year ahead inflation expectations increased to 6 8 percent from 6 6 percent in may marking a new all time high in contrast median three year ahead inflation expectations decreased to 3 6 percent from 3 9 percent the five year ahead inflation expectations ticked down from 2 9 percent to 2 8 percent one way of interpreting the decline is as a vote of confidence that the fed will get inflation under control eventually less optimistically the long term estimate may have come down because people just cannot imagine prices will keep going up as fast as they have been so what gets added now has to be subtracted later unfortunately that s not what history suggests happens with inflation the new york fed s survey also picked up a pretty sizable increase in people saying they are worse off financially now than they were a year ago the shares of people saying they are somewhat worse off rose from 32 8 in may to 36 1 in june the share of those saying they are much worse off jumped from 13 percent to 15 2 percent this is the first time in a decade or so history of the surveys that a majority of americans have said they are worse off no wonder joe biden is the least popular president in 75 years
twitter says its 44 billion sale to elon musk is still on and it will go to court to make it happen despite the mercurial billionaire s declaration he is breaking it off the agreement is not terminated twitter s lawyers wrote in aletter to the tesla and spacex ceo on sunday disclosed in a filing on monday musk knowingly intentionally willfully and materially breached his agreement to buy the company they alleged twitter reserves all contractual legal and other rights including its right to specifically enforce the musk parties obligations under the agreement they wrote back in april musk launched a surprise bid tobuy twitter for 54 20 a share which the social media company initially resisted beforeaccepting musk has accused twitter of violating the sale agreement which he argued gives him grounds to walk away without paying a 1 billion penalty it all sets twitter and musk up for a lengthy and expensive legal battle in the delaware court of chancery which deals with corporate disputes the only sure winners in this situation are the lawyers said joseph grundfest a law professor at stanford and former commissioner at the securities and exchange commission because a lot of money is going to be spent litigating this question twitter will seek to force musk to go through with the deal legal experts say twitter has a strong case the agreement they signed includes a clause that allows twitter to sue to force musk to buy the company that means he promised to buy the company for a price well he d better show up and buy the company for that price grundfest said courts have forced buyers to complete deals even after they ve gotten cold feet in 2001 tyson foods tried to back out of an agreement to buy a meat processor after raising questions about its business but the delaware court ordered it to go through with the purchase forcing musk to buy twitter hinges on his financing for the deal remaining in place musk is on the hook to pay 33 5 billion himself and has lined up 13 billion in loans from banks one key question is will musk s declaration that he wants out of the deal cause the banks to change their minds the court could order musk to pay damages instead even though there is precedent to force a buyer to complete a deal donna hitscherich a professor at columbia business school said the court may be reluctant to do so typically the court is going to put the parties in the position they were in before the unhappy events occurred she said in that case the court might not order musk to buy twitter but could stick him with billions of dollars in damages while that would likely amount to less than the 44 billion musk agreed to pay it would avoid the awkward situation of forcing musk to buy a company he says he no longer wants to own musk has shown little interest in following legal orders after the sec fined him and tesla 40 million in 2018 over his claims he had funding secured to take the electric carmaker private the regulator said a lawyer needed to vet his tweets musk has been accused of violating that order and he s now trying to get his 2018 settlement with the sec thrown out musk will argue that twitter broke their agreement in his letter friday to twitter saying he was terminating the purchase musk accused the company of making false and misleading representations about its estimates of how many accounts on the platform are fake or spam he also accused twitter of refusing to share information that would help him verify its estimates and of violating other parts of the legal agreement while musk initially cited cleaning up twitter s longstanding problem of spam accounts and automated bots as a reason he wanted to buy the company in recent weeks he s flipped he now cites the issue as his rationale for backing out of the deal musk says he thinks the prevalence of fake and spam accounts on the platform is far higher than the 5 twitter estimates twitter has said it uses private data to make those estimates so they can t be easily replicated by outsiders legal experts say even if twitter s figures were incorrect that would probably not be a big enough problem to get musk out of his agreement to buy the company that s a pretty heavy lift said hitscherich there has to be something very very significant in the business for the courts to say you know what you re right the very nature of this contract has changed so substantially that you don t have to go through with it pressure could mount for a settlement many deal disputes end with a settlement involving a price cut that s what happened in 2020 when the luxury conglomerate lvmh moët hennessy louis vuitton tried to scupper an agreement to buy jewelry icon tiffany company but ultimately went through with the purchase at a 425 million discount accepting less than 54 20 a share from musk could open twitter up to lawsuits from unhappy shareholders still a settlement could spare both sides from further headaches and reputational damage some have speculated that musk has wanted to buy twitter for a lower price all along since he agreed to the deal global markets have fallen with tech stocks hit especially hard that s made a 44 billion price tag for twitter look more expensive even as the value of tesla shares musk s main source of wealth have plummeted it s hard to see twitter emerging from the legal battle as a winner even if it s a victor in court a protracted legal battle would weigh on the company morale has already taken a hit since the deal was announced some employees are wary of musk s potential ownership and the changes he s floated to protect his vision of free speech meanwhile twitter has been cutting costs including implementing a hiring freeze and even laying off some employees as it seeks to strengthen its business amid a weakening online advertising market no matter who ends up owning it a courtroom drama would cast a further cloud of uncertainty over the company how long do you want to go through with this hitscherich said you re taking your eye off the business everything that takes your eye off the business is an issue copyright 2022 npr to see more visit
house democrats aided by some republicans are using the pending 2023 defense bill to subordinate the careers of u s professionals to the interests of investors and fortune 500 executives the proposed amendment to the 2023 national defense authorization act would allow any alien with a claimed ph d in science to apply for a green card from the secretary of homeland security a position alejandro mayorkas currently holds the amendment sets the bar for migrants so low that it provides green cards to an unlimited number of indian chinese and other foreigners who earn degrees in their home country universities foreigners who get u s degrees from a lower tier historically black college or university in the united states would also be allowed to get green cards the amendment would also expand an existing law that allows u s ceos to hire foreign graduates with dangled promises of green cards that law is now used by executives to reward roughly 70 000 foreign graduates for taking jobs from u s professionals the three cornered amendment would allow government officials to flood the labor market and so suppress salaries for american professionals it would even make it more difficult for the professionals children to get places in good universities this is the kind of that when reported as the supporters are framing it sounds plausible enough said mark krikorian director of the center for immigration studies but he added there is literally no way that it would be limited it just cannot happen over and over and over again we ve seen immigration proposals that sound plausible on their face end up being perverted there ll be a guy who has a phd in economics and say well this is a stem field so okay and then there ll be a phd in home economics and they ll say well okay you too there s no way they ll limit it the democrat party is increasingly reliant on votes from white collar professionals yet it keeps trying to outsource their jobs to migrants said kevin lynn founder of u s tech workers what they re signaling is there is no place for professionals in the democratic party they re literally voting the professionals out of the party and replacing them with immigrants that can t vote the outsourcing amendment is being pushed by democrat reps zoe lofgren d ca and jim langevin d ri and by republican reps john curtis r ut and peter meijer r mi lofgren represents the investors in silicon valley who use visa workers to spike the stock value of their companies meijer is an heir of the wealthy meijer fortune he is facing a stiff primary challenge this year after already voting for a 2021 plan to massively increase the inflow of cheap blue collar migrants into jobs held by american residents of rural districts that cheap labor policy impoverishes rural districts because the migrants earn little and buy much less in local shops and communities the democrat run committee on rules will decide tuesday afternoon whether or not to allow the amendment and other migration related amendments to stay in the bill if they keep the lofgren measure it will pressure all democrats to publicly vote on the house floor against the core economic and civic interests of their professional class voters the committee is chaired by rep jim mcgovern d ma and it includes several pro migration democrats such as rep deborah ross d nc and rep joe neguse d co ross for example has drafted an amendment that would further reward indian graduates who take outsourced jobs from her home district american college graduate voters the reward would consist of guaranteed no cost green cards for their indian born children that government delivered reward is hugely valuable for indians so it serves as a hidden subsidy for the ceos who cheap indian graduates for jobs that can be done by american professionals in ross own district her giveaway amendment is backed by rep cindy axne d ia and gop rep brian patrick r pa another amendment would offer green cards to any russian with master s degrees in science and technology that amendment is being pushed by rep jackie speier d ca whose district includes part of silicon valley the gop minority on the rules committee is led by pro migration rep tom cole r ok but also includes rep michael burgess r tx the lofgren meijer amendment comes as west coast investors are lobbying congress to expand the inflow of foreign graduates for jobs that would otherwise go to u s professionals one of the leading investors is eric schmidt the former chairman of google he is now an investor who wants to maximize his supply of cheap controllable skilled labor in 2013 he helped form the secretive fwd us lobby group which consists of wealthy west coast investors such as bill gates and mark zuckerberg in 2015 schmidt called for the government to import more consumers for google s advertisers in 2020 schmidt demanded the importation of top tier talent to help u s companies outpace china s government aided companies many of which rely on chinese born u s trained workers however the visa worker programs cited by schmidt are mostly used by ceos to displace american professionals with inexperienced cheap and controllable foreign graduates from very low grade indian universities in 2022 schmidt pushed the claim that an uncapped inflow of foreign graduates is needed for national security jobs such as cyber security or for manufacturing computer chips that plan was added to an anti china technology bill by democratic leaders in the house but it has been rejected by gop senators principally sen chuck grassley r ia and sen todd young r in partly because the schmidt plan would sideline many professionals in their midwestern states this july schmidt is pushing two new claims via the london based financial times the first claim is that the foreign scientists will help launch a new industry in the united states eric schmidt former ceo of google became one of the wealthiest people in the us by specialising in software engineering yet if he was starting out again today schmidt says he would not be targeting bits and bytes alone the 67 year old thinks the next big thing is the bioeconomy not the internet one is the science has advanced more slowly than many hoped another is government regulation there s a more fundamental problem too whereas a couple of teenage computer nerds can build an internet company out of a garage creating a bioscience business requires lots of expertise specialised talent manufacturing plant capacity and time these are not things that the us venture capital industry that funded the tech revolution is widely used to handling however there is no shortage of trained u s college graduates with science technology engineering or math stem degrees a 2021 study by the census bureau reported that most work in non tech jobs the vast majority 62 of college educated workers who majored in a stem field were employed in non stem fields such as non stem management law education social work accounting or counseling in addition 10 of stem college graduates worked in stem related occupations such as health care the path to stem jobs for non stem majors was narrow only a few stem related majors 7 and non stem majors 6 ultimately ended up in stem occupations between 1982 and 2011 american universities awarded 800 000 ph d degrees in science and engineering lynn told breitbart news adding but there were only 100 000 tenured job openings this tells you there is a surplus of advanced stem degree holders in the u s as a result approximately one in five stem ph d s work in non stem non academic fields the joblessness rate among stem ph d s is only going to increase if immigration provisions ensure that anyone with a stem degree could come to the united states and get pushed to the front of the line but many u s technology graduates are pushed out of jobs by ceos preference for visa workers ceos prefer visa workers because their low salaries maximize stock prices and bonuses for example a brookings study said president donald trump s temporary 2020 curbs on visa workers cut 100 billion from the fortune 500 s stock value but those salary cuts caused by the employment of at least 1 5 million visa workers in the united states radiate into many other professional sectors most college graduates have actually seen their real incomes stagnate or even decline since 2000 new york times columnist paul krugman wrote in april 2022 executives also prefer visa workers because the foreign graduates cannot emulate the ability of u s professionals to form their own innovative companies that spur competition in the tech sector the visa workers cannot even quit not even complain about work hours or abuse because they need the ceos to approve green card applications it s imperative for policy makers to understand that foreign stem phd holders will not spur innovation said a june 9 letter by u s tech workers instead they ll keep innovation within the range of the status quo the executives also use the visa workers to subordinate demands by u s professionals that some company revenues be allocated to public priorities such as basic research information security crisis reliability and compliance with federal laws unsurprisingly companies that subordinate u s professionals tend to have more public disasters for example intel boeing theranos and ernst young faced with these congressional rejections schmidt and his lobbyists are also dangling the promise of high tech jobs to skeptical midwestern senators he told the july 6 financial times it s the new industrial age applied to the rural parts of america he told me noting that unlike current tech innovation these jobs are not in silicon valley and they re not in the north east they re in the republican states they re in the states with an awful lot of farming he hopes that the fact that these rural agricultural states tend to be red not blue gives his pitch bipartisan appeal since it will get republican politicians involved but top democrats aligned with president joe biden s east coast network openly oppose the displacement of u s graduates for example commerce secretary gine raimondo again spoke out fended off the pro migration push in an interview with nbc s chuck todd with respect to immigration you know that s an issue for congress to take up she said on july 10 schmidt and his fellow investors prefer to import foreign workers than to hire foreign graduates in their home countries regardless of the damage to u s professionals in general u s operations are less threatened by technology theft local rivals security failures and government regulations thes white collar migration amendments are more nails in the coffin of the professionals in the united states said lynn legislators and corporate lobbyists are stripping out that bottom rung and preventing americans from having careers in stem he said they know this is going on but the financial opportunities are just too great to not take advantage lynn said adding they re not rewarded by market share and productivity they re rewarded by earnings per share extraction migration since at least 1990 the d c establishment has extracted tens of millions of migrants and visa workers from poor countries to serve as legal or illegal workers temporary workers consumers and renters for various u s investors and ceos this federal economic policy of extraction migration has skewed the free market in the united states by inflating the labor supply for the benefit of employers the inflationary policy hurts ordinary americans because makes it difficult for them to get married advance in their careers raise families or buy homes extraction migration has also slowed innovation and shrunk americans productivity partly because it allows employers to boost stock prices by using cheap stoop labor instead of productivity boosting technology migration undermines employees workplace rights and it widens the regional wealth gaps between the democrats big coastal states and the republicans heartland and southern states the flood of cheap labor tilts the economy towards low productivity jobs and has shoved at least ten million american men out of the labor force
new gold reports second quarter operational results and provides update on 2022 operational outlook provides notice of release of second quarter financial results all amounts are in u s dollars unless otherwise indicated toronto july 11 2022 cnw new gold inc new gold or the company tsx ngd nyse american ngd reports second quarter operational results for the company as of june 30 2022 and provides an update to its 2022 operational outlook for the rainy river mine the new afton mine and the consolidated operational outlook the company is also providing notice that it will release its second quarter 2022 financial results before markets open on thursday august 4 2022 during the second quarter operations at the rainy river mine were adversely impacted by heavy rainfall and flooding around the fort frances area in northwestern ontario total tonnes mined from the open pit in the quarter were below expectations as flooding in the pit due to the unfavorable weather impacted the mining rate the mine sequencing and access to higher grade ore planned for the second half of the year the rainy river mine therefore utilized the low grade ore material during the quarter resulting in both lower grades processed and lower gold ounces produced the lower tonnes mined ore and waste year to date has caused a change to the mine plan for the remainder of 2022 the company s new chief operating officer is incorporating these impacts on the mine plan and together with newly hired operating expertise at the site will focus on positioning the open pit operations to its optimal conditions this change requires the operation to continue to process low grade ore material in the second half of 2022 as a result rainy river s gold equivalent1 production for 2022 is now expected to be between 230 000 to 250 000 ounces previously 265 000 to 295 000 ounces primarily due to lower gold production as well as current inflationary cost pressures operating expenses per gold eq ounce are now expected

impact to both production and costs during the second quarter new afton focused on b3 and c zone development and closed the low grade higher cost recovery level zone earlier than planned as a result of the early shutdown tonnes mined was lower than expected to maintain mill feed the operation utilized the low grade stockpile during the quarter resulting in lower grades and recoveries and ultimately lower production copper production guidance for 2022 is now expected to be between 25 to 35 million pounds previously 35 to 45 million pounds gold production is expected to be at the low end of the annual production guidance range of 35 000 to 45 000 ounces due to the lower production as well as current inflationary cost pressures operating expenses per gold eq ounce are now expected

leases and growth capital remain unchanged rainy river experienced challenges during the quarter as the fort frances area saw extreme rainfall and flooding stated renaud adams president ceo i remain confident about the increased production profile as outlined in rainy river s latest updated technical report announced earlier this year at new afton the planned closure of the lift 1 cave including the recovery level is now complete while we ve announced revisions to new afton s copper guidance for the year the priority remains on the b3 ramp up and advancing c zone development which remains on time for first ore in the second half of 2023 with another solid quarter of development prioritizing long term growth initiatives at both of our operations behind us i remain confident both are on the cusp of increasing production profiles leading to strong free cash flow generation for our company for multiple years to come concurrently our exploration efforts have continued to focus on high priority targets with a planned exploration update expected in the third quarter i believe there is additional value to unlock at our assets through substantial resource to reserve conversion and look

performance measure that does not have any standardized meaning under ifrs and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers new gold calculates all in sustaining costs per gold equivalent ounce based on guidance announced by the world gold council wgc in september 2013 the wgc is a non profit association of the world s leading gold mining companies established in 1987 to promote the use of gold to industry consumers and investors the wgc is not a regulatory body and does not have the authority to develop accounting standards or disclosure requirements the wgc has worked with its member companies to develop a measure that expands on ifrs measures to provide visibility into the economics of a gold mining company current ifrs measures used in the gold industry such as operating expenses do not capture all of the expenditures incurred to discover develop and sustain gold production new gold believes that all in sustaining costs per gold equivalent ounce provides further transparency into costs associated with producing gold and will assist analysts investors and other stakeholders of the company in assessing its operating performance its ability to generate free cash flow from current operations and its overall value in addition the human resources and compensation committee of the board of directors uses all in sustaining costs together with other measures in its company scorecard to set incentive compensation goals and assess performance all in sustaining costs per gold equivalent ounce is intended to provide additional information only and does not have any standardized meaning under ifrs and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other mining companies it should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with ifrs the measure is not necessarily indicative of cash flow from operations under ifrs or operating costs presented under ifrs new gold defines all in sustaining costs per gold equivalent ounce as the sum of total cash costs net of capital expenditures that are sustaining in nature corporate general and administrative costs capitalized and expensed exploration that is sustaining in nature lease payments that are sustaining in nature and environmental reclamation costs all divided by the total gold equivalent ounces sold to arrive at a per ounce figure the definition of sustaining versus non sustaining is similarly applied to capitalized and expensed exploration costs and lease payments exploration costs and lease payments to develop new operations or that relate to major projects at existing operations where these projects are expected to materially increase production are classified as non sustaining and are excluded gold equivalent ounces of copper and silver produced or sold in a quarter are computed using a consistent ratio of copper and silver prices to the gold price and multiplying this ratio by the pounds of copper and silver ounces produced or sold during that quarter costs excluded from all in sustaining costs are non sustaining capital expenditures non sustaining lease payments and exploration costs financing costs tax expense and transaction costs associated with mergers acquisitions and divestitures and any items that are deducted for the purposes of adjusted earnings sustaining capital and sustaining leases sustaining capital and sustaining lease are non gaap financial performance measures that do not have any standardized meaning under ifrs and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers new gold defines sustaining capital as net capital expenditures that are intended to maintain operation of its gold producing assets similarly a sustaining lease is a lease payment that is sustaining in nature to determine sustaining capital expenditures new gold uses cash flow related to mining interests from its consolidated statement of cash flows and deducts any expenditures that are capital expenditures to develop new operations or capital expenditures related to major projects at existing operations where these projects will materially increase production management uses sustaining capital and sustaining lease to understand the aggregate net result of the drivers of all in sustaining costs other than total cash costs these measures are intended to provide additional information only and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for measures of performance prepared in accordance with ifrs growth capital growth capital is a non gaap financial performance measure that does not have any standardized meaning under ifrs and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by

twitter says its 44 billion sale to elon musk is still on and it will go to court to make it happen despite the mercurial billionaire s declaration he is breaking it off the agreement is not terminated twitter s lawyers wrote in aletter to the tesla and spacex ceo on sunday disclosed in a filing on monday musk knowingly intentionally willfully and materially breached his agreement to buy the company they alleged twitter reserves all contractual legal and other rights including its right to specifically enforce the musk parties obligations under the agreement they wrote back in april musk launched a surprise bid tobuy twitter for 54 20 a share which the social media company initially resisted beforeaccepting musk has accused twitter of violating the sale agreement which he argued gives him grounds to walk away without paying a 1 billion penalty it all sets twitter and musk up for a lengthy and expensive legal battle in the delaware court of chancery which deals with corporate disputes the only sure winners in this situation are the lawyers said joseph grundfest a law professor at stanford and former commissioner at the securities and exchange commission because a lot of money is going to be spent litigating this question twitter will seek to force musk to go through with the deal legal experts say twitter has a strong case the agreement they signed includes a clause that allows twitter to sue to force musk to buy the company that means he promised to buy the company for a price well he d better show up and buy the company for that price grundfest said courts have forced buyers to complete deals even after they ve gotten cold feet in 2001 tyson foods tried to back out of an agreement to buy a meat processor after raising questions about its business but the delaware court ordered it to go through with the purchase forcing musk to buy twitter hinges on his financing for the deal remaining in place musk is on the hook to pay 33 5 billion himself and has lined up 13 billion in loans from banks one key question is will musk s declaration that he wants out of the deal cause the banks to change their minds the court could order musk to pay damages instead even though there is precedent to force a buyer to complete a deal donna hitscherich a professor at columbia business school said the court may be reluctant to do so typically the court is going to put the parties in the position they were in before the unhappy events occurred she said in that case the court might not order musk to buy twitter but could stick him with billions of dollars in damages while that would likely amount to less than the 44 billion musk agreed to pay it would avoid the awkward situation of forcing musk to buy a company he says he no longer wants to own musk has shown little interest in following legal orders after the sec fined him and tesla 40 million in 2018 over his claims he had funding secured to take the electric carmaker private the regulator said a lawyer needed to vet his tweets musk has been accused of violating that order and he s now trying to get his 2018 settlement with the sec thrown out musk will argue that twitter broke their agreement in his letter friday to twitter saying he was terminating the purchase musk accused the company of making false and misleading representations about its estimates of how many accounts on the platform are fake or spam he also accused twitter of refusing to share information that would help him verify its estimates and of violating other parts of the legal agreement while musk initially cited cleaning up twitter s longstanding problem of spam accounts and automated bots as a reason he wanted to buy the company in recent weeks he s flipped he now cites the issue as his rationale for backing out of the deal musk says he thinks the prevalence of fake and spam accounts on the platform is far higher than the 5 twitter estimates twitter has said it uses private data to make those estimates so they can t be easily replicated by outsiders legal experts say even if twitter s figures were incorrect that would probably not be a big enough problem to get musk out of his agreement to buy the company that s a pretty heavy lift said hitscherich there has to be something very very significant in the business for the courts to say you know what you re right the very nature of this contract has changed so substantially that you don t have to go through with it pressure could mount for a settlement many deal disputes end with a settlement involving a price cut that s what happened in 2020 when the luxury conglomerate lvmh moët hennessy louis vuitton tried to scupper an agreement to buy jewelry icon tiffany company but ultimately went through with the purchase at a 425 million discount accepting less than 54 20 a share from musk could open twitter up to lawsuits from unhappy shareholders still a settlement could spare both sides from further headaches and reputational damage some have speculated that musk has wanted to buy twitter for a lower price all along since he agreed to the deal global markets have fallen with tech stocks hit especially hard that s made a 44 billion price tag for twitter look more expensive even as the value of tesla shares musk s main source of wealth have plummeted it s hard to see twitter emerging from the legal battle as a winner even if it s a victor in court a protracted legal battle would weigh on the company morale has already taken a hit since the deal was announced some employees are wary of musk s potential ownership and the changes he s floated to protect his vision of free speech meanwhile twitter has been cutting costs including implementing a hiring freeze and even laying off some employees as it seeks to strengthen its business amid a weakening online advertising market no matter who ends up owning it a courtroom drama would cast a further cloud of uncertainty over the company how long do you want to go through with this hitscherich said you re taking your eye off the business everything that takes your eye off the business is an issue copyright 2022 npr to see more visit
