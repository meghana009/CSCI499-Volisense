two more large san francisco hotels are changing hands with park hotels resorts announcing tuesday it is selling the 360 room le meridien san francisco and the 171 room hotel adagio in separate transactions to undisclosed buyers but rather than being another harbinger of doom experts say the sales prices are an encouraging sign of the hospitality industry s belief in san francisco s near term value and potential for a robust recovery the deals also provide a contrast to a recent report showing the city as having the most the steepest fall in revenue per available room in the country the total proceeds on the sales will be 303 5 million or about 572 000 per key for the le meridien which sits on battery street near embarcadero center gross proceeds will be 221 5 million about 615 000 per key for the adagio located west of union square gross proceeds will be 82 million about 480 000 per key the sales are expected to close in the next 60 days park hotels nyse pk said the capitalization rate on 2019 net operating income was 5 9 and 6 6 respectively itself perhaps an indication that 2020 is viewed as more anomaly than prevailing norm alan reay president of atlas hospitality a hotel consulting company said the sales prices were as if covid never happened and are on par with what one would have expected in 2018 or 2019 if closed at these prices it will set a new watermark for prices on city center hotels in my opinion reay told me according to reay s research the per key prices would be the highest of any urban hotel sale nationally so far this year he found only two other comparable urban hotels the salisbury in new york and le merigot in santa monica selling for more than 400 000 per key in short it s a huge endorsement of how people see the city of san francisco and how quickly they expect it to return and be when taking into account what the properties are currently running in terms of occupancy and lead time for convention business and business travel to return reay said comparable key prices are likely to increase anywhere from 5 to 15 going forward that would indicate a robust faith in san francisco s prospects given reay s best case scenario of the city s hotels facing another nine to 12 months of diminished occupancy before 2019 numbers are feasible hotels in urban markets face a steep road to recovery while coastal hotels particularly those in drive to markets are in the sharp upswing of a v shaped recovery with locations like monterey la jolla and laguna beach seeing some of their highest revenues ever he added a hotel in big sur just set a record for a resort hotel without a casino of 2 5 million a key while a sonoma county hotel also sold for more than 2 million a key earlier this year what we re seeing today is a tremendous amount of capital that was raised in anticipation of a tidal wave of distressed hotel assets and foreclosures and that never materialized reay said so you have this money on the sidelines that needs to be placed and other buyers that are looking to grow the company park hotels headquartered in mclean virginia is san francisco s largest hotel property owner by room count in large part due to owning two of the bay area s two biggest hotels the 1 921 room hilton san francisco union square and 1 024 room hilton parc 55 just a block away from each other downtown the reit acquired le meridien and adagio in 2019 via a merger with chesapeake lodging trust it still owns two other san francisco properties obtained in that deal jw marriott san francisco union square 344 rooms and hyatt centric fisherman s wharf 316 rooms while reducing exposure for park hotels in the city the sales also offer a chance for others to gain a foothold in the market through acquisition rather than ground up development with exorbitant costs of lumber steel and labor these days reay estimated that permit maze aside new builds would likely pencil at over 1 million per key the move follows recent hotel shuffling from the city s other major hotel property owner pebblebrook hotel trust which unloaded the 416 room kimpton sir francis drake this spring and put the 189 room villa florence san francisco on union square on the market park hotels said in a statement that proceeds from the sales would be used to partially repay debt currently outstanding on its one remaining bank term loan it s unknown if that debt relates to the 725 million commercial mortgage backed securities cmbs loan park hotels borrowed from jp morgan chase co in 2016 and which is anchored by the hilton union square and parc 55 last year that loan landed on an industry watchlist for default risk although it appears park has remained consistent on payments throughout the pandemic park hotels was not immediately available for comment but i ll update this story if i hear back in its announcement park hotels said it has reopened 54 of its 57 hotel nationwide or about 90 of its total room count and expects that once the financials are fully assessed it will have broken even at the corporate level in june compared with its 15 million burn rate in may occupancy at 50 hotels nationwide hit 49 8 in june and an estimated 59 for those open the entire month while average june revpar exceeded 2019 levels in nearly 20 of hotels one of the three properties still offline is the parc 55 which has once again pushed back its reopening date this time to september per its website

wall street stocks retreated from records tuesday while the dollar rallied after data showed the biggest jump in us inflation in more than a decade the consumer price index cpi spiked 5 4 percent in the 12 months ended in june not seasonally adjusted the highest rate since august 2008 the labor department said after major european bourses finished unchanged all three main us indices pulled back from records with the dow shedding 0 3 percent while it s easy to explain away a lot of the pieces that made that print it s certainly added some concern to the broader market in general that perhaps inflation will be less transitory than we thought art hogan of national securities said the fed has said repeatedly that stiff increases in consumer prices will be transitory and so far the markets have largely accepted that argument but if today s number doesn t mark the high water mark then fed officials may start to shift a little bit more uncomfortably as we head into the autumn commented michael hewson market analyst at cmc markets for now markets are buying the transitory narrative however if the current trend continues transitory will be doing a lot more heavy lifting than it is doing now he added while us stocks fell the decline was modest said kathy lien foreign exchange analyst at bk asset management in contrast to the dollar which was sharply higher after the report investors are keen to hear from fed chair jerome powell who will testify in congress on wednesday she said the us dollar will give back gains if powell downplays cpi but if he suggests the taper is right around the corner the dollar could extend higher quickly lien wrote elsewhere oil prices rose after the international energy agency pointed to surging demand last month and expected more growth ahead the oil market could get a lot tighter very quickly and that could mean the recent pullback might have run its course said edward moya an analyst at oanda major us companies are reporting second quarter earnings this week and before markets opened goldman sachs and jpmorgan chase announced soaring profits compared with the same period of 2020 however goldman s stock closed 1 2 percent lower and jpmorgan lost 1 5 percent in what hogan said was a sell the news reaction that is a consequence of investors pricing in the positive performance boeing lost 4 2 percent after saying it will temporarily reduce production of its 787 dreamliner after identifying a new issue with the jet during inspections new york dow down 0 3 percent at 34 888 79 close new york s p 500 down 0 4 percent at 4 369 21 close new york nasdaq down 0 4 percent at 14 677 65 close london ftse 100 flat at 7 124 72 close frankfurt dax 30 flat at 15 789 64 close paris cac 40 flat at 6 558 47 close euro stoxx 50 flat at 4 094 56 close tokyo nikkei 225 up 0 5 percent at 28 718 24 close hong kong hang seng index up 1 6 percent at 27 963 41 close shanghai composite up 0 5 percent at 3 566 52 close euro dollar down at 1 1787 from 1 1861 at 2100 gmt pound dollar down at 1 3810 from 1 3883 euro pound down at 85 26 from 85 43 pence dollar yen up at 110 62 from 110 37 yen brent north sea crude up 1 8 percent at 76 49 per barrel west texas intermediate up 1 6 percent at 75 25 per barrel

by scottie andrew cnn a few times a year over utah s mountainous lakes it rains fish fish are not meant to fly of course but when the utah division of wildlife resources needs to restock the state s high elevation lakes and streams with tiny trout it will often dump them from a low flying plane into the water over 100 feet below the process according to the wildlife agency is surprisingly painless and generally survivable for the little fish the wildlife division shared a video this month of the aerial stocking process the method by which fish are strewn from the sky slowed down in parts to show the fish frenziedly flopping in as they re released the footage is then sped up again to prove just how quickly the plane gets the job done at first glance the trail of airborne fish more closely resembles steam or smoke than a deluge of trout it s an unusual sight but aerial restocking happens several times a year and has been in practice since the 1950s according to the division pilots can dump up to 35 000 trout into 40 to 60 lakes within a few hours a process that is speedier and more efficient than pumping fish through a pipe that empties into a lake the common method for restocking lakes accessible by cars many lakes and streams in the state reside in its mountains and aren t reachable by roads so pilots hover around 150 feet above these lakes to deposit the fish semi gently into their new homes about 95 of the fish survive the drop the wildlife division told cnn in 2018 though they re falling from a great height the stocking process takes just a few hours which means the fish spend less time waiting to drop that means they won t feel as stressed and more of them will survive the transfer according to the division it s also less tedious for wildlife officials to drop them in this way than the old method of carrying them on horseback aerial stocking can take place a few times every year usually starting in july rainbow brook and tiger trout are plopped into the mountain lakes these fish are around just 2 to 3 inches in length which the division says helps them flutter down slowly into the water the native fish begin their lives in hatcheries cnn affiliate kstu reported in 2014 oblivious that they will soon be airborne they ll stay there until july when the aerial stocking season starts the rainbow brook and tiger trout are sent out first later in the season cutthroat trout join the mix it s good news for fishing enthusiasts and other native species when more native fish enter the water the primary reason the division stocks fish is to make sure there s enough animals available for recreational fishing the division said last year and the fish it stocks are often sterile so they can t repopulate lakes on their own other species like the cutthroat trout are released to prey on other fish whose populations may grow too large throwing their ecosystems out of whack some fish just need the extra boost to their ailing populations the division reported as for the fish they re acclimated to the water temperatures before their fall and studied after the drop to see how many survived they serve a purpose for utah residents and other native species that rely on them and they fulfill that purpose after a few seconds of falling from the sky the cnn wire 2021 cable news network inc a warnermedia company all rights reserved

covered rasier llc rasier a subsidiary of the ride sharing company uber technologies inc together with rasier uber until that time ride sharing insurance had only covered claims incurred while ride sharing drivers were transporting passengers for uber thus leaving a gap in coverage for accidents caused by ride sharing drivers while they were not providing transportation services for hire but were still logged on to the uber applications and available to accept a ride uber was james river s largest contract and accounted for more than 25 of its premiums in 2019 the class period commences on august 1 2019 the day after james river issued a press release after market hours that reported unfavorable reserve development of 2 3 million compared to unfavorable reserve development of 2 2

crude oil has been having a great 2021 so far a very different situation to last year s when the pandemic devastated demand for all commodities fueling a price rout that lasted well into 2020 now commodities are back with a vengeance and nowhere is this vengeance clearer than in oil crude has become the hottest commodity for traders in the past few weeks as surging demand has topped all expectations sparking a run on oil futures according to a recent wall street journal report in mid june the ratio of bullish to bearish bets on oil in new york stood at a staggering 23 to 1 this compares with a ratio of 6 to 1 at the beginning of the year this is the speculative component of the price rally and it is certainly a big component but the fundamental component is a big one too opec stunned everyone earlier this month when it failed to reach an agreement on how to proceed with its production control beyond the current month the uae a dissenter who had already criticized some aspects of the production cut deal this time really dug its heels in and refused to make any concessions until concessions were made to it the latest update from this front is that the members of the oil producing cartel have yet to make progress on the deal according to unnamed sources familiar with the situation who spoke to reuters this week the sources said russia had been trying to bring the uae and saudi arabia together to the negotiations table but was apparently having trouble succeeding so a new meeting of opec was unlikely this week related a contrarian investor s approach to opec s oil spat meanwhile however there have been headwinds at play too namely fresh worry that the delta variant of the coronavirus could reverse the global economic recovery that has driven the surge in oil demand that few expected because of this worry reuters reported monday oil started the week with a loss although a minor one at less than a percentage point for both brent crude and west texas intermediate on the stock market oil traders have been taking profits this has weighed on oil prices as well per reuters john kemp last week hedge funds sold a total 34 million barrels of wti and 5 million barrels of brent as well as 14 million barrels of u s gasoline the selloff kemp noted came from the closing of bulling positions to the tune of 55 million barrels and not the opening of bearish ones suggesting sentiment remained upbeat on the whole according to the wall street journal however there may be a ticking bomb hiding among all these oil bets that ticking bomb would be the option that many traders have been using to bet on oil reaching 100 by the end of 2022 analysts are concerned that a reversal of oil s fortunes would lead to an options selloff which due to the size of the options market in oil right now would send ripples across financial markets in all fairness the chances of a sudden drop in oil prices are slimmer than they would normally be during a rally caused mostly by tightening supply normally higher prices lead to greater production this time however higher production is not coming u s shale producers are being extra careful and are not in a hurry to bring back too many barrels supermajors are being targeted by activist shareholders to reduce their output rather than boost it there s iranian oil that a couple of months ago many expected to quickly return to legal global markets but it appears that it will take a while yet for iran and the united states to seal a deal that would make this possible wild price swings are likely to continue as speculators try to make the best of the oil rally by irina slav for oilprice com advertisement more top reads from oilprice com
abigail spanberger d va 07 led the introduction of a bipartisan bill that would prohibit insurers and pharmacy benefit managers from hurting hospitals and clinics that participate in the federal 340b drug pricing program spanberger introduced the legislation alongside david b mckinley r wv 01 the preserving rules ordered for the entities covered through protect 340b act is in response to concerns from central virginia healthcare providers particularly those in rural areas who have seen their access to the program threatened by pbms insurers and pharmaceutical manufacturers the protect 340b act would prohibit health insurers and pbms from discriminating against 340b providers or their contract pharmacies on the basis of their status as providers or pharmacies that dispense 340b drugs specifically the legislation would prevent companies from treating 340b providers differently with regards to reimbursement of fees participation in standard or preferred networks inventory management systems and it would block them from interfering in a patients choice to receive drugs from a 340b pharmacy the 340b program allows central virginia clinics and hospital systems to provide lower cost prescription drugs for our region s patients especially those in rural communities however the rising trend of 340b pick pocketing by third parties threatens to undermine these savings and put the financial security of patients and providers at risk congress did not intend for 340b savings to subsidize for profit insurance companies and pharmacy benefit managers said spanberger our bipartisan bill would hold health insurance companies and pbms accountable for trying to unfairly target and raid these savings by leveling the playing field for 340b pharmacies and providers our bipartisan bill would help protect the availability of discounted prescription drugs at virginia hospitals hiv aids clinics and rural healthcare providers i would like to thank congressman mckinley for his partnership in introducing this bipartisan bill the 340b drug pricing program is a vital part of many rural and underserved areas without it many providers would not be able to provide critical

provide vital services our bipartisan bill will hold pharmaceutical companies accountable and ensure access to affordable medicine virginia commonwealth university health system commends rep spanberger for her recent introduction of the protect 340b act said dr arthur kellermann senior vice president vcu health sciences ceo vcu health the 340b drug pricing program enables vcu health system the commonwealth s largest safety net provider to provide free or deeply discounted prescriptions to our patients with the greatest financial need it also allows us to engage in vital community outreach with our most underserved patients as we attempt to alleviate social stressors that may negatively impact their overall health we are grateful to rep spanberger for her continued unwavering support of this critically important safety net program the 340b program has been a lifeline for federally qualified community health centers like central virginia health services said paula tomko ceo central virginia health services over the past several years changes to the program have had a significant impact on health centers which have trickled down to our patients cvhs appreciates the work that congresswoman spanberger and her bipartisan team of legislators are doing through the protect 340b act to help hold the 340b program to its original intent helping safety net providers provide health care services to the various vulnerable populations they serve the safety net providers utilize these savings to help vulnerable patient populations stay compliant with medications and assist with management of chronic diseases the work the safety net providers do with these savings helps to reduce cost to the whole health care system not increase shareholder profits the aha thanks reps spanberger and mckinley for leading this important bipartisan effort to prohibit discriminatory actions including by insurers against 340b hospitals said stacey hughes vice president american hospital association importantly this bill also provides for the imposition of civil monetary penalties against those that violate these new protections america s essential hospitals thanks reps mckinley and

serve said dr bruce siegel president ceo america s essential hospitals nachc applauds reps mckinley and spanberger for their leadership on introducing the protect 340b act which prohibits discriminatory 340b reimbursement policies against community health centers the introduction of this legislation is monumental and ensures health centers 340b savings are protected and can be reinvested to expand much needed patient care services in medically underserved communities said tom van coverden president ceo national association of community health centers pharmacy services is a key component of the community health center model because of this legislation millions of patients who otherwise would not be able to afford their prescription drug medication now have access to the same affordable drugs as non 340b providers resulting in better health outcomes affordability and equity on behalf of our nation s 1 400 community health centers and their 30 million medically underserved patients i enthusiastically support the protect 340b act of 2021 said colleen meiman national policy advisor state associations of community health centers this bill will ensure that 340b savings remain where congress intended with chcs and other safety net providers who use them to expand access to care for low income and underserved patients for too long pbms and private insurers have been able to pick pocket these savings away from chcs using them to line their own pockets we are enormously grateful to reps spanberger and mckinley for their continued leadership to ensure that 340b benefits underserved patients rather than boosting the profits of middlemen nrha applauds reps spanberger and mckinley for their continued leadership to uphold the integrity of the 340b drug pricing program unfortunately the 340b drug pricing program a critical lifeline for rural providers has been under attack from pharmacy benefit managers and large pharmaceutical manufacturers in recent months protect 340b act will protect covered entities especially those in rural areas from the litany of attacks aimed at undermining the integrity of this lifeline program said alan morgan ceo national rural health association we appreciate reps spanberger and mckinley s continued leadership on protecting safety net hospitals health centers and clinics from the damaging actions of pharmacy benefit managers and other third party payers by ensuring a level playing field this legislation will support the critical mission of 340b hospitals to serve patients living with low income and those

by scottie andrew cnn a few times a year over utah s mountainous lakes it rains fish fish are not meant to fly of course but when the utah division of wildlife resources needs to restock the state s high elevation lakes and streams with tiny trout it will often dump them from a low flying plane into the water over 100 feet below the process according to the wildlife agency is surprisingly painless and generally survivable for the little fish the wildlife division shared a video this month of the aerial stocking process the method by which fish are strewn from the sky slowed down in parts to show the fish frenziedly flopping in as they re released the footage is then sped up again to prove just how quickly the plane gets the job done at first glance the trail of airborne fish more closely resembles steam or smoke than a deluge of trout it s an unusual sight but aerial restocking happens several times a year and has been in practice since the 1950s according to the division pilots can dump up to 35 000 trout into 40 to 60 lakes within a few hours a process that is speedier and more efficient than pumping fish through a pipe that empties into a lake the common method for restocking lakes accessible by cars many lakes and streams in the state reside in its mountains and aren t reachable by roads so pilots hover around 150 feet above these lakes to deposit the fish semi gently into their new homes about 95 of the fish survive the drop the wildlife division told cnn in 2018 though they re falling from a great height the stocking process takes just a few hours which means the fish spend less time waiting to drop that means they won t feel as stressed and more of them will survive the transfer according to the division it s also less tedious for wildlife officials to drop them in this way than the old method of carrying them on horseback aerial stocking can take place a few times every year usually starting in july rainbow brook and tiger trout are plopped into the mountain lakes these fish are around just 2 to 3 inches in length which the division says helps them flutter down slowly into the water the native fish begin their lives in hatcheries cnn affiliate kstu reported in 2014 oblivious that they will soon be airborne they ll stay there until july when the aerial stocking season starts the rainbow brook and tiger trout are sent out first later in the season cutthroat trout join the mix it s good news for fishing enthusiasts and other native species when more native fish enter the water the primary reason the division stocks fish is to make sure there s enough animals available for recreational fishing the division said last year and the fish it stocks are often sterile so they can t repopulate lakes on their own other species like the cutthroat trout are released to prey on other fish whose populations may grow too large throwing their ecosystems out of whack some fish just need the extra boost to their ailing populations the division reported as for the fish they re acclimated to the water temperatures before their fall and studied after the drop to see how many survived they serve a purpose for utah residents and other native species that rely on them and they fulfill that purpose after a few seconds of falling from the sky the cnn wire 2021 cable news network inc a warnermedia company all rights reserved

as i wrote in the summer of 2018 on cd i ve probably created and posted more than 3 000 graphics on cd twitter and facebook including charts graphs tables figures maps and venn diagrams over the last 15 years of all of those graphics i don t think any has gotten more attention links re tweets re posts and mentions than previous versions of the chart above which was once referred to as the chart of the century here are some examples of the attention that past versions of the chart above have gotten a multi colored graphic that s made the rounds at the federal reserve hints at what chairman jerome powell could face if president donald trump succeeds in throwing globalization into reverse higher prices for many goods and potentially faster inflation plugged as possibly the chart of the century by economist and originator mark perry it shows that prices of goods subject to foreign competition think toys and television sets have tumbled over the past two decades as trade barriers have come down around the world prices of so called non tradeables hospital stays and college tuition to name two have surged that report was followed with a cbs moneywatch article inflation risks trade war costs make fed s job much harder a chart that has been making the rounds at the fed from economist mark perry shows how falling prices for trade sensitive things like tv sets and toys have helped offset rising costs for things like medical services housing and education clemson university economist bruce yandle featured the chart in a march 2019 washington examiner op ed titled rising prices global competition and the chart of the century american enterprise institute economist mark j perry is highly and justifiably respected for his ability to convey complicated economic relationships by way of rather simple charts and graphs the most famous example of this shown here is called by some the chart of the century the high praise comes about because the chart is loaded with information regarding the types of challenges faced by the fed and other washington policymakers perry s most recent version reports price increases from 1998 through 2018 for 14 categories of goods and services along with the average wage and overall consumer price index based on today s bls report on cpi price data through june 2021 i ve updated the chart above with price changes through the middle of this year during the most recent 21 5 year period from january 2000 to june 2021 the cpi for all items increased by 60 1 and the chart displays the relative price increases over that time period for 14 selected consumer goods and services and for average hourly wages seven of those goods and services have increased more than average inflation of 60 1 led by huge increases in hospital services 207 5 college tuition 172 and college textbooks 153 followed by increases in medical care services 119 child care 107 5 housing 68 and food and beverages 66 average wages have also increased more than average inflation since january 2000 by almost 87 indicating that hourly wages have increased 27 more over the last two decades than the average increase in consumer prices the other seven price series have been flat or have declined since january 2000 led by tvs 97 toys 73 computer software 70 5 and cell phone services 40 the cpi series for new cars household furnishings furniture appliances window coverings lamps dishes etc and clothing have remained relatively flat for the last 21 5 years because average consumer prices increased by 60 and wages by 87 since 2000 the real prices of all seven of those consumer goods and services in blue above have fallen significantly and have gotten increasingly more affordable over time various observations that have been made about the huge divergence in price patterns over the last several decades displayed in the chart include 1 the greater lower the degree of government involvement in the provision of a good or service the greater lower the price increases decreases over time e g hospital and medical costs college tuition childcare with both large degrees of government funding regulation and large price increases vs software electronics toys cars and clothing with both relatively less government funding regulation and falling prices as somebody on twitter commented blue lines prices subject to free market forces red lines prices subject to regulatory capture by government food and beverages are debatable either way conclusion remind me why socialism is so great again 2 prices for manufactured goods cars clothing appliances furniture electronic goods toys have experienced large price declines over time relative to overall inflation wages and prices for services education medical care and childcare 3 the greater the degree of international competition for tradeable goods the greater the decline in prices over time e g toys clothing tvs appliances furniture footwear new cares etc what s new 4 the price series that has shown the greatest change in recent years is the cpi for educational books mostly college textbooks textbook prices rose an average of nearly 6 annually between january 2000 and december 2016 nearly three times average annual inflation during that period of just over 2 but starting in early 2017 the cpi for educational books flattened for the first time ever and has now been generally trending downward see chart above on an average annual basis the cpi for educational books declined in both 2019 1 5 and 2020 1 1 following small increases in 2017 1 6 and 2018 1 0 those small positive increases followed by two consecutive annual decreases have been an unprecedented departure from a half century of increases in educational book prices that averaged 6 3 between 1968 and 2016 the flattening of the cpi for educational books over the last 5 5 years is truly unprecedented and remarkable we can expect future declines in the prices of college textbooks as the traditional textbook market faces increasingly tough and disruptive competition from alternative options including hundreds of open textbooks that have been funded published and licensed to be freely used adapted and distributed the university of minnesota s center for open education maintains an open textbook library website that lists hundreds of textbooks in more than 40 academic subjects that are available for free online or as a pdf file or as a print copy at a low cost 33 50 for print copies from openstax just in the field of economics there are 27 free open textbooks for economics courses including principles of microeconomics principles of macroeconomics international economics money and banking economic analysis and principles of political economy based on the evidence in the chart above showing stagnating and now falling college textbook prices following half a century of rising prices hurricane joseph schumpeter appears to be hitting the college textbook market with a very large tsunami of creative destruction called the open textbook effect 5 the annual increase in college tuition and fees of only 0 78 in 2020 was the smallest annual increase in the history of the cpi for college tuition and fees going back to 1978 and the only annual increase ever below 1 in each of the last six months this year the annual increases in college tuition have been less than 0 50 which like the declines in college textbook prices is unprecedented and remarkable the recent unprecedented small increases in college tuition are way far below the average annual increase in college tuition of nearly 7 over the last 42 years so perhaps the higher education bubble is finally starting to show signs of deflating and we can expect that bubble to continue to deflate as a result of the new pressure from the coronavirus pandemic on higher education that has accelerated the downward trend in college enrollment that has been ongoing for the last decade 6 the recent annual increases through june in new car prices 5 3 clothing prices 4 9 and prices for household furnishings 4 1 have all set multi decade highs although partly because of unusually low price indexes for some goods a year ago during the pandemic but those increases also might be a cause for concern voiced by many economists about rising inflation in the future alleviating those inflationary concerns somewhat is the relatively modest inflationary expectations in the bond market currently at only about 2 5 over the next five years based on the 5 year breakeven inflation rate for indexed vs regular treasury securities mp i ll continue to update the price chart every six months look for the next version on cd in january 2022 with data through december 2021

by emma farge geneva reuters negotiators are hoping the world trade organization will on thursday not only deal a major blow to overfishing after 20 years of trying but in doing so also dispel doubts about its own usefulness the global trade watchdog whose 164 members are also at loggerheads over how it should settle disputes has not clinched a major trade deal for years and analysts say it needs to land one this year to maintain its credibility the prize could be a sharp reduction of the widespread fishing subsidies that are generally held to be the single biggest factor in depleting the world s fish stocks the wto says it is on the cusp of a deal director general ngozi okonjo iweala said the ministerial meeting being held virtually should kick us along the path towards agreement before a november session intended to seal the deal some delegates are privately more sceptical saying there is still a gulf in views over the allocation of subsidies between wealthy members such as the european union on one side and developing countries such as india on the other many members feel that the larger subsidisers should make larger cuts to their subsidies given the worldwide impact of their fishing both historical and current whereas many developing countries feel the rules should be different for them said alice tipping from the international institute for sustainable development a confidential proposal in may by african caribbean and pacific countries seen by reuters seeks exemptions for members that take less than 2 5 of the global catch which others say would undermine the whole deal race to the bottom while china is the biggest single subsidiser it accounts for only 21 of the 35 4 billion that countries and trading blocs around the world including the eu and japan spend propping up their fleets every year according to a 2019 study by academics from universities and institutes in canada china and the united states meanwhile sustainable fish stocks have plunged from 90 of the total in 1990 to below 66 in 2017 the u n food and agriculture organization says a 2018 study by american canadian and australian based researchers found that much fishing in international waters the high seas would be unprofitable without state handouts in the waters in countries from which fleets emanate the stocks are devastated so they have to go elsewhere and they compete with each other said daniel pauly a fisheries biologist at the university of british columbia in canada expressing particular concern about tuna this is a race to the bottom tipping says the wto is closer than ever to a deal but that a draft text still has 84 places where there is no agreement yet negotiators say china could help by dropping its opposition to subsidies on the high seas and the eu could likewise drop its opposition to fuel subsidies some also want washington to budge possibly by dropping its proposal on curbing forced labour another cost saving measure that spurs overfishing this is the last chance for a deal said friends of ocean action s remi parmentier if not there s an existential crisis at the wto additional reporting by philip blenkinsop in brussels editing by kevin liffey
file in this may 5 2019 file photo warren buffett chairman and ceo of berkshire hathaway smiles as he plays bridge following the annual berkshire hathaway shareholders meeting in omaha neb buffetts company is abandoning its purchase of a natural gas pipeline from dominion energy because of uncertainty about whether the deal could get regulatory approval berkshire hathaway inc will receive a 1 3 billion refund on the proposed purchase of questar pipelines that was also supposed to include 430 million of dominions debt when it was announced a year ago ap photo nati harnik file omaha neb federal regulators say berkshire hathaway s 1 3 billion deal to buy a natural gas pipeline from dominion energy that fell apart this week should have never been attempted because a similar deal drew strong opposition in the past the acting director of the federal trade commission s bureau of competition holly vedova said tuesday that the companies involved should have known that the deal was unlikely to get approved because the agency previously opposed a similar combination involving dominion s questar pipeline and berkshire s kern river pipeline recommended videos it is disappointing that the ftc had to expend significant resources to review this transaction when we previously filed suit in 1995 to block the same combination vedova said given our prior action and the even closer competition that developed between the pipelines since then this is representative of the type of transaction that should not make it out of the boardroom vedova noted the kern river and questar pipelines are the only two pipelines that bring natural gas from where it is produced in the rocky mountains to central utah so allowing the two to combine would undermine the competition that benefits consumers questar has been a part of dominion since 2016 and berkshire s utility division acquired kern river in 2002 so neither parent company was involved when questar tried to buy 50 ownership of the kern river pipeline in 1995 officials with the utility division of warren buffett s company did not immediately respond to questions about the deal on tuesday dominion officials declined to comment berkshire and dominion announced monday that they were abandoning the deal because of uncertainty about whether regulators would approve it dominion said it plans to find another buyer for its questar pipelines unit by the end of the year and it will refund the 1 3 billion that berkshire paid to acquire the pipeline after the deal was announced a year ago separate from the questar deal berkshire spent 2 7 billion to buy some of dominion s other natural gas transmission and storage assets including over 5 500 miles of natural gas transmission pipelines and about 775 billion cubic feed of gas storage facilities berkshire also took on 5 3 billion of the richmond virginia based dominion s debt as part of that transaction the omaha nebraska based berkshire conglomerate owns several major utilities bnsf railroad several large insurers including geico and an assortment of manufacturing and retail companies as part of a collection of more than 90 businesses berkshire also holds sizeable stock investments in apple bank of america coca cola and other companies

yellen sees u s companies pushing to back global tax deal that s a bloomberg headline story from earlier this morning digging a little deeper in her interview she said that u s companies are likely to provide crucial support kind of like falling on your sword huh throwing yourself in front of the train or at least i have this picture of ceos sobbing wildly because they can t get a tax hike that would reduce their profits lower their stock prices cut back on their payroll and undermine their productivity i m surprised these ceos as socially woke as they have all become when it comes to their own financial statement are not picketing together with large placards saying please raise my taxes they would march not just to raise their domestic income taxes but their capital gains taxes death taxes and overseas taxes so i m still looking for this news event but i don t see it inflation just beginning of our worries if dems get their way mcconnell here s what i do know the business roundtable which is home to the 200 largest companies in america is opposed to the biden yellen tax hikes at home and abroad opposed madam secretary not crucially supporting but opposed they have said so publicly so i don t know who she s talking about by the way just for the heck of it president trump is now pouring it on warning republicans not to raise taxes republicans in the u s senate must not in any way shape or form increase taxes that were won in the trump tax cut the largest in the history of our country spot on mr president it s always fabulous when you stay on message speaking of the great trump tax cut the cbo and the jtc have priced out trump and biden tax proposals the trump corporate tax cut was 350 billion dollars in lower revenues the biden corporate tax hike is estimated at 2 2 trillion dollars of increased revenues in other words the biden tax hike is 7 times as large as the trump tax cut just please think about that for a moment it s not just jumping the corporate rate from 21 to 28 where it used to be 35 biden s is a 7 times greater increase than the trump tax cut that s serious business wall street isn t so sure inflation will be transitory now here s another thought although the democrats have not yet put together a budget resolution and therefore they can t form a reconciliation package yet the so called infrastructure package completely lacks details on both the spending and pay for sides nonetheless the desperate dems are now talking about dynamic scoring and i actually love this for years supply siders like myself have argued that lower tax rates change economic behavior tax something less you get more of it we ve always wanted this dynamic behavior to be included in the 10 year estimates of the economy along with federal spending and revenues otherwise in static terms you could presumably raise the tax rate to 100 from say 21 corporate tax now everyone with a pea sized brain would know that 100 tax rate would destroy the economy kill jobs lose revenues but that static approach held on institutionally for decades recently the cbo started using a watered down approach incorporating economic behavioral changes the tax foundation does a great job as do other models nowadays not all but some so if the democrats want to incorporate dynamic scoring into their 3 trillion package or whatever size i say fine they re arguing that their social spending so called human infrastructure universal pre school free community college child credits and dependent care would increase productivity and economic growth and hence revenues to reduce the deficit color me highly skeptical especially because their social spending is not tied to work incentives or work requirements but they kind of forgot the tax hike side so to quote the great art laffer if you tax something more you get less of it less of it means lower revenues and bigger deficits in fact the penn wharton model has virtually the same numbers as the tax foundation and the nam slash rice university model all three models using dynamic scoring of biden spending and tax proposals show roughly a 1 to 1 5 future decline of gdp jobs capital stock and productivity in fact the business roundtable is paying close attention to the penn wharton model so i hope democrats understand what they re getting into because dynamic scoring is going to jack up their deficit numbers by lowering the economy and dropping revenues incidentally the 350 billion trump corporate tax cut paid for itself in about 18 months because of stronger economic growth and lower unemployment and hence more taxable income throughout the economy at lower tax rates jpmorgan profit more than doubles but revenue falls there was far less tax avoidance as huge volumes of overseas cash repatriation came flowing into treasury coffers in fact the entire trump tax cut priced at 1 5 trillion nearly paid for itself just before the pandemic hit cbo estimates only a 200 billion shortfall in revenues which would have been easily gobbled up had it not been for the virus however that s what lower tax rates do they change behavior folks work invest and tax more risks schumpeterian gales of creative destruction blow through the economy opening the door to massive advances inventiveness innovation and technology click here to read more on fox business in fact as i occasionally do last weekend i communed with schumpeter who of course passed away in 1950 but we periodically spiritually commune on the economy and he told me beware of the biden tax hikes he completely agrees with president trump and does not understand janet yellen who had an excellent record at the fed but you re only as good as your last trade this article is adapted from larry kudlow

new york july 13 2021 prnewswire pomerantz llp announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against rocket companies inc rocket or the company nyse rkt and certain of its officers the class action filed in the united states district court for the eastern district of michigan southern division and docketed under 21 cv 11618 is on behalf of a class consisting of all persons and entities other than defendants that purchased or otherwise acquired rocket class a common stock between february 25 2021 and may 5 2021 both dates inclusive the class period seeking to pursue remedies under the securities exchange act of 1934 the exchange act against rocket and certain of the company s senior officers if you are a shareholder who purchased or otherwise acquired rocket class a common stock during the class period you have until august 30 2021 to ask the court to appoint you as lead plaintiff for the class a copy of the complaint can be obtained at www pomerantzlaw com to discuss this action contact robert s willoughby at or 888 476 6529 or 888 4 pomlaw toll free ext 7980 those who inquire by e mail are encouraged to include their mailing address telephone number and the number of shares purchased rocket is the largest mortgage originator in the u s with an estimated 9 2 market share as of march 31 2020 the company operates two primary segments i the direct to consumer segment and ii the partner network segment in its direct to consumer segment rocket directly interacts with clients and potential clients using various performance marketing channels in its partner network segment rocket partners with third parties who utilize the company s platform to provide their clients with mortgage solutions rocket s mortgage origination business generates revenues primarily from the gain on sale of loans which includes loan origination fees revenues from sales of loans into the secondary market as well as the fair value of originated mortgage serving rights and hedging gains and losses one of the most important metrics in measuring rocket s financial performance is the company s gain on sale margin which refers to the company s net gain on sale of loans divided by the net rate lock volume for the period excluding all reverse mortgage activity net rate lock volume refers to the unpaid principal balance of loans issued by the company subject to interest rate lock commitments net of certain factors identified by the company the gain on sale margin is viewed by investors as a core measure of rocket s profitability the complaint alleges that throughout the class period defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the company s business operations and compliance policies specifically defendants made false and or misleading statements and or failed to disclose that i rocket s gain on sale margins were contracting at the highest rate in two years as a result of increased competition among mortgage lenders an unfavorable shift toward the lower margin partner network operating segment and compression in the price spread between the primary and secondary mortgage markets ii rocket was engaged in a price war and battle for market share with its primary competitors in the wholesale market which was further compressing margins in rocket s partner network operating segment iii the adverse trends identified above were accelerating and as a result rocket s gain on sale margins were on track to plummet at least 140 basis points in the first six months of 2021 iv as a result of the above the favorable market conditions that had preceded the class period and allowed rocket to achieve historically high gain on sale margins had vanished as the company s gain on sale margins had returned to levels not seen since the first quarter of 2019 v rather than remaining elevated due to surging demand rocket s company wide gain on sale margins had fallen materially below recent historical averages and vi as a result of the foregoing defendants positive statements about the company s business operations and prospects were materially misleading and or lacked a reasonable basis on may 5 2021 rocket issued a press release announcing its first quarter results and second quarter outlook rocket reported that it was on track to achieve closed loan volume within a range of only 82 5 billion and 87 5 billion and gain on sale margins within a range of only 2 65 to 2 95 for the second quarter of 2021 at the mid point this gain on sale margin estimate equated to a 239 basis point decline year over year and a 94 basis point decline sequentially which represented the company s lowest quarterly gain on sale margin in two years the collapse in the company s gain on sale margin reflected the fact that the favorable market conditions purportedly being experienced by the company during the class period had in fact reversed during a conference call to explain the results rocket s chief financial officer and treasurer defendant julie r booth revealed that the sharp decline in quarterly gain on sale margin was being caused by three factors i pressure on loan pricing ii a product mix shift to rocket s lower margin partner network segment and iii a compression in price spreads between the primary and secondary mortgage markets on this news rocket s class a common stock price fell 3 79 per share or 16 62 to close at 19 01 per share on may 6 2021 on heavy volume of over 37 million shares traded as the market continued to digest the news in the days that followed rocket s class a common stock

pittsburgh ap margaret harris has stockpiled 50 000 worth of tea in her basement ms harris owner of blue monkey tea co in squirrel hill has been in the tea business for 20 years in march 2020 as the pandemic hit she realized there were going to be supply chain issues she relies on shipments from places like china where covid 19 was quickly disrupting business as usual i had to take a loan from the banks and i ordered extra stash of teas she recalled we could barely move in our storage room because we had so much stuff like so many businesses tea sellers who source their products from around the globe have had to maneuver to cope with the pandemic some like blue monkey tea have chosen to stock up while others like fuku tea in oakland decided their best bet is to wait it out fuku tea has a sign posted that informs customers about the shortage of boba those jelly like pearls made of tapioca that sit at the bottom of a bubble tea drink and limits them to only one topping per drink toppings offered include traditional boba popping boba red bean and pudding we re not getting the same supply said hannah ku a senior team member who said most of fuku tea s shipments come from taiwan we re asking for x amount of our tapioca or another topping but we re only getting way less than what we actually need right now a 16 ounce bubble tea costs 3 65 and a large 24 ounce at 4 40 one topping is included in the price but pre shortage it would run a customer an extra 50 cents per additional topping holdups at ports the challenges for the tea industry are coming from more than one direction a recent surge in shipping container costs has caused headaches for many industries including the tea business said peter goggi president of the tea association of the u s a a new york based organization that represents upward of 100 corporations a typical 40 foot container out of china which would have cost about 3 000 a few months back is now up to 13 000 he said a 40 foot shipping container can hold more than 2 000 cubic feet of volume according to icontainers a supply chain tracking platform headquartered in barcelona spain if these containers are not filled or shipped suppliers are missing out on a whole lot of tea because of a lack of workers as a result of covid 19 mr goggi said there was a slowdown in the unloading and loading processes of large port groups like los angeles and new york as the globe now transitions out of a pandemic centered world there is a buildup of demand for containers especially in asia shipping vessels and shipping lines are absolutely trying to get as many empty containers out to these asian ports for exports around the world as they can he said in many instances they re refusing to take cargo from other countries in the u s there s been a lot of communication between various industries and the federal maritime commission about the fact that it s impacting our ability to export agricultural products the u s is the third largest tea importer worldwide behind pakistan and russia according to a 2019 20 report by the tea association of the u s a however the u s is also the only western country to grow in tea imports as well as tea consumption back in squirrel hill ms harris is expecting a big hike in wholesale tea prices soon due to the lack of shipping containers she predicts a 15 to 20 increase in shipping costs but she doesn t think it will affect the price of the tea at her shop very much because local shipping prices are the same we don t see an increase in our shipping costs yet locally because the issue is not local shipment she said fedex and ups are still good the problem is for my wholesalers to get shipment on those containers still ms harris said blue monkey increased prices an additional 10 a few weeks ago for the first time in years one thing helping to keep prices from going still higher is the wide range of other business and supply avenues ms harris said african grown tea crops in places such as kenya and malawi have been largely unaffected blue monkey tea has also started its own wholesale business supplying other retailers with locally made beers that incorporate their tea if there s no tea i ll sell something else she said supply shortages melissa underwood manager of blue monkey tea oversees herbs for herbal teas and said she had to go through multiple distributors to get specific products due to a lack of people working crops overseas it was really bad for many months she said now i would say it s much better it s not back to normal but it s much better ms harris said many herbs come from balkan countries such as bulgaria and romania while ms underwood noted chamomile comes from egypt because certain ingredients are lacking or unavailable all together certain tea blends cannot be made chai blends are largely made up of black tea cardamom cinnamon cloves and the main component ginger with a shortage of ginger a bad harvest didn t help coming out of thailand ms harris said there is no way to make chai tea as a hobby the shortages hit as demand for tea has increased during the pandemic tea is such a comfort measure ms harris said not only were they drinking tea because it was pleasant and something to do but they develop a hobby now we created so many new tea drinkers because of this pandemic situation that included a spike in sales for immunity boosting teas blue monkey tea features teas such as flu fighter and herbs that help with coughs tea was second to water as the most consumed drink in the world from 2019 20 according to the tea association of the u s a ms harris teaches her own class on how to grow tea and she highlighted the great mississippi tea co as an example of places producing more domestic tea crops located in brookhaven miss the great mississippi tea co was just one of 60 tea farms in the nation in 2017 tea is so amazing so interesting because you can learn history geography language culture and customs she said if you know how to drink tea if you can train your body you can become a real tea connoisseur few employees the quality of tea available has been affected by a lack of employees picking crops overseas according to ms harris when tea leaves are first picked after their dormancy period it is known as the first flush the most valuable round of harvesting most teas in the world will sleep in winter depending on how far they are from the equator she said after they wake up there s a lot of nutrients accumulated in branches that are being pumped to these fresh leaves so these are the most precious the best teas when covid 19 surged in india in the spring last year many people had to stay in isolation that meant the first flush leaves couldn t be picked the darjeeling first flush in the darjeeling district in india ms harris said was diminished by comparison tea coming from sri lanka has been relatively unaffected because it is grown all year long the global workforce shortages slammed everyone from tea pickers to wholesalers there are fewer buyers going overseas to taste and purchase teas as well she said tea is one thing you can t really assess virtually she said you have to be there you have to smell it you have to taste it before they buy a big batch what about bubble tea the shortages have extended to boba and bubble tea bubble tea originated in taiwan and began to gain popularity in the u s in the 2000s in oakland alone there are seven locations surrounding the university of pittsburgh s campus that serve bubble tea sihyuk choi owner of chick n bubbly in oakland said college students are a large part of his customer base mr choi s menu is a combination of bubble tea and chicken bites he said the industry is unstable right now as his shipments of boba come from taiwan increased production in the united states would help to stabilize it in his view the costs of boba shipments have increased about 10 since the pandemic began he said and the cost of chicken has increased significantly too the chicken wings was 80 per case or something now it is 130 or 140 mr choi said edward lui a partner at bae bae s kitchen downtown said he first started to hear about the boba shortage at the end of march my mom always watches the news overseas and she informed us about it he said they were reporting about it overseas a couple months ago he orders boba by the case about once a week costing about 60 to 70 this is about a 15 increase from his pre pandemic prices he said about six 10 pound bags come in a case but food costs have risen across the board with the whole food supply process there s a lot of change going on in the industry he said a lot of people have left the industry some people are exploring other options mr lui thinks the general goal of the food industry is to place more emphasis on domestic farm to table supply chains and consumers are more aware of the process i think that s always going to be a goal in the food industry he said but there s also the bigger corporations that are taking things overseas and whatnot there s always that balance and battle between those two worlds mr goggi said bubble tea is a very small percentage of imports to the tea industry those people who have some inventory will be selling it probably at a premium he said like most things give it three to six months and the supply chain should probably settle down and get more into a replacement mode ___ online

hidden blessing the opportunity to gain new perspective about what s truly essential what matters most and how we each want to move forward in light of these insights she wrote and after thinking about my own life i was surprised by the realization that after a long career in roles that have required a 24 7 commitment what i want most these days is the freedom to focus on other priorities all the things i always wanted to do with family and friends but simply never had time for mucha wrote advertisement iger and chapek in a joint email credited braverman and mucha with playing integral roles in disney s expansion and transformation into the digital age including the acquisitions of pixar marvel lucasfilm and 21st century fox the creation of disney s first theme park in mainland

to disney after a career in new york s rough and tumble politics as one of new york gov george e pataki s top aides in the 1990s mucha developed a reputation for an in your face style that led her to

the building that once housed the last drugstore in this town of fewer than 600 is now a barbecue restaurant where pit boss larry holtman dishes out smoked brisket and pulled pork across the same counter where pharmacists dispensed vital medications more than 30 years ago it s an hourlong drive over treacherous mountain passes to laramie wyoming or granby or steamboat springs colorado and the nearest pharmacies the routes out of the valley in which walden lies are regularly closed by heavy winter snows keeping residents in and medications out walden has suffered the fate of many small towns across the united states as the economics of the pharmacy business have made it difficult for community drugstores to survive with large pharmacy chains buying up independent drugstores and increasingly controlling the supply chain towns such as walden have too few residents to attract a chain drugstore and no great appeal for pharmacists willing to strike out on their own with no local access to prescription drugs the town of mainly cattle ranchers and hay farmers has crowdsourced a delivery system taking advantage of anyone s trip to those bigger cities to pick up medications for the rest of the town really it s a network of community and people reaching out and knowing that others have needs said tina maddux who runs a nonprofit that provides food and other assistance in walden we re a community that pulls together for the wellness of everyone the system is just one of the creative ways that rural communities deal with a lack of health care in walden the senior center runs a regular shuttle to the bigger locales so older residents don t have to drive to pick up groceries visit doctors or refill their meds in october a pharmacy in steamboat springs began delivering medications to walden once a week mail order pharmacies can help with medications for chronic conditions but not for acute needs yet these solutions can t replace a bricks and mortar pharmacy as pharmacists do much more than count pills they can give flu or covid shots and in some states such as colorado even prescribe contraceptives some run diabetes management or smoking cessation programs medications can be complicated and without a live person to talk to patients can struggle to take them correctly kyle spradley for khn all smoked up bbq in downtown walden used to be a pharmacy the last drugstore in the town smoked brisket and pulled pork now move across the same counter where pharmacists dispensed vital medications more than 30 years ago in walden locals are one snowstorm one mishap from being cut off from their meds that uncertainty leaves whitney milek with constant anxiety her younger son 8 year old wade relies on medications to control his seizures she usually picks up his medicines in laramie where the family does its big grocery runs but when she needs to refill in between trips she turns to her neighbors for help the informal system runs primarily through a facebook group created in 2013 as a sort of online garage sale for years people have been posting to ask if anybody is headed toward a pharmacy and can bring back a prescription neighbors deliver to neighbors even during the pandemic and no money is exchanged there are times when nobody is going and you end up having to have them mailed which is a whole other thing especially with seizure meds milek said some are controlled substances and they can t mail them two winters ago milek called in one of her son s prescriptions to a steamboat springs pharmacy but when she arrived the medication was out of stock with road conditions rapidly worsening she asked if the pharmacy would mail the medication but was told she lived too close for mail delivery she turned to a pharmacy in laramie which eventually agreed to mail it to her but also didn t have it in stock so he ended up going five days without milek said it s not a big deal if you miss a dose here or there but when you miss that many over a period of time your tolerance level goes down that medication must be carefully managed to build up gradually in wade s blood to avoid a severe allergic reaction it took three weeks to scale up to his daily dose when he started taking the drug two years ago when he went five days without it he had to basically start all over again it was over christmas break so he wasn t in school i brought him to work with me because i didn t feel comfortable leaving him with anybody else said milek a bookkeeper i didn t know what was going to happen kyle spradley for khn whitney milek s younger son wade relies on medications to control his seizures the family photographed in march 2020 before the covid 19 pandemic took hold lives in walden colorado an hour s drive over treacherous mountain passes to laramie wyoming that s where they get groceries and often pick up wade s prescriptions but sometimes they need refills before they can make those trips and rely on help from neighbors wade was fortunate to avoid complications that time but having a local pharmacy mail medications comes with added costs 26 in their case for a prescription last month an extra tax on those who cannot get to a pharmacy mail order pharmacies typically don t charge for shipping yet can run into snags too last year some of wade s mailed medications got stuck in a denver processing facility for three weeks the mileks had to pay 1 600 out of pocket to get replacements walden has no hospital only a small clinic where dr lynnette telck and a nurse practitioner care for residents the clinic stocks some basic medications to handle routine acute needs antibiotics for strep throat inhalers for asthma and they can mix up liquid suspensions for those who can t swallow pills it s a small town so we all wear many hats telck said studies show that without a drugstore nearby patients aren t as likely to keep up with their medications and their chronic conditions can worsen without readily available medications telck said patients can end up taking an ambulance to an emergency room it s just so darn expensive to the system she said walden touts itself as the moose viewing capital of colorado and is a recreation mecca for hunting fishing and snowmobiling but telck said it could be hard to attract a pharmacist because the town lacks amenities like movie theaters and shopping malls it s pristine and wonderful in its own quirky way and we love it she said but not a lot of people want to come to rural areas the wages aren t as high as in the big cities middle park health the granby based hospital system that operates the walden clinic had looked at putting a more complete pharmacy in the clinic but couldn t find a technician to staff it the days of that being a profitable desirable business it s a lot tougher than it was a decade or two ago said gina moore an associate dean at the university of colorado s school of pharmacy you come out of eight years of college four years of undergraduate and four years of pharmacy school with pretty significant student loan debt it s very hard to go to a rural community where you don t make any money in towns without an er or a clinic open late pharmacists often become the health provider of last resort they tell patients whether they need to make the long trek to a hospital late at night or can wait until morning a patient will often come to the pharmacy as the first point of access for health care moore said our pharmacists are taught to understand and to be able to advise people on what can be self treated with over the counter medications versus when you need to see a higher level provider or an urgent care researchers from the rural policy research institute at the university of iowa have documented how the deck is increasingly stacked against community pharmacies it s just not a really attractive business model anymore said keith mueller the institute s director in 2013 they found that new medicare part d drug plans resulted in low and late reimbursements replacing direct out of pocket payments from customers that left many pharmacies unable to turn a profit by 2018 surveys showed pharmacies were struggling more with the narrowing margin between what they paid for the drugs and what they were being reimbursed by health plans towns of more than 10 000 people are often served by at least a walmart or a supermarket pharmacy mueller said but you get out into smaller communities the predominant modality had been the corner drugstore he said we re not seeing that replacement of the closed independents by a cvs rite aid or walgreens the mileks have talked about whether they should move near her family in wyoming to be closer to a hospital and pharmacy when you can t get to a pharmacy it s scary because things can happen so fast milek said people just have no concept of what it s like out here

file in this may 5 2019 file photo warren buffett chairman and ceo of berkshire hathaway smiles as he plays bridge following the annual berkshire hathaway shareholders meeting in omaha neb buffetts company is abandoning its purchase of a natural gas pipeline from dominion energy because of uncertainty about whether the deal could get regulatory approval berkshire hathaway inc will receive a 1 3 billion refund on the proposed purchase of questar pipelines that was also supposed to include 430 million of dominions debt when it was announced a year ago ap photo nati harnik file omaha neb federal regulators say berkshire hathaway s 1 3 billion deal to buy a natural gas pipeline from dominion energy that fell apart this week should have never been attempted because a similar deal drew strong opposition in the past the acting director of the federal trade commission s bureau of competition holly vedova said tuesday that the companies involved should have known that the deal was unlikely to get approved because the agency previously opposed a similar combination involving dominion s questar pipeline and berkshire s kern river pipeline recommended videos it is disappointing that the ftc had to expend significant resources to review this transaction when we previously filed suit in 1995 to block the same combination vedova said given our prior action and the even closer competition that developed between the pipelines since then this is representative of the type of transaction that should not make it out of the boardroom vedova noted the kern river and questar pipelines are the only two pipelines that bring natural gas from where it is produced in the rocky mountains to central utah so allowing the two to combine would undermine the competition that benefits consumers questar has been a part of dominion since 2016 and berkshire s utility division acquired kern river in 2002 so neither parent company was involved when questar tried to buy 50 ownership of the kern river pipeline in 1995 officials with the utility division of warren buffett s company did not immediately respond to questions about the deal on tuesday dominion officials declined to comment berkshire and dominion announced monday that they were abandoning the deal because of uncertainty about whether regulators would approve it dominion said it plans to find another buyer for its questar pipelines unit by the end of the year and it will refund the 1 3 billion that berkshire paid to acquire the pipeline after the deal was announced a year ago separate from the questar deal berkshire spent 2 7 billion to buy some of dominion s other natural gas transmission and storage assets including over 5 500 miles of natural gas transmission pipelines and about 775 billion cubic feed of gas storage facilities berkshire also took on 5 3 billion of the richmond virginia based dominion s debt as part of that transaction the omaha nebraska based berkshire conglomerate owns several major utilities bnsf railroad several large insurers including geico and an assortment of manufacturing and retail companies as part of a collection of more than 90 businesses berkshire also holds sizeable stock investments in apple bank of america coca cola and other companies

by samuel boehlke july 13 2023 read more at samuel boehlke more articles as they worked tirelessly to oust donald trump from the white house in 2020 a chorus of corporate media never trumpers establishment democrats and joe biden himself promised americans a biden presidency would usher in a return to normalcy two and a half years later normalcy has yet to appear biden s tenure has cemented a new normal of men pretending to be women a march toward global conflict and synthetic drugs in the white house decency and decorum not exactly as the 2024 election season heats up now is as good a time as ever to take stock of our cultural and political status quo and remind ourselves that the self proclaimed unifier in chief and his administration s lackeys have done everything in their power to upend our norms not return to them here are 10 examples 1 obscene lgbt activism in exchange for trump s mean tweets biden s normal includes men showing off their prosthetic breasts on the white house lawn as lgbt extremists enforced pride month on the rest of the country the biden family saw fit to host a pride party at the symbolic residence three of their guests proudly stripped off their tops to flaunt their mutilated true selves after immediate backlash the biden administration noted the behavior was inappropriate and disinvited the three people involved but there was nothing normal about nude white house party guests speaking of indecent exposure lgbt activism under the biden administration has taken an obscene turn and not just during pride month the white house s gay and trans agenda has no limiting principle with the president going out of his way to promote irreversible medical interventions for confused youths this radicalism trickles down into defending pornographic books for children explicit education public nudity and graphic sexual depictions in family friendly public environments 2 corruption when biden talked about normalcy did he mean multimillion dollar bribery schemes thanks to astute lawmakers like sen chuck grassley and brave whistleblowers within the internal revenue service and fbi americans are finally seeing past the biden protection racket to the corrupt family business biden and his doj will pretend the sins are littler misdemeanor tax crimes limited to his poor addict son hunter but whistleblower testimony about a damning fbi document suggests the big guy s hands are dirty and the justice department has been covering it up 3 cocaine at the white house the same administration that tracked down grandmas who happened to be in d c on jan 6 2021 claims it won t be able to figure out who brought cocaine into the high security white house complete with secret service agents cameras and records of every guest s name date of birth and social security number among other things whether the synthetic drug belongs to hunter biden an obvious suspect who is believed to be living in the white house right now or someone else colombian bam bam turning up at the president s house isn t normal 4 federal weaponization and censorship to suppress its ideological and political opponents the biden administration found convenient ways to silence social media users as recent house reports have shown biden s agencies regularly engaged in collusion with the largest big tech companies to suppress free speech not only did they push for the censorship of speech that was factually wrong speech that is still protected by the first amendment but they labeled information critical of the democrat regime as disinformation and misinformation to justify stripping it from the public square worse the biden administration devised a category of speech that s true but inconvenient called malinformation and worked to silence that too 5 bidenomics despite recovering some of the jobs the government forced workers out of during covid lockdowns biden s economy overall has been disastrous for the american people inflation in particular has been a steady theme with prices for essentials from groceries to gasoline soaring throughout the early years of biden s term prices are still high and many americans are still suffering in 2023 but in january the president had the audacity to claim a high inflation rate was a good thing because it had cooled from the 40 year record biden broke the previous year 6 the edge of world war aggressive support for ukraine in its war with russia has been a constant theme of the biden administration unfortunately this support edges us closer to a global war with escalation as the apparent goal of this conflict depleted stockpiles put the u s at increased risk of war with insufficient supplies to fight it nato s recent shortening of ukraine s membership application process could threaten to drag nato member countries and america in particular into a great power conflict once again of course this is in addition to rising threats from china and at america s southern border with foreign threats growing under the noses of a distracted national security apparatus 7 science denying hhs assistant secretary how s this for normal biden appointed a science denying man as the first female four star admiral in the u s public health service commissioned corps the president selected dr rachel levine a transgender identifying person and motivated lgbt ideologue as the assistant secretary for health at the department of health and human services levine previously promoted the most extreme policies of the centers for disease control and prevention during covid and was responsible for thousands of excess deaths in pennsylvania during his tenure as the head of the pennsylvania health department in his position as assistant secretary levine has consistently fought to deny biological realities and promote the sterilization and mutilation of gender confused children 8 pop star as a medical expert in keeping with biden s elevation of the unqualified his administration turned to celebrities such as olivia rodrigo to persuade americans to fawn over a flailing anthony fauci in 2021 rodrigo partnered with fauci and biden to produce videos encouraging youth vaccination her fans along with the rest of the world realized her expertise in healing hearts through music did not extend to medicine her vaccination video remains one of her least liked social media posts 9 senility and lying probably the easiest return to normal would have been the election of a younger coherent president who maintained some semblance of accountability to americans instead biden offers regular doses of verbal incoherence sleepiness gaffes uncomfortable whispers and shouts and tumbles these are all bad looks but not as bad as the lies that spill out of the president on the daily which the federalist has tracked since his first day in office lying may be normal for biden but it shouldn t be normal for the presidency and neither should perceived physical and cognitive weakness on the world stage 10 war on scotus it s no surprise attacks on the supreme court have ramped up under the biden administration after all this president evidently believes he s above the law and the court has disagreed smacking down his administration on everything from student loans to covid jab mandates not to mention other blows to the left during biden s tenure such as the overturning of roe v wade the 303 creative decision and a university affirmative action takedown with the help of the media the biden administration has gotten bold about its plans to undercut and circumvent the court wherever it can and the president is not alone private universities will also be doing their best to dodge the law to keep supporting racial

st petersburg the sunshine city and its sparkling waterfront parks have become the center of tampa bay s red tide crisis rafts of dead fish are washing ashore more quickly than crews can gather the carcasses workers have picked up 477 tons of dead marine life from the coastline in recent weeks according to mayor rick kriseman that accounts for the overwhelming majority of more than 600 tons picked up across pinellas county scientists continue to detect high levels of red tide through much of the bay with no sign of immediate relief on the horizon it s here it s bad and there s not much we can do other than make sure we re all communicating well florida fish and wildlife conservation commission director eric sutton told the tampa bay times there s no signs that necessarily it s going to be coming to an end soon but i ve learned enough not to try to predict red tide either sutton and florida s interim environmental secretary shawn hamilton visited st petersburg on tuesday to hold a discussion about red tide reporters were not allowed to attend the bay is not very happy right now to say the least said robert weisberg a physical oceanography professor at the university of south florida whose lab forecasts the movement of red tide his model relying on water sampling from the state suggests the toxic algae will stick around for the foreseeable future weisberg said the bloom could in fact linger even longer perhaps into the fall which is a more normal season for red tide to drift in from offshore the prognosis is not all that good he said a patchy bloom that revealed itself in early june when small pinfish and grunt turned up dead on pinellas beaches has since sunk unnervingly into one of florida s and the country s most treasured estuaries pinellas has reported some water samples in tampa bay with levels of ride tide 10 to 17 times greater than the concentration considered high snook and tarpon have floated dead in the bay carcasses decayed tuesday in the sun gray and reeking at maximo park near the sunshine skyway bridge and bay vista park across pinellas point they piled like snowdrifts beside upturned shells of horseshoe crabs at lassing park in the old southeast you name it it s washing up right now said tampa bay estuary program assistant director maya burke red tide more typically shows up in the gulf of mexico she said like it did during a prolonged bloom in 2018 to see high levels in the bay is really really really uncommon unfortunately i think it could be pretty uncomfortable for a long time burke said keep up with tampa bay s top

throat and watery eyes county monitoring has shown elevated levels of red tide off several beaches in recent days including fort de soto pass a grille treasure island madeira beach indian rocks beach and clearwater beach a bloom was drifting far south of tampa bay earlier this year weisberg said around charlotte harbor unusually persistent southerly winds between march and april may have moved those organisms up to tampa bay he said once here the red tide organisms likely met with recycled nutrients particularly nitrogen dumped into tampa bay in april through contaminated water from the old piney point fertilizer plant site in manatee county according to weisberg if you give it the right suite of nutrients the concentrations can escalate very rapidly he said scientists have not proven definitively that the bloom is feasting upon contamination from piney point and burke said they may never land a smoking gun but they know that putting nutrients into the bay generally causes algae to grow that s textbook what we re seeing right now burke said we have no reason not to link those two things together the forces that end a red tide bloom are still a mystery according to weisberg but he said the standard circulation of the bay is not likely to flush out algae soon dead fish compound the problem because the carcasses release more nutrients back into the water to feed red tide burke said that is part of why local efforts to remove dead fish from the water are so important the city stationed dumpsters in several parks so residents can throw away any dead stinking fish they collect from canals and at the foot of seawalls red tide update citizens who wish to collect dead fish can drop them off at in roll off dumpsters at these 7 sites crisp park flora wylie park lassing park

brewery in south tampa to hear from fishing guides about the problem it was one of three meetings they planned that day daniel andrews co founder of captains for clean water told the times that he has heard from charter operators logging cancellations because of red tide he shared a story of captains bringing clients north to crystal river for clear fishing the state s most recent monitoring shows high levels of red tide to the south of tampa bay as well off longboat key and sarasota andrews from fort myers said his area suffered the brunt of the last bad red tide from 2017 to 2019 fishermen there still cannot keep redfish and snook because of a partial closure following the bloom state regulators reopened those same fisheries while in season in tampa bay only this spring because it was not hit as hard during the 2017 19 crisis pinellas removed more than 1 800 tons of dead marine life captains and guides andrews said are some of the first people hurt when visitors delay trips because

in the 12 months ended june 30 the s p tsx preferred share index soared 36 6 and some actively managed etfs did even better over the same period the ftse canada universe bond index was down 2 4 because of periodic adjustments made to their payouts most preferred shares don t behave like other fixed income asset classes in response to changes in interest rates when rates go up bond prices go down and the longer a bond s duration a measure of its interest rate sensitivity the greater the losses for preferred shares the opposite tends to be true that s because more than 75 of canadian preferreds have rate reset provisions whereby their fixed payouts are adjusted at least every five years yields on rate reset preferreds are linked to changes in the five year government of canada bond rate while still low by historical standards 0 97 at the end of june the five year benchmark bond rate is up sharply from 0 36 a year earlier because of their positive correlation with rising rates rate reset preferred shares received a welcome boost it s a negative duration asset class when you think about it said marc andré gaudreau manager of the 729 million dynamic active preferred shares etf and dynamic preferred yield class a mutual fund with a similar mandate a vice president and senior portfolio manager in the montreal office of toronto based 1832 asset management lp gaudreau is head of the credit team that manages more than 5 3 billion including 1 9 billion in dedicated preferred share mandates noting the huge fiscal stimulus by governments in north america and the mass vaccinations for covid 19 that are enabling the economy to gradually reopen gaudreau said the odds are that central bankers eventually may face pressure to raise interest rates this will benefit preferred shares as an asset class and increase the probability that positive returns will continue especially relative to anything else in fixed income weighed against this outcome is the equity risk associated with preferred shares which was evident during the severe market downturn last year early in the covid 19 pandemic despite their outsized 12 month gains three year returns on preferred etfs are mostly in the range of 4 5 back in 2018 when the canadian stock market was also down some preferred share etfs had double digit losses consistency isn t their strong suit since preferred shares are subordinated debt they rank lower than bonds in the event of corporate insolvency and unlike bonds they have no maturity dates a year ago it was risk off and we had a global recession so the asset class came down significantly said gaudreau with recession fears having eased prospects now appear favourable over the next 12 months the canadian preferred market could return 5 7 said nicolas normandeau vice president and portfolio manager fixed income with montreal based fiera capital corp fiera manages the 1 8 billion horizons active preferred share etf and the 52 million horizons active hybrid bond and preferred share etf most of this projected return about 4 consists of dividend yield with some potential for capital gain the horizons active preferred etf recently had about 45 allocated to preferreds that trade at discounts below their 24 issue price yields on preferred shares are similar to those of high yield bonds which normandeau described as an asset class with comparable credit risk on average preferreds currently yield roughly twice as much as investment grade corporate issues better still for investors in non registered accounts canadian dividends including those paid on preferreds are eligible for dividend tax credits the tax advantage varies by province and by individual tax brackets in ontario for example a 4 dividend yield is roughly equivalent after tax to an interest yield of 5 a ground breaking positive development unique to canadian preferred shares is the emergence of limited recourse capital notes lrcns and other types of hybrid securities both are reducing the supply of preferreds which has positive implications for share prices lrcns were pioneered by royal bank of canada in july 2020 after a favourable ruling by the office of the superintendent of financial institutions osfi with other banks following in short order sold to institutional investors lrcns are classified by osfi as regulatory capital but are interest bearing since interest is tax deductible while dividends are not lrcns are a cheaper source of funds for financial companies than preferred shares consequently canadian financial institutions which account for more than half of the preferred share market will continue to redeem their expensive preferred shares and replace them with lrcns currently the benchmark s p tsx preferred share index has a market capitalization of about 60 billion and about 225 constituents both those numbers are expected to shrink substantially normandeau expects almost 5 billion in preferreds might be redeemed in the remainder of 2021 and potentially another 6 8 billion next year further contributing to the shrinking supply of preferreds are redemptions by non financial companies such as utilities in favour of hybrid bonds that receive equity treatment on corporate balance sheets but are interest bearing and therefore tax deductible it s not full on equity but it s not full on debt gaudreau said it basically has the best of both worlds for the issuer the actively managed dynamic etf has the flexibility to also invest in lrcns hybrid bonds u s preferreds and hybrids and traditional bonds but heading into the second half of this year gaudreau and his team think the risk reward tradeoff is more attractive for canadian preferreds the reason unlike rate reset and floating rate preferreds prices of these other securities could come under pressure in an expanding economy since central bankers might eventually have to increase interest rates lrcns and hybrid bonds don t play much of a role in the horizons active hybrid bond and preferred share etf either under its new name and wide ranging fixed income mandate that took effect in march we still think there s more value within the pref market said normandeau not all of them so you have to be really careful of which ones you select he added that as more preferred shares are redeemed the etf will eventually hold more lrcns and hybrid bonds even while focusing on preferreds active managers like fiera can use securities selection to their advantage there s still a lot of preferreds that trade at discounts normandeau said and that s where we put our overweight of the two canadian preferred etfs with 10 years of history the horizons active preferred share etf has returned an annualized 3 9 to june 30 ahead of the 2 4 return of the ishares s p tsx canadian preferred share index etf

for almost a year louisiana was the laughingstock of the nation that was the way that our state s gubernatorial election of 1991 was described by two of our area s most astute political analysts that was the year that a ku klux klan grand wizard ran for louisiana s highest office against a former governor who was being investigated for criminal activity in the fall of 91 everybody in the state knew that incumbent governor buddy roemer was on the way out and the sitting governor s lack of popularity was confirmed when roemer finished third behind fellow democrat and ex guv edwards and republican duke a smooth talker who positioned himself as the only conservative in the race edwards and duke finished one two in louisiana s jungle primary and the pair squared off in a general election that put the state in the national spotlight and what the nation saw wasn t very flattering the question of his participation in a historically violent racist organization came up again and again but the unflappable duke had a standard response his stock answer was to apologize for his past and declare himself a born again christian edwards meanwhile had his own skeletons having been under investigation by various law enforcement organizations going back to his previous time in office in fact it was edwards taking hold of his own unsavory history that gave rise to the campaign s most memorable slogan vote for the crook it s important perhaps the turning point in the race came during an interview with a reporter from west monroe when duke was unable to give a precise answer about where he went to church in the eyes of most political experts it was a gaffe from which the gop candidate never recovered things got down and dirty in the final days of the race with duke claiming that edwards had mocked the crucifixion of christ and had strayed from his marriage edwards responded in his own inimitable style by responding that the only thing we have in common is we re both wizards under the sheets come election day in november the result seemed to be a foregone conclusion edwards trounced the born again wizard getting more than 60 of the vote edwards the state s four term governor passed away earlier this week at 93 he was also convicted of extortion and money laundering in 2002 he was released from prison in 2011 duke made a number of runs for political office including the united states senate and house of representatives most recently he was portrayed by actor toper grace in the spike lee movie blackkklansman louisiana s biggest political scandals
new york july 13 2021 prnewswire pomerantz llp announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against rocket companies inc rocket or the company nyse rkt and certain of its officers the class action filed in the united states district court for the eastern district of michigan southern division and docketed under 21 cv 11618 is on behalf of a class consisting of all persons and entities other than defendants that purchased or otherwise acquired rocket class a common stock between february 25 2021 and may 5 2021 both dates inclusive the class period seeking to pursue remedies under the securities exchange act of 1934 the exchange act against rocket and certain of the company s senior officers if you are a shareholder who purchased or otherwise acquired rocket class a common stock during the class period you have until august 30 2021 to ask the court to appoint you as lead plaintiff for the class a copy of the complaint can be obtained at www pomerantzlaw com to discuss this action contact robert s willoughby at newaction pomlaw com or 888 476 6529 or 888 4 pomlaw toll free ext 7980 those who inquire by e mail are encouraged to include their mailing address telephone number and the number of shares purchased rocket is the largest mortgage originator in the u s with an estimated 9 2 market share as of march 31 2020 the company operates two primary segments i the direct to consumer segment and ii the partner network segment in its direct to consumer segment rocket directly interacts with clients and potential clients using various performance marketing channels in its partner network segment rocket partners with third parties who utilize the company s platform to provide their clients with mortgage solutions rocket s mortgage origination business generates revenues primarily from the gain on sale of loans which includes loan origination fees revenues from sales of loans into the secondary market as well as the fair value of originated mortgage serving rights and hedging gains and losses one of the most important metrics in measuring rocket s financial performance is the company s gain on sale margin which refers to the company s net gain on sale of loans divided by the net rate lock volume for the period excluding all reverse mortgage activity net rate lock volume refers to the unpaid principal balance of loans issued by the company subject to interest rate lock commitments net of certain factors identified by the company the gain on sale margin is viewed by investors as a core measure of rocket s profitability the complaint alleges that throughout the class period defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the company s business operations and compliance policies specifically defendants made false and or misleading statements and or failed to disclose that i rocket s gain on sale margins were contracting at the highest rate in two years as a result of increased competition among mortgage lenders an unfavorable shift toward the lower margin partner network operating segment and compression in the price spread between the primary and secondary mortgage markets ii rocket was engaged in a price war and battle for market share with its primary competitors in the wholesale market which was further compressing margins in rocket s partner network operating segment iii the adverse trends identified above were accelerating and as a result rocket s gain on sale margins were on track to plummet at least 140 basis points in the first six months of 2021 iv as a result of the above the favorable market conditions that had preceded the class period and allowed rocket to achieve historically high gain on sale margins had vanished as the company s gain on sale margins had returned to levels not seen since the first quarter of 2019 v rather than remaining elevated due to surging demand rocket s company wide gain on sale margins had fallen materially below recent historical averages and vi as a result of the foregoing defendants positive statements about the company s business operations and prospects were materially misleading and or lacked a reasonable basis on may 5 2021 rocket issued a press release announcing its first quarter results and second quarter outlook rocket reported that it was on track to achieve closed loan volume within a range of only 82 5 billion and 87 5 billion and gain on sale margins within a range of only 2 65 to 2 95 for the second quarter of 2021 at the mid point this gain on sale margin estimate equated to a 239 basis point decline year over year and a 94 basis point decline sequentially which represented the company s lowest quarterly gain on sale margin in two years the collapse in the company s gain on sale margin reflected the fact that the favorable market conditions purportedly being experienced by the company during the class period had in fact reversed during a conference call to explain the results rocket s chief financial officer and treasurer defendant julie r booth revealed that the sharp decline in quarterly gain on sale margin was being caused by three factors i pressure on loan pricing ii a product mix shift to rocket s lower margin partner network segment and iii a compression in price spreads between the primary and secondary mortgage markets on this news rocket s class a common stock price fell 3 79 per share or 16 62 to close at 19 01 per share on may 6 2021 on heavy volume of over 37 million shares traded as the market continued to digest the news in the days that followed rocket s class a

summary long term interest rates in many countries have declined modestly in recent weeks as global market participants expect gdp growth to slow into 2h21 rates are at zero or negative in key regions such as europe and japan at the other end of the spectrum spiraling inflation of 14 5 has lifted turkish 10 year bond yields to 16 7 in brazil where prices are rising at a 6 8 clip the 10 year government bond yield is 9 1 long term rates in many industrialized regions the u s norway singapore and australia are in the 0 5 1 5 range inflation expectations also are modest in these areas averaging around 2 5 we keep an eye on global rates for economic forecasting and investing reasons on the economic forecasting front the relatively higher rates in the united states indicate that its economic recovery could lead the way for industrialized nations over the next few quarters from an investment standpoint we see little attraction in global bonds at this point as rates are negative in the safer zones of europe and japan and risks are elevated in higher yielding areas such as turkey south africa and brazil

richard wolff an american marxian economist and professor emeritus of economics at the university of massachusetts amherst shared his observations on the role of the communist party of china cpc in china s development and china u s ties in an exclusive interview with beijing review reporter ma miaomiao this is an edited excerpt of his views on cpc induced synergy the first book i ever read about china was the good earth by pearl buck presenting the stories of poverty and suffering across the chinese countryside in the early 20th century what she described in the book actually didn t take place too long ago but when you look at what china has achieved over the past years and then compare it to what buck wrote about it makes for an incredible feat since 1949 when the communist revolution succeeded u s foreign aid did not go to china because the latter was a socialist country u s foreign aid was however dispatched to every other third world country across asia africa and latin america nevertheless china has done better economically than every other country that did receive the assistance what does that tell us about getting aid from the west it s not the path to economic growth it never was the reality is that the path to economic growth was not to take aid from the west but to rely on yourself the soviet union once helped china before the 1960s but in general the chinese achieved it mostly by themselves that s a very powerful message all over the world today there is a sense of anxiety in the u s that the chinese over the last 30 years have figured out a way to outcompete western capitalism once upon a time the hope had lingered that through reform and opening up somehow china would move away from a powerful government and state owned enterprises and become like the westâ an economic system in which large private corporations take on the dominant role that s what they hoped for and that s what actually did not happen in china major private corporations and government sectors exist side by side but all governed by the cpc the party formulates plans with a set of goals that enable private and public resources to synergize that s what the west could never achieve for example real wages as in what an average worker gets adjusted for the prices that have to be paid in the u s have been stagnant and have not changed much over the last four decades yet in china they have gone up more than four times subsequently the average living standards of the chinese working class too are on the rise the above accomplishments have resulted in a sense of jealousy and anxiety in the u s that the chinese may have unlocked the secret to the ultimate combination of private and public capital under the leadership of one powerful political party that can achieve socially attractive outcomesâ which are not available in the u s china has achieved extraordinary growth growing up from one of the poorest countries in the world to a global superpower second only to the u s this is an achievement done in a historically short period of time it seems to me that among all the underlying forces at work much of the credit for that has to go to the cpc they made the final decisions about this mixture of private and state owned enterprises about how to coordinate them about how to guarantee they complement one another rather than destroy the other i don t see any logic in denying this remarkable deed or in granting it anything other than admiration for example during the past six months the u s has been much slower in vaccinating its people against covid 19 than china there is an example of using private and public resources to concentrate on a priority problem in chinaâ in this case the virus the world witnessed once again the ability of chinese society its party its government and its private sector to be coordinated and gain a more successful outcome throughout its history the cpc was able to learn from marxism applied in other parts of the world many of the early cpc leaders had attended universities in western europe where they studied marxism they learned from the west drew their lessons from it and then continuously kept adjusting the elements they had taken onboard their concerted efforts laid the groundwork for the next generations of the cpc to further elaborate on eventually coming to full fruition in the 21st century there have been various movements in practicing socialism yet the impact of the chinese model will prove prominent in the future the soviet union used to be the first successful example as they survived surrounded by enemies china is different what china has achieved as an engine of economic growth is now being studied by every other socialist country trying to seek out the lessons that can be applied to their own national framework the u s stock exchange nasdaq celebrates the chinese new year by holding a virtual closing bell ceremony on the afternoon of february 11 xinhua on china u s stereo ties for the u s foreign policy is mostly shaped by domestic interests and concerns in other words the position taken toward china or russia by the administrations of donald trump and joe biden for example is really put forward for domestic consumption the u s is an inward looking country which is much more shaped by its struggles on the inside than by anything outside the u s is in a difficult position compared with china it became a global capitalist power in the 20th century during that time the u s developed and overwhelmed countries such as great britain and germany the collapse of the soviet union left the u s without a competitor in the position of dominant global capitalist power they wanted to believe expected even this would go on forever however it did not for the first time in a century the u s has a global competitor economicallyâ china this is a whole new experience for the u s and it feels threatened it has been trying for years to come up with some other solutions and so far it hasn t been able to come up with one over these last few decades china has grown as an economy with a gdp growth of 6 to 9 percent every year the u s stands at 2 percent the u s has not been able to change this dynamic and what you re hearing now is hostility toward china but this is what psychologists refer to as a sense of displacement the real dismay on the part of the u s stems from the fact that it no longer holds the position of the single dominant global power the business community continues to be interested in doing business with china under the surface there is a desire sprouting from ideology there is a feeling among capitalists worldwide that the chinese market is the fastest growing major market in the world the capitalist who is not active in china will lose out in the long run institutions like the u s chamber of commerce or the business roundtable important business organizations have spoken out against such sentiments of resentment and hostility toward china as they want to do business in and with china at the same time enhanced people to people exchanges would help break down the array of negative stereotypes about china and perhaps forge new stronger ties

key point the combination of bolt action full sized rifle and submachine gun was useful in the trenches of world war i during world war ii the beleaguered german army fielded a revolutionary new infantry weapon designed to make the german soldier the most powerful on the battlefield the sturmgewehr 44 or stg 44 was the first mass produced assault rifle the weapon urgently needed as germany found itself increasingly losing the war was a template for future weapons including today s ak 74m and m4 carbine at the outbreak of world war ii the german army fielded two infantry small arms the karabiner modell 1898 kurz otherwise known as the 98k bolt action carbine and the mp series of submachine guns the 98k was a shorter handier version of the gewehr 98 rifle used during the great war it weighed 8 2 pounds had a five round internal magazine and an effective range of 600 yards the mp series including the mp 38 mp 40 and mp 41 were a new design of compact folding stock submachine guns the guns weighed approximately nine pounds fired from a 32 round detachable magazine and had effective ranges of approximately 200 yards the combination of bolt action full sized rifle and submachine gun was useful in the trenches of world war i with the former valuable for aimed fire between trench lines and the latter useful for clearing trenches during ground offensives early in world war ii however it became clear that the nature of warfare had changed a point that became painfully clear as germany began losing the war as the german army fought across the eastern front it became obvious germany s infantry arsenal was not up to the task while accurate hard hitting and reliable the 98k carbine could not deliver the volume of fire useful for repelling large numbers of russian infantry particularly in urban terrain in the case of the mp series submachine guns although they could unleash a hail of nine millimeter bullets the stopping power of the nine millimeter round was limited and the weapons had a relatively short range the german army needed a new weapon the new weapon would be built around a cartridge not as powerful as the 7 92x57 mauser round used by the 98k but heavier than the 9x19 millimeter round used by the mp series it would have a detachable large capacity magazine for quick reloading and could fire fully automatic it would be a compromise weapon sitting squarely between a traditional battle rifle and submachine gun during the 1930s germany had developed just such an cartridge the 7 92x33 round this was the same diameter as the 7 92 57 round used by the 98k but 24mm shorter and using half as much propellant while the round was less lethal and had less range it was controllable for fully automatic fire germany also issued contracts to develop a selective fire rifle that could use the round by 1942 the famous small arms designer hugo schmeisser had produced an early version of the required rifle schmeisser s weapon the haenel mkb42 h was a piston driven gun with frontal locking lugs on the bolt the weapon had a pistol grip wooden stock hooded front sight and a 30 round magazine it was heavy at 11 06 pounds the weapon was easy to field strip breaking down into six different parts the upper and lower receivers connected by a hinge behind the magazine well the mkb42 h prototype was reworked by schmeisser and turned into the mp 43 operational weapon entering service in 1943 in april 1944 the weapon was renamed the mp 44 the weapon was produced under the machine pistol mp designation after hitler had decreed development of rifles was to cease and production of machine pistols was stepped up after the weapon s success on the battlefield it was renamed the sturmgewehr 44 storm gun reportedly by hitler himself despite wartime shortages german industry produced 425 977 stg 44s for the german army one unusual variant of the mp 44 stg 44 produced during wartime was the mp 44 krummlauf the oddball project involved a mp 44 fitted with a curved barrel and mirror sights attached to the muzzle the objective was to create a weapon that could be poked through the firing ports of halftrack armored personnel carriers firing on enemy infantry attempting to place magnetic anti tank mines on the sides of friendly vehicles a large amount of german war resources were spent on the krummlauf far outstripping the theoretical value of shooting red army soldiers through firing ports and few guns were actually produced the stg 44 was a truly revolutionary weapon bringing firepower down to the individual soldier level it was no doubt an influence for mikhail kalashnikov father of the ak 47 assault rifle some firearms enthusiasts believe huge schmeisser imprisoned after the war by the soviet union is the true father of the ak 47 although this is an unproven and likely untrue theory the true legacy of the stg 44 is its design philosophy of an intermediate cartridge mated to a fully automatic weapon with a detachable magazine the same characteristics drive the british sa80 assault rifle chinese qbz 95 assault rifle and american m4 carbine although it lived for only a short time in the wrong hands the stg 44

new york july 13 2021 prnewswire pomerantz llp announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against rocket companies inc rocket or the company nyse rkt and certain of its officers the class action filed in the united states district court for the eastern district of michigan southern division and docketed under 21 cv 11618 is on behalf of a class consisting of all persons and entities other than defendants that purchased or otherwise acquired rocket class a common stock between february 25 2021 and may 5 2021 both dates inclusive the class period seeking to pursue remedies under the securities exchange act of 1934 the exchange act against rocket and certain of the company s senior officers if you are a shareholder who purchased or otherwise acquired rocket class a common stock during the class period you have until august 30 2021 to ask the court to appoint you as lead plaintiff for the class a copy of the complaint can be obtained at www pomerantzlaw com to discuss this action contact robert s willoughby at or 888 476 6529 or 888 4 pomlaw toll free ext 7980 those who inquire by e mail are encouraged to include their mailing address telephone number and the number of shares purchased rocket is the largest mortgage originator in the u s with an estimated 9 2 market share as of march 31 2020 the company operates two primary segments i the direct to consumer segment and ii the partner network segment in its direct to consumer segment rocket directly interacts with clients and potential clients using various performance marketing channels in its partner network segment rocket partners with third parties who utilize the company s platform to provide their clients with mortgage solutions rocket s mortgage origination business generates revenues primarily from the gain on sale of loans which includes loan origination fees revenues from sales of loans into the secondary market as well as the fair value of originated mortgage serving rights and hedging gains and losses one of the most important metrics in measuring rocket s financial performance is the company s gain on sale margin which refers to the company s net gain on sale of loans divided by the net rate lock volume for the period excluding all reverse mortgage activity net rate lock volume refers to the unpaid principal balance of loans issued by the company subject to interest rate lock commitments net of certain factors identified by the company the gain on sale margin is viewed by investors as a core measure of rocket s profitability the complaint alleges that throughout the class period defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the company s business operations and compliance policies specifically defendants made false and or misleading statements and or failed to disclose that i rocket s gain on sale margins were contracting at the highest rate in two years as a result of increased competition among mortgage lenders an unfavorable shift toward the lower margin partner network operating segment and compression in the price spread between the primary and secondary mortgage markets ii rocket was engaged in a price war and battle for market share with its primary competitors in the wholesale market which was further compressing margins in rocket s partner network operating segment iii the adverse trends identified above were accelerating and as a result rocket s gain on sale margins were on track to plummet at least 140 basis points in the first six months of 2021 iv as a result of the above the favorable market conditions that had preceded the class period and allowed rocket to achieve historically high gain on sale margins had vanished as the company s gain on sale margins had returned to levels not seen since the first quarter of 2019 v rather than remaining elevated due to surging demand rocket s company wide gain on sale margins had fallen materially below recent historical averages and vi as a result of the foregoing defendants positive statements about the company s business operations and prospects were materially misleading and or lacked a reasonable basis on may 5 2021 rocket issued a press release announcing its first quarter results and second quarter outlook rocket reported that it was on track to achieve closed loan volume within a range of only 82 5 billion and 87 5 billion and gain on sale margins within a range of only 2 65 to 2 95 for the second quarter of 2021 at the mid point this gain on sale margin estimate equated to a 239 basis point decline year over year and a 94 basis point decline sequentially which represented the company s lowest quarterly gain on sale margin in two years the collapse in the company s gain on sale margin reflected the fact that the favorable market conditions purportedly being experienced by the company during the class period had in fact reversed during a conference call to explain the results rocket s chief financial officer and treasurer defendant julie r booth revealed that the sharp decline in quarterly gain on sale margin was being caused by three factors i pressure on loan pricing ii a product mix shift to rocket s lower margin partner network segment and iii a compression in price spreads between the primary and secondary mortgage markets on this news rocket s class a common stock price fell 3 79 per share or 16 62 to close at 19 01 per share on may 6 2021 on heavy volume of over 37 million shares traded as the market continued to digest the news in the days that followed rocket s class a common stock

cn rail tsx cnr nyse cni and cp rail tsx cp nyse cp are wide moat kings that are forces to be reckoned with whenever each firm takes a bit of a spill buying the dip is typically a pretty wise move at least over the long term of late though the entire rail industry has been rattled especially cn and cp both of which went duking it out for the right to acquire kansas city southern earlier in the year cn ultimately beat cp with its rich bid of around us 34 billion after cp refused to sweeten its offer cn was supposedly to walk away with the incredible rail assets that would have given the firm an unbelievable moat and access to the two major borders in north america investors over at cn rail did not like the deal and for good reason the price was not only rich but borderline obscene i gave cn s managers the benefit of the doubt though so too did long time cn shareholder bill gates through his firm cascade investments which gave management a thumbs up on the deal the cn ksu combination took a massive toll on cn stock also causing ample volatility in cp through the early innings of the first half of the year cn stock took a brunt of the damage plunging over 16 from peak to trough before bouncing back modestly and sagging into the summer it s been a rough ride for cn shareholders and the pain probably isn t over just yet regardless i ve been pounding the table on cn stock on the dip over ksu acquisition concerns joe biden adds another layer of uncertainty for the rails most recently u s president joe biden sent major shockwaves through the entire rail industry causing immense pressure on ksu stock in particular which plunged nearly 8 in a day biden s executive order may very well jeopardize the cn ksu merger while cn stock held its own rather well immediately following the news shares eventually started retreating again why investors seem to hate all the uncertainty following cn and its potential takeover if the historic rail deal is blocked cn rail may have to take a slap on the wrist and if it s approved in spite of biden s orders and his desire to bring forth greater competition in the freight transportation arena cn rail stock may very well continue sagging sadly it seems like a lose lose proposition for cn at least through the eyes of shareholders as most others hit the sell button though i d be an aggressive buyer cn stock has been a massive underperformed lately down 9 over the past six months thanks primarily to acquisition uncertainties at the end of the day cn rail is a wonderful rail that could really crush the tsx as the economy really starts to take off given this cnr stock looks dirt cheap regardless of what happens with the cn ksu deal which i believe may find itself up in the air what about cp rail stock cp rail stock is down just shy of 8 at the time of writing sure the company lost a great prize in ksu which would have been the perfect fit for the firm while an approved cn ksu deal would bring forth additional competitive pressures i think that coming industry tailwinds will overpower any such pressures as such cp rail is also a great buy in my books especially if shares were to fall into a correction 10 peak to trough decline over the coming weeks so cn or cp stock i d buy both here but if you can handle choppier moves i think there s a bit more value to be had in cn stock here it s been a relatively weak first half of 2021 for cn and cp but don t expect more of the same in the second half

blackberry tsx bb nyse bb is rolling over but here is why investors may want to go for the easier money with suncor tsx su nyse su stock blackberry tsx bb nyse bb stock was under pressure again on monday with shares plunging 4 5 in a continuation of the post reddit rally hangover when the folks at wallstreetbets will pile in again is anybody s guess for now it s the bears that are taking control and as i ve warned in numerous prior pieces the negative momentum was likely to continue as the stock looked to fall back towards a range that s more in line with its intrinsic value undoubtedly there s a real chance that reddit could return to blackberry stock after the dust has a chance to settle the second spike in shares was induced by action going on at amc entertainment shares if the euphoria in one meme stock can spread to the broader basket of wallstreetbets names it s quite possible for another meme stock to act as a tide that lifts all ships so to speak regardless by betting on blackberry here you d still be placing a speculative bet even after adding to its losses blackberry shares still seem a tad too rich for my liking and the liking of most analysts on the street many of which have fresh sell ratings but if you re keen on the name i m not against buying on the way down as long as you understand what you stand to lose over the near to intermediate term while bb shares may be frothy at around 14 of all the reddit stocks blackberry seems to be the one that s most likely to grow into its hefty multiple still i find there to be far better bargains on the tsx these days i certainly see easier or at least less painful opportunities to make money than blackberry especially as the name sours again on main street where do the less painful plays lie these days suncor energy a better bargain than blackberry stock in my books warren buffett may have given up on his suncor energy tsx su nyse su shares but you probably shouldn t as the stock looks to build on the strength it posted in the second half of 2021 like many other recovering commodity plays suncor is both a value income and momentum play with wti west texas intermediate prices surging of late suncor has been a top performer on the tsx index still the recovery has been relatively modest versus the likes of many of its peers in the oil patch sure it s hard to be dissatisfied with a stock that s up 34 in six and a half months but one can t help but notice that suncor s peers have performed drastically better i think the relative underperformance will not last long especially once the company is back to hiking its dividend again over the past few years nothing major has changed about the fundamentals the price however has changed in a big way with the stock still off well over 36 from its 2020 pre pandemic high and 49 from its 2018 high as operating cash flows normalize and oil prices continue to add to their gains i think suncor a relative laggard in the first half looks poised to crush the tsx and its peers at just a modest premium to book suncor stock is a great buy here bottom line between buying blackberry on weakness and suncor on strength i d have to go with the latter every day of the week while blackberry is a great business that will eventually turn a corner shares remain too rich for my liking things are looking up for suncor and the valuation still seems too depressed given the industry backdrop in simple terms suncor looks to be easier money for investors looking to outperform in what could be a very eventful second half of 2021
if you strongly believe that bitcoin has strong recovery prospects from today s lows then hut 8 mining stock is a strong buy right now here s why anyone following cryptocurrencies lately has noticed that the bitcoin btc price in u s dollars has fallen by more than 47 from its peak above us 64 100 in april to trade below us 33 000 by the time of writing on tuesday morning the leading cryptocurrency is seemingly tangled up in its usual boom and bust cycles which follow every fourth year halving event bitcoin usually soars to new all time highs after rewards to miners are cut in half after every 210 000 coins are mined this usually happens every four years it can be noted that in the first cycle which ended in november 2012 btc s price reached a high of about us 30 in the second cycle ending july 2016 the coin s all time high was us 1 200 and in the third and most recent cycle that ended in may 2020 us 20 000 was the magic number we are already in the fourth cycle and btc has topped us 64 000 one can only speculate what fortunes the next cycle beginning in 2024 will bring to investors in the cryptocurrency especially to some of the world s largest cryptocurrency miners like hut 8 mining tsx hut nasdaq hut hut 8 s stock price rose 278 between january 1 and february 22 this year to an all time high of 15 98 mining profitability and the value of its cryptocurrency assets soared as bitcoin soared to the moon well natural gravity aided by an ongoing crackdown on cryptocurrency mining operations in china has brought the cryptocurrency s price back to near earth levels for now one can only imagine how high the company s shares could soar in the next cycle 200 300 or even more it s hard to tell when will bitcoin rise again but speculating from previous trends the capital gains from buying the miner s stock at today s low 6 levels could prove substantial over the next five years five reasons to buy hut 8 mining stock today as history has proven since btc s inception the cryptocurrency s value has rallied after each halving event the next halving which is expected in 2024 could give btc more firepower to lift towards the moon again or to at least make another emphatic attempt it could benefit to buy the big name crypto mining growth stocks during their current dips today this is one potential reason to buy hut 8 mining stock right now secondly the company is expanding its productivity significantly right now while mining operations remain profitable at current crypto prices even after the recent significant fall in cryptocurrencies mining operations generally remain viable with better economics than 2020 settings miners who increase their productivity now will reap more benefits operational profitability is still present even if btc prices remain subdued near current levels for years to come third the company and its north american cryptocurrency mining peers are picking up the spoils from a china crackdown competition for blocks has come down as chinese rigs go offline and btc mining difficulty has eased as a result the company is a major cryptocurrency miner in north america and management may be smiling as operations become more profitable in the short term reason number four is company specific the company anticipates expanding its mining capacity from 1 2 exahash eh to about 2 5 3 0 eh within the next few weeks productivity could increase from current lows of 6 2 bitcoin a day to about 10 coins per day by august this year higher productivity will be good for the business more so given current profitability and lower mining difficulty moreover the company boasts of a big wallet its coin inventory had accumulated over 3 800 self mined bitcoin by the end of june 2021 current productivity gains could increase portfolio size to 5 000 coins by december this year buying hut 8 stock is like buying into a bitcoin etf that has mining operations on the side the gains on invested capital will be substantial more so if btc ever reaches billionaire investor tim draper s us 250 000 prediction at any time this decade this is the fifth reason why i would recommend a buy on hut stock today

omaha neb federal regulators say berkshire hathaway s 1 3 billion deal to buy a natural gas pipeline from dominion energy that fell apart this week should have never been attempted because a similar deal drew strong opposition in the past the acting director of the federal trade commission s bureau of competition holly vedova said tuesday that the companies involved should have known that the deal was unlikely to get approved because the agency previously opposed a similar combination involving dominion s questar pipeline and berkshire s kern river pipeline it is disappointing that the ftc had to expend significant resources to review this transaction when we previously filed suit in 1995 to block the same combination vedova said given our prior action and the even closer competition that developed between the pipelines since then this is representative of the type of transaction that should not make it out of the boardroom vedova noted the kern river and questar pipelines are the only two pipelines that bring natural gas from where it is produced in the rocky mountains to central utah so allowing the two to combine would undermine the competition that benefits consumers questar has been a part of dominion since 2016 and berkshire s utility division acquired kern river in 2002 so neither parent company was involved when questar tried to buy 50 ownership of the kern river pipeline in 1995 officials with the utility division of warren buffett s company did not immediately respond to questions about the deal on tuesday dominion officials declined to comment berkshire and dominion announced monday that they were abandoning the deal because of uncertainty about whether regulators would approve it dominion said it plans to find another buyer for its questar pipelines unit by the end of the year and it will refund the 1 3 billion that berkshire paid to acquire the pipeline after the deal was announced a year ago separate from the questar deal berkshire spent 2 7 billion to buy some of dominion s other natural gas transmission and storage assets including over 5 500 miles of natural gas transmission pipelines and about 775 billion cubic feed of gas storage facilities berkshire also took on 5 3 billion of the richmond virginia based dominion s debt as part of that transaction the omaha nebraska based berkshire conglomerate owns several major utilities bnsf railroad several large insurers including geico and an assortment of manufacturing and retail companies as part of a collection of more than 90 businesses berkshire also holds sizeable stock investments in apple bank of america coca cola and other companies

in a perfect world nascar cup series teams would have completed construction of their next gen cars by now but it s not a perfect world even after a one year delay resulting from the covid 19 shutdown the new platform is still behind schedule and it may take a robust schedule of winter testing to get it ready for daytona and the full season afterwards the safety elements of the upcoming car is currently under review by an independent panel of experts following an intentional crash test at talladega superspeedway on june 30 that panel consists of dr james raddin who participated in the investigation of the death of dale earnhardt following the 2001 daytona 500 dr jeff crandall who serves as an engineering consultant to the nfl dr barry myers a professor of biomedical engineering at duke university and dr joel stitzel chair of biomedical engineering at wake forest baptist health the spec car was driven by a robot and fitted with a crash dummy providing an opportunity to study how the dummy was affected by the impact related story nascar crash data submitted for independent review this was actually the second attempt at a crash test following one on june 23 when the sled failed and prevented nascar from sending the car into the wall during this process tales of a dead crash dummy began circulating around the garage accompanied by frustrated crew members who offered a shared narrative that nascar wasn t offering details or responding to questions about the status of the car denny hamlin who is unique in his role as a driver owner said on sunday there is usually fire where there is smoke nascar indicated to race teams like week that the next gen showed good and comparable performance to right front impacts juxtaposed against the current sixth generation car but was awaiting the completed review before commenting further i feel like the car we ve got we ve escaped some pretty good injuries from 99 percentile crashes hamlin said while we definitely need to still work on some roof caving ins on the superspeedway stuff generally when we blow a tire we know what we re going to get we re going to get our bell rung a little bit a little soreness here and there that s the current benchmark while it s standard operating procedure for an independent review board to review crashes or car development this is part of what is being analyzed by the third part right now the data indicated that the car might have come in lighter and stiffer than it optimally needs to be meaning that the driver could be susceptible to injury in high impact crashes without changes as cars are intentionally designed to break apart to dissipate impact ultimately we haven t gotten the results back hamlin said i guess there s rumors that start from people that are kind of close to it and it doesn t sound great but again there s no hard data i would assume if things went fantastic we would have heard about it pretty soon the tale of a dead crash dummy took a life of its own when chase briscoe confirmed that the narrative existed in the garage last week in a since deleted reddit comment ryan blaney said he has shuffled through various conclusions as the narrative shifted since the talladega crash test took place i was told the crash test failed so i took that as oh they killed the dummy blaney said when asked about it on sunday that s not what happened the sled malfunctioned and it literally wouldn t go so when they said it failed the test failed they didn t even get to crash the car 2014 champion kevin harvick says there is a lot of frustration over the lack of communication from nascar i think the guys driving the cars are owed at least the respect enough to at least be a part of the process of what s going on harvick said everybody is just a little bit frustrated with how all that s been handled he said he was generally impressed with the presentation in may but he s starting to wonder when the completed product will be ready when the drivers were a part of the process is why everybody is a little bit frustrated with that harvick said and here we are supposed to go to bristol in a month with our car to do a tire test and can t get chassis chassis are held until the crash testing is done related story the biggest nascar next gen development challenge in hindsight nascar vice president of competition scott miller conceded that the sanctioning body should have better communicated with drivers teams and the industry at large while also expressing confidence that the test didn t not immediately show any cause for concern there s a lot of fiction out there miller said on siriusxm nascar radio on tuesday afternoon what everyone has to realize is that our normal safety testing procedure at the laboratory so to speak the proving grounds where we typically set up our impacts and get the data that was done differently because of covid and because of the backlog at that facility so we went and did that test at talladega at a real race track so what everyone needs to understand is that when we were able to do that test or any testing that we do there is a lot of data that comes off of that as far as the time frame goes it always takes a while to piece together a complete report of what we saw in a crash so it s not like anyone should have expected us to crash the car and look at a couple of graphs and say we re done analyzing this data we see absolutely nothing in the data that is alarming and i have no idea how all the rumors that started that it didn t go well because it did go well so hopefully we can get that report out miller hopes it shouldn t be too much longer to get the report out once the independent review board has combed over it maybe we should have communicated that better up front that if it wasn t immediate that it wasn t good miller said that s how the rumor got started so we should have told everyone not to expect a comprehensive report because it takes time the car is absolutely behind schedule as the industry expect testing to begin around this time earlier in the year hamlin says it s taking longer due to the supply chain issues plaguing various industries right now that complicating factor also has some within the industry predicting that the car either will not race at all next year or will only race a partial schedule similar to the 2007 season that was split between using the car of tomorrow and the previous generation car i don t blame anyone for it being this far down the road hamlin said yeah we wish there would have been testing well before now but also really other than these show cars we really haven t had a car built other than the wheelforce cars it s been pushed back because of covid and there s just a lot of obstacles that has come in the way of getting this thing down the road quicker some drivers have already expressed a heightened sense of concern about the safety elements of the car following an incident in march 2020 at auto club speedway involving william byron the g forces of byron s spin were on par with the tire failure impacts denny hamlin and erik jones endured during the 2020 brickyard 400 although byron was traveling at a fraction of the impact velocity of those two incidents hamlin says the drivers have told nascar that no part of the next gen should be less safe than the current generation race that nothing should be compromised from a safety standpoint if you start having a bunch of concussion injuries and broken bones this thing can go downhill pretty quick hamlin said i think they ll be pretty smart in making sure that the data supports and it s a car they feel comfortable putting themselves in for the drivers they deserve to know what they re getting strapped into and hopefully we don t race it until it s at least better than what we ve got meanwhile there s a subset of drivers who aren t as concerned about safety pointing to the inherent dangers of driving a race car michael mcdowell told the athletic during the media scrum that he doesn t care what the talladega results show it s not supposed to be safe mcdowell said the danger is part of the thrill of racing that s the difference between sitting in the stands and sitting in the race car if it s just as safe for me to sit in the stands as it is to sit in the race car then you don t need me to drive a race car christopher bell is spending is week in ohio driving a 410 sprint car one of the least safe racing machines in motorsports so any version of a nascar stock car is safer than what he spends his free time racing with that said he s still invested in the conversation i m probably not the right guy to ask bell said i came from sprint car racing so anything we re doing is a lot safer than what i used to do growing up obviously it s very important and i m very thankful that nascar takes it as serious as they do and i think they do a great job with it and i believe that they re not going to put us out there in something that s no safe that s not really a concern of mine martin truex jr said he hasn t wanted to add to the confusion by commenting on the topic but hopes everyone asking gets the answers they re looking for if those answers come back approved by the independent review board hamlin said he would feel comfortable with proceeding forward he s not worried about being lied to either there s just too much liability out there for them to fudge numbers right the numbers will come back when we crash at daytona hamlin said the moment we crash and everyone is like man that s worse that will confirm or deny the results that are proven you re not going to be able to fudge numbers but i do trust them and i trust the doctors and whatever they recommend read next one team one goal or how kurt busch won atlanta
if the spike in us inflation this year was supposed to be transitory as the us federal reserve board has consistently claimed it is turning out to be quite a prolonged transition the headline inflation number for june was expected to come in about 5 per cent higher than a year earlier or a fraction lower instead it was 5 4 per cent continuing a trend of surging inflation this year so far this year the one month inflation rate has climbed 0 3 per cent in january 0 4 per cent in february 0 6 per cent in march and 0 8 per cent in april it dipped to 0 6 per cent in may before bouncing to 0 9 per cent last month to post another 13 year high on the fed s preferred measure core inflation excluding food and energy rose from 3 8 per cent in may to 4 5 per cent its biggest rise since 1991 the transitory inflation in the us is turning into quite a prolonged transition credit getty images with the base effects comparisons with the pandemic depressed months last year now fading the latest numbers will encourage critics of the fed s position that the spike in inflation is a passing and fleeting post pandemic phenomenon although there is no expectation yet that the fed will alter its stance

richard wolff an american marxian economist and professor emeritus of economics at the university of massachusetts amherst shared his observations on the role of the communist party of china cpc in china s development and china u s ties in an exclusive interview with beijing review reporter ma miaomiao this is an edited excerpt of his views on cpc induced synergy the first book i ever read about china was the good earth by pearl buck presenting the stories of poverty and suffering across the chinese countryside in the early 20th century what she described in the book actually didn t take place too long ago but when you look at what china has achieved over the past years and then compare it to what buck wrote about it makes for an incredible feat since 1949 when the communist revolution succeeded u s foreign aid did not go to china because the latter was a socialist country u s foreign aid was however dispatched to every other third world country across asia africa and latin america nevertheless china has done better economically than every other country that did receive the assistance what does that tell us about getting aid from the west it s not the path to economic growth it never was the reality is that the path to economic growth was not to take aid from the west but to rely on yourself the soviet union once helped china before the 1960s but in general the chinese achieved it mostly by themselves that s a very powerful message all over the world today there is a sense of anxiety in the u s that the chinese over the last 30 years have figured out a way to outcompete western capitalism once upon a time the hope had lingered that through reform and opening up somehow china would move away from a powerful government and state owned enterprises and become like the westâ an economic system in which large private corporations take on the dominant role that s what they hoped for and that s what actually did not happen in china major private corporations and government sectors exist side by side but all governed by the cpc the party formulates plans with a set of goals that enable private and public resources to synergize that s what the west could never achieve for example real wages as in what an average worker gets adjusted for the prices that have to be paid in the u s have been stagnant and have not changed much over the last four decades yet in china they have gone up more than four times subsequently the average living standards of the chinese working class too are on the rise the above accomplishments have resulted in a sense of jealousy and anxiety in the u s that the chinese may have unlocked the secret to the ultimate combination of private and public capital under the leadership of one powerful political party that can achieve socially attractive outcomesâ which are not available in the u s china has achieved extraordinary growth growing up from one of the poorest countries in the world to a global superpower second only to the u s this is an achievement done in a historically short period of time it seems to me that among all the underlying forces at work much of the credit for that has to go to the cpc they made the final decisions about this mixture of private and state owned enterprises about how to coordinate them about how to guarantee they complement one another rather than destroy the other i don t see any logic in denying this remarkable deed or in granting it anything other than admiration for example during the past six months the u s has been much slower in vaccinating its people against covid 19 than china there is an example of using private and public resources to concentrate on a priority problem in chinaâ in this case the virus the world witnessed once again the ability of chinese society its party its government and its private sector to be coordinated and gain a more successful outcome throughout its history the cpc was able to learn from marxism applied in other parts of the world many of the early cpc leaders had attended universities in western europe where they studied marxism they learned from the west drew their lessons from it and then continuously kept adjusting the elements they had taken onboard their concerted efforts laid the groundwork for the next generations of the cpc to further elaborate on eventually coming to full fruition in the 21st century there have been various movements in practicing socialism yet the impact of the chinese model will prove prominent in the future the soviet union used to be the first successful example as they survived surrounded by enemies china is different what china has achieved as an engine of economic growth is now being studied by every other socialist country trying to seek out the lessons that can be applied to their own national framework the u s stock exchange nasdaq celebrates the chinese new year by holding a virtual closing bell ceremony on the afternoon of february 11 xinhua on china u s stereo ties for the u s foreign policy is mostly shaped by domestic interests and concerns in other words the position taken toward china or russia by the administrations of donald trump and joe biden for example is really put forward for domestic consumption the u s is an inward looking country which is much more shaped by its struggles on the inside than by anything outside the u s is in a difficult position compared with china it became a global capitalist power in the 20th century during that time the u s developed and overwhelmed countries such as great britain and germany the collapse of the soviet union left the u s without a competitor in the position of dominant global capitalist power they wanted to believe expected even this would go on forever however it did not for the first time in a century the u s has a global competitor economicallyâ china this is a whole new experience for the u s and it feels threatened it has been trying for years to come up with some other solutions and so far it hasn t been able to come up with one over these last few decades china has grown as an economy with a gdp growth of 6 to 9 percent every year the u s stands at 2 percent the u s has not been able to change this dynamic and what you re hearing now is hostility toward china but this is what psychologists refer to as a sense of displacement the real dismay on the part of the u s stems from the fact that it no longer holds the position of the single dominant global power the business community continues to be interested in doing business with china under the surface there is a desire sprouting from ideology there is a feeling among capitalists worldwide that the chinese market is the fastest growing major market in the world the capitalist who is not active in china will lose out in the long run institutions like the u s chamber of commerce or the business roundtable important business organizations have spoken out against such sentiments of resentment and hostility toward china as they want to do business in and with china at the same time enhanced people to people exchanges would help break down the array of negative stereotypes about china and perhaps forge new stronger ties
