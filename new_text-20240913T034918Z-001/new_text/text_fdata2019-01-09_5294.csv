days after reclaiming the house majority democrats are introducing gun control legislation timed for the anniversary of the shooting of former democratic rep gabby giffords speaker nancy pelosi and other democrats will introduce a bill to expand background checks for sales and transfers of firearms on tuesday the eighth anniversary of the day giffords was shot in the head at a constituent meeting in arizona giffords who co founded a gun safety group with her husband mark kelly said in a statement friday she was thrilled that her former house colleagues were responding to a gun violence epidemic that killed nearly 40 000 people in 2017 the bill expanding background checks marks a critical first step toward strengthening america s gun laws and making our country a safer place to live work study worship and play giffords said i stand ready to do everything in my power to get this legislation across the finish line democrats promised swift action on gun control after the party regained the house majority following eight years of republican rule pelosi called the bill on background checks a common sense measure and cited polls showing 97 percent of americans support background checks for all gun sales our democratic majority will press relentlessly for bipartisan progress to end the epidemic of gun violence on our streets in our schools and in our places of worship pelosi said enough is enough rep mike thompson d calif who leads a gun violence prevention task force in the house said he and other lawmakers from both parties have been pushing years to expand background checks and approve other gun related bills but have been stymied by republican leaders noting that many freshman democrats ran on the issue of preventing gun violence thompson said political momentum to address gun violence is growing the american people have been demanding we take action and this new congress will deliver he said the background checks measure is likely to face opposition from the republican controlled senate and the white house where president donald trump has promised to protect the second amendment jennifer baker a spokeswoman for the national rifle association said a federal background check did not prevent giffords shooting adding that so called universal background checks will never be universal because criminals do not comply with the law lawmakers should deal with the root cause of violent crime instead of trying to score political points and push ineffective legislation that doesn t stop criminals from committing crimes baker said the trump administration moved last month to ban bump stocks the firearm attachments that allow semi automatic weapons to fire like machine guns bump stocks became a focal point of the gun control debate after they were used in october 2017 by a gunman in las vegas who fired into a crowd at a country music concert killing 58 people and injuring hundreds more a new regulation gives gun owners until late march to turn in or destroy the devices

carbon dioxide emissions in the u s are on the rise again after several years of decline and a booming economy is the cause that s according toa report out today from the rhodium group an independent research firm that tracks co2 emissions in the u s it appears based on preliminary data that emissions in the u s grew by the highest rate since 2010 when we were recovering from the great recession says trevor houser a partner at rhodium and an author on the new estimate emissions rose roughly 3 4 percent in 2018 he says rhodium group rhodium group emissions were up for the first time since 2015 the big drivers were increased electricity demand and growth in trucking and aviation the report underscores an unusual upside to an economic downturn when the economy shrinks greenhouse gas emissions also go down that s what happened in the throes of the financial crisis in 2008 carbon dioxide emissions plummeted they ve been bouncing up and down since then but last year the strong economic growth meant a rise a cold winter was also a factor particularly because it led to higher consumption of natural gas and fuel oil in homes for heat there were some areas where decisions by government and industry helped to reduce some types of emissions a record number of coal fired power plants closed last year and emissions from passenger automobiles dropped slightly due to better fuel economy standards but it wasn t enough and houser wants more aggressive policies to drive drown co2 that seems unlikely for now policies to limit greenhouse gas emissions started under the obama administration are now being halted and even reversed under president trump what we ve seen is backsliding in federal policy and we re starting to feel the effects of that now houser says the report means the u s is less likely to meet its reduction targets under the global paris climate agreement according to andrew light a senior fellow at the world resources institute when the u s signed on to the agreement in 2015 then president obama promised a 26 28 percent reduction from 2005 levels by 2025 there s still time to catch up light says if we do get back on track in the united states toward having an energy policy that s consistent with the threat of climate change then we can turn these things around he says stock markets have faltered in recent months indicating the u s might be headed toward another recession that could cause emissions to drop but houser says it would not be productive a short term emissions decline as a result of a recession is not something anyone s cheering for he says we do the best on this issue when the economy is thriving and there are policies in place that can channel investment into clean energy technologies copyright 2021 npr to see more visit

carbon dioxide emissions in the u s are on the rise again after several years of decline and a booming economy is the cause that s according toa report out today from the rhodium group an independent research firm that tracks co2 emissions in the u s it appears based on preliminary data that emissions in the u s grew by the highest rate since 2010 when we were recovering from the great recession says trevor houser a partner at rhodium and an author on the new estimate emissions rose roughly 3 4 percent in 2018 he says rhodium group rhodium group emissions were up for the first time since 2015 the big drivers were increased electricity demand and growth in trucking and aviation the report underscores an unusual upside to an economic downturn when the economy shrinks greenhouse gas emissions also go down that s what happened in the throes of the financial crisis in 2008 carbon dioxide emissions plummeted they ve been bouncing up and down since then but last year the strong economic growth meant a rise a cold winter was also a factor particularly because it led to higher consumption of natural gas and fuel oil in homes for heat there were some areas where decisions by government and industry helped to reduce some types of emissions a record number of coal fired power plants closed last year and emissions from passenger automobiles dropped slightly due to better fuel economy standards but it wasn t enough and houser wants more aggressive policies to drive drown co2 that seems unlikely for now policies to limit greenhouse gas emissions started under the obama administration are now being halted and even reversed under president trump what we ve seen is backsliding in federal policy and we re starting to feel the effects of that now houser says the report means the u s is less likely to meet its reduction targets under the global paris climate agreement according to andrew light a senior fellow at the world resources institute when the u s signed on to the agreement in 2015 then president obama promised a 26 28 percent reduction from 2005 levels by 2025 there s still time to catch up light says if we do get back on track in the united states toward having an energy policy that s consistent with the threat of climate change then we can turn these things around he says stock markets have faltered in recent months indicating the u s might be headed toward another recession that could cause emissions to drop but houser says it would not be productive a short term emissions decline as a result of a recession is not something anyone s cheering for he says we do the best on this issue when the economy is thriving and there are policies in place that can channel investment into clean energy technologies copyright 2021 npr to see more visit

days after reclaiming the house majority democrats are introducing gun control legislation timed for the anniversary of the shooting of former democratic rep gabby giffords speaker nancy pelosi and other democrats introduced a bill to expand background checks for sales and transfers of firearms on tuesday the eighth anniversary of the day giffords was shot in the head at a constituent meeting in arizona giffords who co founded a gun safety group with her husband mark kelly said in a statement friday she was thrilled that her former house colleagues were responding to a gun violence epidemic that killed nearly 40 000 people in 2017 the bill expanding background checks marks a critical first step toward strengthening america s gun laws and making our country a safer place to live work study worship and play giffords said i stand ready to do everything in my power to get this legislation across the finish line democrats promised swift action on gun control after the party regained the house majority following eight years of republican rule pelosi called the bill on background checks a common sense measure and cited polls showing 97 percent of americans support background checks for all gun sales our democratic majority will press relentlessly for bipartisan progress to end the epidemic of gun violence on our streets in our schools and in our places of worship pelosi said enough is enough rep mike thompson d calif who leads a gun violence prevention task force in the house said he and other lawmakers from both parties have been pushing years to expand background checks and approve other gun related bills but have been stymied by republican leaders noting that many freshman democrats ran on the issue of preventing gun violence thompson said political momentum to address gun violence is growing the american people have been demanding we take action and this new congress will deliver he said the background checks measure is likely to face opposition from the republican controlled senate and the white house where president donald trump has promised to protect the second amendment jennifer baker a spokeswoman for the national rifle association said a federal background check did not prevent giffords shooting adding that so called universal background checks will never be universal because criminals do not comply with the law lawmakers should deal with the root cause of violent crime instead of trying to score political points and push ineffective legislation that doesn t stop criminals from committing crimes baker said the trump administration moved last month to ban bump stocks the firearm attachments that allow semi automatic weapons to fire like machine guns bump stocks became a focal point of the gun control debate after they were used in october 2017 by a gunman in las vegas who fired into a crowd at a country music concert killing 58 people and injuring hundreds more a new regulation gives gun owners until late march to turn in or destroy the devices

days after reclaiming the house majority democrats are introducing gun control legislation timed for the anniversary of the shooting of former democratic rep gabby giffords speaker nancy pelosi and other democrats introduced a bill to expand background checks for sales and transfers of firearms on tuesday the eighth anniversary of the day giffords was shot in the head at a constituent meeting in arizona giffords who co founded a gun safety group with her husband mark kelly said in a statement friday she was thrilled that her former house colleagues were responding to a gun violence epidemic that killed nearly 40 000 people in 2017 the bill expanding background checks marks a critical first step toward strengthening america s gun laws and making our country a safer place to live work study worship and play giffords said i stand ready to do everything in my power to get this legislation across the finish line democrats promised swift action on gun control after the party regained the house majority following eight years of republican rule pelosi called the bill on background checks a common sense measure and cited polls showing 97 percent of americans support background checks for all gun sales our democratic majority will press relentlessly for bipartisan progress to end the epidemic of gun violence on our streets in our schools and in our places of worship pelosi said enough is enough rep mike thompson d calif who leads a gun violence prevention task force in the house said he and other lawmakers from both parties have been pushing years to expand background checks and approve other gun related bills but have been stymied by republican leaders noting that many freshman democrats ran on the issue of preventing gun violence thompson said political momentum to address gun violence is growing the american people have been demanding we take action and this new congress will deliver he said the background checks measure is likely to face opposition from the republican controlled senate and the white house where president donald trump has promised to protect the second amendment jennifer baker a spokeswoman for the national rifle association said a federal background check did not prevent giffords shooting adding that so called universal background checks will never be universal because criminals do not comply with the law lawmakers should deal with the root cause of violent crime instead of trying to score political points and push ineffective legislation that doesn t stop criminals from committing crimes baker said the trump administration moved last month to ban bump stocks the firearm attachments that allow semi automatic weapons to fire like machine guns bump stocks became a focal point of the gun control debate after they were used in october 2017 by a gunman in las vegas who fired into a crowd at a country music concert killing 58 people and injuring hundreds more a new regulation gives gun owners until late march to turn in or destroy the devices
tns on a corner lot surrounded by lush live oaks and florida style bungalows sits jonathan wilson s first real estate investment a 2 100 square foot bone colored duplex the area was a big draw for wilson seminole heights is part hipster and part historic as one of tampa s oldest neighborhoods and home to local breweries art galleries and yoga studios some 2 400 miles due west in the mojave desert is a multi colored spectacle called rancho de colores one of the most popular airbnb listings in joshua tree calif the 1 500 square foot three bedroom house painted in blazing reds oranges and greens stands out among the placid chestnut colored playas of the desert popular among pinterest and instagram enthusiasts it was conceived by artist patrick hasson located on opposite coasts in contrasting environments and rented out via different channels these two properties share one important feature they re both part of a long term personal investment strategy wilson and hasson each wanted a way to create security for themselves in a time when few employers offer pensions and most people must rely on their own savings to keep them afloat in their later years in 2013 i was living in los angeles i realized then that i d never be able to afford a house in l a unless i hit the lottery i thought i don t have a pension i don t have a retirement what do i do i had already been interested in joshua tree so i started asking people how much they paid for their house hasson recounts i bought my first house in joshua tree for 73 000 in 2014 i was excited i had a house but now what an airbnb in the desert hasson batted around the idea of renting the house which he figured would bring in just enough to cover the 600 monthly mortgage payment he wasn t keen on managing tenants however so he decided to try the airbnb option the house he bought was once home to meth dealers so to communicate that the house was under new ownership and to deter meth seekers from stopping by hasson painted the house in vivid colors using a rainbow theme throughout ironically this eye catching palette was a hit with airbnb renters who wanted a great deal in a unique space the experiment worked airbnb was generating enough income that hasson was able to buy a second house in joshua tree on three acres of property as well as a trailer he moved to joshua tree full time in 2016 and now rents out the trailer dubbed the color trip trailer and continues to airbnb what he calls rancho de colores while living in his second house which de named rancho el reposo a duplex in a booming neighborhood like hasson wilson wanted to invest in real estate as a way to help secure his future he knew he wanted to buy property that could accommodate him and a tenant but he wasn t particular about what form that took as long as the location was desirable and the price was right i was very flexible in what i was looking for i was looking for something that had a mother in law suite or an extra lot and when this came up it was a perfect fit wilson says wilson originally offered 225 000 with no contingencies for the duplex with a two car garage but the owners passed in favor of a cash buyer when that deal fell through wilson ended up getting the house for 210 000 it had tenants in place so he was able to generate income from one unit immediately while moving into the other unit he plans to convert the two car garage into another rentable space which would cost him about 30 000 and add approximately 150 000 in value he estimates for both men buying real estate as a way to generate income was a new venture neither had deep pockets a background in real estate investing or a huge nest egg to fall back on and they both admit to making mistakes along the way and they re not alone more than 33 percent of renters live in single family homes which are largely owned by individuals like wilson and hasson rather than corporations or banks this is a 2 3 trillion industry according to a paper by the ucla anderson school of management single family rentals are historically good investments it turns out however that investing in property was a good decision a recent study by andrew demers a real estate specialist at structured portfolio management and andrea eisfeldt a ucla finance professor shows that the yields of single family rentals are on par with stock market returns the pair examined the net yields and price appreciation of single family rental homes in the 30 largest metro areas between 1986 and 2014 separately net yields resulted in a 5 percent return while price appreciation accounted for a 4 percent return on average however both factors must be looked at to get an accurate picture of value argue the researchers both factors combined averaged a 9 percent annualized rate of return compare that with the s p 500 s annualized long term rate of return of about 10 percent and investing in single family rentals doesn t seem like such a bad idea the ratios of the total return the study found depended on the price range of the house for example the top 20 percent most expensive homes made the bulk of their profits from price appreciation around 5 percent whereas net yield only made up about 3 percent the reverse was true for houses in the bottom 20 percent in that case net yield was the big earner at around 6 percent and appreciation only brought in 3 percent ultimately the lower priced houses fetched more overall earning a total of 9 percent compared with 8 percent from the more expensive homes that would mean people who want to earn more today should invest in a less expensive house whereas those who are looking for a windfall when they cash out should consider more expensive homes what to consider before you become a landlord or airbnb host wilson and hasson both cite mistakes they made when they first began renting their property the main takeaways from both of them is to limit liability treat others fairly and spend every dollar on repairs and upgrades wisely put everything in writing and leave nothing to the imagination if you re renting out your home then you ll want to have a well articulated lease in place this should include when rent is due when the lease expires what the property owner is responsible for and what the tenant is responsible for including lawn and large appliance maintenance some places require tenants to care for amenities like pools and jacuzzis everything should be spelled out in the lease you want to eliminate any risk of ambiguity says joe santoro founder of personal property managers in pennsylvania the best way to ensure your lease is well written and amenable to both parties is to have an attorney review it for an airbnb rental the rules are different hosts can ask their guests to sign a contract prior to renting their house which is a good idea for a number of reasons first airbnb offers a type of insurance called a host guarantee which is a good start but it s not comprehensive this guarantee covers damage to your property up to 1 million with photo evidence and receipts required to proceed with any claims however there are conditions this guarantee doesn t cover damage caused by pets and limits coverage for art and collectibles for example for people like hasson who don t allow pets at their property creating a contract that discloses this rule is important screen your tenants one key to minimizing risk is knowing who is occupying your space santoro says a minimum screening is essential but a more thorough background check which includes credit history employment history criminal infractions and past evictions is even better deeper dives into a tenant s background as opposed to a simple credit report are costlier between 100 and 150 but can be a worthy investment in the long run it s better to get the right person in than to try to evict the wrong person evicting someone can be a long process every day that your house isn t rented is another day you re losing money says salvatore friscia managing broker at san diego premier property management with something like airbnb hosts can check guest reviews look at the guests airbnb profile and communicate with the guest within the airbnb website airbnb offers several features such as social connections which allows guests to add their facebook profiles and verified profile statuses to get verification users must submit identifiers such as their facebook profile phone number email address or government issued id nix the expensive stuff unless you re catering to a high end clientele you don t want to sink all of your capital into marble countertops and amenities adjust the amount of money you spend on fixing up your rental or providing amenities to the price point for example if your airbnb is priced at 400 per night then you ll probably want to include a few extra treats such as wine and late night snacks however for hosts like hasson who cater to budget minded crowds those bottles of wine can add up when i first started i d put different color m ms in different dishes and leave a bottle of wine after a while i was like what am i doing this is expensive hasson says the place to splurge in an airbnb says hasson is the bed save money on fancy appliances and expensive furniture and put those savings into a good mattress 500 thread count sheets and a nice comforter unhappy guests are guests who didn t sleep well hasson points out likewise if you re renting your home at a low to mid level price point you can get away with putting in less expensive countertops when wilson bought his duplex he had to change the fixtures and he opted for the most budget friendly ones he could find for the rental unit i want the property to look nice but i also don t want to spend a lot on upgrades wilson says treat your renters with respect the golden rule might be the most effective mantra when it comes to renting your space what people don t realize says santoro is that tenants have rights he says that many property owners are under the false assumption that because they own the real estate they can show up and even go inside whenever they want not only is that illegal in most cases but it can make for a poor relationship my advice is to be polite treat your tenants fairly you want to give them at least two or three days notice before you come over even if you live on the property this kind of respect goes a long way santoro says when it comes to repairs or problems with the house be expedient if you don t live near the property then you ll want to find someone you trust who can do repairs quickly that said santoro warns against would be landlords who rely too heavily on third parties to do repairs if you want to make money off renting your house then you have to be able to do some things yourself otherwise those little fixes and paint jobs will eat at your profits santoro says 2018 bankrate com distributed by

following the november ballot that saw washington state voters approve a sweeping gun control initiative democrats will be pushing for further regulation during the upcoming legislative session washington attorney general bob ferguson has released his legislative requests for the 2019 session which include three provisions on gun regulation these included restrictions on magazine size banning the sale of assault style weapons and prohibiting untraceable guns and guns that cannot be detected by a metal detector democrats have already pre filed bills in both the house and the senate to address magazine size and untraceable guns similar bills in legislature are proposing to ban the sale of high capacity magazines which can hold more than 10 rounds standard magazines for rifles like the ar 15 or ak 47 often hold 30 rounds while novelty magazines can hold up to 100 rounds if the bills are passed owners of high capacity magazines will have their existing ones grandfathered in and will be allowed to keep them as long as they are locked up bills in both chambers have also been filed by democrats to ban untraceable guns commonly known as ghost guns these are firearms assembled from untraceable parts often bought online or by parts created with a 3d printer firearms would also be required to contain enough metal to register on a metal detector the house bill defines an undetectable firearm as one that is made of polymer plastic and does not contain at least 3 7 ounces of steel or steel alloy this was supported by 45th district sen manka dhigra d who said it is designed to keep people from printing guns with blueprints available online i think a lot of the problem is we actually don t know how many people and who all received the blueprint on how to print them she said dhingra is also hoping to introduce a new bill dealing with domestic violence it would give law enforcement the ability to remove weapons and ammunition during a domestic violence call that results in an arrest she is also planning on re introducing another bill she sponsored last year would ban people with a history of violence and a mental health diagnosis from buying a gun she s hoping to file them by dec 14 at the latest no bills had been submitted as of jan 4 dealing with an assault style weapons ban supported by the attorney general ferguson has been requesting a sales ban on assault style weapons since at least 2017 the ban would bar the sale of weapons that use a telescoping stock pistol grip foregrip high capacity magazines or muzzle attachments like a flash suppressor assault weapons are semi automatic rifles with at least one military style feature making the weapons easier to fire more accurately and rapidly than a typical hunting rifle his request read the 2019 state legislature session begins jan 14 and runs through april 28 both senate measures were supported by dhingra who made gun restrictions a main point of her campaign in the house democratic reps javier valdez and tina orwall of the 46th and 33rd districts respectively sponsored both bills along with other representatives democrats won a majority in both chambers of the legislature during the november 2018 election and saw support for gun control after the passage of i 1639 i 1639 raises the age to purchase semi automatic rifles to 21 mandates safe storage of firearms statewide and requires enhanced background checks and approval from local law enforcement before an assault style weapon can be sold additionally it requires that law enforcement check that an owner of assault style weapons is eligible to keep owning the firearm each year however even with majorities dhingra said she wasn t sure if the legislature would be able to pass additional gun regulations not all democrats are identical so we have democrats who have different ideas and they represent different districts so they have to represent their constituents she said nationally eight states have bans on magazines that can hold more than 10 rounds high capacity magazines were banned nationwide between 1994 and 2004 under the federal assault weapons ban weapons with two or more components including a telescoping stock pistol grip flash suppressor bayonet mount or grenade launcher were barred from being sold ferguson s proposal to classify a weapon as an assault style weapon with only one of these elements would be stricter than the 1994 law

carbon dioxide emissions in the u s are on the rise again after several years of decline and a booming economy is the cause that s according toa report out today from the rhodium group an independent research firm that tracks co2 emissions in the u s it appears based on preliminary data that emissions in the u s grew by the highest rate since 2010 when we were recovering from the great recession says trevor houser a partner at rhodium and an author on the new estimate emissions rose roughly 3 4 percent in 2018 he says rhodium group rhodium group emissions were up for the first time since 2015 the big drivers were increased electricity demand and growth in trucking and aviation the report underscores an unusual upside to an economic downturn when the economy shrinks greenhouse gas emissions also go down that s what happened in the throes of the financial crisis in 2008 carbon dioxide emissions plummeted they ve been bouncing up and down since then but last year the strong economic growth meant a rise a cold winter was also a factor particularly because it led to higher consumption of natural gas and fuel oil in homes for heat there were some areas where decisions by government and industry helped to reduce some types of emissions a record number of coal fired power plants closed last year and emissions from passenger automobiles dropped slightly due to better fuel economy standards but it wasn t enough and houser wants more aggressive policies to drive drown co2 that seems unlikely for now policies to limit greenhouse gas emissions started under the obama administration are now being halted and even reversed under president trump what we ve seen is backsliding in federal policy and we re starting to feel the effects of that now houser says the report means the u s is less likely to meet its reduction targets under the global paris climate agreement according to andrew light a senior fellow at the world resources institute when the u s signed on to the agreement in 2015 then president obama promised a 26 28 percent reduction from 2005 levels by 2025 there s still time to catch up light says if we do get back on track in the united states toward having an energy policy that s consistent with the threat of climate change then we can turn these things around he says stock markets have faltered in recent months indicating the u s might be headed toward another recession that could cause emissions to drop but houser says it would not be productive a short term emissions decline as a result of a recession is not something anyone s cheering for he says we do the best on this issue when the economy is thriving and there are policies in place that can channel investment into clean energy technologies copyright 2021 npr to see more visit
days after reclaiming the house majority democrats are introducing gun control legislation timed for the anniversary of the shooting of former democratic rep gabby giffords speaker nancy pelosi and other democrats introduced a bill to expand background checks for sales and transfers of firearms on tuesday the eighth anniversary of the day giffords was shot in the head at a constituent meeting in arizona giffords who co founded a gun safety group with her husband mark kelly said in a statement friday she was thrilled that her former house colleagues were responding to a gun violence epidemic that killed nearly 40 000 people in 2017 the bill expanding background checks marks a critical first step toward strengthening america s gun laws and making our country a safer place to live work study worship and play giffords said i stand ready to do everything in my power to get this legislation across the finish line democrats promised swift action on gun control after the party regained the house majority following eight years of republican rule pelosi called the bill on background checks a common sense measure and cited polls showing 97 percent of americans support background checks for all gun sales our democratic majority will press relentlessly for bipartisan progress to end the epidemic of gun violence on our streets in our schools and in our places of worship pelosi said enough is enough rep mike thompson d calif who leads a gun violence prevention task force in the house said he and other lawmakers from both parties have been pushing years to expand background checks and approve other gun related bills but have been stymied by republican leaders noting that many freshman democrats ran on the issue of preventing gun violence thompson said political momentum to address gun violence is growing the american people have been demanding we take action and this new congress will deliver he said the background checks measure is likely to face opposition from the republican controlled senate and the white house where president donald trump has promised to protect the second amendment jennifer baker a spokeswoman for the national rifle association said a federal background check did not prevent giffords shooting adding that so called universal background checks will never be universal because criminals do not comply with the law lawmakers should deal with the root cause of violent crime instead of trying to score political points and push ineffective legislation that doesn t stop criminals from committing crimes baker said the trump administration moved last month to ban bump stocks the firearm attachments that allow semi automatic weapons to fire like machine guns bump stocks became a focal point of the gun control debate after they were used in october 2017 by a gunman in las vegas who fired into a crowd at a country music concert killing 58 people and injuring hundreds more a new regulation gives gun owners until late march to turn in or destroy the devices

china is buying american soybeans again and has cut tariffs on american cars it is offering to keep its hands off valuable corporate secrets while also allowing foreign investors into more industries than ever before the new york times reports beijing hopes all of that will be enough to let president trump declare victory and end the trade war between the two largest economies but the offer combines some real concessions like lower tariffs with nebulous promises and it will be hard to ensure that china sticks to its commitments that could make it a tough sell in washington the trump administration s trade hawks are still pushing for a lot more while even the doves fret that the new promises need effective enforcement to make sure that china follows through according to people with a detailed knowledge of american policymaking many american officials and businesses complain that china has long wiggled out of commitments accusations that china denies and the more hawkish wing of the administration contends that beijing s assurances have been so vague that it is hard to discern any meaningful progress a position some analysts support beijing s effort so far adds up to a modest adjustment of chinese foreign economic policy said scott kennedy a scholar at the center for strategic and international studies in washington but nowhere close to the great leap in liberalization that the u s and others are seeking midlevel trade talks this week in beijing which will continue into wednesday have been productive but if negotiators do not come to a deal in the coming weeks the administration is poisted to raise american tariffs on 200 billion a year in chinese made goods on march 2 amping up the trade war at a time when china faces rapidly softening growth and the american economy is facing headwinds it is not clear whether the moves will fully satisfy trump the american stock market one of the president s favorite barometers has slumped in part over trade tensions and further market gyrations could prompt the president to declare victory even if china does not give up too much on tuesday trump said in a message on twitter that the talks were going very well a sign that beijing was at least moving in what he considered the right direction china added a complicated new variable to the trade talks on tuesday by inviting north korea s leader kim jong un to beijing the invitation could increase pressure on trump to reach a deal soon but it might also antagonize national security hawks in his administration who worry about north korea s ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programs the white house has said china is an unfair trading partner its tariffs are too high it says it forces american companies to give up important technology to chinese partners as a price for doing business there it offers subsidies and cheap loans to chinese companies that hope to compete with american companies in strategic areas like jetliners semiconductors and electric cars chinese officials dispute those claims they say higher chinese tariffs and strict investment limits are justified because china is still a developing country and well behind the united states in many economic respects china s manufacturing capabilities they say need upgrading for the country s continued growth they have consistently denied that the government allows forced technology transfers saying some companies willingly share and make big profits in china doing so wn com jim berrie
days after reclaiming the house majority democrats are introducing gun control legislation timed for the anniversary of the shooting of former democratic rep gabby giffords speaker nancy pelosi and other democrats introduced a bill to expand background checks for sales and transfers of firearms on tuesday the eighth anniversary of the day giffords was shot in the head at a constituent meeting in arizona giffords who co founded a gun safety group with her husband mark kelly said in a statement friday she was thrilled that her former house colleagues were responding to a gun violence epidemic that killed nearly 40 000 people in 2017 the bill expanding background checks marks a critical first step toward strengthening america s gun laws and making our country a safer place to live work study worship and play giffords said i stand ready to do everything in my power to get this legislation across the finish line democrats promised swift action on gun control after the party regained the house majority following eight years of republican rule pelosi called the bill on background checks a common sense measure and cited polls showing 97 percent of americans support background checks for all gun sales our democratic majority will press relentlessly for bipartisan progress to end the epidemic of gun violence on our streets in our schools and in our places of worship pelosi said enough is enough rep mike thompson d calif who leads a gun violence prevention task force in the house said he and other lawmakers from both parties have been pushing years to expand background checks and approve other gun related bills but have been stymied by republican leaders noting that many freshman democrats ran on the issue of preventing gun violence thompson said political momentum to address gun violence is growing the american people have been demanding we take action and this new congress will deliver he said the background checks measure is likely to face opposition from the republican controlled senate and the white house where president donald trump has promised to protect the second amendment jennifer baker a spokeswoman for the national rifle association said a federal background check did not prevent giffords shooting adding that so called universal background checks will never be universal because criminals do not comply with the law lawmakers should deal with the root cause of violent crime instead of trying to score political points and push ineffective legislation that doesn t stop criminals from committing crimes baker said the trump administration moved last month to ban bump stocks the firearm attachments that allow semi automatic weapons to fire like machine guns bump stocks became a focal point of the gun control debate after they were used in october 2017 by a gunman in las vegas who fired into a crowd at a country music concert killing 58 people and injuring hundreds more a new regulation gives gun owners until late march to turn in or destroy the devices

speaking at a meeting with former fed officials at a conference in atlanta last friday federal reserve chairman jerome powell said that the fed does not have a predetermined plan to raise the key interest rate and that the central bank will be more flexible in its monetary policy this year this is the new position of the head of the fed earlier in december powell argued that the process of reducing the balance goes smoothly and reaches its goal so they do not intend to change anything at the central bank after powell s speech on friday the dollar fell sharply and stock indices closed the day with a noticeable gain futures on federal funds which investors use to bet on fed policy last wednesday indicated a 91 chance that interest rates would be reduced this year or remain at the same level investors are increasingly inclined to think that in 2019 the fed will not raise interest rates the more cautious position of the fed in this matter voiced by powell on friday confirms investors opinion that the fed is likely to refrain from raising rates in 2019 at all this is a fundamental change compared to the beginning of november when a 90 probability of a rate hike in 2019 was predicted this means that stock markets have already reached the local bottom in late december and if the macro data from the united states comes with positive indicators and there is a positive trend in resolving the trade conflict between the united states and china stock indexes will quickly regain their positions and the threat of breaking the almost 10 year bull trend of the us stock market will change to a return of positive dynamics the fate of the dollar will also depend entirely on the actions of the fed and other global central banks if the fed does not raise rates and other central banks begin to curtail its soft monetary policy the dollar which grew by about 4 8 last year will be vulnerable to other competing currencies this year 15 00 cad bank of canada interest rate decision accompanying statement of the bank of canada report of the bank of canada monetary policy committee the bank of canada will decide on the interest rate in december the bank of canada did not change its monetary policy in a companion statement the central bank stated that the pace of further rate hikes will depend on a number of factors including the impact of this process on consumption and the housing market as well as on the situation in international trade policy shock resilience in relation to oil prices the situation with companies investments and the economic assessment given by the bank of canada will also play an important role in making decisions about the future course of monetary policy the bank of canada said probably at a meeting on wednesday the bank of canada will once again keep the interest rate at 1 75 probably on the eve of this meeting of the bank the canadian dollar will remain under pressure economists forecast a further slowdown in the canadian economy amid falling oil prices and deferred effects of earlier increases in interest rates the consequences of a tightening policy by the bank of canada as well as a slowdown in wages and a weak housing market have a negative impact on the activity of the country s households in their accompanying statement and report on changes in monetary policy representatives of the bank of canada will explain the position of the bank and assess the current economic situation in the country the hard tone of the accompanying statement of the bank of canada regarding rising inflation and the prospects for further monetary tightening will cause a strengthening of the canadian dollar if the bank of canada signals to extend the period for maintaining a soft monetary policy the canadian currency will decline the banking policy committee of the bank of canada will make a regular quarterly report on current monetary policy issues containing information on changes in monetary policy the hard tone of the report may cause cad reinforcement 15 15 cad press conference of the bank of canada during the press conference the head of the bank of canada stephen poloz will explain the position of the bank and assess the current economic situation in the country if the tone of the speech of stephen poloz is tough with respect to the monetary policy of the bank of canada then the canadian dollar will strengthen in the foreign exchange market if stephen poloz favors maintaining a soft monetary policy the canadian currency will decline in any case during the performance of stephen poloz the highest volatility in the canadian dollar trades is expected 15 30 gbp speech by bank of england ceo mark carney participants in financial markets are waiting for him to clarify the situation regarding the future policy of the central bank of great britain volatility during his speech usually increases dramatically in the pound trade and in the ftse index of the london stock exchange if mark carney gives any hints of tightening or easing of monetary policy if he does not touch the monetary policy issues of the bank of england then the reaction to his speech will be weak also investors will be interested in the current position of the bank of england in relation to brexit in one of his recent speeches mark carney said that the management of the bank of england does not doubt the ability of british banks to resist if the brexit negotiations end in nothing in his opinion the withdrawal of great britain from the eu without an agreement would be a real economic shock in this situation raising or lowering interest rates by the bank of england is not so important for the economy probably during his speech mark carney will again talk about the prospects of the uk economy and the actions of the bank of england in the conditions before the official date for the brexit march 29 2019 and after 15 30 usd weekly report of the energy information administration of the united states department of energy on petroleum and petroleum products in us storage facilities the publication of data is usually accompanied by an increase in the volatility of oil prices which are expressed in us dollars reducing stocks as a rule has a positive effect on oil prices the previous value is 0 007 million barrels of oil and petroleum products if the reserves of oil and petroleum products in the united states rose again last week then this will adversely affect oil prices in recent days there has been an increase in oil prices after a sharp drop in the last 3 months in september the price of brent crude oil was 86 60 per barrel which is a multi year high the fall in global stock indices and signs of a slowdown in global economic growth also adversely affect oil prices there is no sign of a change in the bearish trend in oil prices despite opec s determination to resume oil production again 19 00 usd minutes from the last meeting of the fed open market operations committee fomc protocol publication of the protocol is extremely important to determine the current fed policy and the prospects for raising interest rates in the united states the probability of the fed raising interest rates in 2019 is currently less than 10 according to futures contracts for federal funds volatility of trading in financial markets at the time of publication of the protocol usually increases because the text of the protocol often contains either changes or clarification of details regarding the outcome of the december meeting of the fomc fed the soft tone of the protocol will have a positive effect on stock indices and will adversely affect the us dollar the harsh rhetoric of fed officials regarding monetary policy prospects will push the dollar to further growth

missing in 1945 in close encounters of the third kind the hysteria of a post pearl harbor los angeles in 1941 nazis in both raiders of the lost ark and indiana jones and the last crusade a group of men making one last bombing run in the amazing stories episode the mission and a japanese prisoner of war camp seen through the eyes of a young boy in empire of the sun legend has it that after the success of e t the extra terrestrial the head of universal pictures sid sheinberg purchased the rights to thomas keneally s novel schindler s list for steven spielberg to direct spielberg was very moved by the book but felt he was not ready to handle such a difficult subject the director veered from his usual popcorn style movies to drama using the color purple and empire of the sun as training grounds for more dramatic fare receiving mixed reactions from both critics and audiences in january of 1993 spielberg felt ready to tackle schindler s list and cameras began rolling in poland beginning a long time collaboration with cinematographer janusz kaminsky who has lensed every movie for the director since schindler s list tells the story of war profiteer oskar schindler liam neeson who arrives in krakow shortly after the german invasion in 1939 taking control of an enamel factory and convincing the nazis to provide him jews from the ghetto as cheap labor schindler is portrayed by neeson at first as an opportunist charming those in charge around him to get what he needs to turn a profit selling pots and pans to the germans as part of the war effort when he begins to see the brutality inflicted on the jews particularly by ss leader amon goeth played chillingly by ralph fiennes he has accountant itzhak stern ben kingsley assign 1 100 jews to his munitions factory in brinnlitz just as the nazis begin sending all jews to their concentration camp in auschwitz for extermination schindler s list revealed a maturity in steven spielberg as an artist not afraid to show the brutal violence of the nazis the darkness of goeth s evil heart or that schindler was a flawed human being despite his place in history video 5 5 3d rating na schindler s list may be the first film shot in black and white to be released on 4k uhd blu ray and just may make a good argument for more classic black and white films to be released in the format to be fair the movie does contain a few color and colorized sequences candle flames and the girl in red but that actually makes the argument even stronger i was a theater evaluator for thx when schindler s list was first released theatrically in 1993 and what i remember most about the theatrical presentations of this significant film was that because spielberg wanted only the colorized and full color sequences printed on color stock and all black and white printed on black and white stock each print had to have the color sequences edited in by hand since black and white printed on color stock would have a bluish tint this meant that many prints went out to theatres with missing sequences and one of the reasons for its staggered release in addition to the subject matter i remember having to see this film at two different theatres at least three times each until i could confirm that each theater had a complete print when kevin koster reviewed the 20th anniversary blu ray release in 2013 he rated the video 4 5 out of 5 he noted that the cutting from pure black and white to sequences with added color to be rather noticeable although i found them to less obvious as they were theatrically in 1993 with this 4k uhd transfer which includes both dolby vision and hdr10 high dynamic range those cuts are seamless when viewed on an hdr10 capable display the colorized sequences remain subtle but where this disc really shines is in both clarity and contrast detail is greatly improved not to say the 2013 blu ray included in this set was no slouch with fine texturing on walls to facial features receiving a significant boost the high level of contrast adds to the heightened detail where some backgrounds during daytime scenes on the blu ray appeared slightly washed out yet on the uhd disc one can easily make out the textures in the plastered walls the same can be said of darker sequences with wall textures that blended into blackness on the blu ray are much more refined on the uhd in comparing the uhd to the blu ray i also found the blu ray to appear as if it had a very subtle sepia tone while the uhd was more silver in appearance audio 5 5 schindler s list has been remixed in dolby atmos with a dolby truehd 7 1 core and it is a noticeable improvement this is a very performance driven film and perhaps for that reason for the most part the mix has always been front heavy utilizing the surrounds only when absolutely necessary that is still the case here but sound placement is much more precise overheads are used sparingly mostly to help fill the listening space more evenly but also to add more immersion with discrete sounds such as the sounds of luggage being thrown over balconies during the ghetto evacuation or public address announcements inside the camp special features 4 5

depended on this aid to augment their grocery budgets in september according to the us department of agriculture s latest data more than 700 000 alabamians utilize snap funds each month according to alabama arise a statewide public advocacy organization alabama has one of the highest snap utilization rates in the country because the majority of people are low income earners it s children a very large number of children its people with disabilities its the elderly and its people in families that are working poor said carol gundlach policy analyst at alabama arise food banks across the country will have to step up if the shutdown continues into next month the food bank of north alabama is preparing for the worst we actually made sure that we have some food coming in this week that will help us kind of replenish our stores after the holidays so that we have food for anyone in need explained shirley schofield executive director of the food bank of north alabama especially if there s an increase in the numbers schofield said if snap benefits are affected next month the food bank will be ready to help serve the more than 146 000 north alabamians who are food insecure the us department of agriculture said last month that the program is funded through january but it has only 3 billion in reserves to cover february that s less than two thirds of food stamps 4 8 billion cost in september what the agency would do next is unknown if the 3 billion reserve were distributed evenly that would translate into a roughly 90 cut for the 19 4 million households that receive an average of 245 a month according to the left leaning center on budget and policy priorities that would put a huge hole in the budget every month for families that have very low incomes and would likely result in severe hardship and hunger said dottie rosenbaum a senior fellow at the center a program that provides food assistance to more than 7 million low income pregnant women new mothers and young children is similarly threatened the special supplemental nutrition program for women infants and children also has federal funding to last only through january according to the national wic association an advocacy organization the average cost of a monthly wic food package is just under 41 per person last week the agency s food nutrition service division said it intends to allocate all remaining carryover and unspent funds to state agencies according to the rev douglas greenaway the association s president federal officials are working with state agencies to see what other unspent money might be available for reallocation how much is available and how long the program can continue operating will vary by state but these actions together would push the cutoff date into february it becomes a make or break moment likely in mid february greenaway said at that point it s possible states might not sign up new clients or might stop providing benefits to women who recently gave birth or older children greenaway said they might also provide only one month of benefits instead of the typical three months child nutrition programs including school breakfasts and lunches and after school meals will continue into february according to the usda while states partner with the federal government on many food assistance programs they do not have the funds to cover the federal portion during the shutdown said james weill president of the nonprofit food research action center the usda did not respond to requests for comment if federal nutrition aid does run dry next month it will put a big strain on the nation s food banks which provide groceries to tens of millions of americans through the federal emergency food assistance program donations from the food industry and charitable contributions the usda paid for its shipments through march before the shutdown took effect said carrie calvert managing director of government relations at feeding america the nation s largest domestic hunger relief organization however the federal agency is no longer reimbursing states for storing and distributing the products which costs 5 3 million a month so far no problems have been reported but calvert is concerned that the funds will dry up if the shutdown is prolonged another issue if low income americans stop receiving their food stamps and other benefits more will turn to food banks for help many of which don t have the resources to handle the additional crush of people the capital area food bank which annually serves half a million people in the washington metro area through 450 pantries is already planning to boost its stocks since it expects to see more clients soon both federal workers and contractors who are losing their paychecks and low income residents who are losing their government aid it s already getting queries from the food pantries and soup kitchens it serves about whether they can get more supplies the shutdown comes at a bad time because the food bank typically has less inventory in january and february since it receives fewer donations after the holiday season ends the nonprofit agency is talking to grocery and corporate partners to see if they can hold food drives in coming weeks we just need to be able to provide more said radha muthiah the food bank s ceo

robert bork began his influential 1978 book the antitrust paradox with the story of a prominent attorney and future supreme court justice at an american bar association meeting of several hundred antitrust lawyers arguing that a good antitrust regulator behaves like the sheriff of a frontier town he did not sift the evidence distinguish between suspects and solve crimes but merely walked the main street and every so often pistol whipped a few people tim wu a law professor at columbia university argues in his new book the curse of bigness that american antitrust enforcement should return to that bygone era among other policy proposals wu recommends a simple but per se ban on mergers that reduce the number of major firms to less than four he also proposes that regulators use breakups rather than consent decrees because they are self executing and a much cleaner way of dealing with competition problems in his narrative history of american antitrust law wu s hero is louis brandeis who served on the supreme court from 1916 to 1939 and coined the phrase curse of bigness to refer to the societal problems he saw as engendered by gilded age monopolies bork is the villain of the story having spearheaded the chicago school s role in narrowing antitrust regulation to economic concerns and establishing consumer welfare as its lodestar the small business myth while it is understandable that brandeis suspected there was a curse of bigness in the economy given the paucity of data available at the time the same cannot be said in wu s case in their book published earlier this year big is beautiful robert d atkinson and michael lind show that large firms pay their employees more than small firms give their employees better benefits create more jobs on a net basis and employ a more diverse workforce big business is more likely to be unionized than small business and workers in large firms are less likely to be laid off or injured on the job large companies are also an engine of productivity growth investing more in both research and development and in employee training source jacobin source jacobin citing much of the same evidence socialist writer matt bruenig has tried to persuade the left that small businesses are overrated noting that in reality small business promotion is mostly a bad idea small businesses pay lower wages provide worse benefits are often exempt from important worker protections and are incompatible with the way unionization works in the u s rejecting the myth of small business is thus neither a left nor a right wing conspiracy as in wu s cynical narrative of the chicago school rather recognizing the value of bigness is possible whether your primary concern is for the well being of workers or economic productivity overall conflating natural monopolies and de jure monopolies but maybe bigness tips from a positive to a negative when a single firm takes over a whole market monopolization enables companies to raise prices and lower output for the sake of maximizing profits however if we are to vanquish the evils of monopoly we must distinguish between its sources natural monopolies which exist due to high fixed costs or economies of scale differ from government granted monopolies and the two require distinct policy responses here again wu s analysis falls short in the most infamous case of abusing market power in recent memory martin shkreli now in prison for securities fraud raised the price of an infectious disease drug from 13 50 to 750 overnight in his retelling wu fails to mention that shkreli was only able to profitably jack up the price of this lifesaving drug because of a regulatory backlog at the fda daraprim the drug in question was no longer under patent but no other producer was approved to sell the generic and the approval process is notoriously long in the united states similarly whenever discussing big pharma or hospital monopolies wu erroneously characterizes them as the consequence of derelict antitrust regulators lacking sufficient will to enforce the laws on the books yet in many of these cases the lack of competition is a result of poorly designed patent laws and exclusionary regulations from certificate of need laws to occupational licensing as my colleague will wilkinson put it there are companies that do nothing but hoard pre existing tech patents and then sue everyone who comes within a country mile of infringing on one of them just buy up little state sanctioned monopolies then make a mint destroying rather than creating economic value this is monopoly at its worst yet wu s framework provides little help in understanding it the inability to distinguish between natural and government granted monopoly is most glaring when wu says the original boston tea party was after all really an anti monopoly protest yes but it was a protest against government granted monopoly the british government had passed the tea act of 1773 to reinforce the east india company s monopoly on the sale of tea in the colonies if private power had been the real concern of the protest maybe the colonists would have revolted against the east india company instead of king george iii simple industry concentrating ratios can be misleading in a run that lasted some two decades american industry reached levels of industry concentration arguably unseen since the original trust era a full 75 percent of industries witnessed increased concentration from the years 1997 to 2012 wu explains he goes on to use increasing market shares by companies ranging from at t to bayer to ticketmaster to sound the antitrust alarm but market share statistics which are used to define a monopoly in structural analysis often obscure more than they reveal about the state of competition in an industry to deal with this problem antitrust economists have developed more advanced analytical tools for studying market power such as diversion ratios the gross upward pricing pressure index guppi test and merger simulations a deeper look at the beer airline and book retailing sectors shows how relying solely on the structural framework leaves much to be desired mergers in the airline industry have left us with only three traditional major airlines that must lead to monopoly profits right in fact as the priceonomics blog notes six major airlines went through bankruptcy in the 2000s and from 1979 to 2014 airlines lost 35 billion one recent paper in the american economic review was simply titled why can t us airlines make money airfares are also down by about a third over the same period it is hard to conclude that allowing mergers in a persistently unprofitable industry with falling prices and rising output is really what ails our society source priceonomics source quartz the book also notes ominously that after recent mergers and acquisitions in the beer industry anheuser busch inbev and millercoors control over 70 percent of beer sales but there are more than 6 000 breweries in the united states a 150 year high is this really a market that lacks choice or is difficult to enter of all of its markets amazon is most dominant in books which is no surprise considering it was the product category that launched the company so did amazon kill the independent bookstore not quite the number of indie bookstores is up by about 35 percent in the last decade source brewers association source quartz the trickiest part of market definition in antitrust analysis is determining the boundaries of the market which products are inside or outside of the market in modern antitrust analysis this question is important but not essential as there are many other factors for determining competitive effects in the old structural approach which relies on bright line presumptions based on market shares market definition is pivotal consider amazon which has 49 percent of the u s e commerce market but only 5 percent of the u s retail market which one is the appropriate market for structural analysis or take google and facebook in the u s together they control 57 percent of the digital advertising market but only 25 percent of the total advertising market which one is the appropriate market for structural analysis the second to last chapter of wu s book is titled the rise of the tech trusts and the extra attention these companies receive is understandable given their prominence in the economy but before we break up big tech there are other important facts about the tech industry to consider the top five companies that spent the most on research and development last year were all tech companies combined spending on r d and capital expenditures at technology companies is increasing as a percent of revenue over time the big five apple amazon facebook google and microsoft may be dominant but they also compete against each other in a wide range of product categories big tech companies simply are not acting like the complacent monopolies wu portrays source recode source kpcb most importantly policymakers should be cognizant of the cyclical nature of the tech industry at t was dominant in telephone service ibm in mainframe computing microsoft in desktop aol and yahoo in web 1 0 google and facebook in mobile as benedict evans shows each cycle in tech allows a few dominant companies to build a moat and create quasi monopolies no competitor ever does cross the moat the castle just becomes irrelevant when the next cycle begins economics is not a morality play nobel prize winning economist paul krugman once wrote economics is not a morality play it s not a happy story in which virtue is rewarded and vice punished the market economy is a system for organizing activity with no special moral significance the rich don t necessarily deserve their wealth and the poor certainly don t deserve their poverty in the early chapters wu makes a strained connection between the social darwinists and the gilded age monopolists claiming they were motivated by the same eugenicist ideology as applied to society and business the problem with inferring moral motives behind economic decisions is that they don t neatly map onto the good and bad teams teddy roosevelt the trustbuster himself was also a eugenicist an inconvenient fact left out by wu in a letter to charles davenport one of the leaders of the american eugenics movement roosevelt wrote that society has no business to permit degenerates to reproduce their kind any group of farmers who permitted their best stock not to breed and let all the increase come from the worst stock would be treated as fit inmates for an asylum we have no business to permit the perpetuation of citizens of the wrong type wu s book does a serviceable job relating the history of american antitrust law but one wonders whether we should follow antitrust policy recommendations from an author who makes claims about economic concentration leading to the rise of nazism based on sources that don t withstand the most basic scrutiny wu makes errors and omits facts when they serve his narrative substituting rigor for a simple story of good versus evil the book is particularly ungenerous in its description of peter thiel s short essay competition is for losers which argues that entrepreneurs should pursue businesses or product lines that are hard to substitute a call for startup founders to resist being copycats that gets translated by wu through omitted context into a kind of monopoly worship in sum professor wu fetishizes smallness despite the evidence showing that most things progressives and free marketers alike value increase with firm size he conflates natural and de jure monopolies underrating the role that regulations and patent law play in establishing and sustaining monopoly power he advocates returning to a structural approach in antitrust enforcement despite it being abandoned by empirical researchers decades ago because market structure and competitive effects are not systematically correlated except in special circumstances and lastly in an attempt at narrative wu constructs a morality play in which he lobs ad hominem attacks at monopolists for their ethical shortcomings and abhorrent political viewpoints when many of the same viewpoints were held by the trustbusters he otherwise praises it is easy to demonize and scapegoat big business particularly tech companies at a time when the president of the united states views many of those same companies as his political enemies and is groping around for any tool to

pictured anna soubry outside parliament yesterday there was something horribly predictable about the shameful scenes outside parliament in which a group of men drowned out mp anna soubry with taunts of liar traitor and even nazi during a tv interview they then harassed her all the way back to the palace of westminster keeping up the barrage of insults while crowding her with intimidating body language questions have rightly been raised about whether the police should have intervened rather than let the group pursue its victim but there s something far more worrying going on something that reaches deeper into our culture and poses a greater threat to society than a few inept cops it is a fundamental shift in the norms of civil behaviour a sense that a line has been crossed it was like seeing a twitter hate mob leap out of a computer screen in front of our eyes certainly their behaviour mirrored the unbridled vitriol often displayed on twitter but this was worse these were men fuelled not only by fanatical self belief but by the notion that soubry a staunch remainer was not deserving of any kind of respect as a human being such was their fury that in their eyes she had become as the nazis used to say untermensch subhuman inferior and therefore a legitimate target that is what makes this kind of behaviour on the rise across the board from anarchists targeting jacob rees mogg s children to the intimidation of journalists such as the bbc s laura kuenssberg by the hard left so deeply terrifying the fact that it s so open so brazen those men hurling abuse at soubry genuinely don t think they are doing anything wrong it s when you see that look on someone s face when you realise that in their eyes you are a human piñata to be beaten with a stick until the insides spill out it s when you realise nothing you could say no logical argument no compromise could ever make them see you otherwise that s when you feel most hopeless questions have rightly been raised about whether the police should have intervened rather than let the group pursue its victim i know on the occasions when a similar thing has happened to me i m not an mp but i am married to a conservative and i write for the daily mail which in some people s minds is just as bad it has shaken me to the core i m lucky though neither i nor my family have been in any real danger or at least i ve never felt we were unlike the mp jo cox murdered in her constituency by a far right fantasist just days before the referendum vote her death profoundly shocked us all and it is no less a tragedy almost three years on but if a similar thing were to happen again would we be as surprised i fear not for this is the reality of politics in britain today the political landscape has become so intensely polarised it s hard to see how normal service can ever be resumed and it s not just the fanatics of leave vs remain it s the way the opposing left and right see each other not in terms of differences of policy or opinion but as good vs evil nor is it just at the margins either shadow chancellor john mcdonnell famously said last year that he wants a situation where no tory mp can travel anywhere in the country can show their face anywhere without being challenged by direct action well it seems he got his wish neither i nor my family have been in any real danger or at least i ve never felt we were unlike the mp jo cox murdered in her constituency by a far right fantasist just days before the referendum vote where will this growing hysteria lead to a hollowing out of democracy in which the only people who can survive in politics are the brutes and the boors the ones who can stomach the abuse the thinkers dreamers gentler more vulnerable souls will all be hounded out and thus the electorate will be represented only by those with the skin of a rhino and the emotional sensitivity of a grizzly bear of course mps have a duty to engage with voters but what they cannot be expected to do is endure a level of abuse that in any other context would be deemed wholly unacceptable freedom of speech is a right that should not be abused in the name of prejudice and hatred olivia and the triumph of a real woman i cannot tell you how much pleasure it gives me to see olivia colman bagging gongs in hollywood she won best actress at the golden globes on sunday night for her portrayal of queen anne in the favourite and is hotly tipped for an oscar in a few weeks not only is she a supremely talented actress she is also proof that even in this image obsessed instagram age you don t have to look or dress like a victoria s secret model to achieve recognition i cannot tell you how much pleasure it gives me to see olivia colman bagging gongs in hollywood don t let cronies bring down lords norman fowler is right there are far too many cronies in the house of lords people there not because they have a genuine passion for public service but because at some point in their lives they brown nosed the right person but let s not forget that among the stuffed ermines there are some very wise heads ruth deech paul bew maurice glasman richard chartres alexander trees the only vet in parliament to my knowledge to name but a few it would be a tragedy if those characters who appear to be most interested in having a fancy title to put on their notepaper were to bring down the entire edifice and deprive us of the grown ups who take the primary function of the lords holding the increasingly unhinged commons to account very seriously indeed i must confess i found channel 4 s brexit the uncivil war hard to watch it wasn t that i was portrayed very fleetingly as a boot faced opera loving old crone i ll take the boot face but i prefer the ballet or that the events as presented were not entirely as i recall them it was after all a drama it was more the way that craig oliver david cameron s chief of staff at the time of the referendum mastermind of the losing remain campaign and as the final credits revealed political adviser on the show had clearly been allowed to spin it relentlessly in his side s favour thus anyone of a vaguely eurosceptic bent from ordinary members of the public to politicians was presented at best as a bumbling fool at worst as a two dimensional bigot don t they always say that history is written by the winners in the case of the eu referendum it seems the opposite may well be true campaign meltdown isn t there something just a tad snowflakey about the soldier portrayed as a snowflake in the army s latest recruitment campaign threatening to resign for being made to look like a snowflake isn t there something just a tad snowflakey about the soldier portrayed as a snowflake in the army s latest recruitment campaign threatening to resign for being made to look like a snowflake it s a bit unfair of jeremy clarkson to say the bbc is aimed at seven people in islington some of them live in neighbouring hampstead too vegans chew on this the war against meat consumption continues vegan dog food is the latest thing apparently i m sure it is theoretically possible for a dog to have a healthy vegan diet but if vegans are as they claim so preoccupied with the welfare of animals here s a question for you what are the ethics of imposing human moral and cultural choices on animals my three dogs have never to my knowledge expressed any misgivings about the contents of their tin of chappie and when one of them happens on some rotting animal carcass in the park i don t for example hear snowy the eldest lecturing monkee the puppy about the rights and wrongs of eating leftover kfc instead he just growls at him and claims it for his own fact is nature is red in tooth and claw and no amount of anthropomorphic wishful thinking on behalf of vegans is ever going to change that continuing on the subject of vegans it is after all veganuary one of the main arguments deployed by plant evangelists against the farming of livestock is the amount of methane that cows produce and how it is contributing to global warming i am willing to concede that cows do indeed produce a lot of gas but then again so do pulse eating humans might we not simply be swapping one source of methane for another finally more exciting vegan news not that i m obsessed or anything my son reports that following chelsea vs nottingham forest at the weekend he popped into greggs for his customary post match steak bake stocks of which were perilously low the new vegan sausage roll below by contrast shelves full of the things happy to say he still wasn t tempted my son reports that following chelsea vs nottingham forest at the weekend he popped into greggs for his customary post match steak bake stocks of which were perilously low the new vegan sausage roll pictured by contrast shelves full of the things yachts and fast cars were once the vdws vulgar displays of wealth of choice for the super successful now it s something far more precious children no self respecting high achiever is complete without a brood that not only signals virility him and fertility her but ensures the world knows how many members of

carbon dioxide emissions in the u s are on the rise again after several years of decline and a booming economy is the cause that s according toa report out today from the rhodium group an independent research firm that tracks co2 emissions in the u s it appears based on preliminary data that emissions in the u s grew by the highest rate since 2010 when we were recovering from the great recession says trevor houser a partner at rhodium and an author on the new estimate emissions rose roughly 3 4 percent in 2018 he says rhodium group rhodium group emissions were up for the first time since 2015 the big drivers were increased electricity demand and growth in trucking and aviation the report underscores an unusual upside to an economic downturn when the economy shrinks greenhouse gas emissions also go down that s what happened in the throes of the financial crisis in 2008 carbon dioxide emissions plummeted they ve been bouncing up and down since then but last year the strong economic growth meant a rise a cold winter was also a factor particularly because it led to higher consumption of natural gas and fuel oil in homes for heat there were some areas where decisions by government and industry helped to reduce some types of emissions a record number of coal fired power plants closed last year and emissions from passenger automobiles dropped slightly due to better fuel economy standards but it wasn t enough and houser wants more aggressive policies to drive drown co2 that seems unlikely for now policies to limit greenhouse gas emissions started under the obama administration are now being halted and even reversed under president trump what we ve seen is backsliding in federal policy and we re starting to feel the effects of that now houser says the report means the u s is less likely to meet its reduction targets under the global paris climate agreement according to andrew light a senior fellow at the world resources institute when the u s signed on to the agreement in 2015 then president obama promised a 26 28 percent reduction from 2005 levels by 2025 there s still time to catch up light says if we do get back on track in the united states toward having an energy policy that s consistent with the threat of climate change then we can turn these things around he says stock markets have faltered in recent months indicating the u s might be headed toward another recession that could cause emissions to drop but houser says it would not be productive a short term emissions decline as a result of a recession is not something anyone s cheering for he says we do the best on this issue when the economy is thriving and there are policies in place that can channel investment into clean energy technologies copyright 2021 npr to see more visit

update at t has reached out to us with a statement regarding its employee adjustments at t s statement we are hiring to meet the needs of the growth areas of our business in fact we hired more than 20 000 new employees last year and more than 17 000 the year before in cases where we do have to adjust our workforce we take steps to lessen the effect on employees at t is preparing to let go of an unspecified number of employees from no fewer than ten operation hubs in the lead up to the closing of its merger with time warner according to leaked internal documents advertisement advertisement provided by an unnamed employee the leak consisted of a memo sent out to the company s management staff by at t president of technology operations jeff mcelfresh locations listed in that indicated the layoffs would primarily affect new york california texas new jersey washington colorado georgia illinois missouri and washington dc a spokesperson reportedly confirmed that at t would be moving to adjust its workforce a source at at t referred to the action as a reduction to its surplus of employees and plans for the layoffs are expected to be finalized by the end of the month while not necessarily related that would imply that plans are intended to be finished just as the company is wrapping up its 85 billion merger deal with time warner the two companies will no longer be forced to operate as separate entities in february this is nothing new for at t advertisement the memo also made reference to lowering costs and getting faster leaner and more agile but this is hardly the first time at t has made changes that are arguably harmful to its workforce to accomplish that goal as of august the mobile service provider and now media mogul had already closed down 44 call centers from 2011 many of the jobs in those call centers have since been moved to overseas locations where employees can be hired for as little as 2 per hour more recent reductions and disagreements with employees have also been set against a backdrop of record profits from quarter to quarter over the past several years in early 2018 those profits equated to around 10 billion with the company spending as much as 16 45 billion to buy back stock over the preceding five years tax breaks supported by and ultimately benefiting the carrier brought back around 20 billion some of that around 1 000 in bonuses was later returned to approximately 200 000 of its employees but those bonuses were later discovered to have been negotiated prior to their delivery in total the company s profits rose from around 13 billion in 2016 to approximately 29 5 billion in 2017 as a result of tax reductions advertisement further benefits followed when the fcc backed by at t and several other telecoms and technology companies effectively dismantled net neutrality regulations in mid 2018 the regulations had been put in place to limit isps and other companies handling of internet traffic ensuring that all traffic was treated equally without throttling among other restrictions at t was among several other service providers that argued the regulations were unnecessary and stifling competition trouble incoming over the past several years threats to workers jobs whether at at t or other carriers have typically resulted in intervention and negotiations involving the communications workers of america cwa labor union there s no guarantee that will happen in this case and as outlined above it hasn t always protected workers when the union gets involved but it would certainly spell trouble in the case of at t historically negotiations between the two organizations haven t always gone smoothly often resulting in worker strikes and at t being forced to offer more compensation and protections for its union associated employees
bad bunkers what can be done to protect a shipowner s charterer s fleet by alex tang head of business development and marketing petro inspect alex tang director sales marketing image credit petro inspect in the wake of the recent spate of bad bunkers being delivered in major ports such as houston panama and singapore owners charterers are obviously worried about engine damage vessels have reported various operation and equipment problems like fuel pump damage and excessive filter blocking or sludging after or during using the fuel and not to mention substantial off hire and downtime for de bunkering here i will look at some of the key issues and along with loss mitigation strategies for owners operators firstly petro inspect is offering its clients a practical approach in dealing with this contamination and help identify the fit for purpose fuel rather than following the traditional fuel testing methods that will not identify contaminants at molecular level we provide alternative methods of fuel testing essentially mitigating losses that would have been brought about by consuming contaminated bunkers only gcms analysis would show phenolics compound styrene and indene chemical contaminants because of serious wait time up to 2 3 weeks in getting the analysis results for gcms tests petro inspect has partnered with major laboratories in the united arab emirates uae and singapore in providing a one stop solution in deterring contaminated fuel from being bunkered onboard the vessel in the first place by offering pre testing of bunker fuel at the source of loading from the refinery onto the barge here the petro inspect surveyor will draw a representative sample from the designated bunker barge tanks and seal it while this may not be an ideal scenario for many due to time constraints and reluctance of suppliers to go the extra mile we provide alternative methods of fuel testing essentially mitigating losses that would have been brought about by consuming contaminated bunkers the turn around time for such results is less than a week two working days for sample delivery and 2 working days for analysis and at almost half the cost which other major labs are charging obviously taking advantage of the prevailing situation post recommendations in dealing with contaminated fuels some suppliers traders have been trying to sell bunkers below the current market price to essentially use up the current contaminated stock as soon as possible and discount is between usd 5 to usd 8 per mt do not let this fool you as should the contaminated bunkers make their way into the engines the damage in terms of monetary value could far outweigh what you would have paid for in bunkers at the discounted price some physical suppliers have been removing clause 5 of some standard bunker sales contract which could limit shipowners fuel buyers ability to claim damages in future since they have commercially agreed to take on potentially contaminated fuels this is because as long as the full iso iso8217 2005 2010 2012 are on specification as tested further forensic analysis like gcms ftir which are not part of iso8217 2005 2010 2012 if found any chemical contaminants that would be harmful to the engine or operation the claim will probably deem invalid clause 5 of iso8217 2017 states the product shall be free from any material at a concentration that causes the fuel to be unacceptable for use together with other considerations understand the industry quality claim time is 15 days or less it should be reviewed to provide a longer quality claim timeline to 30 days which should be we sufficient time to test the bunkers before usage in a typical fuel analysis carry out routine iso 8217 2005 2012 2017 for every bunkering gcms screening ftir and tan total acid number which is crucial in determining the presence of any chemical contaminants in the event that the above tests prove positive for any chemical contaminants we recommend for a more detailed gcms as per astm d7845 for the chemicals quantifications lots of large marine fuel testing agencies each have their own testing methodology which in theory cannot be replicated and agreed upon internationally as the recognized test method but having said that we would still recommend to go by astm d7845 method as reference by this pro active approach our clients are saving thousands of dollars in unnecessary expensive fuel testing cost claims and benefit from our inclusive consultation and advisory reports
days after reclaiming the house majority democrats are introducing gun control legislation timed for the anniversary of the shooting of former democratic rep gabby giffords speaker nancy pelosi and other democrats introduced a bill to expand background checks for sales and transfers of firearms on tuesday the eighth anniversary of the day giffords was shot in the head at a constituent meeting in arizona giffords who co founded a gun safety group with her husband mark kelly said in a statement friday she was thrilled that her former house colleagues were responding to a gun violence epidemic that killed nearly 40 000 people in 2017 the bill expanding background checks marks a critical first step toward strengthening america s gun laws and making our country a safer place to live work study worship and play giffords said i stand ready to do everything in my power to get this legislation across the finish line democrats promised swift action on gun control after the party regained the house majority following eight years of republican rule pelosi called the bill on background checks a common sense measure and cited polls showing 97 percent of americans support background checks for all gun sales our democratic majority will press relentlessly for bipartisan progress to end the epidemic of gun violence on our streets in our schools and in our places of worship pelosi said enough is enough rep mike thompson d calif who leads a gun violence prevention task force in the house said he and other lawmakers from both parties have been pushing years to expand background checks and approve other gun related bills but have been stymied by republican leaders noting that many freshman democrats ran on the issue of preventing gun violence thompson said political momentum to address gun violence is growing the american people have been demanding we take action and this new congress will deliver he said the background checks measure is likely to face opposition from the republican controlled senate and the white house where president donald trump has promised to protect the second amendment jennifer baker a spokeswoman for the national rifle association said a federal background check did not prevent giffords shooting adding that so called universal background checks will never be universal because criminals do not comply with the law lawmakers should deal with the root cause of violent crime instead of trying to score political points and push ineffective legislation that doesn t stop criminals from committing crimes baker said the trump administration moved last month to ban bump stocks the firearm attachments that allow semi automatic weapons to fire like machine guns bump stocks became a focal point of the gun control debate after they were used in october 2017 by a gunman in las vegas who fired into a crowd at a country music concert killing 58 people and injuring hundreds more a new regulation gives gun owners until late march to turn in or destroy the devices

strength and diversity of end markets future revenue visibility resulting from 30 month average lease durations embedded growth driven by ready to work solutions and accelerating synergy realization forecasted total revenue between 1 05 and 1 15 billion representing a 45 7 increase over the midpoint of the company s 2018 total revenue guidance reflects organic growth and does not reflect any future acquisition activity forecasted adjusted ebitda between 345 and 365 million represents a 65 1 increase over the midpoint of the company s 2018 adjusted ebitda guidance as well as adjusted ebitda margin3 expansion of over 350 basis points to 32 3 at the midpoint of the 2019 guidance range tim boswell chief financial officer commented we have a simple formula to deliver another year of outstanding growth in 2019 through the continued steady execution by our team our business has significant revenue visibility due to our 30 month average lease durations and approximately 125 million of embedded revenue growth potential from pricing and penetration of ready to work solutions over the next several years we also have concrete plans to eliminate redundant costs which we expect to contribute to earnings growth and over 350 basis points of adjusted ebitda margin expansion in 2019 and margins approximating 35 heading into 2020 these earnings growth levers are largely internal and within our control capital expenditures and liquidity boswell commented our capital expenditures are highly discretionary in the short run and we reevaluate these investments quarterly based on market conditions based on the continued strength in our end markets we expect net capital expenditures of 130 to 160 million with the investments heavily weighted to refurbishment of existing fleet assets and the expansion of our ready to work value proposition the company anticipates net debt to adjusted ebitda of approximately 4x by the end of the second quarter of 2020 boswell continued our balance sheet is solid and supports our growth initiatives approximately 70 of our debt bears interest at a fixed rate we have no debt maturities before 2022 we have ample liquidity under our abl revolver and we can evaluate opportunities to reduce our weighted average cost of debt as the business de levers naturally as integration costs subside and we realize cost synergies and organic revenue growth we expect net income and free cash flow to accelerate in the second half of 2019 resulting in steady deleveraging towards our 4x target by the second quarter of 2020 we remain committed to our goal of creating long term value for all shareholders and are excited about the outlook for 2019 modspace integration update soultz noted we achieved a critical milestone with the modspace integration on january 7 2019 when modspace s billing system was migrated onto the willscot operating platform ahead of schedule this represents an extraordinary accomplishment by our combined team that gives us complete control and visibility across the combined portfolio and enables the next phase of value realization across our network this value will build throughout 2019 as we continue the consolidation of our branch network and shared services soultz continued as we exit 2019 we expect our annual adjusted ebitda run rate of approximately 400 million to include over 80 of the approximately 70 million of identified acquisition related cost synergies with the remainder to be executed in 2020 moreover we expect over 90 of total integration costs to be expensed by the end of second quarter 2019 with more than 90 of related cash payments being disbursed by the end of 2019 after production consolidation in november 2018 the completion of our it system cutover this month and our exit of approximately 75 of redundant leased properties expected by december 2019 we anticipate entering 2020 with the integration largely behind us and remain focused on executing our growth initiatives 2018 outlook management reaffirmed its 2018 guidance as updated on october 1 2018 total revenue between 740 and 770 million adjusted ebitda 4 between 210 and 220 million net rental capital expenditures5

by reuters by dominique patton and david lawder beijing washington reuters the united states and china will continue trade talks in beijing for an unscheduled third day u s officials said on tuesday amid signs of progress on issues including purchases of u s farm and energy commodities and increased access to china s markets people familiar with the talks said the world s two largest economies were further apart on chinese structural reforms that the trump administration is demanding in order to stop alleged theft and forced transfer of u s technology and on how to hold beijing to its promises talks with china are going very well u s president donald trump tweeted without elaborating as talks wound down late on tuesday evening in beijing steven winberg assistant secretary for fossil energy at the u s department of energy told reporters in beijing that the talks which began on monday had gone well i confirm we re continuing tomorrow yes winberg said declining to answer further questions this week s meetings are the first face to face talks since u s president donald trump and chinese president xi jinping agreed in december to a 90 day truce in a trade war that has roiled global financial markets trump is increasingly eager to reach an agreement to help lift the markets bloomberg reported citing people familiar with internal white house deliberations the s p 500 index has fallen about 8 percent since the truce began a spokeswoman for the u s trade representative s office which is leading the u s negotiating team said talks would continue on wednesday and a statement will likely follow then tariff profit pain if no deal is reached by march 2 trump has said he will proceed with raising tariffs to 25 percent from 10 percent on 200 billion 157 billion pounds worth of chinese imports at a time when china s economy is slowing significantly in the meantime companies in both countries are feeling pain from the effects of u s tariffs and retaliation from china which are starting to mount el paso texas based helen of troy ltd a maker of consumer products from oxo kitchen utensils to braun shavers cut its sales and gross margin outlooks on tuesday laid some of the blame on u s tariffs on chinese goods which make up 70 percent of the company s cost of products sold helen of troy stock fell nearly 13 percent the largest one day drop in more than six years tariff increases began to impact our cost of goods sold during the third quarter helen of troy chief financial officer brian grass told investors on a conference call that featured 27 mentions of the words tariff or tariffs while the company is trying to offset tariffs through price increases that doesn t mean we ll be 100 percent successful a week ago apple inc rattled global markets by cutting its own sales outlook blaming weak demand in china advertisement seeds of progress in what is widely seen as a goodwill gesture china on tuesday issued long awaited approvals for the import of five genetically modified crops which could boost its purchases of u s grains as farmers decide which crops to plant in the spring on monday chinese importers made another large purchase of u s soybeans their third in the past month increased purchases by china of u s soybeans oil liquefied natural gas and financial services are viewed as easier to achieve than major changes to china s industrial policies aimed at transferring u s technology to chinese firms overall the talks have been constructive our sense is that there s good progress on the purchase piece said one person familiar with the talks the person added that it was more difficult to determine how to hold china to its commitments to better protect intellectual property advertisement scott kennedy director of the project on chinese business and political economy at the center for strategic and international studies in washington said the two sides for the first time were discussing topics that matter most to the trump administration these include expanded chinese purchases of american products greater protections for u s intellectual property constraints on chinese industrial policy and enforcement and verification of follow through by china the minimum baseline for judging whether this week is a success is whether they can have an in depth conversation on those areas kennedy said adding that an announcement of another round of talks would be a positive outcome reporting by michael martina and dominique patton in beijing and david lawder and susan heavey in washington editing by peter graff richard chang and grant mccool
carbon dioxide emissions in the u s are on the rise again after several years of decline and a booming economy is the cause that s according toa report out today from the rhodium group an independent research firm that tracks co2 emissions in the u s it appears based on preliminary data that emissions in the u s grew by the highest rate since 2010 when we were recovering from the great recession says trevor houser a partner at rhodium and an author on the new estimate emissions rose roughly 3 4 percent in 2018 he says rhodium group rhodium group emissions were up for the first time since 2015 the big drivers were increased electricity demand and growth in trucking and aviation the report underscores an unusual upside to an economic downturn when the economy shrinks greenhouse gas emissions also go down that s what happened in the throes of the financial crisis in 2008 carbon dioxide emissions plummeted they ve been bouncing up and down since then but last year the strong economic growth meant a rise a cold winter was also a factor particularly because it led to higher consumption of natural gas and fuel oil in homes for heat there were some areas where decisions by government and industry helped to reduce some types of emissions a record number of coal fired power plants closed last year and emissions from passenger automobiles dropped slightly due to better fuel economy standards but it wasn t enough and houser wants more aggressive policies to drive drown co2 that seems unlikely for now policies to limit greenhouse gas emissions started under the obama administration are now being halted and even reversed under president trump what we ve seen is backsliding in federal policy and we re starting to feel the effects of that now houser says the report means the u s is less likely to meet its reduction targets under the global paris climate agreement according to andrew light a senior fellow at the world resources institute when the u s signed on to the agreement in 2015 then president obama promised a 26 28 percent reduction from 2005 levels by 2025 there s still time to catch up light says if we do get back on track in the united states toward having an energy policy that s consistent with the threat of climate change then we can turn these things around he says stock markets have faltered in recent months indicating the u s might be headed toward another recession that could cause emissions to drop but houser says it would not be productive a short term emissions decline as a result of a recession is not something anyone s cheering for he says we do the best on this issue when the economy is thriving and there are policies in place that can channel investment into clean energy technologies copyright 2021 npr to see more visit
jpmorgan chase ceo jamie dimon on the credit market the state of the consumer no high yield debt issuance the outlook for federal reserve policy and the u s markets and economy h t dataroma jpmorgan s jamie dimon don t know about a rip roaring rally but will have decent growth in 2019 in america q3 hedge fund letters conference scoops etc transcript there is no high yield debt issuance in the month of december and it s the first time that s happened in a decade so is that an ominous sign i remember during the financial crisis which you lived through and you led with such great leadership it was the debt markets that got us into trouble but as the deleveraging in the liquidation of debt markets not the not the lack of issuance so my view is that in december things slow down people got scared the issue didn t one issue get spreads gapped out that ll probably change how long can the credit markets stay this tight before you actually do see it as a worry sign for a while i m really not worried about i think i think you just having if you look at the other way around so credit spreads were normally low for a long time this is more maybe a little bit of a normalization and you know you and i both know that the tip of the iceberg the tip of the spear is ipos and high yield so when people when sentiment changes dramatically those are the two areas where people cut back and then they kind of open up over time the fundamentals seem to be ok putting the market volatility aside but you ve got a great vantage point in seeing how consumers are doing from your credit card business what do you saying so credit card is very good i mean again if you look at actual data people getting jobs more people working wages going up wages are going up household balance sheet in very good shape credit card credit extraordinary good things better than we deserved at this point in the cycle and if you look at actual spend now look at retail spend about home improvement spend a whole bunch and it s pretty good and so you know me my view is that the consumer is in good shape and is continuing to grow and they have back when with jobs and wages going up speaking of non aligned the federal reserve is trying to normalize interest rates now raising rates from these rock bottom levels that we were at is the fed doing the right thing in your view how many fed hikes do you think we should see in the year ahead and how many might we say i remind people years ago you know the fed didn t forecast and all that type of thing paul volcker raised rates effectively 200 basis points on a sunday night no one completely knows the future so the fed obviously has be data dependent and i think that depends both interest rates and maybe how the markets bounce you a little bit they are very bright people i have enormous respect for chairman powell and they ll look at the situation and adjusted accordingly but my own view is if we had good growth raising rates normalize normalize would be 3 percent the short end and maybe 4 percent a tenure is a good thing so you don t think markets though are indicating a recession is on the horizon over the near term then no markets are overreacting to short term sentiment around a whole bunch of complex issues what about the shrinkage in money supply actually this is that some of it is a rational response so when have stock prices are 18 and now there s 16 because you think will be slower growth higher chance of recession highchairs trade that is a rational adjustment you shouldn t say that that s irrational you know i would say that s probably pretty rational you pay less under that environment because you think the future is going to be very different was before actually you know better than i do but when i think about things the federal reserve makes a pivot they say there is no rush earnings have been pretty strong we just had great jobs numbers on friday and 12000 jobs created valuations are better after the last three months it seems like we could be poised for a rip roaring rally there that s why i think people react i don t give a rip roaring rally but i think you re going to have decent growth in 2019 in america and therefore sending me reverse course a little bit down the road i hate guessing about the future i run my business like serving you as a client and then we d navigate the ups and downs of markets but just to be clear when you look at what happened in the inversion or when you look at the no high yield debt issuance that s real time and that s telling us something right now it s not speculating i think that s true but again i look at the inversion a little bit because of qe i wouldn t give it it is quite high importance as they were before we don t know the exact effect of qe and i still suspect that somehow that 10 year bond today should be 4 percent and i ve been wrong about that but you know when you ve had 2 percent inflation a normal 10 year bond rate is 4 percent and we don t have that and that may be because of not just us qe by the way so if you re the federal reserve you ve had qe around the world for a long time the ecb was buying 100 percent of sovereign debt issuance in in europe and for a couple of years that was true here we ve never seen something like that before maybe during world war ii we had some of that but you know it s we don t know exactly what the reverse will be but i have little faith in that our folks foetal navigator

the following is the unofficial transcript of a cnbc exclusive interview with apple inc nasdaq aapl ceo tim cook and cnbc s jim cramer which aired on cnbc s mad money w jim cramer today tuesday january 9th when today tuesday january 8 2019 where cnbc s mad money w jim cramer get the full warren buffett series in pdf get the entire 10 part series on warren buffett in pdf save it to your desktop read it on your tablet or email to your colleagues jim cramer tim you know i always say own it don t trade it but right now people are saying jim give me the investment case for buying this stock tim cook well you know i never try to sell a stock i try to sell a product jim cramer never have tim cook however let me tell you the way i look at it we manage the company for the long term the most important things in apple one a culture of innovation this team is unbelievable in creating hardware and software and services and getting them all to work together it just works second we have a very large active install bays we hit 1 3 billion a year ago and we ve added about a 100 million in the last 12 months third highest customer satisfaction and loyalty in the industry so you put those two things together you got a lot of a big active install bays and you got a lotta heavy customers then you have a recurring revenue stream on your product business and then because of our ecosystem that we build which has unbelievable developers in it and an app store to get services out there we built a services business that was you know a little over 7 billion in 2010 last year for the calendar year over 41 billion and so and we ve said that you know we re gonna double the 2016 numbers by 2020 and so we re on a fast clip there and then of course we are shareholder friendly on our capital allocation so you put all these things together and those are the most important things for us innovation customer satisfaction and the overall size and loyal of our customer jim cramer okay so most tech companies i think don t innovate nearly as much as you but let me just put posit what we got you take so many risks that i don t think you get credit for for instance we had what turned to be real ridiculous strings around our neck and then we got the airpods we loved our dumb watch that told time and now we have a smart watch that saves our lives we loved the big fat jack and then we got the lightning jack we loved our sony 2 000 mirrorless camera until we got the iphone x which takes better pictures why do you therefore have a 12 multiple because to me that is wrong tim cook yeah i think it s wrong too but i tell ya what i focus on is the customers and so the customers speak every quarter they speak every year they speak every day and the most important thing for us is that they re satisfied and so when i read the emails and so forth from customers they re tellin me how the apple watch has changed their life they re tellin me how it motivated them to be more fit be more active they re tellin me that they discovered they had afib they re tellin me they found a problem with their heart that they didn t know existed and if they wouldn t ve reached out to a doctor they might ve died and so these are life changing things we ve got machine learning embedded in our silicon in our phone you know this allows us not only the power efficiency to have an incredible performance in a very small package but it allows us to manipulate this data on the phone have the transactions on the phone as opposed to letting them out in the world and you know this the whole privacy issue forum we ve always been on the right side of privacy but the market is now moving and so this is an incredible strength that we ve built the photos that you re able to take with your phone as you said i mean these are life changing things if you like to chronical your life this morning i was i picked up my phone and i saw a memory from a year ago jim cramer i love the memorything tim cook i love it you know you see my nephew or somebody that s very important to you and their face just appears and you have a slideshow built for you these things are they re unbelievable and our customers love them and that s the most important thing jim cramer but okay so let s unpack that my daughter has the 5 why cause she loves it she said listen dad if you put it in the washing machine like your wife did i ll get a new one but you can t pry it outta my cold dead hands cause i love it she is not an upgrader because she you made the greatest product what do we do about that what do you do tim cook well the most important thing for me is that she s happy that is the most important thing now if she s not upgrading for another reason maybe it s too much of a hassle for her to upgrade maybe she s worried about the transfer of data all of this stuff we wanna help on an you know we ve got the store that you re in that s very focused on having the best customer experience there helping people set up their new phone making sure all their data s transferred and also allowing them to trade in their current phone which begins to look like a subsidy that the carrier may have previously provided and it s offsets some of the cost of the new phone jim cramer okay so these issues are all occurring at the same time that we do have china you were very abject about china and the 100 of what we didn t think of the upside that went away there are issues involving perhaps not boycotts we know that s off the table but patriotism in a strange way meaning that you know what if i can get a huawei with a s with a subsidy why should i buy an apple it s conspicuously american how long can that last tim cook well i think what here s what we saw in china in specifically the chinese economy it seemed to us began to slow maybe in the second half of the year and it was on some sort of rational trajectory we believe based on what we saw and the timing of it that the tension the trade war tension with the u s created this more sharp downturn i believe that s temporary because i think that when you really look at it it s in both countries best interests to come to an agreement it is a complex very complex trade agreement and it needs to be updated but i m as i ve said before i m very optimistic that this will happen and so that clearly will be good not only for us frankly but i think more about the world in general the world needs a strong u s and china economy for the world economy to be strong jim cramer my understanding is even the hardliners in the white house have moved on this issue and i know president trump calls you a friend i know you go back and forth because you represent the greatest that we have in america and my understanding is that there are people who feel exactly like you which means a deal s possible tim cook i think a deal is very possible and i m i ve heard some very encouraging words jim cramer even of recent right tim cook yes yes in very recently and so i don t speak for them obviously i do talk with them and i give them my ideas and thoughts jim cramer okay now we gotta talk about some of these people who the naysayers and we ve dealt with them before when the stock was substantially lower a wedbush analyst said apple s clearly the darkest days representing a challenge in growth journal it s too soon to call the xr a flop only after a few months but early indications are of course it s a flop what do you say to people who say the xr flopped what do you say to say darkest days tim cook bologna i call bologna on that let me tell you how i view this here s the truth what the facts are since we began shipping the iphone xr it has been the most popular iphone every day every single day from when we started shipping until now jim cramer but how about relatively i mean there s been other ones that have tim cook i mean do i want to sell more of course i do of course i d love to sell more and you know we re working on that and but in terms of the product itself it s an incredibly innovative product it has a bunch of advanced technologies in it for the chip with the neural engine to security embedded to an edge to edge liquid retina display the first in the industry longest battery life ever in an iphone i mean it is unbelievable and the photos that you can take of your life and of your loved ones i mean it beats many many of the standalone cameras that you could buy now that nobody uses anymore and so these things are you know give a lot of value to the customer so that s that in terms of the naysayer i ve heard this over and over again jim i ve heard it in 2001 i ve heard it in 2005 and 07 and 08 and 10 and 12 and 13 you can probably find the same quotes from the same people over and over again and i m not defensive on it this is america and you can say what you want but i m giving you my honest opinion is that there is a culture of innovation in apple and that culture of innovation combined with these incredible loyal customers happy customers this ecosystem this virtuous ecosystem is something that is probably underappreciated jim cramer well then you were surprised with the market reaction to both when you decided to not reveal units and when you revealed the shortfall tim cook i m never surprised by the market to be honest with you because i think the market is quite emotional in the short term and we sorta look through all of that we think about the long term and so when i look at the long term health of the company it has never been better the product pipeline has never been better the ecosystem has never been stronger the services are on a tear if you look at let s just take wearables as an example right wearables it s mainly the apple watch and airpods if you look at this and you and on a trailing basis i m not projecting on a trailing basis we ve already exceeded the revenue for wearables is already more than 50 more than ipod was at its peak now this is a product that everyone would i ipod would say i think everybody would say it was an incredibly important product for apple full of innovation and probably the trigger for the company getting on a very different trajectory and into other markets and so already exceeded it by 50 at its peak at its peak also if you take airpods and the watch separately and you sort of back these up and align it to the launch date of ipod as well and you know where all of em have a comparable amount of time you would find that that each one independently is like four to six times ahead of where ipod was at a comparable period of time and so this airpods are becoming ubiquitous out there people love them i get notes every day they re chock full of technology but they just work it s the elegance of them but with significant technology and built right in and an unbelievable user interface jim cramer alright keep that thought we talk about innovation we ll be right back more with tim cook in a second jim cramer all right i ve been following stocks for 40 years tim and you guys are a fount of innovation my wife said tell him what do they want time travel what do you have to do tim cook hey time travel sounds kind of cool jim cramer right i mean that s what because the reason i mention it is because there are companies that sell at 22 to 23 times earnings they are the consumer packaged goods companies they are companies that tend to go from 1 to 4 if they get 5 then they get a 28 multiple and yet the analysts who follow your company continue to look for units of phones they are not thinking about the revenue and yet if it were procter gamble and they got that many razors with razor blade they d pay 28 times earnings are you followed by the wrong people tim cook i think that our story isn t well understood i think apple is not well understood in some of wall street if you for example i think there are several people that believe the most important metric is how many iphones are sold in a given 90 day period or what the revenue is this goes this is far far far down my list because the point is if somebody decides to buy an iphone a little later if because of the battery huge discount that we gave they decide to hold on a little longer i m great with that i want the customer to be happy we work for them and so but the important thing is that they re happy because if they re happy they will eventually replace that product with another and the services and the ecosystem around that will thrive jim cramer but as long as it s north of 60 i mean as long as cell phones are north i don t know how you get people to think even if it s 20 billion in service revenue it s the 62 it is overwhelming and they don t know what to do and i understand their conundrum tim they don t know what to do because the cell phone s such a big part of the pot tim cook yeah but if you sort of back up and look at apple in our last fiscal year we had 100 billion of revenue that was not iphone 100 billion and in this last quarter if you take everything outside of iphone it grew at 19 19 on a huge business jim cramer again it s a consumer packaged goods company but not a tech look you have the best tech consumer packaged goods why not accept it and say you know what we re just we want to be covered by other people tim cook i don t think we get to pick who we re covered by jim cramer well i don t know you re a big company maybe you could now i ve got some ideas for you okay i talked to some people at walmart yesterday an arrangement with walmart flipkart to take over india with a budget phone rather than doing it piecemeal tim cook for us we re about making the best product that enriches people s lives and so we re not about making the cheapest right we want to make a great value but that s not necessarily the cheapest and so for us what we ve seen is there s enough people in every country in the world that we play in that we can have a really good business by selling the best phone now the best phone we knew that as we went to the x and then the follow on of the xs and the xs max that everybody would not want to spend 1 000 for the phone so we made the iphone xr and we put as many of the advanced technologies as we could in that phone jim cramer well let flipkart do the subsidy tim cook and we priced it right between the 8 and the 8 plus of the year before and so on but in india in general we are all in it is a major focus if you look at how we ve done over the years we ve gone from you know 100 200 million business to last year we hit we exceeded 2 billion that 2 billion was flat year over year after rapid rapid growth and so we have more work to do we d like to put stores there we would like some of the duties and so forth that are put on the products to go away and we re working closely with the team there and i believe that we ll have better results at some point in the future i m not in the forecasting mode here today but it s an important market for us jim cramer you have people who are naysayers one of the naysayers is not an analyst it s qualcomm qualcomm keeps telling me over and over again you re going to come to the table you have to lost the suit in germany lost the suit in china wait until you see them cave are you going to cave tim cook no look the truth is we haven t been in any settlement discussions with them since the third calendar quarter of last year that is the truth so i m not sure where that thinking is coming from the issue that we have with qualcomm is that they have a policy of no license no chips this is in our view illegal and so many regulators in many different countries agree with this and then secondly they have an obligation to offer their patent portfolio on a fair reasonable and nondiscriminatory basis and they don t do that they charge exorbitant prices and they have a lot of different tactics they use to do that and that s not just us saying that i mean you can see what s coming out of the ftc trial here in the united states and obviously i have an issue with some of their other tactics that i m sure you ve read about jim cramer right that they say you are in settlement talks all the time tim cook well not just that but the paying somebody to write fake news and then promoting it this is stuff that should be beneath companies this is not how things should operate jim cramer all right so let s talk about competition the other company that i think of with innovation i always have to talk about is amazon and they do great voice you have voice it s a bit of a contest tim if you threw you have unlimited capital and you throw it at voice would it make siri even better tim cook well we re putting a ton of investment in siri and so if you look at siri today jim we have about a bit over 500 million devices that are using siri out there siri enabled and siri is used over 10 billion times a month and it s in 21 different languages and 30 something countries and so we ve tried to do we tried to create a global product we re not in every country yet we want to be and if you want something that is something that has been created on your device siri is the best place to do that and i think i get more and more great things every day the quality is going up you know voice is a never ending journey we all speak a little bit differently i have a southern dialect not as southern as i used to but there s a lot of stuff to do there but i m highly confident in our ability to keep innovating like crazy there jim cramer okay last question because they re giving me some wrap healthcare if you hooked up with different could you make it so that i can sync i need to sync i need to handshake with my doctor okay and payments it can be huge if you look at a paypal they ve got a 30 multiple mastercard 30 multiple can you layer either one of those on to be able to jump even though it s huge the service stream take it so that it s 40 of your company by doing more in payments more in health tim cook on services you will see us announce new services this year there will more things coming i don t want to tell you about what they are jim cramer material material tim cook i believe they will be material over time i m not going to forecast jim cramer right fair enough tim cook you know precisely the ramps and so forth but they re things that we feel really great about that we ve been working on for multiple years on the healthcare in particular and sort of your wellbeing this is an area that i believe if you zoom out into the future and you look back and you ask the question what was apple s greatest contribution to mankind it will be about health because our business has always been about enriching people s lives and as we ve gotten into healthcare more and more through the watch and through other things that we ve created with researchkit and carekit and putting your medical records on the iphone this is a huge deal and it s something that is very important for people we are democratizing it we are taking what has been with the institutions and empowering the individual to manage their health and we re just at the front end of this but i do think looking back in the future you will answer that question apple s most important contribution to mankind has been in health jim cramer tim cook ceo apple tim cook great to see you jim cramer thank you so much sir tim cook thank you for having me jim cramer great to see you well now you know the story behind just the units of the cell phone tim cook ceo apple

after strong performance last year shareholders hope the athletic footwear specialist will be more generous check out the latest nike earnings call transcript 2018 was a good year for nike nke 0 31 as its stock posted a total return of nearly 20 even though the athletic footwear and apparel company has seen a lot of competition lately nike was able to fight back and keep its primary overseas rival at bay that helped restore nike s supremacy atop the industry as much as investors love good returns they also like to see healthy dividend yields and that s one area in which nike consistently loses the race yet the company did manage to deliver a dividend increase in 2018 and that has shareholders hopeful that nike will keep being more generous with its cash both this year and beyond below we ll look more closely to see if nike s likely to keep boosting its dividend in 2019 dividend stats on nike metric nike current quarterly dividend per share 0 22 current yield 1 2 number of consecutive years with dividend increases 17 years payout ratio 67 last increase december 2018 a solid track record of higher payouts it might not look like it when you focus on nike s dividend yield but the athletic company has put together an impressive track record of dividend performance the stock has paid higher dividends each year for the past 17 years and nike doesn t give token hikes with double digit percentage increases being the most common last year s 10 boost continued a string of 0 02 per share raises in nike s quarterly dividend payment dating back to 2014 and similar percentage increases prevailed before then the reason nike s yield looks so puny is that its stock s performance has been even better over the past decade nike s dividend has risen by more than 250 but its stock has produced a 650 increase in its share price and that s had the impact of dramatically reducing nike s yield that s not bad news for long term investors it just makes the current payout look less enticing for those who are new to nike how nike s business is doing over the past year nike has made a lot of progress restoring its reputation as a champion in the athletic apparel arena after losing some of its momentum in overseas markets in past years nike refocused its efforts on key international markets like china and europe and the return of strong growth in those regions has helped lift nike s overall numbers higher it also managed to get sales in the key north american market moving upward more sharply and near term projections have nike carrying that positive momentum into the new year moreover nike has been able to tap into a key trend that could produce even more benefits down the road rather than relying solely on intermediary retailers to sell its products nike has made big investments in building out its direct to consumer channel both through physical retail locations and with its e commerce assets the higher margin levels the direct business produces have been a boon to nike s overall profitability and shareholders expect those favorable trends to continue can nike keep raising its dividend in 2019 nike s capital allocation strategy puts a lot of emphasis on share repurchases with a recent 15 billion authorization for buybacks over the next four years demonstrating the company s commitment to returning capital to shareholders in that way yet with plenty of earnings room to boost dividends as well i m optimistic that nike will accelerate its payout increase in 2019 to a 0 03 per share boost making the quarterly payout a round 0 25 per share that won t give nike a big yield but it ll show that the athletic giant still takes dividends seriously

days after reclaiming the house majority democrats are introducing gun control legislation timed for the anniversary of the shooting of former democratic rep gabby giffords speaker nancy pelosi and other democrats introduced a bill to expand background checks for sales and transfers of firearms on tuesday the eighth anniversary of the day giffords was shot in the head at a constituent meeting in arizona giffords who co founded a gun safety group with her husband mark kelly said in a statement friday she was thrilled that her former house colleagues were responding to a gun violence epidemic that killed nearly 40 000 people in 2017 the bill expanding background checks marks a critical first step toward strengthening america s gun laws and making our country a safer place to live work study worship and play giffords said i stand ready to do everything in my power to get this legislation across the finish line democrats promised swift action on gun control after the party regained the house majority following eight years of republican rule pelosi called the bill on background checks a common sense measure and cited polls showing 97 percent of americans support background checks for all gun sales our democratic majority will press relentlessly for bipartisan progress to end the epidemic of gun violence on our streets in our schools and in our places of worship pelosi said enough is enough rep mike thompson d calif who leads a gun violence prevention task force in the house said he and other lawmakers from both parties have been pushing years to expand background checks and approve other gun related bills but have been stymied by republican leaders noting that many freshman democrats ran on the issue of preventing gun violence thompson said political momentum to address gun violence is growing the american people have been demanding we take action and this new congress will deliver he said the background checks measure is likely to face opposition from the republican controlled senate and the white house where president donald trump has promised to protect the second amendment jennifer baker a spokeswoman for the national rifle association said a federal background check did not prevent giffords shooting adding that so called universal background checks will never be universal because criminals do not comply with the law lawmakers should deal with the root cause of violent crime instead of trying to score political points and push ineffective legislation that doesn t stop criminals from committing crimes baker said the trump administration moved last month to ban bump stocks the firearm attachments that allow semi automatic weapons to fire like machine guns bump stocks became a focal point of the gun control debate after they were used in october 2017 by a gunman in las vegas who fired into a crowd at a country music concert killing 58 people and injuring hundreds more a new regulation gives gun owners until late march to turn in or destroy the devices

quarter of carbohydrates a quarter of protein plenty of fruits or vegetables and a small amount of fat shutterstock the nudge theory the art of small subtle changes now has a scientific status and you can use it to improve your eating habits over 12 weeks 14 workplace cafeterias in the netherlands underwent a nudge makeover that involved 14 small changes to the food service environment such as always having fruit and vegetables available better choices in every food category cash register food displays repeatedly advertising healthier options and offering water for free the results published in the american journal of clinical nutrition confirm that sales of healthier sandwiches healthier cheese as sandwich fillings and fruit all increased and then stayed constant during the study small positive changes appear to stick without making a change to a person s autonomy in making food choices so how do you give your whole eating routine a nudge makeover advertisement when corrie van put on 30 kilograms during her second pregnancy she made small changes to her eating habits one meal at a time breakfast was the first i chose three breakfast meals that i liked were easy to prepare and achievable and for a month just implemented these without worrying about any of the other meals once a healthy breakfast became a habit i moved on to snacks she says i began buying a smaller chocolate instead of the family block for the first week on week two i chose a sweet fruit like orange or grapes and had them twice a week instead of chocolate on week three fruit was my go to sweet for four days and by the end of the month i was no longer craving chocolate as much as sweet fruits so i cut it out altogether lunch was easier to implement as a healthy habit over a six week period with a protein balanced salad sandwich or wrap but dinner was the most challenging meal to change the last thing i wanted to do after working a full day was to come home and cook dinner so it had to be simple i scanned through a list of simple meals that my husband or i would be happy to make and we came up with basic meat and vegetable recipes think tacos wraps and stir fries and we would make enough to last two nights advertisement it took well over six months of trying failing and trying again but in the end i succeeded to get rid of the weight and keep it off accredited practising dietitian georgia bevan agrees that focusing on one behavioural based goal at a time is a great way to nudge you into lasting habits when people want to change their health they often overhaul their life through four to six week programs or 30 day detoxes which is a recipe for disaster bevan says fast fix programs usually require a change of habits all at once in other words an all or nothing approach which can work for a couple of weeks but in most cases the motivation wanes when the program finishes and you end up at square one on the flip side by focusing on small goals you receive motivation by ticking off that goal at a more sustainable pace consider a minimum of three weeks for each meal and then you can work towards developing your next eating habit throughout every meal the approach to achieve healthier eating habits revolves around considering filling half your plate or bowl with vegetables and loading up the other half with a quarter of carbohydrates and a quarter of protein and roughly a thumb sized portion of fat advertisement this model aims to help guide your meal portions so you re on your way to meeting the nutrient and fibre recommendation plus keep you satiated for longer bevan says breakfast and snacks when following the plate model for breakfast swap vegetables for fruit bevan suggests a porridge with fruit yoghurt and nuts the fruit nuts and oats are high in fibre while the yoghurt will provide protein to keep you fuller for longer another example would be wholegrain toast with avocado tomato and boiled eggs again you re hitting the quarter of carbohydrate with high fibre grains the quarter of protein with the boiled eggs the avocado includes the bonus of healthy fats and additional fibre making it a satisfying and filling early morning meal adds bevan a balance of healthy nutrients first thing in the morning means longer lasting energy lessening cravings and the need to snack throughout the day she says advertisement but if you re in need of some energy bevan suggests snacking on fruit vegie slices with cottage cheese a boiled egg a homemade protein ball tinned tuna on wholegrain crackers or fruit toast topped with cottage cheese or nut butter on fruit if you feel you lack control around sweet foods or you snack unmindfully swapping larger portions for smaller pieces can safeguard from overconsumption bevan says lunch and dinner lunch can be as easy as lentils with tuna a sandwich or salad with avocado drizzled with a nut dressing or leftovers from the night before such as a stir fry or a rice dish to make home made cooking at night easier fit in the family favourites bevan suggests adding two to three vegetables to a spaghetti bolognese sauce or a vegetable stir fry with brown rice and chicken for protein for those days when you re feeling unmotivated have a repertoire of tasty recipes you can fall back on that you know you and your family will eat in addition have a variety of spices in your pantry to give your meals flavour stock whole grains such as pasta and brown rice barley and buckwheat to bulk up your meals legumes like lentils and stock the freezer with vegies and cuts of meat and fish that way you can quickly whip up a meat and three veg or a brown rice with some frozen vegies bevan says the best recipes from australia s leading chefs straight to your inbox sign up

the members page of the hollywood foreign press association website lists no members instead it contains a single paragraph which states what the organization is in general terms a group of international journalists based in southern california that attend countless movie and television screenings and put on the annual golden globe awards the membership page goes into zero detail about the makeup of the hollywood foreign press association like where the members are from or who they write for it doesn t even say the exact number of members the group has about 90 is as specific as it gets this is something that should be kept in mind when watching and discussing the golden globes this is not the work of a large group of movie industry professionals nor is it even a tight knit group of local critics whose membership is transparent and readily available the globes are the product of about 90 anonymous people whose whims and reasoning is completely unknown when they do something like name green book and bohemian rhapsody as the two best movies of the year and that is totally fine i mean i completely disagree with both of those choices and don t think they could have picked worse in either category given the nominees they had to choose from but it s their group they have the right to celebrate whatever movies they want from whatever filmmakers they want i just don t think the rest of us should really care about them or put a bit of stock into the results but people do for years the globes have been treated like the junior varsity oscars the all important preliminary step on the road to the academy awards and sure they re usually an entertaining couple of hours of television thanks to snarky hosts although this year s andy samberg and sandra oh were almost disturbingly nice a glitzy guest list and a heavy supply of alcohol to help lubricate the unpredictable wheels of live television i m all for it on those terms give me a good boozy hatewatch where celebrities miss their acceptance speeches because they were in the bathroom any day of the week the weird part is that the globes are beloved for all the slip ups and weirdness and also as this important prognosticator of the oscars even though the two shows have zero overlap in terms of voters and little overlap in terms of taste the globes are treated as this crucial bellwether despite numerous alleged stories of hfpa members being wined and dined by studios and then mysteriously inexplicably and totally unrelatedly giving those same studios movies tons of awards like the time producers of the musical burlesque flew golden globes judges to las vegas for an all expenses paid trip which included luxury hotel accommodation free meals and a private concert performed by the film s star cher burlesque wound up with 3 golden globe nominations including best picture and won the best original song prize the film s rotten tomatoes score 36 again this doesn t necessarily bother me what bothers me is that we know all this and still take the globes relatively seriously some oscar voters today are looking at the results and reconsidering their own attitudes towards green book and bohemian rhapsody and maybe towards other movies that didn t fare so well at this year s globes like a star is born it bums me out to think that deserving films might have their chances at oscars hurt because of this that doesn t seem right the globes are a hell of a party and a lousy awards show so why do we pretend it s not gallery crazy golden globe nominees through the ages

an influential analyst s increased optimism boosted the canadian marijuana stock what happened shares of tilray tlry surged 13 5 as of 3 27 p m est on tuesday the marijuana stock s big move came after cowen analyst vivien azer wrote in a note to clients that she expected tilray and canopy growth cgc 4 01 to outperform in 2019 azer anticipates that a couple of factors will boost growth in the north american cannabis industry she expects stronger growth in the canadian market as growers ramp up their production capacity and the recreational marijuana market in the country expands to include cannabis edibles and concentrates azer also upped her outlook for u s marijuana sales by 2030 from 75 billion to 80 billion so what a more positive outlook from a leading analyst in the cannabis industry is certainly good news for tilray but was there anything really new in cowen s update not really everyone already knew that the canadian recreational market would pick up momentum in 2019 the worst bottleneck of the market launch in 2018 was limited supply tilray and its peers should increase capacity significantly this year and that translates to higher sales it s also no surprise that the top marijuana producers should benefit when canada finalizes regulations on cannabis edibles and concentrates as expected later in 2019 what s interesting though is to compare the stock movements of tilray and canopy growth after azer s note to clients became public canopy s share price moved higher but only by a little the reason that its stock didn t jump as much as tilray s helps us understand why the market reaction for tilray isn t anything to get overly excited about canopy growth arguably has more to gain from the factors underlying azer s increased optimism than tilray does it has a larger production capacity and a greater market share in canada so why didn t canopy rack up gains as tilray did probably because of the differences between the two stocks floats tilray s stock float is very low roughly 10 million shares canopy s float is nearly five times higher a low stock float results in greater volatility both positive and negative now what investors shouldn t make too much out of tilray s nice move today there s a more important story just around the corner for the company on jan 15 tilray s initial public offering ipo lockup period expires insiders will then be allowed to sell their shares if the selling volume is heavy it will likely create significant downward pressure on tilray s stock price however the factors behind vivien azer s increased bullishness give shareholders reason to share her optimism about tilray over the long run as the global marijuana market grows tilray will probably claim its fair share of the market in the meantime though expect continued volatility for this high flying marijuana stock check out the latest tilray earnings call transcript
washington cnn business the world bank has been warning of a worldwide economic slowdown for a while now but its projections just took a turn for the worse in a 200 page report issued tuesday the international financial institution laid out evidence that emerging markets have been stagnating as trade has contracted and financing conditions have worsened the bank knocked down its expectations for this year s global growth to 2 9 from its previous forecast of 3 it also lowered its 2020 growth forecast to 2 8 from 2 9 the world bank blamed the downgrade on the global economy s more sudden than expected deceleration since the institution s last forecast in june and the situation could deteriorate further confirming wall street s concerns about next year being a difficult one for american companies with significant business abroad downside risks have become more acute the bank s report reads disorderly financial market developments could disrupt activity in the affected economies and lead to contagion effects trade disputes could escalate or become more widespread denting activity in the economies involved and leading to negative global spillovers the united states is still among the best performing economies in the world but its growth streak could run out soon as the effects of the tax cuts and government spending wear off and the era of easy money fades further into the distance as the federal reserve raises interest rates although a recession isn t obviously around the corner a volatile political environment and mounting corporate debt loads are a toxic cocktail the policy mix in the united states will shift from expansionary to contractionary during the forecast horizon with monetary fiscal and trade policies all expected to become a drag on activity within the next couple of years the authors write in this context relatively small negative shocks have the potential to abruptly end the current expansion still the implications of an economic crunch are probably worse for low income countries many of which haven t managed to raise per capita incomes enough to keep closing the gap with the developed world although absolute poverty has been declining in places like india progress has stalled in sub saharan africa which the world bank projects could hold as much as 87 of the planet s poor people by 2030 in order to keep the global economy on an even keel the bank recommends that countries invest more in developing their residents skills ease restrictions on investment and reduce barriers to trade rather than raise them as the united states has recently done by imposing tariffs on 12 of its goods imports the world bank is going through its own difficult transition with president jim yong kim unexpectedly resigning on monday three years ahead of schedule president donald trump will now need to appoint a successor since the united states is the bank s largest shareholder
days after reclaiming the house majority democrats are introducing gun control legislation timed for the anniversary of the shooting of former democratic rep gabby giffords speaker nancy pelosi and other democrats introduced a bill to expand background checks for sales and transfers of firearms on tuesday the eighth anniversary of the day giffords was shot in the head at a constituent meeting in arizona giffords who co founded a gun safety group with her husband mark kelly said in a statement friday she was thrilled that her former house colleagues were responding to a gun violence epidemic that killed nearly 40 000 people in 2017 the bill expanding background checks marks a critical first step toward strengthening america s gun laws and making our country a safer place to live work study worship and play giffords said i stand ready to do everything in my power to get this legislation across the finish line democrats promised swift action on gun control after the party regained the house majority following eight years of republican rule pelosi called the bill on background checks a common sense measure and cited polls showing 97 percent of americans support background checks for all gun sales our democratic majority will press relentlessly for bipartisan progress to end the epidemic of gun violence on our streets in our schools and in our places of worship pelosi said enough is enough rep mike thompson d calif who leads a gun violence prevention task force in the house said he and other lawmakers from both parties have been pushing years to expand background checks and approve other gun related bills but have been stymied by republican leaders noting that many freshman democrats ran on the issue of preventing gun violence thompson said political momentum to address gun violence is growing the american people have been demanding we take action and this new congress will deliver he said the background checks measure is likely to face opposition from the republican controlled senate and the white house where president donald trump has promised to protect the second amendment jennifer baker a spokeswoman for the national rifle association said a federal background check did not prevent giffords shooting adding that so called universal background checks will never be universal because criminals do not comply with the law lawmakers should deal with the root cause of violent crime instead of trying to score political points and push ineffective legislation that doesn t stop criminals from committing crimes baker said the trump administration moved last month to ban bump stocks the firearm attachments that allow semi automatic weapons to fire like machine guns bump stocks became a focal point of the gun control debate after they were used in october 2017 by a gunman in las vegas who fired into a crowd at a country music concert killing 58 people and injuring hundreds more a new regulation gives gun owners until late march to turn in or destroy the devices
