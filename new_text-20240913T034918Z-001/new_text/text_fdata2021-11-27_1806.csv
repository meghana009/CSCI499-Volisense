bank deposits would be able to borrow from the treasury to cover any losses that might occur as a result of the higher insurance limit but the core of the senate bill is the treasury s proposal to let financial institutions sell to the government their troubled assets mostly mortgage related and as in the house bill the senate would allow the treasury access to the 700 billion only in stages the senate bill is also similar in that it includes a provision that would require the president to send a legislative proposal to congress that would require the financial industry to reimburse taxpayers for any net losses associated with the program after five years the bailout bill is seen as the beginning of a long process towards cleaning up the bad debt mess following the first bill s rejection president george w bush said in a brief televised address at the white house our economy is depending on decisive action from the government the sooner we address the problem the sooner we can get back on the path of growth and job creation this is what elected leaders owe the american people and i am confident that we ll deliver copyright 2008 cnn all rights reserved this material may not be

to belgium hong kong and israel as well as in southern africa there was no immediate indication whether the variant causes more severe disease as with other variants some infected people display no symptoms south african experts said the who panel drew from the greek alphabet in naming the variant omicron as it has done with earlier major variants of the virus even though some of the genetic

suspended until we have a clear understanding about the danger posed by this new variant and travelers returning from this region should respect strict quarantine rules she warned that mutations could lead to the emergence and spread of even more concerning variants of the virus that could spread worldwide within a few months it s a suspicious variant said frank vandenbroucke health minister in belgium which became the first european union country to announce a case of the variant we don t know if it s a very dangerous variant omicron has yet to be detected in the united states said dr anthony fauci the u s government s top infectious disease expert although it may be more transmissible and resistant to vaccines than other variants we don t know that for sure right now he told cnn speaking to reporters outside a bookstore on nantucket island where he was spending the holiday weekend biden said the new variant was a great concern that should make clearer than ever why this pandemic will not end until we have global vaccinations he called anew for unvaccinated americans to get their widely available doses and for governments to waive intellectual property protections for covid 19 vaccines so they can be more rapidly manufactured around the world israel one of the world s most vaccinated countries announced friday that it also detected its first case of the new variant in a traveler who returned from malawi the traveler and two other suspected cases were placed in isolation israel said all three were vaccinated but officials were looking into the travelers exact vaccination status after a 10 hour overnight trip passengers aboard klm flight 598 from capetown south africa to amsterdam were held on the edge of the runway friday morning at schiphol airport for four hours pending special testing passengers aboard a flight from johannesburg were also being isolated and tested it s ridiculous if we didn t catch the dreaded bug before we re catching it now said passenger francesca de medici a rome based art consultant who was on the flight some experts said the variant s emergence illustrated how rich countries hoarding of vaccines threatens to prolong the pandemic fewer than 6 of people in africa have been fully immunized against covid 19 and millions of health workers and vulnerable populations have yet to receive a single dose those conditions can speed up spread of the virus offering more opportunities for it to evolve into a dangerous variant this is one of the consequences of the inequity in vaccine rollouts and why the grabbing of surplus vaccines by richer countries will inevitably rebound on us all at some point said michael head a senior research fellow in global health at britain s university of southampton he urged group of 20 leaders to go beyond vague promises and actually deliver on their commitments to share doses the new variant added to investor anxiety that months of progress containing covid 19 could be reversed

than other variants we don t know that for sure right now president joe biden said the new variant should make clearer than ever why this pandemic will not end until we have global vaccinations he

until monday according to professor marc van ranst who works for the scientific group overseeing the belgian government s covid 19 response israel one of the world s most vaccinated countries

ridiculous if we didn t catch the dreaded bug before we re catching it now said passenger francesca de medici a rome based art consultant who was on the flight some experts said the variant s emergence illustrated how rich countries hoarding of vaccines threatens to prolong the pandemic fewer than 6 of people in africa have been fully immunized against covid 19 and millions of health workers and vulnerable populations have yet to receive a single dose those conditions can speed up spread of the virus offering more opportunities for it to evolve into a dangerous variant this is one

frankincense and myrrh aren t setting the commodities markets on fire but gold is in high demand as both christmas gift and investment for the second mid pandemic holiday season in a row daniel fisher the ceo of physical gold which sells gold coins and bars saw it first in november 2020 he called it an extraordinary time in which his turnover jumped 2 000 compared to november 2019 we couldn t pick up the phone fast enough he said physical gold sells through its web site but also takes orders over the phone and it was through those conversations with new customers that fisher and his staff learned of the rising popularity of gold as a stocking stuffer advertisement the gift that keeps on hedging against inflation physical gold sells bars of gold ranging from 5 g to 1 kg as well as sovereign coins issued every year by the royal mint a 2021 sovereign coin costs roughly 335 446 but older coins with historical value are costlier a george v sovereign minted between 1911 and 1932 costs around 470 coins and 5 g bars were of particular interest to customers who called physical gold last november to make their purchases these were people talking about how they worried about inflation given how much money the government was printing for furlough programs during the pandemic fisher said some people wanted to pass down money to their kids or grandkids in a way that it didn t lose its value over time or they wanted them to learn the value of investment one man fisher recalled spent a long time discussing how he could best shrink his inheritance tax by gifting his grandchildren gold the conversation landed on coins because those are also free of capital gains tax fisher said he ended up gifting his grandkids 30 or 40 coins apiece the gold supply chain is mostly smooth and untangled now people weren t buying these coins last year because they couldn t purchase other gifts because supply chain snafus had delayed playstation deliveries or rendered razor scooters out of stock i know this because we had supply chain issues with gold as well fisher said when customers called with orders and physical gold could sometimes promise delivery only two or three months out he remembered they d say no problem lock me in the subsequent 12 months have been intensely active as well fisher said as retail demand for gold stayed strong physical gold doesn t yet have numbers for the holiday season that s just beginning understandably fisher doesn t expect yet another 2 000 bump in turnover but he thinks that the uk is starting to see a seasonality to gold purchases that corresponds strongly with the run up to christmas advertisement the supply chain issues have improved although fisher said there are still pockets where they say it ll take two weeks to ship rather than two days but while newly minted bars and coins are easy to source convincing sellers to part with older coins is proving difficult if someone wants to buy 100 george v sovereigns usually it would be quite easy to source them fisher said now though the rising value of gold and the uncertainty about the value of fiat currency fisher said is making people reluctant to part with their coins i d have to tell the customer i can get them for you but the price will be 5 higher it s an interesting dynamic and i don t think it s ending any time soon americans bought more gold during the pandemic like fisher north american gold retailers have been having a bumper pandemic last november and december the canadian firm kitco metals saw a 50 spike in sales compared to the same period in 2019 and 2018 stefan gleason the president of money metals exchange a us dealer in precious metals saw demand for gold double from nov 2019 to nov 2020 and double again from nov 2020 to nov 2021 gleason doesn t spot a seasonal pattern to purchases yet though more americans are buying gold around the holiday season this year than last year he said but it s hard for me to attribute that to anything besides the general uptrend in demand advertisement bart kitner the president of kitco is also cautious about attributing the winter s surge in buying exclusively to gift giving in the summer of 2020 gold was touching record prices advertisement by nov 2020 prices had cooled a little a combination of events kitner said that often leads to investor buying and inevitably investors looking at gold as an asset will outspend gift givers making the latter hard to spot within any larger surge in purchasing people who buy gold as gifts probably would not spend more than 1 000 per purchase and i think i m being generous with that kitner said investors on the other hand will easily buy bars and coins for anywhere from 10 000 to 50 000 at a time approximately 5 10 of gold investors will spend upwards of 500 000 on bullion kitco does sell a line in gifts and collectibles and sales in that category also increased by 50 between nov dec 2019 and nov dec 2020 kitner expects his 2021 holiday season to be less heated than last year s but given that gold is still selling for nearly 400 per ounce more than it was just before the pandemic retailers will still relatively speaking have very happy holidays after all

professor marc van ranst who works for the scientific group overseeing the belgian government s covid 19 response israel one of the world s most vaccinated countries announced friday that it also detected its first case of the new variant in a traveler who returned from malawi the traveler and two other suspected cases were placed in isolation israel said all three were vaccinated but

runway friday morning at schiphol airport for four hours pending special testing passengers aboard a flight from johannesburg were also being isolated and tested it s ridiculous if we didn t catch the dreaded bug before we re catching it now said passenger francesca de medici a rome based art consultant who was on the flight some experts said the variant s emergence illustrated how rich countries hoarding of vaccines threatens to prolong the pandemic fewer than 6 of people in africa have been fully immunized against covid 19 and millions of health workers and vulnerable populations have yet to receive a single dose those conditions can speed up spread of the virus offering more opportunities for it to evolve into a dangerous variant this is one of the consequences of the inequity in vaccine rollouts and why the grabbing of surplus vaccines by richer countries will inevitably rebound on us all at some point said michael head a senior research fellow in global health at britain s university of southampton he urged group of 20 leaders to go beyond vague promises and actually deliver on their commitments to share doses the new variant added to investor anxiety that months of

global health officials are concerned after determining the new variant has characteristics to be as transmissible as delta and possibly antibody resistant as well example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video miami while much of the united states celebrated the thanksgiving holiday global health experts were quickly sharing information about a new covid 19 variant detected in south africa the coronavirus evolves as it spreads and many new variants including those with worrying mutations often just die out scientists monitor for possible changes that could be more transmissible or deadly but sorting out whether new variants will have a public health impact can take time 10 tampa bay reached out to dr aileen marty of florida international university marty has spent more than a decade immersed in the south african public health arena ever since the 2010 fifa world cup in which she worked with the world health organization why south africa marty says it s not all that surprising that the new variant called omicron was discovered in south africa adding they have state of the art equipment and state of the art biosafety level laboratories there where they have full capacity to identify completely new viral pathogens professor salim abdool karim the former chair of the south africa ministerial advisory committee on covid 19 backed up marty s assessment in an interview friday saying we ve put in place the systems of surveillance to identify a new variant as quickly as possible and so we ve been fortunate in this case we ve identified it quite early for perspective the united states doesn t have nearly as robust a variant surveillance program like other countries scientists determine the prevalence of a particular variant through genomics testing and dna sequencing but according to dr jill roberts a molecular epidemiologist at the university of south florida the u s is only running genomics on about 10 percent of positive cases roberts says this is due to a lack of resources such as money equipment and staffing to run genomics on more specimens marty says south africa s low vaccine rate of roughly 24 percent of the population leaves a lot of room for the virus to spread and grow another reason the variant could have originated there as of the time of this article 59 percent of the u s population is fully vaccinated with 74 percent of americans age five and older having at least one shot according to the centers for disease control and prevention how contagious is the omicron variant although it s hard to say for sure just yet health officials are concerned initial research shows this variant will spread rapidly there s every evidence that this is going to be just as transmissible as delta and what we worry about and have been worrying about for a long time is that it does have mutations that could make it an escape variant marty said abdool karim said we know very little about this variant in terms of its behavior and how it s going to cause disease but we can make some extrapolations based on the mutations we are seeing and it has to be said that those are just extrapolations they are not fact but if you look at this particular variant it has characteristics and it has mutations of all the other four variants of concern what s an escape variant marty says an escape variant is a variant of the original covid 19 virus that is resistant to antibodies produced through vaccines natural infection and treatments such as monoclonal infusions what s most concerning the omicron variant has the potential for the one two punch one being highly transmissible like delta and two being more resistant to prior antibodies like beta keep in mind beta didn t get a lot of attention because it wasn t as contagious as delta and fizzled out this new variant takes the worst of beta and the worst of delta and it s been recombined in that way marty said additionally covid is never just about covid if a variant starts exponentially spreading it s a matter of time before hospitals are overrun and other parts of our lives are interrupted what should we do by now you know the drill experts are screaming it from rooftops on every continent do all the things vaccines masks distance ventilation repeat

officials reacted nervously to a new and potentially lethal pandemic crisis the new strain dubbed omicron by the world health organization sent ripples of fear around the globe amid fears the mutation

concerned about the market s decline they always do when there s something on covid that arises biden said a child winces as he receives his pfizer vaccine against covid 19 in diepsloot township near johannesburg south africa cases were already spiking in south africa and the heavily vaccinated country of israel reported its first omicron positive test in a traveler returning from the southern african nation of malawi travelers returning to belgium hong kong and israel from visits to southern africa were also diagnosed with the omicron variant officials said this variant may be more transmissible than the delta variant and current vaccines may be less effective against it warned british health secretary sajid javid we must move quickly and at the earliest possible moment the newly discovered variant also raises fears that those who already contracted covid 19 and recovered could be reinfected officials said the who called an emergency friday meeting to discuss the threat hanging over the planet with its decision to name the new virus an indication they believe the mutated virus could pose a serious threat in the coming months the who along with other medical experts cautioned more information about the variant was needed before any of its dire consequences could be felt although word of its existence set off warning flares across the globe 21 months into the pandemic previous variants including the beta variant raised initial concerns among scientists but ultimately did not turn into a widespread issue but news of the omicron strain quickly led to the barring of international flights into the uk russia and the 27 nation european union with president biden halting inbound planes from south africa botswana eswatini lesotho malawi mozambique namibia and zimbabwe starting monday a departures screen displays a canceled flight to johannesburg and a message to contact the airline for a scheduled flight to capetown at london s heathrow airport friday

vaccines to other countries than every other country combined it is time for other countries to match america s speed and generosity canada also banned the entry of all foreign travelers to southern africa in the last two weeks as eu commission president ursula von der leyen offered a dire warning mutations could lead to the emergence and spread of even more concerning variants of the virus that could spread worldwide within a few months she said a spokeswoman for new york city mayor de blasio said city hall was already in touch with the centers for disease control and was following global scientific reports closely we continue to see warning signs of spikes this upcoming winter and while the new omicron variant has yet to be detected in new york state it s coming new york gov hochul said in a statement a resident from the alexandra township gets tested for covid 19 in johannesburg south africa dr anthony fauci the u s government s top infectious disease expert told cnn the new variant seems to be spreading at a reasonably rapid rate asked if it might prove more transmissible and resistant to vaccines than other variants fauci replied that we don t know that for sure right now adding to the global unease less than 6 of the african population is fully immunized against covid 19 with millions of health care employees and vulnerable populations yet to receive a single dose creating a situation where the spread of a new virus could accelerate the who indicated omicron could pose greater risks than delta the variant that has already fueled waves of infection across every continent in the u s the death toll from coronavirus was climbing toward 800 000 while european health officials warned this week that its covid fatalities could hit 2 million by this coming march the worldwide number of fatalities was already above 5 million south african scientist tulio de oliveira speaking earlier this week reported the omicron variant contains more than 30 mutations to its spike protein the part of the virus that can infect healthy cells in contrast the delta variant contained just two mutations raising the possibility that the new strain could be both more easily spread and more vaccine resistant the last thing we need is to bring in a new variant that will cause even more problems said spahn

infected in the current community outbreak just over 6600 active contacts are being managed with 70 per cent having returned at least one negative test today s update comes as the discovery of a new variant of concern in southern africa prompts a number of countries to halt air travel from the region epidemiologist professor michael baker told the herald that new zealand should also consider putting countries from southern africa on its very high risk travel list i m sure the actual number of travellers to new zealand from those countries is probably tiny he said i think it would probably be relatively easy to put those countries in the same grouping as papua new guinea already on the list as the highest risk and that does give you extra precautions baker said that the real threat of the new variant was how resistant it was to vaccines if this turns out to be a real threat to the effectiveness of vaccines which is the main worry then this might mean we have to review our plans for january and february next year on relying on home isolation entirely he said but look that s really leaping ahead it s important not to catastrophise and we need to wait for more information deputy prime minister grant robertson said yesterday a travel ban on countries where the variant was present would depend on public health advice if we need to take action we will he said in a statement today the ministry of health said this particular strain is in its infancy and as with any emerging developments to do with covid 19 we are closely watching and monitoring evidence and countries responses we will advise on any potential impacts for new zealand noting that we remain in a good position to minimise the impact of any new variants with isolation and routine testing of international arrivals almost 18 000 doses of the vaccine were given yesterday 5 679 were first doses and 12 222 were second doses in auckland where the outbreak began and continues 6058 vaccines were given yesterday just over 1000 were first doses and 5000 were second doses to date 92 per cent of eligible people in new zealand have had their first dose and 85 per cent are fully vaccinated a vaccination milestone has also been reached for pacific communities with 90 per cent of pacific people in aotearoa now having had their first dose and 80 per cent are fully vaccinated māori vaccinations nationwide are at 81 per cent for first doses and 67 per cent for second doses robertson said yesterday that 13 dhbs had now hit 90 per cent first dose coverage of the eligible population only 19 408 more first doses were needed for all dhbs to hit the mark these are all fantastic achievements more dhbs are closing in on the 90 per cent first dose mark he said robertson said bookings were now open for booster shots which will begin from november 29 healthcare and border workers were prioritised given they were the first in line bookings were also now open for astrazeneca on monday the government will say more about the traffic light system the new framework will come into force from next friday prime minister jacinda ardern has said no part of the country will start in the green setting while auckland and regions with low vaccination coverage will start in red new covid variant omicron the world health organisation has named the b 1 1 529 covid variant omicron and an advisory group has said it should be designated as of concern in a statement the who said preliminary evidence suggests the latest variant carries a higher risk of re infection than other variants of concern the statement said the first known confirmed b 1 1 529 infection was from a specimen collected on november 9 2021 this variant has a large number of mutations some of which are concerning preliminary evidence suggests an increased risk of reinfection with this variant as compared to other vocs the number of cases of this variant appears to be increasing in almost all provinces in south africa medical experts have warned against any overreaction before the variant that originated in southern africa was better understood but a jittery world feared the worst nearly two years after covid 19 emerged and triggered a pandemic that has killed more than 5 million people around the globe the us said it will ban travel from south africa and seven other african nations by non us citizens beginning monday european union nations agreed earlier in the day to impose a ban on travel from southern africa to counter the variant s spread the uk canada and other countries have imposed

the s p 500 index was down 2 3 per cent on pace for its worst day since february the price of oil plunged nearly 12 per cent the last thing we need is to bring in a new variant that will cause even more problems german health minister jens spahn said amid a massive spike in cases in the 27 nation european union which recommended a ban on flights from southern african nations eu commission president ursula von der leyen said flights should be suspended until we have a clear understanding about the danger posed by this new variant and travellers returning from this region should respect strict quarantine rules belgium became the first european union country to announce a case of the variant it involved a person who came from abroad it s a suspicious variant we don t know if it s a very dangerous variant health minister frank vandenbroucke said showing how complicated the spread of a variant can be the traveller returned to belgium from egypt on november 11 and became sick on

geneva afp next week s world trade organization ministerial conference the global trade body s biggest gathering in four years was postponed at the last minute friday due to the new omicron covid 19 variant advertising read more the wto hoped the four day gathering in geneva would breathe new life into the crippled organisation which has been stuck for years trying to make progress on resolving issues like fishery subsidies new director general ngozi okonjo iweala was also hoping against the odds to conclude a deal on lifting covid vaccine patents proving the wto had a relevant role to play in combating the pandemic but the conference was postponed four days before it was due to start hours after omicron was declared a variant of concern by the world health organization fears surrounding the spread of the variant saw airlines banning flights from southern africa where the strain was first detected on november 9 meanwhile stock markets and oil prices plunged on fears surrounding the variant potentially dealing a heavy blow to the global economic recovery wto deputy director general anabel gonzalez said the conference has been postponed with the full membership of 164 states behind the decision taken by okonjo iweala and general council chair dacio castillo health fairness and inclusiveness informed the call it is the right decision work will and must continue gonzalez said the beleaguered wto s 12th ministerial conference mc12 has already been postponed once before due to the pandemic it was originally due to take place in kazakhstan s capital nur sultan in june 2020 ip waiver must wait the conference normally takes place every two years it was expected to draw more than 100 ministers to geneva where the organisation is based including heads of state plus 4 000 or so delegates the gathering was being seen as a test of okonjo iweala s ability to fulfil promises to turn around the crisis hit institution the nigerian former foreign minister who in march became the first african and first woman to lead the wto has been widely hailed for her revitalisation efforts she has helped kick start blocked trade negotiations and made reaching a long elusive deal to end harmful fishery subsidies a top priority for the conference she also stressed the urgency of agreeing on how to remove trade barriers blocking access to covid 19 vaccines ministers were also due to discuss calls for a temporary waiver on intellectual property protections for vaccines and other medical tools needed to fight the pandemic but the covid caught up with the conference before okonjo iweala could even start banging heads together on the subject eu trade commissioner valdis dombrovskis said the wto had made a difficult but wise decision rest assured we will continue to work towards a successful outcome of the postponed ministerial in the meantime he said simon manley britain s ambassador in geneva said that given the inability of all delegations to attend also said it was a wise move we stand undaunted in our support for the wto and look forward to the holding of a successful mc12 asap he said us china tensions besides fisheries and covid the meeting was also set to chart a way forward for the wto amid widespread calls for reform of an organisation that was already facing numerous daunting challenges before the pandemic in addition to its long inability to conclude major trade deals it has grappled with rising trade tensions between the united states and china and a broken dispute settlement system there was little optimism around the outcome of the negotiations over the coming days said elvire fabry a trade policy researcher at the european jacques delors institute however she said the postponement was a bad turn of events which prevents us from underlining that the us non engagement encourages the inertia around reforming the wto dmitry grozoubinski director of the geneva trade platform organisation had little hope that having extra time to play with would prove fruitful in finding agreements probably not he told afp the benefit of a ministerial conference is it provides the chance of political movement on issues where technical solutions alone aren t enough 2021 afp

a newly identified heavily mutated coronavirus strain dubbed omicron is triggering alarm across much of the globe prompting a rash of travel restrictions amid fears that existing vaccines will be unable to stop the variant new covid variant of concern the world health organization who convened an emergency meeting on friday to discuss the viral strain which had previously been known as b 1 1 529 declaring it a variant of concern while giving it the new name of omicron preliminary evidence suggests an increased risk of reinfection with this variant as compared to other strains the agency concluded while little is yet known about omicron the who s chief scientist soumya swaminathan noted that it carried a number of worrying mutations that could make the strain more infectious than any observed before with dozens of worrying mutations the large number of mutations have also prompted fears that omicron could be resistant to existing vaccines and therapeutics especially as currently available immunizations have been seen to lose effectiveness over time against other known variants of concern one major determining factor in the transmissibility of the virus is the evolution of its spike proteins microscopic protrusions that allow the coronavirus to access and hijack host cells causing infection a strain detected in south africa in may 2020 and dubbed beta for example had three significant mutations in its spike region which helped make it between 20 and 30 more infectious omicron on the other hand is thought to have at least 32 spike mutations omicron already crossed continents the first cases of omicron were identified in the african nation of botswana on november 11 with additional infections detected in south africa just days later since then omicron is believed to now make up 90 of new infections in south africa s gauteng region according to local epidemiologists hong kong registered its first omicron case on thursday while israel reported an infection from a traveler returning from malawi on friday and is now monitoring two other suspected patients suggesting the strain is quickly spreading far beyond southern africa where it was first spotted hit europe belgium became the first european nation to detect the strain within its borders on friday the discovery set off alarms across the continent and beyond with the uk s health security agency deeming omicron the worst variant we have seen so far and paralyzed travel as news of the strain dominated headlines for much of friday italy france the netherlands denmark spain germany and the czech republic among other european countries declared new travel bans russia has also joined the fast growing list of countries to bring new travel bans along with the united states the philippines malaysia japan singapore brazil and bahrain even though the who warned against acting too hastily with travel bans european commission president ursula von der leyen called to suspend all air travel to and from countries with reported cases of the new variant until officials have a better understanding of the strain what s next though omicron has already made major waves around the world impacting global stock markets and international travel there is still much to be learned about the new variant and the danger it poses fewer than 100 full genome sequences were available for review as of thursday and the who s technical head on covid 19 dr maria van kerkhove said it could take several weeks before much insight is gleaned into the strain and its mutations high on the agenda however is determining whether omicron is resistant to currently available vaccines which many nations have banked on to curb their outbreaks and ultimately bring the pandemic to an end some of the world s largest pharmaceutical firms have also rushed to roll out strategies for how to manage the new strain among them pfizer biontech moderna and johnson johnson each of which claimed to be closely monitoring omicron and looking at ways to alter their existing vaccines and boosters

don t lose rail history re new plan for old rail hub editorial nov 23 the editorial article draws attention to the sad possibility that this wonderful old railway station may be lost forever if that happens a major part of bangkok s and thailand s history will be gone thailand has many tourist attractions and hua lamphong is one of them my understanding was that the entire site would become a railway museum and this is an opportunity that should not be missed thailand has a great railway history and the small museum that i have visited at hua lamphong more than once shows some fine examples of that the possibility of some services continuing to operate at hua lamphong should be seriously considered especially for trains that will attract tourists it could easily double as a limited rail terminal and a magnificent railway museum apart from that it is a central location that is well connected to other parts of bangkok by the mrt the development at bang sue is magnificent and is in keeping with the fact that rail travel in southeast asia has a bright future however authorities need to recognise that railway history is of significant interest to many tourists reflecting this is the increasing number of television programmes about the great railway journeys one can take in the world which include their stations rolling stock and destinations hua lamphong is one of the great classic railway stations of the world progress is important but not at the cost of losing such a wonderful piece of history let s continue to admire it and see it develop into a must see for visitors from around the globe martin george

organization on friday as the u s and other nations reacted to the newly discovered variant with travel restrictions experts with the world health organization met friday to assess the variant which appears to have a high number of mutations in the virus spike protein prompting worries about how easily it will spread while good data on the risks of omicron is likely weeks away the organization cited early evidence suggesting an increased risk of reinfection the u s said it will restrict travel from south africa as well as botswana zimbabwe namibia lesotho eswatini mozambique and malawi according to a statement from senior officials from the biden administration latest updates world reacts to omicron much faster than previous variants vaccine contingency plans in motion latest covid

who test negative infection rates in south africa have increased steeply coinciding with the detection of the variant according to a friday statement from the who the first omicron case was reported to the agency from south africa on nov 24 and the number of cases of the variant are increasing in almost all south african provinces the who said while omicron is now in the same category as the delta variant the extent of the public health threat the new variant will pose is unclear the beta variant was classified a variant of concern but did not spread as far as initially expected the who urged countries to increase surveillance of omicron cases and genome sequencing efforts to better understand its potential impact biden said the emergence of omicron emphasizes the importance of vaccinations and urged americans to get their booster shots as soon as possible the new variant has also been found in botswana and hong kong in travelers from south africa according to joe phaahla

effectiveness of current vaccines but moderna has already announced a three point strategy to combat the new variant omicron s mutations could possibly reduce current vaccines effectiveness but are unlikely to eliminate their benefit according to dr ashish jha dean of brown university s school of public health there are a series of mutations in key regions that may impact effectiveness of our vaccines tweeted jha on friday render vaccines useless no super unlikely moderna s strategy involves three options for boosting covid 19 vaccination should omicron prove problematic for current vaccines the three options according to a friday release from the company a higher dose booster shots currently being studied that are designed to anticipate mutations such as those that have emerged in the omicron variant and an omicron specific booster which is already in the works andy slavitt who previously served as president joe biden s white house senior adviser for covid response said in a tweet that both moderna and pfizer biontech have estimated a vaccine to combat a new variant could be developed in about 3 months with some regulatory and logistical hurtles to follow if we start in early december new vaccines could be available by summer in much of the world slavitt tweeted multiple media organizations on friday reported pfizer biontech is studying the new variant and expects data within weeks if warranted a targeted vaccine could be developed within 6 weeks and ship within 100 days the reports say johnson johnson is also testing its current vaccine against omicron according to cnbc new york gov kathy hochul on friday announced an executive order intended to boost hospital capacity and address staffing shortages a move that comes amid growing concerns about hospital beds and staffing hospitalizations have already risen sharply recently in much of the state and could soar higher if omicron proves to be as highly transmissible as some fear the variant has not yet been detected in new york it s coming hochul said in a statement friday her order allows the state health department to limit non essential surgeries if needed to ensure capacity the governor said the order also will allow the state to acquire critical supplies more quickly hospitals in other areas of the country are already stretched thin amid a spike in cases on wednesday the federal government said it would send 44 military medical staffers to michigan to help beleaguered hospitals treat covid 19 patients amid a fourth surge that is the worst in the country facing hospitals filling up with covid patients needing lengthy stays massachusetts gov charlie baker said tuesday any hospital or hospital system facing limited capacity to care for patients will be required to reduce non essential non urgent scheduled procedures beginning monday the associated press federal health regulators say an experimental covid 19 pill from merck is effective against the virus but they will seek input from outside experts on risks of birth defects and other potential problems during pregnancy the food and drug administration posted its analysis of the pill ahead of a public meeting next week where academic and other experts will weigh in on its safety and effectiveness the agency isn t required to follow the group s advice the fda scientists said their review identified several potential risks including possible toxicity and birth defects given those risks the fda will ask its advisers whether the drug should never be given during pregnancy or whether it could be made available in certain cases under that scenario the fda said the drug would carry warnings about risks during pregnancy but doctors would still have the option to prescribe it in certain cases where its benefits could outweigh its risks for patients given the safety concerns fda said merck agreed the drug would not be used in children additionally the fda flagged a concern that merck s drug led to small changes in the coronavirus signature spike protein which it uses to penetrate human cells theoretically fda cautioned those changes could lead to dangerous new variants regulators also noted that merck collected far less safety data overall on its drug than was gathered for other covid 19 therapies fda will ask its independent advisers to discuss all those issues and then vote on whether the drug s overall benefits outweigh its risks the associated press despite early signs that suggested the u s may have avoided another winter surge covid 19 cases are on the way up the
