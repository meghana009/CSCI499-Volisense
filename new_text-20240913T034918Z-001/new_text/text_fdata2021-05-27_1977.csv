opinion china and the united states are engaged in a great struggle economic diplomatic and ultimately military that will determine the survival of democracy sadly president biden embraces half measures that play into beijing s hand secretary of state antony blinken has made clear we object to china s mercantilist policies that weaken our economy and our allies the gross human rights violations it commits by throwing muslims into concentration camps and smothering democracy and jailing dissidents in hong kong and its violations of international law by militarizing large swaths of the south china sea and threatening taiwan with invasion mr biden seeks to gird the u s economy with his infrastructure proposals but the monies allocated to the semi conductor industry and manufacturing generally ride second car to social programs his industrial policies pale by comparison to advantages beijing offers national champions with subsidies and by throwing up barriers to foreign competition in its domestic market mr biden s limp approach appeases the democratic party s hard left it believes america can spend as it pleases domestically cut back on defense and rely on diplomacy to somehow stifle an international bully instead mr biden should be telling americans there can be no social justice if china destroys our industrial base or if he fails to modernize our pacific military resources by cultivating moderate democrats and republicans in congress to get the job done mr biden seeks a coalition of democracies however for the u k germany france japan and other trans pacific partnership nations disengaging and confronting china entails lost exports and jobs and military vs domestic spending tradeoffs too our most potent tool would be to offer our allies a western free trade alliance by rejoining the tpp and quickly concluding agreements with the u k and eu instead mr biden again bows to hard left democrats who oppose free trade as an ideological imperative and embraces their nostalgic fantasy that somehow america can recreate the unionized manufacturing prosperity of the 1950s u s manufacturing no matter how strongly rebuilt will use fewer and more technically sophisticated workers that are less amenable to collective bargaining and political herding america can t expect japan germany and others to forgo market opportunities in china while mr biden acts so protectionist toward friend and foe alike mr biden appeases black lives matters aoc and other radical progressives by not explicitly rejecting the 1619 narrative and critical race theory he stocks his administration only with appointees who meet the hard left s ideological screening that s why we don t have as defense secretary michel flournoy who has the clearest vision of the military challenges posed by china but instead have lloyd austin who has not demonstrated by his record or words such understanding all this opens the field for beijing s aggressive foreign policy narrative that tells the world america poses a false choice beijing offers a better system and a unifying path while the americans seed divisions and suspicions what beijing does internally to muslims and other minorities is its own business and its treatment of hong kong and taiwan are within its sovereign discretion beijing repeatedly calls out the united states for our treatment of blacks blm oac and the rest of the ever patriotic hard left must be happy for the help the good news is that mr blinken is a skilled diplomat well capable of cultivating allies and privately focusing them on the hypocrisy of beijing s narrative the bad news is like most who rise from the ranks at foggy bottom he is adverse to stating publicly compelling discomforting truths if this were the 1920s how beijing treats muslims hong kong and taiwan would be internal matters but since world war ii and the u n charter which china has signed and should abide respect for human rights and self determination are international obligations not matters for domestic sovereign discretion for its actions messrs biden and blinken should label china a terrorist state that would better frame the issue for our allies and compel sanctions with teeth since presidents truman and johnson our national policy has been to correct injustices toward blacks and dismantle systemic racism whereas as former secretary of state mike pompeo correctly stated china s national policy amounts to genocide now it s up to mr blinken to state that beijing s deeds make president xi guilty of crimes against humanity and world leaders who would enable him become accomplices it s time to stop pretending we can engage china or do business with a maniacal fascist on much of anything sometime in this decade beijing s military will likely cross the straights of taiwan and america should be preparing for war peter morici pmorici1 is an economist and emeritus business professor at the university of maryland and a national columnist
on may 26 1896 the wall street journal began to publish the world s first stock market average it consisted of 12 stocks and charles barron added their closing prices up and divided by 12 with paper and pencil that first day the djia closed at 40 94 the country was still coming out of the deep depression of the mid 1890s and many on wall street feared that william jennings bryan might win the presidency that year and ditch the gold standard by september the average was down to 28 a drop of 31 percent but as william mckinley s prospects improved the average recovered it would cross 100 for the first time in 1906 before the average people had no easy way to determine how the market as a whole had acted that day wall streeters were adept at reading the tape but most people had to rely on what journalists told them now they had an objective standard the number of stocks in the average increased to 20 during world war i and then to 30 near the end of the twenties and companies were added and dropped as the american economy evolved from an industrial one to a consumer driven and then a digital one but these changes could have strange effects in 1937 the dow dropped ibm and added at t over the next forty years before ibm went back into the index in 1977 at t s stock price increased 300 percent while ibm went up 22 000 percent in other words had they not made that switch the dow jones would have recovered its 1929 high and broke through 1 000 many years before it did the dow has been the means by which people could measure the five great bull markets we have had since 1896 the biggest ran from august 1921 to september 1929 when the average increased 496 5 percent and of course the not infrequent bear markets having hit 381 17 in 1929 the dow sank to 41 27 in the middle of 1932 barely above where it had first closed 36 years earlier but over the long term the dow has grown an average of 7 96 percent per year had your great grandfather passively invested 1 000 in the dow stocks in 1896 the investment would have doubled on average every nine years until it reached 4 104 000 this year to put that another way no one has made money in the long term betting against the american economy
bill gates s money manager shared nude photos of women in the office rated female colleagues on their looks and made racist and sexually offensive remarks former employees have claimed they described michael larson 61 as an infamous bully who disparaged his female staff and humiliated those around him at a work christmas party in the mid 2000s sources told the new york times that larson was seated outdoors with a small group of male employees after dinner with three female colleagues standing about 20 feet away which one of them do you wanna f larson asked them when a female staff member was attending weight watchers larson allegedly asked if it was to lose weight for him another woman at his firm was allegedly asked by larson if she would strip for a certain amount of money michael larson 61 has managed bill gates s money for the past 27 years gates 65 was not a social friend of larson but the pair had a close working relationship bill and melinda gates pictured in 2018 were informed about concerns over larson in 2006 the new york times revelations about larson comes after the may 4 announcement that the gateses were divorcing the announcement has opened the floodgates to stories about his affair in 2000 with a microsoft employee melinda gates hired divorce lawyers in 2019 after meetings that gates had with convicted sex offender jeffrey epstein became public epstein who had been charged with sexually abusing dozens of young girls in the early 2000s died by suicide while in custody in 2019 melinda gates was said to have been deeply uncomfortable with epstein after their first meeting and urged her husband to steer clear of the pedophile financier she was also unhappy with an investigation into larson in 2018 which ended with the woman involved receiving a payoff larson s firm cascade investments existed entirely to manage the gateses money at times the gateses were dragged into complaints about larson one woman who managed a local bike store which was mostly owned by a firm rally capital that cascade had invested in complained that larson repeatedly propositioned her according to the new york times she repeatedly rebuffed him but she claimed in a lawyer s letter sent to the gateses threatening to sue that he had exposed himself to her and said he wanted to have sex with her and another woman bill gates agreed to settle the matter by having a payment made to the bike store manager the paper reported melinda gates insisted that an outside investigator review the incident and cascade s culture an investigation that took place in 2018 as larson went on leave he returned in 2019 melinda was said to be unsatisfied by the outcome bill and melinda gates pictured in 2018 hired larson in 1994 to manage their finances bill gates s relationship with larson began in 1993 when his previous financial manager andrew l evans was sent to prison for bank fraud in the ensuing scandal gates in 1994 hired larson after taking the job larson decided to go off the radar said roger mcnamee a co founder of elevation partners a silicon valley firm that was an early investor in facebook a former employee told the new york times that the philosophy was we don t want bill s name in the headlines larson s firm incorporated in washington state near the offices of both bill and melinda gates s companies and microsoft grew to more than 100 people all working to increase the wealth of both the gateses personally and their foundation larson was known to be a comparatively traditional investor who preferred safe bets to huge risks he invested their money in farmland hotels stocks bonds even a bowling alley thanks to larson s team and the rise in value of microsoft s shares bill gates s fortune has gone from less than 10 billion to about 130 billion larson is seen in july 2009 arriving for the annual conference in sun valley idaho in september 2014 the gateses held a dinner for larson at their seattle mansion nicknamed xanadu 2 0 to celebrate larson s 20 years of working with them gates gave a toast to larson the wall street journal reported at the time and said larson has his complete trust and faith he added melinda and i are free to pursue our vision of a healthier and better educated world because of what michael has done larson and gates were not friends and did not mingle socially but gates certainly appeared to have larson s back they re not two buddies for sure said steve walsh former chief executive of legg mason inc s western asset management unit who has known larson for years walsh said he was impressed by the 2014 party it was almost tender and endearing he told the wall street journal yet behind closed doors the problems were plain to see stacy ybarra who joined the company in 2001 as an investor relations analyst announced that she was leaving in 2004 for another firm infospace ybarra was hired in 2001 as an investor relations analyst in 2004 larson made racist comments larson was furious and set out to sabotage her new company telling ybarra and others that he had shorted infospace s stock out of spite according to the three people who heard about his remarks at the time the new york times said ybarra then decided to stay at larson s firm in november of that year larson was asking his staff about the best time to vote for the presidential election ybarra who is black replied that she had voted that morning without having to wait in line according to two people who heard the comment and a third who was told about it later and told the new york times larson responded but you live in the ghetto and everybody knows that black people don t vote complaints were made and bill and melinda gates later spoke to ybarra as part of an investigation people familiar with the matter told the new york times in january 2005 she quit cascade received a small payout and agreed to not speak about the firm in the future chris giglio larson s spokesman denied that he had made the racist remark during his tenure mr larson has managed over 380 people and there have been fewer than five complaints related to him in total giglio said any complaint was investigated and treated seriously and fully examined and none merited mr larson s dismissal the times also reported that in november 2006 the gateses were alerted to concerns about larson this time in a letter from robert e sydow a california fund manager who had been close friends with larson and was godfather to one of larson s children sydow s firm grandview capital management had been hired by larson to manage a 1 6 billion slice of the foundation s endowment sydow warned larson that he needed to stop using his power to hurt others in anger and in the letter to the gateses warned them about a toxic environment at the firm as a result larson s office was moved to a different floor away from his staff and employees including larson were required to undergo sexual harassment and sensitivity training yet one former employee told the new york times that larson did not seem to take it seriously they recalled him saying we don t need this giglio denied that bill gates s spokeswoman bridgitt arnold said they do not tolerate inappropriate behavior bridgitt arnold a spokeswoman for bill gates said that bill and melinda gates investments bmgi whose name is sometimes used interchangeably with cascade s has robust policies to deal with employee complaints about wrongdoing bmgi takes all complaints seriously and seeks to address them effectively to guarantee a safe and respectful workplace giglio said arnold said bmgi does not tolerate inappropriate behavior she added that any issue raised over the company s history has been taken seriously and resolved appropriately larson said calling bmgi a toxic work environment is unfair to the 160 professionals who make up our team and our culture courtney wade a spokeswoman for melinda gates said melinda unequivocally condemns disrespectful and inappropriate conduct in the workplace she was unaware of most of these allegations given her lack of ownership of and control over bmgi larson did admit to using tough language with his staff years ago earlier in my career i used harsh language that i would not use today larson said i regret this greatly but have done a lot of work to change

wants time to more fully review the guidelines before deciding what to do he also will be weighing whether to leave in place for a while the current reservation system for park entry a requirement under existing covid guidelines while stocks said he s looking forward to a strong summer he acknowledges that a full recovery may not come right away it doesn t quite feel normal yet he said we have

voicing concerns back to video it sounds good in principle hfr being described as transformative with more reliable service to more communities more daily departures and better on time performance but where does cornwall and area fit in article content the worry is accessing all of that improvement would have passengers having to drive to access hfr to perhaps brockville or alexandria and that via

councillors as just the messenger but nonetheless one who was delivering unsettling and incomplete information still smarting over the recent news that greyhound canada was closing bus service across quebec and ontario a pre emptive strike from the mayor and councillors made it clear cornwall and area can t afford a transportation blow in the form of reduced train service when you look at that proposed train route map graphic cornwall looks pretty lonely sitting there compared to other municipalities the mayor told cannon to get to the new dedicated track roughly running in this region

and fearing the devil will eventually appear in the details council was voicing concerns long before train service could potentially go to hell here that was the point of tuesday s exercise said coun elaine macdonald this hfr and cornwall s place in it is a most unwelcome development it certainly doesn t serve our community better in this era when people are being urged to park their cars and use

reminded cannon cornwall isn t a one stoplight town that combined with akwesasne and the counties i would argue that there are 100 000 people here looking at this and thinking ok we have a big strategic plan to grow the region which is working by the way people are moving from the larger centres and working remotely but lack of via rail investment in cornwall taking away station staff and putting up paid parking has not helped at all and sends an opposite message a message that you don t want our business said coun justin towndale we re a town that relies heavily on connecting links

economic drivers to ensure that advertisement 6 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content supplied cannon in his presentation said via rail owns just three per cent of the rail it operates on and that hfr would change that and ultimately serve the greater good of all communities and he said that with kingston identified as an hfr

on discontinued and existing railway rights of way portions of it rely on using the existing line on which via s trains between ottawa and montreal already run as via would own more track along this

fourth quarter and full year highlights then provide an update on activity so far on our first fiscal quarter and wrap up with thoughts about the balance of the year i am pleased with the results skyline champion delivered in the fiscal 2021 as we continue to make progress in delivering topline growth and achieving improved capacity and productivity levels for our customers for the year we grew adjusted ebitda by 18 to 135 million and expanded margins by 120 basis points i m extraordinarily proud of our team and the success we achieved during the year despite the challenging and unpredictable operating environment we started the year with idled facilities and restricted operations and we finished with strong financial results and expanding production levels i m increasingly confident in our ability to capitalize on the growing demand for housing from an industry standpoint homebuilder confidence remains at historically high levels due to low interest rates and lean inventories of new and existing single family homes skyline champion provides high quality and affordable solutions for consumers and we believe that we can leverage our business model to continue to scale operations to service this robust demand environment we had an outstanding fourth quarter delivering terrific results across the business as we continue to see robust demand for new housing as stated earlier demand is being driven by numerous factors including favorable financing historically low inventory levels and rapidly growing number of millennials looking to become homeowners our affordable price point during these inflationary times created strong order demand and that along with the acquisition of scotbilt resulted in backlogs growing by 370 million during the fourth quarter to reach 859 million fortunately we were able to increase production during the quarter allowing us to moderate the growth in our delivery times to our customers to 28 weeks at the end of march compared to 18 weeks at the end of the third quarter despite the surge in orders as a result of solid production increases we delivered 6 342 homes an improvement of 34 from the prior year and up 12 sequentially we improved our u s manufacturing facility s capacity utilization to 77 during the quarter an increase of 7 percentage points from the third quarter achieving these production increases despite facing operational challenges caused by supply chain disruptions across our manufacturing operations and the industry our improved production efficiencies allowed us to increase daily production rates over the levels achieved in the sequential third quarter due in part to the progress made on streamlining product offerings while we were able to add people to workforce labor availability continues to be a challenge we made progress in our western canadian plants as well as we saw home sales volume increase over 200 from the prior year and 32 sequentially during the quarter we also announced the acquisition of scotbilt homes which significantly enhanced skyline s manufacturing and distribution presence in the attractive mid south region with two facilities in georgia we are thrilled to have the scotbilt team on board and look forward to continuing to capture synergies we are confident in our ability to deliver solid returns and meaningful shareholder value as part of our overall capital allocation strategy moving into our fiscal 22 we expect that the demand for attainable housing will remain extremely strong for the first and second quarters and then moderate to higher than normal levels as the economy starts to reopen and the stimulus effect starts to fade at the same time we believe that we have the raw materials to operate and maintain topline revenue levels in the first quarter similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 we then anticipate the compounding challenges of supply chain and labor to cause sequential decline in our second and third quarters we expect that these challenges will subdue and subside by our fourth fiscal quarter allowing us to return to first quarter levels while we will manage through the short term supply side challenges during our fiscal 22 our focus is in looking outward with entry level housing supply hitting a five decade low and millennial household formations increasing we continue to gain confidence in our move into digital and turnkey offerings inflationary and interest rate pressures will only hasten the transition away from antiquated site built methods currently performed today to more modern production practices therefore we are focused on expanding our capacity and investing in automation to enhance our processes we will need to supply more housing to our channel partners into our customers who need affordable attainable homes the growth in orders experienced during our fourth quarter was enhanced due to our initial digital efforts and as we mentioned on our last call by skyline being named america s most trusted manufactured housing builder receiving a five star trust rating in a survey of more than 24 000 new manufactured home buyers in fiscal 22 we are accelerating our investments into our platforms for sustained growth today s consumers reward brands that they can trust and that can deliver a simple and seamless experience digitally and at retail the pandemic has only intensified this expectation we recently expanded our senior leadership team with the addition of tim larson as the company s chief growth officer as we accelerate our investments into our customer experience strategy in omnichannel digital platform tim brings with him significant experience and proven performance in transforming the customer and digital experience across a diverse portfolio of brands and industries with tim in this new role i m even more confident that skyline champion will be able to develop industry best solutions and experiences for our customers and create growth opportunities for our company finally in fiscal 22 we will continue to demonstrate our commitment to esg through companywide and plant specific programs as well as through our everyday business practices when providing high quality yet affordable homes to homebuyers beginning in fiscal 22 we have launched a program to participate in reforestation with forestry products central to the construction of homes we have initiated a program to plant one tree for every tree used in the construction of our homes reforestation contributes to the environment by replenishing forests reducing greenhouse gases and protecting the watershed i will now turn the call over to laurie to discuss our quarterly financials in more detail laurie hough executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks mark and good morning everyone i will begin by reviewing our financial results for the fourth quarter followed by a discussion of our balance sheet and cash flows i will also briefly discuss our expectations for the fiscal first quarter as well as the long term outlook before reviewing our numbers i would like to highlight a few dynamics that impacted our results in the quarter compared to the year ago period as mentioned in our press release we had an extra week in our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021 compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 the extra week accounted for approximately 31 million in sales during the quarter in addition we acquired scotbilt homes on february 28th and have included its results for the month of march finally we experienced negative impact from the covid restrictions which caused us to temporarily close 20 plants at the end of the fourth quarter last year reducing overall production levels for that period net sales increased by 49 to 448 million in the fourth quarter versus the same quarter last year we saw revenue growth of 120 6 million in the u s factory built housing segment as well as growth in our canadian factory built housing segment of 23 9 million the increase in u s factory built revenue was driven by an increase in the number of homes sold and an increase in average selling price the increase in the number of homes sold was 29 or 1 320 units for a total of 5 923 homes compared to the same quarter last year the average selling price per u s home sold increased by 11 6 to 67 200 due to product mix and price increases in response to rising material costs we are pleased with the sequential growth in revenue in the u s factory built segment which increased 18 in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2021 this increase was driven by an 11 increase in homes sold and a 7 increase in average selling price canadian revenue increased to 212 to 35 2 million compared to last year driven primarily by a 222 increase in the number of homes sold to 419 units the average home selling price in canada of 84 100 decreased 3 versus the same quarter last year as pricing actions enacted in response to rising material costs were offset by a shift in product mix consolidated gross profit increased to 99 1 million up 65 versus the prior year quarter due to increased sales volume and higher pricing our u s housing segment gross margins were 21 9 of segment net sales up a 120 basis points from the fourth quarter last year due to direct labor efficiencies and increased leverage of fixed costs caused by higher sales volumes sg a in the fourth quarter increased to 52 5 million from 47 2 million in the same period last year lower expenses due to decreased travel and marketing were more than offset by higher variable compensation and investment in the company s online customer experience and other system enhancements which will continue to accelerate throughout the year net income for the fourth quarter was 33 9 million or 0 59 per diluted share compared to net income of 6 million or earnings of 0 11 per diluted share during the same period last year the increase in eps was driven by a combination of higher revenue and gross profit the company s effective tax rate for the quarter was 24 5 versus an effective tax rate of 51 8 for the year ago quarter the company s effective tax rate decreased primarily as a result of a fiscal year 2020 increase in a deferred tax asset valuation allowance partially offset by recognition of certain tax credits adjusted ebitda for the quarter was 51 2 million an increase of 155 over the same period a year ago the adjusted ebitda margin expanded by 470 basis points to 11 4 due to higher sales growth gross margin improvement and leverage of fixed costs forest product inflation as well as other building product costs continued to increase during the fourth quarter and into our fiscal 2022 first quarter as we discussed during our third quarter conference call we began seeing an increase in labor inflation during these periods as well there are several levers we can utilize in response to increasing material and labor costs including price adjustments product standardization raw material substitutions and further operational improvements despite our efforts to continue to pass on inflation and make operational improvements our production may be impacted by the availability of raw materials due to global supply chain challenges the availability of qualified labor as well as the homebuyer s ability to qualify for financing at the higher inflationary rates as of april 3rd 2021 we had 263 million of cash and cash equivalents and long term borrowings of 39 million with no maturities until june of 2023 we generated a 154 million of operating cash flow for the year which doubled from the prior year the increase in operating cash flow is primarily due to the increase in net income customer deposits and deferment of employer payroll taxes allowed by the cares act which were partially offset by an increase in raw material inventory balances during the fourth quarter we used 52 5 million of our cash on hand to acquire scotbilt we remained focused on executing on our growth and operational initiatives and given our favorable liquidity position plan to utilize our cash to reinvest in the business and support strategic growth i ll now turn the call back to mark for some closing remarks mark yost president and chief executive officer thanks laurie i m encouraged with the solid momentum in our business and the results we delivered this fiscal year our strong backlog and efforts to expand our capacity and increase our productivity has positioned us well to respond to the growing demand for our homes before we open the lines for q a i want to take a moment and thank our team this has been a truly challenging year for everyone and the skyline champion team overcame those challenges and delivered strong results while helping to solve the affordable housing crisis with our unique and innovative home solutions and ensuring the safety of all involved along the way i am even more confident in our ability to execute our strategy going forward after this extraordinary year and with that operator you may now open the lines for q a questions and answers operator thank you at this time we ll be conducting a question and answer session thank you and our first question comes from the line of daniel moore with cjs securities please proceed with your questions daniel moore cjs securities analyst mark laurie good morning thanks for taking the questions mark yost president and chief executive officer good morning dan how are you daniel moore cjs securities analyst i m well thank you and congrats on execution review as well as team maybe start with a little bit more detail on the customer buying experience you described can you maybe provide a few specific examples of how you re kind of simplifying the process and then separately the digital initiatives and automation projects any tangible examples of where some of those projects have been and where your ramping investment would be really helpful mark yost president and chief executive officer yes sure thanks dan i think as far as the buying experience the first thing we re doing is driving a tremendous amount of leads to our retail channel partners to increase their business and to make it an easier buying experience for the customer so if the customer comes in with a pre vetted home that they know what they want because they priced it they looked at it online it s much easier for the retail sales person and the retail channel partner to serve the customers needs so i think that s the first step is providing more vetted leads to our retail channel partners our second step in that process is to make it very easy to design and configure your home online and then find that home along with maybe a communication process dan that allows the customer to see when that home is delivered in backlog how long that order is going to take so that they can pick from a selection of options and have more transparency in the buying process eventually because i think that s where the world is going so i think it s really streamlining some of those front end and then also two is with our turnkey solutions that we ve been investing in in different parts of the country in the u s having a set and finish crew that can set finish and turnkey the home over to the end customer to make it easier for either a retail partner or community partner and or just the end customer to have a seamless experience rather than multiple handoffs and so all of that will be connected to our systems and digitally so it looks like the handing of the baton is seamless to the end customer and makes the buying process more enjoyable daniel moore cjs securities analyst perfect and then on the kind of automation side maybe some of the any examples you might be able to share there mark yost president and chief executive officer yeah i think on the automation side there is some new and innovative processes that are out there that have come to bear thus far we ve seen and studied many things frankly dan that don t work or don t have a good return on capital we ve actually met with about 40 or 50 different companies or suppliers or vendors to different automation components and things in doing that what we ve seen is that many of the process and tools today that are developed that are off the shelf really are not effective to meet the speed and or quality and or cost savings that would be needed but now today there is a handful of new equipment that s starting to come out that is being designed that can meet the speed and quality so we re not quite there yet but we see some potential investments right on the horizon that we re going to be making in the next actually throughout this year and into next year so because it s proven itself out at least on a high level daniel moore cjs securities analyst got it and maybe switch gears for one more just talk about the raw material availability what are the biggest pain points that you re seeing as we enter kind of fiscal q2 and fiscal q3 as you described for you and the industry and maybe some of those alternatives in terms of procurement or substitute materials mark yost president and chief executive officer yeah thanks dan i think the raw material supply chain will probably be the largest short term driver for the industry and specifically for us as we look many of the supply are of our supply partners are dealing with production challenges themselves so they re going out and putting allocations in place so certain critical raw material supplies that we ve got they said will give you an increase year over year however that increase year over year would mean a roughly a 20 reduction to where we were in the fourth quarter so we ve got a problem solved to either get substitute materials which we re working through but i think those supply chain allocations that were given on several components are going to create challenges as we work through the year so if we can find substitute products and or materials for some of those categories then hopefully we can we can maintain certain levels of production but it s really supply allocation that is the larger issue today other than just confronting the day to day challenges of short term supply issues in two part adhesives pvc fiberglass tubs insulation i think it s today it s a very volatile situation the team has done an exceptional job managing through that thus far but i think the larger allocation issues will be the driver of volumes this year daniel moore cjs securities analyst perfect i ll jump back with any follow ups thank you mark yost president and chief executive officer thank you operator our next question is from the line of greg palm with craig hallum please proceed with your questions greg palm craig hallum analyst hey good morning mark hey laurie congrats on the quarter congrats on getting to that 10 plus ebitda margin as well really impressive stuff overall mark yost president and chief executive officer thanks greg greg palm craig hallum analyst i guess just starting off appreciate some of the color on the expectations for the fiscal year and i just wanted to clarify whether the comments about topline are those related solely to unit production i guess the reason why i ask is i m assuming pricing in your asps on a go forward basis will be somewhat higher than what you just reported in the past quarter based on what we see home prices doing so i m curious if that s incremental or if the commentary on topline includes contribution from higher home sales as well laurie hough executive vice president and chief financial officer hey greg i can take that one so we really expect asps to moderate to the growth in asp to moderate versus the fourth quarter kind of going forward to fiscal 22 we are going to have some increase in price that comes through but that s going to be offset with product mix greg palm craig hallum analyst got it ok so maybe more singles then multis which brings down the asp but somewhat higher prices on a like for like basis so maybe that evens out asps that s what you re thinking laurie hough executive vice president and chief financial officer you got it yeah greg palm craig hallum analyst got it and just looking back in the quarter even if you make some adjustments for the extra week you re still outpacing industry production or shipments by a pretty decent amount i think it s the second quarter in a row so it implies additional share gains i don t know if that s a byproduct of having some available capacity that others don t maybe it s you re starting to see returns in this online digital initiative i don t know how sustainable is that going forward laurie hough executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i think it s definitely sustainable the team has we definitely have had some productivity gains our just labor efficiencies and productivity have definitely picked up in the second half of the year so i see that continuing and progressing our supply chain borrowing supply chain issues so that s very encouraging and then yeah i think the digital solutions are bringing to us more of a vetted standardized product and we ve been simplifying our product mix so i think all of those factors greg are allowing us and helping us to gain share today especially given many of the states that we participate and this past year have been down in terms of volume so some of the key states we participate in in california michigan the pennsylvania new york florida regions if you look at total industry shipments for manufactured housing those are actually down so for us to gain share overall when some of the key geographies we serve were down for the year is quite encouraging greg palm craig hallum analyst that s a good point alright great well i will leave it there best of luck going forward thanks again mark yost president and chief executive officer thanks greg operator thank you our next question is from the line of matthew bouley with barclays please proceed with your questions matthew bouley barclays analyst good morning everyone thanks for taking the question congrats on the results i wanted to ask back on the pricing side you mentioned moderating the growth rate this coming year and in the prepared remarks you made a comment about people qualifying for financing and keeping an eye on that as prices move higher just how do you think about the ability at this point for the typical customer of manufactured housing to accept further price increases is there any kind of ceiling to it or just a consideration on not stretching affordability too far thank you mark yost president and chief executive officer thanks matt and good morning i think yeah we definitely watch for that right now what we call the fallout rates at lenders is very low by historic standards still so as prices increase that will definitely create a ceiling in some way but i think what we re seeing more so is really our price increases vis a vis traditional site builders is much lower so we re actually getting homebuyers that maybe could have qualified for a state built home but they are moving in maybe they couldn t they now can t qualify for a site built home so they kind of moved into a more affordable price point home a more attainable home so generally as inflation happens and interest rate increases happen generally manufactured housing or off site construction does better than site built during those times so as we see the inflation and as we see this we anticipate gaining share versus site build over time so that s a positive note but we haven t seen any significant concerns yet there is we are watching it but we are not concerned yet on the fallout rates at lenders matthew bouley barclays analyst got it that s really helpful mark thank you for that second one on the margin side the north of 11 this quarter on ebitda margins obviously it s only three months but ahead of the call it soft long term goal of 10 on a full year basis is there any reason why that margin can t sustain a double digit rate year just given the volumes strength kind of in light of all the other puts and takes you re seeing on price versus cost thank you laurie hough executive vice president and chief financial officer hi matt so the 11 4 in that number we ve got to consider a couple of things we have the extra week in this fourth quarter so we were able to leverage more fixed costs with our production mark mentioned we had significant labor efficiencies from simplification of products so that certainly will continue barring any more significant than we ve seen labor challenges but in the fourth quarter we did see a benefit from forest product cost which sounds kind of odd but the way that we price our forest products is based on market futures and looking at those futures versus our backlog and so we saw those features and priced accordingly but then the cost actually dipped slightly that s not going to continue going forward so we see our margins actually coming down because of those reasons from the 11 4 is it sustainable the 10 was actually our pre covid volumes and our volumes as mark had mentioned are higher so we have that impacting as well another component that s going to go into the ebitda margin is an increase in sg a from our digital offerings and investment in our direct to consumer platform matthew bouley barclays analyst okay really helpful thank you laurie and thanks mark mark yost president and chief executive officer yeah thanks matt operator thank you our next question is from the line of mike dahl with rbc capital markets please proceed with your question christopher kalata rbc capital markets analyst hi this is christopher kalata on from mike thanks for taking our questions my first question i was wondering if you guys seen any kind of tangible evidence of your kind of customer base broadening out particularly on the traditional site built builder side given some of the struggles they are having to kind of complete homes have you seen any of the recent demand strength come from that part of the market and also do you have any update on the genesis rollout mark yost president and chief executive officer yeah thank you i think two things one is the on the site built side we re just seeing recently site builders pause construction because of high material costs we have not with our cost structure we are not we re still very affordable and still producing so i think that switch is yet to happen i think it s too early in the stage to see much of that switch as builders continue to pause production in construction activity because of high costs we re able to still produce and make margin even at these lower price point levels so it s a more effective cost structure for us than most site builders have so i think that that transition will happen but it s going to take a handful of months before people really start flowing from one side to the other in at least a significant number on the genesis side there has definitely been a tremendous amount of interest and activity on that the challenge for us is just to still increase output to meet the demands and make sure we have adequate supply for those site builders so adding capacity and adding allocations for builders is really the primary focus it s not so much a demand issue as it is a supply issue to make sure we can get them acute supply in genesis but the product itself is has been very well received christopher kalata rbc capital markets analyst understood thanks for that and in terms of demand trends by channel has there been any notable differences between retail and the community channel mark yost president and chief executive officer no i think community at the beginning of the pandemic community channel softened i would say they returned and probably returned with a little bit more vigor recently than even retail retail was strong kind of initially out of the pandemic i would say both channels are adequately strong and i believe that the community channel probably has a little bit more momentum currently than even the retail channel today so it s just a very strong outlook for housing demand i think the affordable price point housing is particularly attractive in today s market with the inflationary pressures and concerns over interest rate increases christopher kalata rbc capital markets analyst understood thanks for taking my questions mark yost president and chief executive officer thank you operator thank you our next question is from the line of phil ng with jefferies please proceed with your question philip ng jefferies analyst hey guys good morning congrats on another strong quarter on pricing laurie i think it said you mentioned that pricing growth may moderate a little bit going forward so from a high level have you taken enough pricing to offset all the inflation we re seeing you called out maybe supply constraints i would imagine your suppliers are pushing more price i just want to get a little more color on that and the ability to kind of stay in front of inflation and drive margins through this year laurie hough executive vice president and chief financial officer hi phil yeah i think that we have seen we are taking price increases to offset the majority of inflation to be perfectly honest commodities are really volatile as i m sure everybody on the call has been so we re doing the best we can based on the information that the future show and just keeping an eye on it so we are integrating the scotbilt acquisition and have also their backlog that s going to be flowing through that were pre acquisition pricing so that s just another component of price and margin coming through in the next couple of quarters philip ng jefferies analyst okay that s helpful the constraints you re calling out in meeting demand in 2q and 3q it sounds like it s getting better at least on your end from a production standpoint and issues more getting supply from your getting material from your suppliers any color when your production levels will get to an optimal level on your end and any of the mothball facilities that you have that you re potentially considering bringing on just kind of help meet that strong demand mark yost president and chief executive officer yeah thanks phil i think we are anxiously looking at bringing on some of our idle facilities really the limitation there primarily is supply chain driven today we want to make sure we have adequate materials to operate those plants effectively so we feel very good the onboarding process we ve done this year has been has been improved has been better our training and our people have been doing a great job so i think all of those some of those internal processes they are not where they need to be i think there is always room for improvement but the team has done an exceptional job at doing and simplifying some of the operating processes we have internally so i feel very good about the ability to ramp production as long as we have adequate materials to operate so when we see a break in the supply chain i think we will be looking to bring on more capacity because we see affordable housing demand is in very needed supply philip ng jefferies analyst and on that note mark in terms of bringing on some of these mothball capacity one is it really capital intensive how are these facilities from a state operational level and i don t know if they have been idle for a long time and then lastly on the supply side from a material standpoint you kind of talked about a few of them are these mostly material that were impacted from the texas storm because i think you called out some of the pvc polyethylene type material which might have been more impacted but anymore color on what type of material you are seeing a little more constraint in general thanks mark yost president and chief executive officer yeah thanks phil i think on the idled plants that we re looking to restart i think it s fairly lean capital to get them restarted we do anticipate having one or two of those plants restarted with some automation capabilities so the lead time on that may be a little different but to get capacity to the market quickly i think we will restart facilities with very low capex levels and then as we put in automation into some of our facilities that will take a little longer be a little bit more expensive but nothing that s from our standpoint crazy i think it s laurie what s our normal capital to open up a facility is laurie hough executive vice president and chief financial officer 3 million to 4 million mark yost president and chief executive officer 3 million to 4 million it s fairly low philip ng jefferies analyst got it and then on the material side i m sorry good ahead mark mark yost president and chief executive officer yeah on the material side we re definitely seeing allocation issues from the as you mentioned the petrochemical side and that s lingering it s starting to clear up in certain functions but it has a cascading effect and i think some of that cascading effect is we destocked the supply chain the entire supply chain to such a level that any other hiccups will create challenges in that so i think it s definitely on the petrochemical side and that will kind of linger throughout a portion of the year a little longer than we anticipate because at least maybe initially anticipated just because they re having a difficult time finding labor bringing people back as well in certain functions and they have to repopulate or restock the supply chain in general but i think it s other items like insulation and other products that have longer lead times to bring on capacity are going to also be part of that solution you can t start up a fiber glass plant for instance in immediate time period and ramp up capacity quickly so some of those longer lead time items are also going to be more on the allocation side philip ng jefferies analyst okay that s great color mark really appreciate it mark yost president and chief executive officer thank you operator thank you at this time i ll turn the floor back to mark yost for closing comments mark yost president and chief executive officer i d like to thank everyone for taking time and your interest this morning on skyline champion we look forward to continuing to solve the affordable housing crisis throughout and provide good quality and attainable homes for people across the country and in the u s and canada thank you for your interest stay safe and have a great day operator duration 42 minutes

just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now and chegg wasn t one of them that s right they think these 10 stocks are even better buys see the 10 stocks stock advisor returns as of may 11 2021 this video was recorded on may 19 2021 david gardner risk a lot of people talk about it but especially in the investment world i ve never found that talk very satisfying first of all how do you how do i how do they define risk what does it even mean to say that s a risky stock the definitions are often unclear then some analysts in the risk section of their stock report will say stuff like medium as in this is a medium risk stock what does that mean well about a decade ago i developed a 25 point risk rating system that we ve used at rule breaker investing ever since i defined risk well at least what that word means to me as an investor and we went on not just to put a word to the riskiness of the stock not just a word like medium but to go on to put a number on that stock s risk a number to give you a much more specific understanding and that number is itself based on 25 questions asked of the stock you know what we re going to cover the whole thing this week joined by my two friends alicia alfieri and maria gallagher we three are going to teach you the entire system help you rate stocks yourself along the very important dynamic of risk only on this week s rule breaker investing welcome back to rule breaker investing well it was a busy week last week especially on this podcast it was my delight to bring you a road less traveled in ten and a half chapters which i started writing at 11 00 am last tuesday morning 9 309 words later that is by the way a 36 page paper if you re doing 250 words double spaced single page i didn t know that i was going to write a 36 page paper that i presented on last week s podcast to you about the future but that was a delight i was saying to friends that if i had been told ahead of time that in order to do that podcast last week i would need to write a 36 page paper i would not have done a podcast last week but i m really glad that i did and i hope that you enjoyed it i hope that it opened your eyes and i hope you have some measure of understanding about my excitement about this podcast going forward we even did a weekend extra last week lead a more interesting life and i hope you enjoy that short story for those who gave us a little time on their weekend but here we are back to brass tacks back to the business of investing in this podcast last month s mailbag from chicago i hope you re listening you challenged me to do more investing you said i was doing a little bit too much storytelling and other things and i agreed with you i said i think this podcast needs to remember its roots sometimes admittedly it s been a very distracting last few weeks but with that said i wanted to revisit risk ratings i told you in that mailbag that we would do with this month and here i am this week with two friends to go over risk assessing risk in your investing well in just a few minutes i m going to be joined by two of my favorite analysts at the motley fool alicia alfieri and maria gallagher and we re going to talk through my 25 point risk rating system but before we do that let me just lay down some introductory material first of all if you enjoy what we do this weekend you find yourself wanting more of it i did a series it was a risk month march of 2016 on this podcast if you want we did it in three consecutive podcasts you can google it rule breaker investing risk ratings and you will see the series of three podcasts that i ve done it was with two example companies one of which got bought out subsequently it s not even public anymore but it takes you through the same material probably with little different language and with some extra companies if you find yourself really enjoying this week s podcast and you crave more of it just google it and you will find that past series which should still feel pretty fresh assessing risk in your investing i said at the top a lot of people don t really define risk i feel like i owe it to you my listener for you to know how i define risks and how i ve used it for rule breaker investing over the year here s my rather simple definition of risk to me risk and equity investing when you buy a stock is that you would lose a substantial portion of your capital here right here in this stock that you re looking at that you re thinking of buying that you ve just bought that you would lose a substantial portion of your capital held over a meaningful portion of time let s think of that as a minimum of three years to me risks in the stock is that i would actually lose let s say get cut in half maybe i would lose a lot of my money and nevertheless have held it for several years which hurts even more because you tied that capital up over time and you did poorly with it that s how i think about risks and what a risky stock is our system to measure risk is designed to fare it out which are stocks that could happen in a more likely way than other stocks which are the risky stocks and which are the safe ones i mentioned at the top my distaste for the phrase medium i ve never known what it means when somebody tells me the stock s risk is medium from the beginning i wanted to help investors think not about risk as a word or some kind of continuum that s a label i far prefer in this case numbers about a decade ago we hatched a system i m going to explain that right now we re going to do the why the what and the how i m telling you about the why right now why i think it s helpful to know what is the risk of a stock especially for you as a new investor i hope this particular episode will really help the new investors open your eyes to how to think about really understand why one stock is riskier or not than another that is a goal the why should be fairly clear i think risk is important you should be able to think about it at a stock by stock basis you should be able to think about it on a portfolio level basis when you reduce it to numbers you really can in a much more helpful way that was why i was dissatisfied with other people s definitions of risk and by sometimes the sloppy language around it so we built this system that s the why here s the what what is the system well as i ve mentioned it s a 25 point system now if you are an existing rule breakers or stock advisor member of any vintage you will recognize that every stock that i pick as we ve put them in over the years you ll see our 25 point risk rating included with that stock pick there is ample homework for you to do if you d like to go back and relearn this run it yourself or look at the risk ratings for any of our past picks they re right up there but let me say a little bit more about this simple 25 point system first of all it is simple really and i designed it that way ultimately so that you and i could use it anybody could use it you don t need to be a professional analyst at the motley fool as my two talented guests are you should be able to do this yourself you re asking yourself a simple question with a yes or a no you re going to ask 25 questions and of course they re the same 25 questions for the most part for every stock that you are looking at you are going to go through the list that s what we re going to do for the majority of this week s podcast is go through that very list with two example companies with my two analyst friends now anytime the answer to that question is no that is risky or riskier as we go through 25 questions if we end up saying no 10 times in one of these companies that is exactly its numbers spoiler alert i already know the risk rating of both of our stocks if we say 10 no s then that means it s a 10 on the risk rating system the higher the number the higher the risk if one stock has a risk of 17 that means we said no 17 times if another has just five then we said no only five times and five is a lot safer than 17 i hope that s simple to follow the higher the number the higher the risk in general we don t like risk i would far rather make a lot of money as an investor taking no risk i bet you would too again our definition of risk is that you would lose a substantial portion of your capital held over a meaningful portion of time that is not good yes the lower the risk generally the happier i am holding the stock and here s a little secret a lot of people think that risk equals reward but what i ve learned is that that is not true you can actually find stocks that are lower risks that have greater rewards and that itself is rule breaking and part of why we do what we do to close with the what it s a 25 point system we ask the same 25 questions every no is a 1 that s bad the higher the number the higher the risk by the way while you can do this stock by stock and i would encourage those who really get into this to do that stock by stock you can apply this to any stock for people who are really into it i want to point out you can actually measure the risk of a group of stocks or your portfolio dear listener all you do is take the risk of each of your stocks then multiply by the percent allocation that you ve given of your portfolio to that stock and you could estimate the risks of your portfolio again if you get really into our conversation this week there s more for you well with all of that said i now want to welcome my friends alicia alfieri and maria gallagher alicia and maria welcome maria gallagher hi thanks so much for having us alicia alfieri yeah so glad to be here gardner as am i and it s a delight to have you both alicia i believe this is your debut on the rule breaker investing podcast you and i have done a number of motley fool live events together maria this is certainly not your debut on the motley fool investing podcast because you have been a market cap game show star among other appearances anyway it s so great to see your smiling faces we re going to have fun this week talking through i don t know is this fun risk is that fun well before we start let me turn first to maria maria could you briefly introduce yourself and the company that you ll be taking through our risk rating system gallagher of course hi everyone my name is maria gallagher i ve been at the fool for almost three years now the company i m going to talk about i have been a user of it s called chegg chgg 1 19 for people who aren t familiar with it it was founded as a go to place for textbook purchases and rentals and then amazon came into this space and chegg did this really great job of pivoting and going into more service offerings tutoring citations math answer help etc taking over what a lot of people used yahoo answers for in a subscription based model they ve done it really well and i m excited to talk more about chegg as the podcast goes on gardner we will certainly be doing that maria thank you so much for joining me this week really looking forward to it i ll mention that both of these stocks are active recommendations chegg is a motley fool rule breaker recommendation alicia will be mentioning her company in a sec that s a stock advisor pick our two example companies are active recommendation stocks that i like today going forward for at least the next three years and we ll find out their risks together this week let me now move to alicia alfieri alicia a delight to have you with your debut on the motley fool rule breaker investing podcast welcome who are you what is your company alfieri well i m so glad to be here i started at the fool in september so i m a pretty new fool and i m working on the stock advisor rule breakers and the ownership portfolio i have brought you to talk about the toro company ttc 2 61 some people might be familiar with toro from the residential lawn and gardening equipment but they do so much more than that they also design manufacture and market professional landscaping equipment golf course maintenance equipment irrigation systems and underground construction equipment gardner part of what i love is the real contrast between these companies we ve got basically an online education company and the company that gives you your snowblower or your robo mower for your golf course for those of us who work on golf courses we have a wide enough listenership i m quite sure we have people who are using both chegg and toro possibly more than i am every day these are very different companies one of them is a dynamic recent education player the other a long standing american brand that s a leader in its categories but both tech savvy without further ado maria and alicia let s get started my job as mc is to queue up what each of our 25 questions is and then you will dutifully give the answer for your company and any color that seems necessary sometimes these are simple numbers not a lot of color other times nuance we should discuss we ll do both the first five questions are from the category the company these five questions are about the company by the way some of our other sections are the financials the competition the stock and a few others we ll cover at the end but these are bucketed up the first five are questions about the company question no 1 a yes or no question from our rule breaker investing risk rating system turning now chegg and maria profitability maria was the company profitable during the previous quarter and past 12 months gallagher the quick answer is no as of march 2021 chegg was operating at a loss of about 65 million gardner i think that a company that isn t making money is this crazy is riskier than a company that is making money unfortunately for chegg we have to give a no turning now to alicia alicia the toro company was the company profitable during the previous quarter and past 12 months alfieri yes and yes for their most recent 12 months they had net profits at 371 million and for their most recent quarter they also had profits they re at 111 million gardner excellent the question is written as alicia and maria just underline not just about like the last quarter did they make money but also the last 12 months but both you can t just have made money the last 12 months but if you ve lost money in the last quarter that also matters to us if you can t say yes basically to both of those then it s a plus one no keeping active score here i see chegg s a no that makes it a 1 i see toro s a yes that makes it a 0 let s move to question no 2 risk rating system question no 2 is about the cash flow turning chegg and maria maria was the company cash flow positive during the previous quarter and past 12 months gallagher this is a yes from chegg as of march 2021 they had about 140 million in free cash flow gardner really interesting and here we re highlighting the difference between reported profits but then the actual cash flows and of course if a company has cash flow as chegg does that makes it less risky than if it did not have cash flow i can probably guess for this one alicia but did the toro company was it cash flow positive during both the previous quarter and past 12 months alfieri well so i m giving partial credit here for the fiscal year end yes but for the last quarter no they were down a bit gardner when we actually ran these numbers for the toro company it was a little while ago i m not sure we knew that most recent reported quarter i counted it as a yes we re going to call it a yes for our purposes here which means that chegg is still at 1 toro still at 0 but wow you can imagine a year of covid even for big in this case more industrial companies a lot of challenge and yet toro has held up pretty well at least well enough for us to give them a 0 here let s move to question no 3 friends about the companies this is about the company s brand turning to maria and chegg maria does the company s business rely on recognizable branding that is truly valued by its buyer base gallagher yeah for chegg that s really important for them because they need to consistently be top of mind for students a pretty interesting statistic i found is that in 2018 the brand awareness for chegg in college students was about 80 so it s a really widely known brand and i think that that s one thing that has a strong competitive advantage for it gardner really well put that is a key factor for our thinking about chegg and of course this question is important because if a brand of a company is not particularly known or valued by its buyer base that sounds riskier to me than if there is an existing brand relationship alicia toro brand is it recognizable and truly valued by its buyer base alfieri yes they have an impressive catalog of several well known brands they have a toro for turf maintenance snow management landscaping equipment ditch witch for some of their underground and utility construction which is irrigation programs and lawn boy for their residential mowers gardner a bunch of brands and in different categories and yes sure enough that is a strength therefore a less risky proposition very happy to give yes answers for both of these companies to brand let s move next to no 4 we ve had a lot of yeses so far only a single no chegg still standing at 1 toro at 0 as we hit question 4 which is about diversification maria has chegg diversified its buyer base so that no single customer accounts for more than 20 of its revenue gallagher i m coming back in with another yes chegg because it s mostly bought by students and actually had 5 8 million paid customers in 2019 so they have a very diversified user base gardner this is a really again an important consideration around the risk of an enterprise i ve lived it myself the motley fool has had a few different business models over our 27 years once we were a largely ad driven and ad reliant we were a free website back in the late 1990s and we only had a few customers our big advertisers when all of a sudden 2001 hit a lot of bad things hit in 2001 and some of our advertisers said you know what we re not in this quarter boy did that hurt our business quite a lot these days much later much happier to say we have a broad diversified base of subscribers and we hope nobody would ever cancel any of our services but if you did it would not endanger our enterprise in the same way that one big advertiser for us back then or somebody who does 20 or more of your business well that does add risk back in glad to note that about chegg i can probably make a guess about toro but this is not about guesses alicia this is about truths and answers alicia has toro diversified its buyer base so that no single customer accounts for more than 20 of its revenue alfieri yes they have they sell through a network at 68 domestic and 140 international distributors and they sell through equipment dealers hardware retailers online direct to consumer a big yes here gardner that is awesome that brings us to the final of our five questions about the company itself again we ve reviewed profitability cash flow brand and diversification our 5th and final question about the company for our risk rating system turning now to maria and chegg is about raving fans now this one s subjective a number of our questions are subjective and how your answer might be different from how i answer which by the way gives us different risk ratings which is i think an important point that i might make later on but back to raving fans maria does chegg receive a positive word of mouth from its customers gallagher for this question i try to find as much wisdom of the masses as i can and for chegg it landed me in a lot of subreddit groups for different college majors and i would say that a very enthusiastic yes from a lot of subreddit users specifically in engineering has a very positive yes for chegg in that section gardner that is awesome thank you for that again you can imagine why as people rate the risk of enterprise which is what we re all doing together this week you can imagine why having raving fans makes a company much more stable in my mind than having the opposite let s move now to the toro company alicia does toro have a positive word of mouth overall from its customers alfieri yes they do actually i m really excited because i think this is going to be expanding for them in the future they have a deal with pga frisco and pebble beach resorts for toro branded equipment to maintain the golf courses of every major championship tournament in 2021 plus they were named the official turf equipment and irrigation provider for the ryder cup through 2029 we think we re going to see them to continue with this in the future which is really exciting gardner that s wonderful and that ll probably help grow brands as well in addition to the raving fans we finished our company s section i count chegg with one i count toro with 0 these numbers are going to go higher but at least these five questions we aim at the company we find very satisfying many many yeses let s next move to the financials now we have five questions about the financials the first one question no 6 concerns the growth of the enterprise maria with chegg did the company grow its sales by 10 to 40 annualized over the past three years gallagher the answer for chegg is yes it shifted its business model like i said earlier from that capital intensive textbook rental to digital learning platform and so you can see that really tick up in the revenue in 2017 there was less than 1 growth but then 2018 and on there was over 20 growth with the most recent quarter of up to 59 8 growth as of march 2021 gardner this is again something that intentionally i d like to take a little bit of a longer view rather than just zoom in on any one year keep in mind a lot of analysts just zoom in like one quarter which i especially don t think is that wise i like to look at the three year story turning now to toro and alicia alicia is this company growing its sales helpfully between 10 and 40 annualized for the past three years alfieri well they re more of a slow but steady grower when we look at the yearly totals on their own so 2019 revenue grows really tip the scales at nearly 20 but 2018 and 2020 were both below 10 gardner we have our first no for toro which ties these companies 1 to 1 so far on risk i just want to add before we move to the next one that i like a healthy amount of sales growth i think that shows companies are innovating often they re not cyclical i prefer companies that grow naturally and don t rely on cycles if companies are either below that 10 or a subtle point over 40 where there s a lot of expectations and a lot of crazy sales going there are lots of exciting sales stories but that actually creates in my mind more risk as well if a company has a really high sales growth rate because there are often market expectations baked in that that will continue and often it may not so that adds more risk i hope it s clear why we have that banded number 10 to 40 as that s the safer less risky band to be growing your sales which sure enough we want you to be growing your sales for most of the stocks we re going to invest in let s move on to no 7 this is about the independence of a company financially maria and chegg can this company operate its business in the next three years without relying on external funding gallagher i remember thinking about this one i had a little bit i wasn t quite sure i put down yes because it generates strong free cash flow as much more asset light than it once was but it is becoming more and more acquisitive which i think is important to note here and it conducted two follow on offerings it does have it boosted cash position through a follow up offering and convertible notes issuance in 2018 and new convertible notes issuance in november of 2020 it currently has about 1 8 billion in cash which should be enough for the next couple of years but i wanted to note that i thought about it a little bit more with those follow on offerings as well as they re acquisitive strategy moving forward which will be more capital and cash intensive gardner well and thank you very much for that nuance it s worth pointing out that while we re giving a binary yes or no in order to arrive at a final score that s a number which i think is a strength of the system at the same time there are subjective considerations and somebody who is smart and knows this stuff like maria can look at it and say well it s not necessarily a simple yes or no some of the time you just heard about a company that s grown through acquisition where sometimes some companies become dependent on that and therefore become riskier because if they don t find a good acquisition or don t do it well that can hurt the company and your chances with the stock we re going to give chegg a yes there and say because of that big cash balance and it is cash flow positive it can operate without needing external funding but sure enough it has drawn on some of that as maria pointed out we ll give chegg another yes let s turn our sites now to the toro company and alicia can this company operate its business without relying on external funding alfieri yes but i ll mention here that they did utilize a credit facility which is essentially a line of credit partially out of precaution during covid but they ve already paid that back which was smart and shows that the company s commitment to paying down debt is really there gardner thank you for pointing that out both of these are nuanced and dear listener if you are more conservative than i am or than we are you might actually say i m going to say no on that one which would give you a slightly different score than mine which i think is the strength of this system there is subjectivity that you bring we re going to be very explicit about that in about 15 questions or so but some of the risks aren t actually about the stock it s about you and what you know or what you think there is subjectivity and i like that about our system but we re going to stay tied at chegg 1 toro 1 as we move to question no 8 which is about financial disclosure maria does chegg maintain a high standard of disclosure consistent with sec guidelines in the united states gallagher it s a quick and easy yes for chegg and i don t have much else to add for that one gardner let s keep moving then alicia would you say the same of the toro company alfieri yes gardner why does this matter well i don t like to read through really complicated financials i sometimes think i m going to be the last to figure out things are going wrong if i m reading really complicated financial statements i do mention the sec guidelines in the united states of america because i do think that america is among i won t say the best sometimes we americans think we re better than we are but i will say we re among the world highest standards for transparency and full and fair disclosure sometimes we ding some foreign companies if we feel as if they are not reporting to the same high standards that i demand as somebody who s trying to figure out the financials we re going to give yeses to both of these companies but sometimes we give no s let s keep moving question no 9 continues that theme of transparency maria would ant intermediate level investor that s always how i think of me and probably a lot of us listeners think there s more we could learn we re not experts but we re also not beginners would an intermediate level investor find the company s financial statements and management ownership disclosures relatively easy to sift through and understand gallagher yes i think chegg and i might talk about this a little bit later with their management team i really respect their management team sometimes when you read these disclosures there s so much jargon even when the company is pretty straightforward and pretty simple they say so many words i feel like i m googling every 3rd word for no reason that s definitely not the case of chegg i really admire the way management is very straightforward and the way they talk about what the company does and their vision of it for the future gardner thank you alicia similarly as intermediate level investors do we find the financial statements and management disclosures readable alfieri yes and i would say that both their financial statements and their earnings call give really good color to their earnings to help you understand the moving pieces behind the numbers which is so important gardner i like that you both have spoken to management here because transparency is the title of this question question no 9 for the risk rating system but a lot of this is about the leadership of the company and their communication ability and willingness and that really does count for a lot as you could imagine since we re assessing risk companies that you would not be able to say yes to companies that are not transparent or communicate very poorly either on their earnings calls or to the world at large yeah that would be riskier if companies are like that very happy to be able to say yes to both of these and so far these seem like really safe stocks maria and alicia i think that s not going to be fully the case but my running count here is still 1 for chegg and 1 for toro let s move to the final of our financials questions we call this one well managed now i would love it maria maybe if you d speak to this a little bit this is not a ratio we use that frequently on this show you don t necessarily have to give us the chapter and verse textbook but not everybody may know return on equity or what that is but here s what we re asking for well managed over the most recent fiscal year did the company report a return on equity of 15 or higher first of all yes or no for chegg gallagher it s a no from chegg it was about 7 gardner you want to throw us any color or explain what s going on there gallagher yes of course with return on equity it reveals how much profit a company earned in comparison to the total amount of shareholder equity found on the balance sheet it s what us as shareholders own it s a really good level of profitability and understanding what that looks like for the company moving forward and in the past gardner very succinctly explained and without going too deep here it s in a way i think of it as well managed are you doing well with the resources accorded you what is your level of profitability off of the shareholders equity again this is more of an older school ratio not one i use very actively but when we re assessing risk i think this is a good quick look in that s a no for chegg what about the toro company alicia alfieri it s a big yes for the 12 months ending in january toro s roe was 35 5 this is slightly down from fiscal year 2019 which is 35 9 and also a little bit down from fiscal year 2018 gardner well thank you very much and let s call it right there for this section which was the financial where are we while we ve gone through 10 of our 25 questions some of them are quick and easy some of them are nuanced it s not always clear but i hope we re learning i hope you re learning right along with us if i ve been doing the math right after 10 questions i count chegg at 2 and toro at 1 we re about to move to our next section three questions that are now about the competition because surely you cannot know the risk of a company if you don t understand the competition that that company is having to think about or deal with either every day or in future potentially let s move now to the competition maria question no 11 is entitled underdog maria again this is the underdog question is chegg free of any direct competitors that possess substantially greater financial resources gallagher no competition is where we will have some conversations about chegg and where i had a little bit of pause with chegg and that it has a lot of competition in this space you have universities with massive types of endowments and a lot of money you have amazon you have free youtube videos and online resources and so you have the whole internet essentially at your fingertips and if you can t find a free answer then you might go to chegg but so they have a lot of competition especially in the space of people who have more resources than them specifically i think youtube gardner thank you and very true we had to give this one a no because there is a lot of substantial competition for an upstart like chegg let s move now to the toro company same question for you alicia is this company free of any direct competitors that have substantially greater financial resources alfieri this is also a no they have competitors including heavyweight caterpillar and deere gardner maria in her explanation gave us a range of a whole bunch of different competitors from the universities themselves to free online answers on youtube alicia for the toro company it s much more focused around big players as you mentioned like caterpillar for both of these companies we give a no that s in the loss column boosting chegg to a 3 and toro to a 2 now let s look at competition with question no 12 from the other direction is the company free of any disruptive upstarts that are visibly challenging its business model we call this the goliath question is this a lumbering giant that could or maybe is being actively disrupted by upstarts let s start with again maria and chegg what is your take on this one yes or no gallagher this is another no from me you see so much competition in this space because it s such a wide range you have competition from your friend s mom who used to be a teacher in this space and you pay her to help you you also have places online like the khan academy and you have places like coursera and so you have different upstarts groups free study groups that you build with your friends or things like that so you have so much once again just a lot of competition in this space both with a lot larger of a competition based and smaller as well gardner absolutely maria and especially because chegg to its credit has broken out of an initial textbook orientation and moved much more to adult lifelong learning across a number of different dynamics we can imagine yeah youtube is out there challenging maybe i should just watch a youtube video to figure out how to do this or that thing so there s no question that there is a lot of disruption in the online education space and that certainly has to ding chegg again do we still like the color yes this is an active recommendation on motley fool rule breakers but let s also eyes wide open know the risk and understand the competition which is what we re speaking to right now similarly alicia with toro is toro free of any disruptive upstarts visibly challenging its business alfieri no they re not there continues to be innovation in this space specifically in automation and in robotics but something really exciting here is that toro has done a really great job of using acquisitions as a way to broaden their offerings which we could talk about later gardner well that is true and that s part of our thesis and why we re excited about toro s because it is i hope anyway amply ready for an increasingly automated robotic world that we may be moving into with its big equipment it s not going to be disrupted we hope anyway because it is making some of the early stage acquisitions to be a leader in that space we ll see but for now we have to give both companies a no for both of our competition questions so far which has brought chegg to a 4 and toro to a 3 as i ask the 3rd and final question about the competition that would be question no 13 of our risk rating system which is entitled moat maria would potential new competitors face high economic technological or regulatory barriers to compete with chegg gallagher i had another no for chegg here but i do think this one is a little bit more nuanced once again there is an archive of 30 million expert questions five million textbook solutions access to 24 7 tutors and a consistent growth in an acquisition strategy they have easybib they have thinkable they do have quite an expansive category but i do think that in terms of the way the question is i always go to if i m a new competitor do i have these really high barriers to entry i don t really think they do but i do think that chegg has a head start in all of their offerings but i think if new companies come in the textbooks don t need to be exclusive with chegg they don t have that incentive the universities don t need to be exclusive in that way it doesn t incentivize me to think that chegg is going to be this exclusive offering but i did want to note that they do have i d say a really big head start but i do think a company could catch up to them gardner i really appreciate again the nuances and your thinking and i agree with you i could imagine some people saying yes that they do have a good moat all of the existing answers that they have in their databases in the search ability in the accessibility is a substantial asset and yet i agree with you maria that that would not necessarily intimidate or stop anybody else from trying to build something similar i think that is the spirit of the question i m sorry to note it s no because i always want these to be yeses but i agree with you chegg is a no which means chegg gets a no for all three competition risk rating questions bringing its overall score up to 5 now the toro company a very different company alicia but what s your read here for toro would potential new competitors face a real barrier to entry to compete with toro alfieri this is a no as well though start up would have a bit of a hurdle in terms of getting their brand out there and creating partnerships and relationships with distributors that toro has but there are no high barriers to entry here gardner awesome i say awesome because i agree with the answer but i m always sad to have to give a no for both of these companies they get dinged for all three of our competition questions that brings the overall score at this point after 13 questions chegg is at 5 toro is at 4 now the next section three questions about the stock we re going to go quickly through these because these are just straight numbers pretty much and a lot of us especially long time listeners will already know what a market cap is so we don t have to explain let s go to question no 14 the first about the stock chegg and maria maria does chegg have a market cap of 10 billion or more gallagher yes barely it s a 10 7 billion market cap gardner excellent similarly alicia does toro have a market cap of 10 billion or more alfieri yes it s 12 billion gardner wow both are actually quite near that cutoff and even that number is a big round number somebody else might prefer a different one i like 10 billion for me if a company is worth more than 10 billion in the public markets that feels safer like there s half there there are lots of employees there are lots of customers those are bigger and safer enterprises than smaller a little bit more fly by night in some cases a lot of people invested in very small micro cap stocks i almost never do but i think we can all agree that at a certain point you are big enough that you re a little bit of an unsinkable molly brown while i can t say that about chegg as i think about the company toro i do feel that but the market cap for these companies surprisingly similar interestingly enough but both over and so yeses so we re back to yes ville let s go to question no 15 i will briefly explain what this means and then maria and alicia will fill out their numbers question no 15 is about the beta of a stock basically this is the volatility of the stock one of my criticisms of other ways of measuring risk is a lot of people think that risky stocks are volatile stocks and they equate risk with volatility i hope that you dear rule breaker understand that our ideas fly in the face of that we do include volatility as a consideration right here with question no 15 the beta but a lot of people just think of a stock zooming up and down more than the market that s risk i completely disagree i think risk is about the chances you ll lose a lot of money after you hold a meaningful amount of time it s so much more about the fundamentals of the business and these 25 questions we re asking now we re going to zoom in right again on the beta number this is the percent the stock moves relative to the market s average movement if the s p 500 tends to move up let s say 10 a year and a company tends to move up 15 a year when the s p is down 10 this company s typically down 15 that would be a higher beta we would say that it has a beta of 1 5 it tends to move more than the market in both directions and you can express that numerically the number that we use here is a beta of 1 3 we re going to acknowledge as rule breakers that our stocks are typically more volatile than the average stock i tend to avoid cyclical stocks for these reasons i like to ask is a stock s beta rating over the past 12 months less than 1 3 i m going to get quick answers first and we could talk about a little bit more maria for chegg is its beta less than 1 3 gallagher yes it is 0 82 gardner wow so it moves less than the market averages it s less volatile or at least over the last 12 months has been than the market itself very interesting alicia what about the toro company alfieri yes as of yesterday it was 0 77 for the last 12 months gardner here again these radically different businesses are about the same size and are also kind of lower beta companies that surprises me i have to admit i wasn t speaking ahead and looking at the answers i couldn t remember but i m really interested to know both of these stocks move less than the market overall up and down now these are all averages and this is only over the last 12 months this is not something you should expect over the next 12 months or locked down in your mind but the intent of this question for our risk ratings fellow fools is that it s going to be riskier if a stock is flying all over the place than one that isn t too much maria would you like to add anything to that or to chegg gallagher actually i was very surprised by this i thought because when we initially looked at it i thought that the year of covid would have changed that because i think chegg was a company that people hadn t thought about and then covid brought it to the forefront and people thinking about online accessible education i was actually surprised i thought it was going to be higher when i looked at it because it s a stock that has moved a lot over the past year or two gardner i too am surprised by that alicia i have to say i m not as surprised that a staunch or more industrial company like the toro company even though there are some hi tech aspects that interest us that it would be a lower beta stock alfieri yeah i would agree with you i wasn t very surprised either just because again they ve been around forever slow steady growers gardner all right let s move onto the 3rd and final question we asked about the stocks and that is the question about the price to earnings ratio now i m not going to redefine the p e ratio a lot of our listeners will know that like the back of their hand others are still new to investing we don t have time to really dwell on this other than to say that we like to see a positive price to earnings ratio because that means the company actually has earnings which will be safer and less risky but we d like it to generally be within a reasonable range we re going to say here below 30 the question that we asked of our stocks as we rate their risk by the way is it going to be a good stock or not we ve had some amazing stocks with very high priced earnings ratios this is measuring the risks that s what we re doing this week maria and chegg does this stock have a positive price to earnings multiple less than 30 gallagher no it has 55 times next 12 month earnings per share ratio gardner wow that s a big number by the way keeping score at home and i m keeping score right here that brings chegg up to a 6 on our risk rating points systems so far through 16 questions alicia what about the price to earnings ratio of the toro company alfieri it s not less than 30 but it was positive when i initially did my research it came in at 30 6 so just above gardner wow so close again you could have fudged that if you want and the whole spirit of the system i hope our listeners are picking up this week if any of us can pick up and use this if you don t like to round numbers you d like to drop fractions then you could say yes for this one but we gave it a no both of these companies have higher priced earnings ratios which adds in an element of risk sure enough it will because if companies trade at high multiples if they stub their toe or if something shows up i don t know like covid for some businesses that can really hurt them and if they have high valuations high multiples then you could expect that stock to get hit harder sometimes for longer that is always going to be true of higher p e stocks even though i favor a lot of them of course these are both active recommendations keeping score at home we re into our final nine questions a couple of them are very subjective we ll have some fun in a sec but we have chegg at 6 and toro at 5 totally different businesses but somewhat similar interesting to note that let s move onto our next two questions this is about management we re looking for the founders we re looking at the people of this enterprise in the eye question no 17 founder maria do any of the founders of chegg still have at least a 5 stake in the company gallagher no the founders are no longer involved and the current ceo has 1 6 of the shares outstanding and everyone else on the management team and within the board has less than one gardner wow we ll talk about that in a sec but alicia the toro company do any of the key insiders still have at least 5 stake alfieri i m glad you left out founders because the companies started back in 1914 i believe so none of them are still involved also sadly none of the named executive officers have at least 5 share unfortunately they have about 0 42 gardner all right again does this mean they ll be good stocks or not no this one question this one factor is among many others and what we re doing now is we re estimating the risk of our companies i would say it is riskier if there s not a lot of skin in the game at the management level or to alicia s point among key insiders because sometimes even though a company may have started a long time ago like walmart there might still be substantial family ownership which in my mind reduces the risk of companies i like to see multi generational succession some of our best stocks i think of old dominion freight line is a great example of this on the public markets a trucking company a market bidder for us in motley fool stock advisor in one of those comments you could say that even though it started a long time ago i think it s fair to say maria and alicia that typically companies where you can say yes to this the founder like jeff bezos is still going to be active even if he s not going to be ceo later this year he still owns a big stake which makes us feel a little bit safer about our own so sorry to give no s to both of our companies there bringing chegg up to a 7 toro to a 6 we have one other question about management in our risk rating system and it s about the experience of the top three officers maria do the top three officers at chegg have more than 15 years of combined leadership at this company gallagher yes and i just wanted to talk a little bit about dan rosensweig who is the ceo i really admire him and i talked about this a little bit earlier but he s been at the company since 2010 he came from leading the guitar hero part of activision blizzard and history at yahoo he led them through their shift and their business model has led through a lot of successful acquisitions he earned a 92 approval rating on glassdoor and the whole company gets 4 2 stars an 87 recommended to a friend just listening to him on conference calls and reading interviews with him i think he s really passionate about where chegg can go i think he s really honest and i think he s had a really impressive track record of saying what we ve been doing hasn t been working we re not going to compete with amazon the way we maybe could have in 2005 so let s do something different and let s do it well i really admire him so that s a big yes for me gardner thank you you can see the manager reflected in the number of these questions the ones we ve already covered raving fans that often have quite a lot to do with the management of the company or the transparency of disclosure also a factor that the dan rosensweigs of the world will either influence for good or for ill glad to hear they get a yes in terms of experience i hear you re on the glassdoor ratings that s a factor for some people s consideration certainly as well let me now turn to alicia and the toro company alicia at the toro company do the top three officers have more than 15 years of combined leadership at the company alfieri yes and honestly the question is fulfilled by the ceo alone rick olson who joined the company over 34 years ago he spent time in nearly all of toro s divisions which i just love the cfo has been at the company since 2011 and the vp of global operations has been at the company since 2013 gardner thank you for that while this is a straight number answer again there is subjectivity there is something that each of us brings to the system because we re asking the top three officers that s even a choice that you make as somebody who s looking at stock which is the most important after let s say the ceo and the cfo for some companies it might be the chief technology officer or the chief information officer others might be chief marketing officer alicia you just rocked the who was it again alfieri the vp of global operations gardner there you go for a multinational company like toro that makes a lot of sense to me but it s a reminder that each of us brings our own experience and perspective as we rate the risk of a company so thank you for that i want to thank you both for yeses that always makes me happier with this system we move into two specialized questions which i ll explain now with chegg at 7 toro at 6 all right now motley fool rule breakers and motley fool stock advisor are two different services at the motley fool that have existed for a long time and they re a little bit different from each other for the 25 point system i have a service specific orientation slightly different questions actually for maria and alicia i will speak to these briefly first of all for the rule breakers there are two questions and this is for maria and chegg the questions are basically does a company meet the majority of our six rule breaker attributes the second question is is the company s future business prospects easily able to withstand binary outcomes let s for example imagine they get fda approval they don t get fda approval some companies are vulnerable to big binary outcomes and that could be true of rule breaker companies those are the two for rule breakers and i might as well go right to you maria and ask you does this company meet no 19 does this company meet a majority of the rule breaker attributes gallagher yes it has four of the six it does not have a first mover top dog or sustainable advantage but it does have strong past price appreciation good management and smart backing strong brand and called overvalued gardner i agree with you and so that s a yes here how is this company easily able to withstand any binary outcomes that might go against it gallagher yes i think this one is nuance because it does work within universities and it works within textbooks but because there is such a broad range if one textbook providers said we re never selling you another textbook i do think chegg would be able to still do well but it would not be unharmed i think that it s a yes with a little bit of nuance as well gardner thank you i appreciate both of those we re going to give two yeses keeping chegg s risk rating at 7 through these 20 questions now i m going to shift our focus over to more of a stock advisor orientation as a service stock advisor a little bit less focused on disruptive innovation a little bit broader it makes sense to me that chegg is in rule breakers and the toro company is in stock advisor so here are the two questions that we ask in stock advisor the first is we call it the stock advisor way we ve written some articles about how we think about things and stock advisor members should know the stock advisor way the question alicia no 19 for you is is this a solid business with proven management and a stalwart balance sheet yes or no alfieri well i do believe it is a solid business with proven management but when i did this analysis it did have some concerns in terms of the company funding some acquisitions with borrowings under credit facilities which are essentially lines of credit for the 12 months ending in january there is a net debt but they ve done a really good job at paying off debt and in fact they re dedicated to it gardner so i hear you there you re allowed to break the rules because we re all rule breakers anybody who s listening to this podcast is allowed to break the rules within reason people you are allowed to break rules you gave a half point on this one alfieri i did gardner so that s why we re going to give chegg we re going to bump it up to six and a half because you re right you do like the proven nature of this business and management team but a little bit of the financial flexibility is missing given the presence of debt on its balance sheet and a little bit of the reliance it has on that to grow so i hear you on the half point and so we re going to put it at chegg 7 toro 6 5 as we proceed to the final five questions now just as i kept an overview of those two i m going to do an overview for these final five in fact we re going to cheat a little bit because two of these you both already know two of these are always no let me speak to that briefly they re the same two questions asked every time their questions are no 21 and 25 here s why i ve programmed them always to be no because i didn t want to build a risk rating system that ended up saying zero if you gave yes is to everything the message to the world is now there s no risk there and that is absolutely silly there is risk in everything there s risk to crossing the street later today after you listen to this podcast there s always risk out there and i realize it s critical for us to have a positive number here the two questions no 21 and 25 21 is is this company fault free and fraud free in all its corporate statements and deeds do you know that to be certain and always will is this company this is the title of the question immaculate the answer is of course no we can never know there might be somebody cooking the books right now i hope not at either of these companies because they re our stock picks but there could be we just can never know what fraud might be out there or what fault the answer is always no and that s no 21 which bumps both of these companies chegg up to 8 and toro up to 7 5 and cheating forward to the final question can you be certain dear listener that the company you are looking at is invulnerable to external world or macroeconomic events such that you re sure you can get all your capital back and if we didn t just live through a year in which we all learned that there is no guarantee out there this is important for investors to know as well the title of question no 25 is bulletproof and the answer is no no company is bulletproof and you never know what s going to happen next that s a no pumping chegg to 9 and toro to 8 5 those are the two easy no s that we always give at the motley fool when we do our risk rating system that leaves us with the three final questions i want to ask you they re questions 22 23 and 24 23 and 24 is where our conversation lies for the rest of this podcast 22 i can give short shrift too it makes an important point that i especially hope each of you our dear listeners will take to heart because the question this is the only one of the 25 that isn t about the company or its management or its competition it s the question about you this is a funny one i hope you can embrace the right brained thinking the foolish capital f thinking here this question is about you and here s the question that you want to ask yourself as you look at a stock do i want to know more about this company am i willing to dig deeper learn more ask questions let s say on the motley fool discussion boards to actively try to understand this company now there is no pre programmed answer to that question because some of the time you re going to say yes yes i do want to know more about this company i love the company s products or i work at this company yes certainly but sometimes it might be a complicated or boring thing or somebody told you about and you d be like i have to admit in my heart of hearts no i m not really willing to dig deeper or learn more here there s too many other things in the world that interest me more and sure enough if you re saying yes then that is a less risky stock for you isn t it that s a powerful and important point if you re saying no that is a riskier stock for you because you don t really want to spend much time looking at it that makes it riskier for you that s why question 22 is entitled you i ll ask maria and alicia for the fun of it here maria are you inspired to learn more about chegg you personally yes or no gallagher yes gardner you certainly lived it you ve bought from the company you are old enough no longer to be in college but you re young enough to only be a few years out of college or so and you have direct experience with this company and you are also like me fascinated by the internet and buy all disruptive innovation happening out there i don t mean to put words in your mouth but i agree with you i m a yes for this one too let me turn it over to alicia i don t know what you re going to say about this one alicia are you personally interested in toro willing to dig deeper and learn more in toro not everybody is alfieri i m glad that my answer will surprise you it s yes i am very interested in this company i love the idea of automation and robotics in this industry gardner i feel the same way when you filled out this risk rating which is what each of you as analysts do for every one of our stock research reports i felt the same way you did because i find myself i always love great american brands and companies that stood the test of time founded in 1914 you said alicia but i especially love it when they are potentially transformational stages they have the r d and the tech savvy and a willingness to acquire to adapt and evolve as the world changes and sure enough for snow blowing and mowing and all yes we can make robots do it at night and yes this company gets it and i m excited about that i found myself interested but question no 22 you dear listener you might say yes or no depending on who you are and we think that that makes the stock riskier or not for you all right our final two questions are the most interesting questions out of the 25 point risk rating system because speaking of you they are the two best questions that you personally bring to this analysis now this is a way to tailor the analysis because there s some cookie cutter going on here and i think in a good way same 25 questions basically yes no yes no score everything have a number at the end there s a lot of cookie cutters there is a process driven thing that i like about this system but i also wanted to make sure it s dynamic enough to adjust for the questions that you think are unique or interesting that should be answered to understand this company s risk better then if they weren t asked it was just a generic set of cookie cutter questions questions no 23 and 24 and i ll start with maria are basically ask and answer the most insightful question you can come up with that s no 23 no 24 is ask and answer the 2nd most insightful question that you can come up with and subtlety of the system which we won t delve into too much here is that since you re asking the question you can angle it depending on how you ask it to a yes or a no which allows you as a professional which is what maria and alicia are to guide the final number to a number they think is appropriate depending on how you ask these questions you can move it up or down and that is by design let s now go right back to chegg maria asking answering the most insightful question you could come up with when you did this analysis about six months ago or so for chegg what was your most insightful question gallagher my question was snap tests if the company is gone in five years would consumers no longer be able to succeed in school gardner i love that gallagher i did have to word it in a way that the answer was no because i was trying to get to the answer of no because as i said with all of my competitions being no i think that that is a big risk with chegg when we talk about that there are upstarts there are behemoths in this space there s a lot of free resources on the internet and there s accusations of people using these resources to cheat it s such a fragmented industry i wanted to really dial in on that and make sure that that was clear within my analysis that that is what i saw as the single biggest risk is that this very fragmented industry i worded it in a way if it s gone would people miss it probably but would they be able to no longer succeed in school would their outcome be completely demolished the answer to me is no and so that was my first question gardner i totally agree i think it s a beautiful question speaking of a book whose author i once featured on this podcast warren berger and his book a more beautiful question or the big book of beautiful questions both are great books about asking beautiful questions and i think that s one gallagher thank you gardner that you go into the snap tests and you angled it the right way and you gave it a no which brings chegg up to 10 on our risk rating system maria concluding what is your 2nd most insightful question about chegg gallagher this question for me was in the opposite vein what do i think was the single biggest risk then what do i think it s one of the single biggest checkmarks and green flags for this company until that question gardner did you say chegg mark did i hear you say that gallagher i didn t but i should have gardner that s amazing keeps going i see rick engdahl shaking his head he doesn t like bad puns gallagher that was amazing and i m upset i didn t think of it but so i said does the company have a management team that can lead it through more successful acquisition moving forward that s going to be a big part of their strategy and i think that the way they pivoted so far in the way that they ve acquired different ways to go outside of just high school and university and get more into that outside learning space get more into citations has been really thoughtful and led by a management team that i respect i wanted to also word that one in a way that i wanted to give that a yes because i do think that companies are just people and when you feel really strongly about the people i really like to highlight that within the questions i asked so that was a yes gardner i really appreciate that you looked at the heart of basically your thesis for and against with your two company specific questions no 23 in our system and no 24 the final tally for chegg is maria gallagher 10 gardner 10on our risk rating system which i would say is just outside quite safe and just within the realm of pretty safe which is an interesting thing to think because i think a lot of people would think chegg is this crazy online fly by night start up could it really work out and some of our best rule breaker picks people have thought that about the companies part of i think the secret of our approach to investing because we re looking at the business we re largely focused on business focused investing we look at the enterprise and say i actually don t think it s as risky as a lot of people might and that s led us to some great stuff we ll see if it works out or not for chegg but maria thank you for your analysis that you ve shared with us fully up and down 25 questions about chegg we re going to put 10 on it and tie a bow on it maria gallagher you rock gallagher thank you so much it was really fun gardner all right now we ll turn to alicia because we re going to close it out with your two best questions that you can ask as a risk rate of the toro company alicia no 23 what is the most insightful question that you can ask of this company alfieri sure my question was is this company operating in a strong recession proof or for today s times covid proof industry the answer to that was no they were impacted by covid the worst of their covid impact within their fiscal 2nd quarter when sales fell 3 4 and net earnings fell 14 8 but in studying this question they really won me over because of the things that they did they instituted cost cutting measures as i talked about before they took out a line of credit just in case because nobody knew what was going to happen with covid then also residential sales increased then they began to see the professional segment revenues really begin to recover as well while they re not recession proof or covid proof i think management is really creative with how they solve these problems which is so important i think for having a good management team gardner i agree you re speaking in a sense both sides of your mouth because you ve given them a no but you re also approving of them and i feel the same way i can see both of those for our purposes here do they operate in a strong recession proof ish sector the answer is no i agree with that that gives them a 1 taking them up to 9 5 now we just tied up on chegg with maria it was a 10 this puts toro at 9 5 i m curious the final question no 24 alicia what is your second most insightful question about toro alfieri well my second question was has the management acquisition strategy been strong and value added this is a really important question for toro the answer here is yes while acquisitions like we talked about before impacted debt levels the company is paying down its debt but also the acquisitions that they re going after are incredibly interesting they added charles machine works and what that really did is that opened up underground construction opportunities within 5g the installation of all that fiber it also sets toro up really nicely if there s a national investment in infrastructure also they ve had these really neat acquisitions in robotics and ai like we talked about it a little bit before they bought turflynx which is a developer of a fully autonomous electric mowing equipment for golf courses and it s going to be a game changer it s going to allow golf courses to prefer maintenance at any time and it s going to really lower those costs as well they also recently purchased left hand robotics a creator of a fully autonomous work bot that could mow grass clear snow and work as a tractor so really interesting here and exciting gardner i sure want some of those things walking around my property at night i think i do anyway now that is exciting and i like your yes and that brings the toro company to a final risk rating of 9 5 basically let s round it let s point out this is a fun fact this week that both of these companies are essentially right about the same risk rating 10 9 5 i think that s helpful especially for new investors to realize that even though one is 100 years old and the other is more like 10 years old and even though one of them is profitable and the other isn t and even though they operate in completely different industries overall we assess them at about the same level of risk that might be an eye opener for some this is a system that s really worked well for us though to assess risk and often to find some of the winning businesses that other people are missing let me say thank you to alicia for her analysis of the toro company alicia you rock alfieri thank you gardner well again thanks to my friends maria gallagher and alicia alfieri for their work on chegg and the toro company chegg ticker symbol chgg the toro company ticker symbol ttc i hope that we have contributed not just to your understanding of these two companies both i think interesting stocks to research if you hadn t already looked at them before but i hope we contributed to your general overall understanding and development as an investor especially if a lot of this material was new as i said at the top i did a full series on this five years ago maybe you heard it back then or maybe you re a stock advisor or a rule breakers member and you get these reports with every new recommendation that we ve done or maybe you re just a new listener and you re hearing this for the first time let me say a few things here at close the first is that this is a system that i developed about 10 years ago and even though in keeping with my announcement last week i will not be picking new stocks for rule breakers and stock advisor you should know that the team uses this system and i hope we ll continue to do so although i also want to say that i m not requiring anybody inside or outside the company to use this approach the motley fool may change its products services and or rating systems might change i m not locking anybody down to use this that s point no 1 point no 1 is the motley fool may change who knows point no 2 though is it s again it s for you here you go here are the 25 questions i use i will mention by the way that on the motley fool site both rule breakers and stock advisor they use the 25 point system but some of the questions are different than the ones we just covered this week that s because you can t automate some of the answers that we just gave some of the questions that maria and alicia asked can t be automated but at the fool we wanted to automate the system you re going to see a slightly different system online that you ve heard this week i hope that makes sense to you again an effort to automate and have automated risk ratings on site which are generally analogous to what you heard today but you could never really automate what we just all shared together in roughly an hour s time could you that s why point no 2 is this is for you and also from chicago this was for you too last two points point no 3 what we re really doing with this system is i think we re looking at the quality of companies yes on the face of it we re assessing the risk i defined risk at the start this week you now know how to score risks around companies i think that s a wonderful innovative breakthrough there aren t a lot of services or people who have real risk ratings on stocks they might have risk ratings on debt or risk ratings on their nfl fantasy draft but who has risk ratings for stocks i would say not nearly enough people i hope this has been a fun source view but what our system is really

thanks deb and good morning everyone fiscal 2021 was an unprecedented year and we were happy to end on a high note we believe the excellent execution of our strategy by the team in the development and deployment of our enhanced columbus mckinnon business system or cmbs were crucial to our success as markets have been recovering we have responded with agility to increasing customer demand as a result sales grew 12 sequentially to 186 million which was at the higher end of our updated guidance our team worked hard to drive efficiencies against headwinds as well fourth quarter adjusted operating margin was 10 1 compared with 10 7 last year our 80 20 tools continued to contribute to our earnings power 80 20 provided approximately 2 9 million in operating income in the quarter to help offset the headwinds that both covid and the supply chain presented despite the pandemic we were able to achieve a 11 8 million in contribution to operating income during fiscal 2021 while not as visible in the year because it offsets the operational headwinds associated with volume declines we expect our efforts to be rewarded as volume returns we generated 27 million of cash from operations during the quarter and nearly 21 million in free cash flow by year end we had dropped our leverage ratio to nearly 0 6 times in the wake of our recently successful debt refinancing which greg will address in a moment our net debt leverage ratio is about 3 4 times we expect to get that back down to our target ratio of 2 times within two years excluding any additional acquisitions a strong sequential increase in quarterly order flow drove backlog up 13 over the trailing fiscal third quarter and up 31 year over year as you look at slide 4 our focus on 2 0 led us to identify and pursue the acquisition of dorner manufacturing which we completed just following the end of the fiscal year this acquisition created an additional platform from which we can expand our intelligent motion solutions and higher growth end markets specialty high precision conveying puts us at the high at the center of the industrial automation equation backlog for dorner at the end of april more than doubled over the same time last year to nearly 40 million this is slightly ahead of our expectations when we closed the acquisition at the beginning of the month our organic efforts were successful as well and accelerated in contributions throughout the year despite the pandemic new product revenue or n minus 3 revenue which is revenue from products introduced in the recent three years was up 22 this is the second year in a row we have exceeded 20 growth with our vitality index i should point out that new product innovation is also key to dorner s growth we are prioritizing efforts to bring their ingenuity and precision conveying to a broader customer base while continuing to introduce new conveying solutions to the market with that let me turn it over to greg for a review of our financials greg gregory p rustowicz vice president finance and chief financial officer thank you david good morning everyone on slide 5 net sales in the fourth quarter were 186 2 million down 1 7 from a year ago as david noted this sales level was at the upper end of our updated guidance for fourth quarter revenue of approximately 184 million to 187 million we continue to see demand improved sequentially and our closing the gap to pre covid revenue levels this fourth quarter felt more like a normal fourth quarter as we saw stocking orders begin to return in our short cycle businesses looking at our sales bridge sales volume was down only 11 million or 5 8 we did realize positive pricing as we saw year over year pricing improvement by 1 foreign currency remains a tailwind and increased sales by 3 1 or 6 million let me provide a little color on sales by region for the fourth quarter we saw sales volume decline in the us by approximately 10 this was partially offset by price increases of 80 basis points non us sales volume was down approximately 1 which was more than offset by price increases of 1 2 and favorable foreign currency translation of 6 9 by region sales volume was down 16 in canada and down 19 in latin america but emea was down less than 1 and apac saw volumes increased 19 albeit off of a small base we did push through normal price increases to start the fiscal year and we announced the second price increase last week to help offset inflationary pressures in commodities and labor costs the second price increase will be effective at the end of june and will help preserve margins next quarter we will continue to monitor inflationary pressures going forward and we ll take further actions if necessary on slide 6 we saw gross margin improved sequentially to 34 4 which compares with 34 9 last year sales volume is still below last year by 11 million which affects our fixed cost absorption in our factories we also face supply chain and logistics challenges which led to inefficiencies in our factories we are still benefiting from our 80 20 process which contributed approximately 2 9 million of incremental year over year gross profit expansion in the quarter through strategic pricing indirect overhead reductions in factory closures we are doubling down on product line simplification this year and are making good progress with sku and component reductions unfortunately this part of the process takes longer as you have to phase out existing products and utilize existing inventory to avoid write offs and this effort will pay dividends over a longer horizon let s now review this quarter s gross profit bridge fourth quarter gross profit of 64 1 million was down 2 1 million compared with the prior year this was driven by two factors first we saw 3 6 million reduction in gross profit due to lower sales volumes compared to a year ago we also experienced negative productivity net of other cost changes of 4 5 million largely due to supply chain issues and covid related labor inefficiencies in addition freight carriers have also been impacted as we see higher costs and longer transit times we did see gross profit expansion from pricing net of material cost inflation of 1 7 million which includes about 200 000 of material cost inflation in the quarter foreign currency translation increased gross profit by 2 1 million factory closure costs and business realignment costs together were lower this quarter by 1 8 million as shown on slide 7 our sg a costs were 46 7 million in the quarter or 25 1 of sales included in this total were four million of dorner acquisition deal costs which we have included as a pro forma item in our adjusted operating income adjusted ebitda and adjusted eps calculations excluding these costs our rsg a costs were actually 3 5 million lower than the previous year despite 2 3 million of higher annual incentive costs and stock comp costs compared with the fourth quarter a year ago this improved level of rsg a was due to several factors we had lower selling costs of 1 4 million resulting from cost saving measures including lower head count and limited travel g a costs were down 2 9 million compared with the prior year if you exclude the dorner acquisition deal cost of 4 million that i just covered we also continued to invest in r d to drive organic growth so those costs were actually up 800 000 fx translation also added approximately 1 2 million to rsg a cost which also makes this year over year performance that much more impressive as we move into the new fiscal year we are increasing our q1 estimate for rsg a to approximately 50 million which includes the impact of the dorner acquisition dorner adds about 7 million quarterly to our legacy rsg a base costs as sales increased throughout the year variable sales costs will increase in addition we plan to continue making investments in r d and we ll implement merit increases in july to reward our employees as a result we would expect rsg a cost to increase modestly throughout the remainder of the fiscal year turning to slide 8 adjusted operating income was 18 9 million adjusted operating margin was 10 1 of sales only down 60 basis points from the prior year we are close to returning to pre covid margin levels as we see volumes return we ve also made structural changes to the business in the past year to improve profitability which are beginning to show up decremental adjusted operating leverage for the year was 13 5 which is significantly better than what we saw during the great recession of 2009 when we experienced decremental operating leverage of 38 i would like to point out that while we are still finalizing the purchase accounting for the dorner acquisition we expect total amortization expense to increase to 6 5 million per quarter as dorner will approximately double the historical level of amortization expense we have had post the stahl acquisition as you can see on slide 9 we recorded gaap income per diluted share for the quarter of 0 39 adjusted earnings per diluted share were 0 50 which were up substantially on a sequential basis but down 0 08 per share from a year ago we still believe that dorner will be accretive to fy 2022 earnings per share by 0 05 to 0 10 we are still working through the impact of the fy 2022 gaap effective tax rate given the complexities of the dorner acquisition and we ll provide our estimated tax rate in july when we report our q1 earnings in the meantime we continue to use 22 as our normalized tax rate for computed adjusted earnings per share in addition there have been substantial changes to the capital structure of the company and i want to be sure that we are transparent with the impact that this will have on q1 with the initial 650 million bridge financing outstanding for half a quarter the debt pay down from the equity offering in the permanent 450 million term loan b financing outstanding for half a quarter we expect interest expense in q1 to be approximately 7 5 million with the additional shares from the equity offering our share count for average diluted shares outstanding in q1 is expected to be 27 2 million shares on slide 10 our adjusted ebitda margin for fiscal year 2021 declined to 11 9 because of covid 19 our return on invested capital of 6 6 was similarly impacted we continue to target 19 ebitda margins and expect our roic to be greater than our we continue to target 19 ebitda margins and expect our roic to be greater than our wacc in fiscal year 2023 dorner will help us achieve our 19 ebitda margin one year earlier than we would ve otherwise done we remain highly confident that our strategy will enable us to drive profitable growth and achieve these objectives moving to slide 11 we generated 20 5 million of free cash for in this quarter in an impressive 86 6 million in the fiscal year 2021 despite the pandemic we took rapid actions to preserve and generate cash and utilized our strategy deployment process which is part of our business system to focus on working capital reductions our working capital as a percent of sales improved to 9 3 which was a significant contributor to our free cash flow improvement we drove our day sale outstanding or dso performance down to 51 5 days and improved our days payable outstanding to 58 7 days inventory turns also improved to 4 4 turns we expect capex of 20 million to 25 million in fiscal year 2022 this includes capex for dorner of approximately 3 million to 4 million turning to slide 12 we ve been very busy refinancing the capital structure polestar or acquisition and i m pleased to report that we even exceeded our own internal expectations we utilize the 650 million bridge loan to acquire dorner paid down our previously existing term loan b and paid various fees and expenses associated with the acquisition we then issued 207 million of stock in an upsized equity offering in which the underwriter also exercised the green shoot provision this equity was issued at a price of 48 per share and resulted in net proceeds of 198 7 million all of which was utilized to pay down the initial bridge loan right after the equity price we refinanced the remaining initial bridge loan with 450 million term loan b at libor plus 2 75 with a 50 basis point libor floor in 99 75 price this was on the tight end of the price stock and gives us a low cost flexible capital structure that will serve us well for the coming years with the completion of the equity offering and debt refinancing we estimate that as of march 31 on a pro forma basis and excluding costs synergies we would have been at a 3 4 times net leverage ratio using both ours and dorner s 3 31 ltm adjusted ebitda finally our liquidity remains strong which includes our cash on hand and revolver availability and with approximate a 155 million at the end of april please advance to slide 13 so i will turn it back over to david david j wilson president and chief executive officer thanks greg as you can see on slide 13 orders continue to improve sequentially in q4 and we re up 24 versus q3 we have seen improvements continuing in many markets projects that were previously on hold are now being released and new projects are being quoted this is all very encouraging we also saw the beginnings of inventory restocking and our distribution channels for the first time in two years i should point out that there is a degree of seasonality in our orders we typically have stronger demand in the fiscal fourth quarter whereas orders in the fiscal first quarter tend to decline sequentially this reflects distributor purchasing behavior in advance of annual price increases we know that year over year comparisons for the first quarter in fiscal 2022 will be favorable considering what was happening at this time last year in fact through last week the average daily order rate for our lifting business was up over 50 compared with last year book to bill for the fiscal fourth quarter was greater than 1 2 1 demand was strong in defense and government with a variety of projects including shipbuilding and material handling automation at supply depots among other projects demand from energy markets globally was encouraging utilities were stocking up for summer grid work in advance of the hurricane season we also had requests for solutions in nuclear and thermal power generation facilities demand for our fixed venue entertainment products has been improving enquiries in this market in general are picking up we would expect to continue to see this trend improve and to start seeing this convert to orders for touring shows as we progressed through the year both short and long term backward log were up sequentially short term which is expected to ship within the first quarter grew nearly 15 to 104 million while long term backlog was up nearly 10 this does not include approximately 40 million of additional backlog from dorner we are entering fiscal 2022 in a solid position with the expansion of the markets we serve our strong competitive position and the tailwinds of recovery please turn to slide 14 for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 we expect net sales to range between 212 million and 217 million this of course includes the dorner acquisition the addition of the specialty conveying solutions platform diversified our markets into to those with enduring tailwinds we are seeing strong demand from e commerce life sciences and food processing industries with this platform we are accelerating our pivot to growth and improving our margin profile as to the supply chain we are actively addressing inflation shortages and logistics constraints we began implementing additional price increases this month and are working closely with our suppliers to get better purchasing and delivery performance we have historically been able to cover material cost inflation and believe we are positioned to continue to do so looking beyond the next quarter there is a lot that makes us excited about where we are headed we are driving progress with our strategy and employing new business tools to drive scalability we expect to deliver growth through targeted organic initiatives including opportunities within our specialty conveying solutions platforms and while delivering our balance sheet and integrating dorner our high priorities we will continue to actively develop our m a pipeline turning to slide 15 i d like to remind you of our blueprint for growth 2 0 strategy cmbs provides the foundation and our core growth framework defines the potential that we have in front of us we truly believe there is a lot to look forward to here at columbus mckinnon with that rob we can open up the line for questions questions and answers operator thank you thank you our first question today comes from the line of mike shlisky with colliers securities please proceed with your question mike shlisky colliers securities analyst hey good morning i want to ask quickly first about the backlog at dorner you mentioned it had more than doubled year over year i think in the quarter can you remind us last march to your knowledge if and was there a large dip at the very end of the quarter last year kind of like what you saw or is it vary apples to apples really pre pandemic for them a our comparison david j wilson president and chief executive officer yeah i think that the pandemic might be a good question of course i mean as we look at that the quarter ending march for them in the prior year the pandemic was early in its cycle i think their backlog was around 17 million at that time and they saw the first quarter of our period last year so our first quarter their second i m sorry their third quarter in their annual cycle was their worst if you will from the pandemic so remember they have a year end in september and so that would ve been their fiscal third quarter which is equivalent to our first fiscal quarter of 21 and that was the period when they were impacted the most by covid but their march ending balance or what we referred to as their april ending balance at 40 million is up about you know it s more than double i think it was 70 million at the time that we re referring back to mike shlisky colliers securities analyst okay and then my follow up you had mentioned in the slide that you re still looking at 19 ebitda margins of at fiscal 2023 do you anticipate that being a full year type of scenario or just kind of scratching by the end of the year as an exit rate kind of sense us as to what does that 19 a target mean to you for the next fiscal year gregory p rustowicz vice president finance and chief financial officer hey mike its greg we re looking at that has being the average for the full year mike shlisky colliers securities analyst average okay well guys that s great that s great color i appreciate it and i ll pass it along david j wilson president and chief executive officer thanks mike operator thank you our next question is from the line of michael mcginn with wells fargo please proceed with your question michael mcginn wells fargo analyst hey good morning everybody david j wilson president and chief executive officer hey mike good morning gregory p rustowicz vice president finance and chief financial officer good morning michael mcginn wells fargo analyst so you walked through some sg a numbers and i think the sg a ramp you said was 7 million from with dorner and then amortization on top of that does that 7 million include is that fully burdened with r d and everything gregory p rustowicz vice president finance and chief financial officer yeah so just to be clear amortization is not included in our sg a costs legacy is 43 million dorner is 7 million and that gets to the 50 million of rsg a and as i mentioned we do expect to ramp our spend for new product development which falls into r d david j wilson president and chief executive officer that 50 million includes the r d gregory p rustowicz vice president finance and chief financial officer yeah for the quarter david j wilson president and chief executive officer and we re going to continue to make selected and targeted investments in growth throughout the year michael mcginn wells fargo analyst got it you also alluded to some pricing the second pricing increase and that your backlog is filling up a little quicker with the shorter cycle distribution products can you walk us through what the the expectations are for price increases on the front end shorter cycle products being delivered in the front half and then maybe projects picking up the back half what your incremental margin estimates or assumptions would kind of be a scenario like that david j wilson president and chief executive officer yeah so mike we re working to make sure that we re out ahead of the inflationary pressures that are out there in the market and so our second price increase is really targeted at ensuring that we stay positive as it relates to net price versus inflationary pressures so we re not seeing this as an action that expands margins specifically in the second price increase and it s more of a movement to make sure that we re out ahead of inflation and the back half as it relates to longer cycle projects we obviously price them as an engineered to order project off of an understanding of the market value of the project the competitive landscape and then the pricing pressures on the cost base and so we ll be making sure that we have the appropriate adjustments in there to ensure that we re maintaining if not expanding margin gregory p rustowicz vice president finance and chief financial officer and just to add on to that mike so with engineered to order product because it s a unique sku we don t count that as price and so our price calculations are year over year by sku but the change in prices so with engineered to order every time you quote you have the opportunity to adjust your input costs and our quoting software so when we talk price it s really just on standard short cycle product that was sold in the previous year which is about half of the business so when we talk about 1 price realized in the quarter you might think of it as really it s 2 on what we re actually raising prices on standard product but there is also pricing embedded in engineered to order products based on how we re quoting it and how long and adjusting the input cost for that michael mcginn wells fargo analyst got it and if i could sneak one more in on the capex number is this sort of a catch up plus integration or is this the run rate to skus going forward for the combined business david j wilson president and chief executive officer yeah i ll take that so in general this is probably a more normal level of capex at the 20 million to 25 million we spent 12 3 million this past year in other years we ve been as high as 20 million to 22 million on just the legacy columbus mckinnon dorner is typically in the 3 million to 4 million range and that should be plenty on a go forward basis so i would think that this would be a good number going forward michael mcginn wells fargo analyst got it appreciate the time gregory p rustowicz vice president finance and chief financial officer thanks mike operator the next question is coming from the line of chris howe with barrington please just use your questions david j wilson president and chief executive officer hi chris chris howe barrington research associates inc analyst good morning everyone thanks for taking my questions as far as the guidance that we ve kind of discussed for the first fiscal quarter can you talk in more detail as to how this may look for dorner a dorner sales expectation and in the context of this fiscal year can you remind me again about dorner seasonality and its comparisons over let s say your last fiscal year david j wilson president and chief executive officer yes but i ll chris howe barrington research associates inc analyst and that s too many questions on there but the previous dorner expectations laid out for their year ending september 30 are those still in line david j wilson president and chief executive officer yeah chris let me jump in and then i ll ask greg to help out so dorner s performance is tracking consistent with our expectations at the acquisition timeframe and as i mentioned in my opening comments even slightly ahead of those expectations and so we feel really good about where the business is their order development has been really promising from a cyclicality standpoint on their build to order business which is their base business it s relatively i d say stable the q3 columbus mckinnon period tends to be their highest period at calendar year end and then that goes into the q4 period at a slightly lower level but q1 and q2 if there is any seasonality would tend to be a little bit lower on the build to order in a general cycle if you will but that s exclusive of more macro drivers which includes a lot of activity in the life sciences and e commerce sectors and so we re seeing terrific development in terms of order pipeline there on a year over year basis their orders are up on a quarter to date basis materially we had but that but again first quarter last year was their worst quarter the first when i say first quarter i m referring to columbus mckinnon s quarter so yeah really good development there and greg i don t know if you have anything you want to add to this context gregory p rustowicz vice president finance and chief financial officer yeah so just to add on from a seasonality perspective we don t really see seasonality in the business other than the number of working days so when david talks about our december legacy quarter being less for them it s really a function of the thanksgiving holidays christmas holidays but there isn t really that cycle and given the growth trajectory that they ve been on they ve been kind of blowing through any kind of concept of seasonality now we did give a couple of markers on revenue as part of the s 1 filings and 8 k filings where and when we announced the dorner acquisition i think through december the revenue was about 98 million and change 98 million and change david j wilson president and chief executive officer december period ending gregory p rustowicz vice president finance and chief financial officer yeah and then we said for their september timeframe it was about 124 7 million is the number that i recall and they which says that there s been there s a tremendous amount of growth that s happening in the second half of the year and that is just continuing so we re very pleased with the first month and a couple of weeks that we ve owned dorner it s a very profitable high margin business with a really great double digit growth trajectory david j wilson president and chief executive officer yeah and a fantastic team gregory p rustowicz vice president finance and chief financial officer so we really really feel good about where we are and we re excited about how things are coming together right now and working really hard on all the things that we ve committed to do to make sure that we exceed or we achieve and exceed our targets chris howe barrington research associates inc analyst that s great and if i may squeeze another question it won t be a series of questions but as it relates to dorner in some of your comments in the press release david you said strategic opportunities in a fragmented market can you perhaps expand on these thoughts and perhaps how it may relate to the different opportunities that you re seeing in your inorganic pipeline david j wilson president and chief executive officer sure so the market that dorner serves is a global market that approximates 5 billion they re obviously at the rates that greg was just referring to a small piece of that total market but there are two other major global players in addition to dorner and then we see a long tail of fragmentation and dorner today has a very large percentage of their business approximately 85 of their business is in the us and the balance overseas and so as we look at the competitive landscape and we look at the market there are a number of nice niche technology opportunities there are also opportunities that will enable more global scale and there is just a tremendous runway and a nice pipeline of opportunities that exist and obviously we re very focused on what s right in front of us and making sure that we execute to the plans that we ve committed to but the pipeline of opportunities are really nicely concentrated in areas that we think will be very attractive for dorner chris howe barrington research associates inc analyst very helpful thanks for taking my questions i ll hop back in the queue david j wilson president and chief executive officer great thanks mike operator our next question is from the line of greg palm with craig hallum capital please proceed with your question danny eggerichs craig hallum capital group analyst hi this is danny eggerichs on for greg today thanks for taking the questions david j wilson president and chief executive officer hey danny good morning gregory p rustowicz vice president finance and chief financial officer hey danny danny eggerichs craig hallum capital group analyst hey i appreciate the color on it sounds like dorner growth rates have been accelerating recently i m wondering if you could kind of dig into the drivers behind that i know certainly with the labor constraints a lot of companies are putting more emphasis on warehouse automation just anything you re seeing from that perspective david j wilson president and chief executive officer danny i m sorry you broke up just a little bit there in the front end of the question so you re asking about order rates in dorner just to confirm danny eggerichs craig hallum capital group analyst yep yep so i mean just it seems like order rates have been accelerating recently i was just kind of wondering what the drivers were behind that david j wilson president and chief executive officer yeah danny eggerichs craig hallum capital group analyst i know with the labor constraints it seems like companies are putting more of an emphasis on warehouse automation in their distribution centers so i just wanted to understand david j wilson president and chief executive officer sure we re certainly seeing that as well the two primary markets that we re seeing most of the significant activity and although all across the board markets are pretty favorable but it would be life sciences and that s primarily concentrated around pharmaceutical automation if you will pharmaceutical distribution automation in the life sciences space and then e commerce growth and that s in terms of warehousing and order fulfillment activities so yes a lot of demand generation coming from those areas and the order pipeline continues to develop positively and we re starting to receive more and more commitments from customers for orders that will come in the future relative to that opportunity and we re pretty encouraged danny eggerichs craig hallum capital group analyst got it that s good and just piggybacking off one of the last questions on i think you were mentioning inorganic growth opportunities on a worldwide basis what is the opportunity organically for dorner for geographic expansion david j wilson president and chief executive officer yeah so dorner has historically grown on a year over year basis organically at about 13 over the last five seven years on a cagr basis and so really attractive organic performance profile clearly the work we re doing together is focused on driving incremental growth beyond that we ve got a nice set of opportunities that exist from a channel synergy standpoint and from a geographic expansion perspective particularly as we look beyond the us into europe and so we ve got reach that they don t necessarily have legal entities and the opportunity to plug resources in to help them scale and then as it relates to columbus mckinnon product that hasn t had access to some of the channel partners that dorner enjoys we have the opportunity to bring some of our actuation and other overhead workstation crane products through their channels for growth in the near term so there is some really interesting opportunities that are organic and synergistic in both directions on top of the already terrific performance that they ve been delivering and remember they ve been owned and operated under a private equity structure for the last seven years they ve been somewhat capital constrained and we re working with them to expand capacity and make sure that they can scale to accommodate the growth opportunities that are in front of them so i think the organic growth opportunities will be material in addition to the acquisitive opportunities danny eggerichs craig hallum capital group analyst all right that s really helpful i ll leave it there thanks david j wilson president and chief executive officer great thanks dan operator our next question is from the line of matt summerville with d a davidson please proceed with your questions matt summerville d a davidson co analyst thanks a couple of questions first i was wondering if you could comment on where you think we are with respect to distributor inventory levels currently versus prior up cycles and maybe what inning we re in with the restock process david j wilson president and chief executive officer good morning matt i guess i haven t lived through those historic cycles but i m trying to get as smart as i can on it i ll let greg comment a little further after i highlight but we saw channel partners lean in q4 and start to place orders for the first time in a couple of years and lean in positively toward where the market was going and since then we ve seen that lean become more forward leaning if you will and become accelerated and so we see our customers beginning to open up i d say we re in what we re reporting here in q4 is the beginnings of that on a quarter to date basis we re up about 70 short cycle through in comparison to the prior year so that s kind of may for the first three weeks of may and our project business is up about 30 year over year in that same cycle so when i commented that through the first three weeks of may we see orders up year over year approximately 50 that s the split and what the short cycle demand increase would indicate is that our channel partners are leaning in a little bit further on inventory and being bullish about it but i d say we re in the early to mid innings in terms of restocking gregory p rustowicz vice president finance and chief financial officer yeah just to add on matt i would having been here for a while this is substantially less than what we would typically see and the stocking always would take place and the orders would come in the march timeframe with delivery either in march or in the first quarter of the next fiscal year so while we did see stocking orders still significantly below what we would normally see matt summerville d a davidson co analyst and then i apologize if i missed it to a prior question given and then the moving pieces associated with how raw material costs are rolling through how your pricing schematic is going to play out this year how should we be thinking about core incremental margins in the base business ex dorner this year david j wilson president and chief executive officer yeah so with the pricing that we ve implemented we want to be sure we stay ahead of the inflationary pressures that we re going to see we have inflationary pressures in raw materials and freight and labor costs not that they re unusual but in the past year we really did not provide increases to our associates so there is going to be a bit of a catch up here starting in july but i think all in we will expect that will cover inflation and maybe have a little bit of upside to it like we always do but this is really meant to cover the inflationary pressures that we are expecting gregory p rustowicz vice president finance and chief financial officer yeah so i think the net comment is we don t expect any erosion and we re anticipating that we ll be able to lean in a little bit more david j wilson president and chief executive officer yeah matt summerville d a davidson co analyst got it thank you guys david j wilson president and chief executive officer thanks matt operator thank you our next question is from the line of jon tanwanteng with cjs securities please proceed with your questions jon tanwanteng cjs securities analyst hey good morning guys thank you for taking my question maybe just to drill down the previous question a little bit further for the first quarter do you expect any gross margin deterioration just in that quarter because the price increases don t take place until june and then maybe end up the year up as those roll through or is it more of a that you re still able to stay ahead based on the pricing increases that you already did david j wilson president and chief executive officer yeah we would expect that we ll still be able to stay ahead jon i mean because if you recall we implemented our normal round of price increases that took effect some in january some april 1 some in the u s the third week of march and so those are all in place and we should not expect any erosion to margins as a result of inflation in the first quarter but once again we re trying to get ahead of what we anticipate coming down the road jon tanwanteng cjs securities analyst okay great and then since you ve announced your next price increase are you seeing another spike in demand from people who are trying to stock up ahead of that rolling through kind of counter season what you usually see david j wilson president and chief executive officer no nothing material yet at this point as greg indicated we announced last week we ve had a lot of positive discussions with our channel partners and customers they re they understand they re expecting it and it s not a challenge as it relates to implementation at this stage and we haven t seen a lot of movement in terms of order rates in the short term that we ve been talking about it jon tanwanteng cjs securities analyst okay great and then greg just a great job on cash flow once again do you see that reversing out as you grow this year and maybe building inventory like some of your customers maybe and then it seems like everybody s supply chain is trying to if they can david j wilson president and chief executive officer yeah no that s exactly what we would expect to happen as we look at free cash flow going forward we re going to have higher interest expense as a result of the refinancing that we ve done we re going to have higher capex working capital is going to be significantly higher we did benefit in our accrued liabilities our working capital as a percent of sales was i think 9 3 but that was that benefited from a derivative that was classified as current and so our more normal working capital as a percent of sales is going to be in the 14 to 15 area so we would expect free cash flow isn t going to be as rich as it was this past year and the bulk of it really coming from an increase in working capital as we expect revenue to improve and then on top of that we also have transaction costs and that refinancing fees that are going to get paid in the month of april or have been paid in the month of april may so for all those reasons we will benefit from dorner s free cash flow but net net it s we re going to have less free cash flow in the coming year than this past year jon tanwanteng cjs securities analyst okay great thanks then last small question did you have a breakout as to what dorner was expected to contribute in the first quarter within your guidance david j wilson president and chief executive officer we did not i mean the revenue number that we ve guided to includes both legacy columbus mckinnon and dorner we broke out the dorner sg a at 7 million we talked about dorner being roughly 3 2 billion 3 3 million of additional amortization because we said that it s approximately double what we had historically for amortization expense gregory p rustowicz vice president finance and chief financial officer yeah so we didn t break it out explicitly in the full p l we had a few guides that we provided relative to dorner performance jon tanwanteng cjs securities analyst okay fair enough thank you guys david j wilson president and chief executive officer thanks jon operator our next question is from the line of steve ferazani with sidoti please state your question david j wilson president and chief executive officer good morning steve steve ferazani sidoti company llc analyst follow up from the last question i know even if you re not breaking out dorner you can sort of ballpark it which would say that and i know you re coming off of typically your strongest quarter seasonally but it seems like maybe there isn t in pre dorner columbus mckinnon maybe you re not looking at much sequential growth certainly at the low end of your guidance i m just trying to figure out if the chip shortage in the automotive business is slowing sales to certain end markets like automotive or if there are any labor issues anything that hampering growth in q1 that goes away david j wilson president and chief executive officer yeah i don t think there is anything specific from a market perspective that we see as negative as it relates to the sequential activity in the market it s more simply sequential performance in the core business based on the cycle in the market so we see a lot of demand that gets placed as we talked about given our year end price increases etc are being placed in the last fiscal quarter of the year that s not necessarily market development driven it s more just get out ahead of price increases behavior in the channel and then as we head into q1 we re anticipating a typical cyclical decline in the core business but certainly with a tendency toward acceleration as we head into the second quarter gregory p rustowicz vice president finance and chief financial officer yeah the only thing i d add is one of the movers to our revenue line is our rail business which can have some larger projects and we had a very strong order in the fourth quarter from a rail business and really just due to the timing of projects in our q1 there is probably about a 5 million delta in revenue timing david j wilson president and chief executive officer revenue timing yeah good point greg you made steve ferazani sidoti company llc analyst and then in terms of leverage and certainly it s easy for us to model out how you get net leverage under two times within two years given your strong cash flow but you may have touched on this what are you thinking about and what are you allowed to do in terms of actual debt repayments and just in general how you re thinking about cash david j wilson president and chief executive officer yeah so from a debt repayment perspective the term loan b requires an annual principal payment of 1 per year which would be 4 5 million and divide that by 4 million so 1 25 million a quarter starting in the next quarter and then there are what s called an excess cash flow suite which is 50 of in essence your free cash flow that s due based on your annual free cash flow at the end of march and it depends on your leverage ratio i think once we re below three times that steps down to 25 and then it steps down again but that s we filed our credit agreement so that s publicly out there so we can chat about that later and in terms of other cash requirements pension contributions would be one that we would anticipate that pension contributions will be similar this year compared to when i say this year this new fiscal year versus what we did last year and probably the neighborhood of around 7 million oh and there are no prepayment penalties on debt so what we have typically done in the past is we will use any excess cash we have to pay down debt save the interest expense and delever quickly even though it s a net leverage ratio we will use excess cash to pay down debt so there is no prepayment penalties and the financial covenant for those not familiar with the term loan b only kick in if we draw down off of the revolver and if we don t draw off the revolver the covenant isn t tested and we typically don t need our revolver for intra period of cash requirements given our strong cash flow profile deborah k pawlowski investor relations steve are you there rob operator thank you at this time we ve reached the end of our question and answer session i ll hand the call over to david wilson for closing remarks david j wilson president and chief executive officer great thank you rob and to everyone for joining us today i d like to take a moment to thank all of my columbus

ontario a pre emptive strike from the mayor and councillors made it clear cornwall and area can t afford a transportation blow in the form of reduced train service when you look at that proposed train route map graphic cornwall looks pretty lonely sitting there compared to other municipalities the mayor told cannon to get to the new dedicated track roughly running in this region along the highway

but specifically for cornwall and fearing the devil will eventually appear in the details council was voicing concerns long before train service could potentially go to hell here that was the point of

taking away station staff and putting up paid parking has not helped at all and sends an opposite message a message that you don t want our business said coun justin towndale we re a town that relies

board designees by portfolio company employees likely triggering at least indemnity considerations which need to be evaluated in connection with insurance and indemnity at the portfolio company level and might also affect the value of the portfolio company and in turn the value of the fund s assets employee shareholder claims as discussed in prior posts a fund sponsor s designation of its own partners as portfolio company board directors provides some measure of control over the company but also creates potential exposure for the sponsor for example in a major company transaction there may be a divergence of the fund s interests as a shareholder from certain of its fellow shareholders such as employees who hold a different class of equity interests and even the company itself that divergence of interests may be particularly acute between common shareholders and preferred shareholders whose preference shares may give them priority in the distribution of any proceeds of a sale often a fund will hold some combination of preferred shares and common shares particularly if the investment was made at a later stage in the life of the portfolio company whereas employees often hold common shares examples of unequal rights and restrictions between share classes include voting preferences liquidation preferences and anti dilution preferences these preferences can produce wildly divergent outcomes between shareholders leading to disputes employees holding common shares may claim that a director and particularly a fund designee breached their duties to the company and the shareholders by voting for a transaction that produced a disproportionately favorable outcome for the fund given this background fund sponsors should consider the risk of an employee shareholder lawsuit against the company its directors and even the sponsor entities in the dissolution or sale of a portfolio company employees holding common shares may be inclined to sue if they believe the value of their shares was impaired disproportionately and unfairly relative to other share classes in the dissolution or sale additionally if a director is also a representative of a fund that owns preferred shares the employees may allege that the director was conflicted and favored the preferred shareholders over common shareholders in the sale to maximize the fund s investment with increasing frequency fund sponsors along with the share holding fund s are named directly as defendants and accused of aiding these alleged breaches of fiduciary duties at a minimum the fund is indirectly at risk because of its indemnification obligations to the board designee and through the financial risk conflicts can also arise when employee shareholders feel aggrieved whether warranted or not by the differential treatment of their common shares as compared to shares of preferred shareholders for example preference shareholders of a portfolio company may be able to sell in a secondary market stock transaction while employee common shareholders are often blocked from these transactions similarly when a portfolio company faces liquidity issues it may seek convertible debt or equity financing cram down financing may disproportionately dilute the value of employees common shares and cause employees to seek to recover their lost value through litigation warn act claims delaware courts have allowed warn act class action suits against fund sponsors in addition to the portfolio company s management again this is a situation where increased control by a fund sponsor equates to increased litigation exposure both federal and state warn acts obligate companies to warn employees if the company can reasonably foresee that it will not be able to meet payroll the key consideration in determining potential direct liability of a fund sponsor is how much control the sponsor exercised over decisions and operations at the company even if the fund sponsor is not involved sufficiently to be named as a defendant itself it can still face indirect risk in a warn act case through its indemnity obligations to board designees who are often named as defendants in warn act lawsuits whistleblower claims we have seen more whistleblower activity in increasingly high profile cases with high rewards where employee whistleblowers are exposing inconsistencies and financial impropriety relating to valuations including 409a option valuations and impairments to goodwill particularly for acquisitive portfolio companies additionally a flag raised on how a portfolio company is valuing itself could trigger an interest in how the fund sponsor is valuing the company for purposes of its own accounting and reporting particularly when the sponsor has one of its own members on portfolio company board erisa stock drop claims boards and board committees with responsibility for administering employee retirement plans that contain the option to buy company stock are under the obligation to ensure that maintaining the stock fund option is prudent i e for the benefit of the employee participants of the plan directors with fiduciary responsibility for the plan run the risk of litigation of claims under erisa if an employee elects to invest some of his her plan holdings in the stock yet the board knows something about the health of the company that would make it imprudent for the stock to be available for plan investment plaintiffs in these cases face a high pleading standard but history guides that employees will still pursue claims when there has been an impairment in the value of the company affecting their retirement for further information regarding how to mitigate risks such as those above contact us regarding the portfolio company playbook a fund sponsor s guide to risks and liability keep an eye out for chapter 4 of the playbook which will cover navigating additional sources of direct liability risks to the fund

updated an insurance biz has retracted boasts of how it uses ai algorithms to study videos of customers for non verbal cues that their claims are fraudulent the marketing u turn came after the ethics of this approach was called publicly and loudly into question using machine learning software to automate decision making processes to decide whether to accept or deny customers credit or insurance payments is particularly sensitive last month america s consumer watchdog the ftc issued a strongly worded statement warning that it was illegal to deploy algorithms end up discriminating against people based on their race color religion national origin sex marital status and age when making financial related decisions alarm bells went off when lemonade a company based in new york said it had built software that scanned videos of customers explaining the situations they found themselves which were submitted as part of insurance claims to decide whether those people were essentially lying or committing some other fraud lemonade prides itself on providing an easier and simpler way for people to file pet home and life insurance claims customers speak to a chat bot submit their claim with a video and a decision on how much it should pay them can be made in a few minutes when a user files a claim they record a video on their phone and explain what happened lemonade stated in a series of tweets that have since been deleted our ai carefully analyzes these videos for signs of fraud it can pick up non verbal cues that traditional insurers can t since they don t use a digital claims process netizens criticized lemonade s technology accusing it of being potentially biased and overly reliant on flimsy sentiment and emotion analysis of the submitted videos the backlash on twitter prompted the company to delete its posts and issue a fresh statement in which it claimed it just used facial recognition algorithms to make sure the same person wasn t making multiple claims so no ai lie detector as previously claimed just identification algorithms apparently there was a sizable discussion on twitter around a poorly worded tweet of ours mostly the term non verbal cues which led to confusion as to how we use customer videos to process claims the upstart stated on its website there were also questions about whether we use approaches like emotion recognition we don t and whether ai is used to automatically decline claims never we do not use and we re not trying to build ai that uses physical or personal features to deny claims it reiterated our systems don t evaluate claims based on background gender appearance skin tone disability or any physical characteristic nor do we evaluate any of these by proxy 3 4 lemonade lemonade_inc may 26 2021 that said the company s privacy policy does say it collects among other details people s physical characteristics when handling life insurance and in a s 1 filing to america s financial regulator the sec lemonade said its system collects roughly 1 700 data points from customers we use technology and artificial intelligence to reduce hassle time and cost associated with purchasing insurance and the claims submission and fulfillment process lemonade stated in its sec submission dated june 2020 we built our entire company on a unified proprietary state of the art technology platform our customers are able to purchase insurance on our website or through our app generally in a matter of minutes our artificial intelligence system handles substantially all of our customer onboarding and a meaningful portion of our claims what those data points describe is unclear it went on to admit its own technology could have unintended consequences in which customers may be paid too much or too little due to biased and discriminatory decisions on the one hand this is a boilerplate warning to investors and the financial markets that the biz could screw up and implode and thus investments could be lost though on the other hand it is pretty specific about how it could go wrong our proprietary artificial intelligence algorithms may not operate properly or as we expect them to which could cause us to write policies we should not write price those policies inappropriately or overpay claims that are made by our customers moreover our proprietary artificial intelligence algorithms may lead to unintentional bias and discrimination it added a determination by federal or state regulators that the data points we collect and the process we use for collecting this data unfairly discriminates against some groups of people could also subject us to fines and other sanctions including but not limited to disciplinary action revocation and suspension of licenses and withdrawal of product forms any such event could in turn materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects and make it harder for us to be profitable over time although we have implemented policies and procedures into our business operations that we feel are appropriately calibrated to our artificial intelligence and automation driven operations these policies and procedures may prove inadequate to manage our use of this nascent technology resulting in a greater likelihood of inadvertent legal or compliance failures the company was launched in 2016 and operates across the us and parts of europe including france germany and the netherlands it has yet to turn a profit and spends most of its money on sales and marketing our future success depends on our ability to continue to develop and implement our proprietary artificial intelligence algorithms and to maintain the confidentiality of this technology it stated in its filing the register has asked lemonade for further comment updated to add we ve noticed that even though lemonade in its u turn on wednesday said its ai software is never used to automatically decline claims in its the s 1 filing from last year it boasted that one of its chat bots called ai jim could as of march 2020 handle a customer s entire claim through resolution in approximately a third of cases paying the claimant or declining the claim without human intervention however a spokesperson for the upstart told the register today the term non verbal cues was a bad choice of words to describe the facial recognition technology we re using to flag claims submitted by the same person under different identities these flagged claims then get reviewed by our human investigators we have never and will never let ai auto reject claims they also told us that despite being called ai jim the part of the chat bot that automatically denies or approves claims isn t artificially intelligent these checks are not done using ai but they are still processed by the same product we call ai jim the spokesperson told us approximately a third of our claims require zero human intervention in order to approve or deny without using ai or machine learning

food banks have seen increased need since pandemic related food benefits expired in idaho the idaho department of health and welfare decided not to extend snap emergency allotments in the state which were designed to increase benefits to the lowest income households during the pandemic shutdown ariel jackson executive director of the community food basket in idaho falls said numbers went down after the expanded benefits went into effect last year but this announcement has reversed that trend and she saw the first signs of it posted on facebook people were panicking because they had received a letter and they weren t going to be getting this extra allotment anymore and they didn t know what they were going to do she said within days of that our numbers at our food bank spiked back up we were seeing 20 to 30 families a day and now we re back up to 60 a day jackson said her colleagues in food banks across the state have seen similar increases the enhanced benefits stopped at the end of april according to the u s department of agriculture more than 42 000 idaho households received snap emergency allotments in march the idaho department of health and welfare did not respond to a request for comment idaho has announced that additional unemployment benefits from the federal government also will end in the state in mid june and the federal eviction moratorium is set to expire at the end of june jackson said she thinks the combination could mean a benefits cliff for some people who either have struggled to find jobs or haven t returned to work because of health concerns one of the biggest concerns that food banks have she said is that these programs will all end at relatively the same time and we ll feel it here people won t know what to do jackson said she believes families didn t have enough time to cope with the snap benefits change she said she s also concerned about what will happen over the summer when kids are out of school and don t have access to school meals we know the programs are going to end i mean they just were never intended to go forever she said and so anything we can do to help our families adjust to the changes that are coming if that s getting information sooner or being able to help them navigate through some of that stuff that s what we want to do jackson said food banks across idaho are in need of volunteers and donations

on main street in man west virginia a woman marched through the front door of uncle sam s loans a cavernous pawn shop packed with hunting bows fishing lures and camping supplies for the residents of this small appalachian town behind the counter hung the linchpin of uncle sam s business guns the woman flashed her credentials which revealed that she was an investigator with the bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives the nation s gun industry watchdog she was here to make sure uncle sam s had cleaned up its act this was the atf s third inspection of uncle sam s in seven years the two most recent audits found that the store had transferred weapons without conducting background checks and failed to provide safety notices to handgun buyers at one point atf records show more than 600 firearms that should have been in stock could not be found a red flag for gun trafficking in both cases the violations were serious enough to warrant stripping uncle sam s of its license to sell guns according to atf records but agency officials decided to spare the shop issue an official warning to its owners and give them another chance to prove they could follow the rules as the investigator leafed through handwritten ledgers in the spring of 2014 she discovered that things had hardly improved sales records were incomplete the store failed to report required information to law enforcement and safety notices still weren t going out the inspector typed out her findings and sent them to her superiors their decision issue yet another warning months later the atf learned that uncle sam s was the backbone of a sprawling gun trafficking scheme witnesses told the agency that steven adkins a longtime shop employee who d purchased a stake in the business had enlisted a host of people including a colleague s girlfriend and his brother in law to falsify paperwork so it would appear they had purchased guns in legitimate transactions according to court records in reality the guns were used to bribe coal officials in a pay to play scheme at a local mine others were sold on the black market witnesses said one accomplice told investigators hundreds if not thousands of firearms had been trafficked through uncle sam s according to court records he recalled parking his truck around the back of the store loading up guns and delivering them to a convicted felon another accomplice said he drove guns from uncle sam s to adkins s home where adkins allegedly sold them out of his basement adkins pleaded guilty to aiding and abetting a false statement relating to purchases of more than 50 firearms from late 2008 to august 2014 he was sentenced to 10 months in prison no one else was convicted in the trafficking scheme everybody knew where to get a firearm adkins said roger d b muncy whose father founded uncle sam s in 1975 we re all human but you don t send guns out the back door the atf is facing intense scrutiny as the senate considers president joe biden s pick for the agency s first permanent director in six years the confirmation of david chipman a former atf agent who has advocated stricter gun laws is unfolding against a backdrop of public anguish over mass shootings and a renewed determination from the white house to clamp down on easy access to firearms in one of the most sweeping examinations of atf inspection records the trace and usa today found that the federal agency in charge of policing the gun industry has been largely toothless and conciliatory bending over backward to go easy on wayward dealers such as uncle sam s and sometimes allowing guns to flow into the hands of criminals gun industry lobbyists have fought for decades against tougher oversight by casting gun dealers as among the most heavily regulated businesses in the usa the trace and usa today s review found that dealers are largely immune from serious punishment and enjoy layers of protection unavailable to most other industries gun sellers fear crack down from biden s nominee for atf read more reporters spent more than a year analyzing documents from nearly 2 000 gun dealer inspections that uncovered violations from 2015 to 2017 the reports showed some dealers outright flouting the rules selling weapons to convicted felons and domestic abusers lying to investigators and fudging records to mask their unlawful conduct in many cases when the atf caught dealers breaking the law the agency issued warnings sometimes repeatedly and allowed the stores to operate for months or years others are still selling guns to this day more than half of all stores with violations transferred guns without running a background check correctly waiting for the check to finish or properly recording the results more than 200 dealers were cited for selling guns to people who indicated on background check paperwork that they were prohibited from owning them dozens made false statements in official records a violation that includes facilitating illegal straw purchases a florida gun dealer got in trouble for giving a taurus handgun to a convicted felon in the parking lot and an arkansas pawnshop was cited for selling a firearm to a customer even though he d failed the background check because of an active restraining order in ohio one store transferred guns without conducting background checks 112 times another was missing some 600 firearms a pennsylvania gun retailer racked up 45 violations and received eight warnings from the atf but the store was allowed to remain in business and it went on to sell a shotgun to a man who used it to kill four family members including his 7 year old half brother the reports were obtained through a freedom of information act lawsuit by the gun control group brady and shared with the trace and usa today reporters who conducted an independent analysis the reports detail inspections of brick and mortar gun stores and pawnbrokers including home based sellers independent mom and pops and big box retailers such as walmart and dick s sporting goods others cover gun manufacturers and importers investigate read this story at the trace the data is extensive but may not be comprehensive the agency provided brady roughly 2 000 reports from inspections that resulted in warning letters warning conferences and license revocations over the two year span from july 2015 through june 2017 however annual fact sheets published by the atf include aggregate figures showing the agency issued nearly twice as many penalties during fiscal years 2016 and 2017 a period that overlaps with the brady documents the atf repeatedly declined to explain that gap but said it is investigating a single violation is enough to shutter a gun shop if atf officials can prove that the store willfully broke federal regulations in the vast majority of the cases analyzed by the trace and usa today the atf gave violators the lightest penalty available a boilerplate warning letter reminding them that their compliance is crucial to reduce violent crime and protect the public the agency revoked a gun dealer s license in less than 3 of cases gun shop owners who violate the rules seem to understand they have little to fear one owner told an atf investigator that he was busy and didn t give a s the agency records show another said he did not like being told what to do the owner of a pawn shop in northeastern kansas became very belligerent and hostile when questioned about falsifying records shaking his finger in the investigator s face as he told her to do her job and stop messing with him the atf allowed all of those dealers to keep selling firearms the bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives headquartered in washington d c is the main line of defense against firearms ending up in the black market rich clement bloomberg via getty images joseph bisbee a retired atf agent in seattle said the lack of action has fostered a culture of impunity there s really no teeth to the laws and gun dealers know that he said they can see that nobody gets prosecuted that nobody gets held accountable and that sends the signal that they can fudge things a little more and get away with it the problems extend high into the management ranks of atf the trace and usa today s review found that the managers of on the ground investigators routinely overrule recommendations to revoke licenses and order lesser punishments reporters identified 138 reports in which atf officials acknowledged that a dealer s violations were severe enough for them to lose their licenses the agency revoked 56 of those licenses just over 40 a majority were granted lesser penalties ranging from temporary license suspensions to warning letters in the reports atf officials justified backing off by citing the dealer s age recent health problems intentions to retire and in one case affluent clientele one dealer got a pass because he had been in business less than a year another because he had been in business for decades sometimes the agency was afraid that a dealer might sue in 2017 an inspector advocated pulling the license for back acre gun works after reporting the gun shop west of orlando florida had falsified records related to the transfer of an ar 15 style rifle a supervisor downgraded the penalty to a written warning noting substantial legal liabilities because the inspection had been conducted prematurely current and former atf officials say the light regulatory touch is at least partly a reflection of congressional restrictions on the agency s enforcement powers some also say the atf has increasingly adopted an industry friendly approach to lessen the risk of a backlash that could lead to budget cuts or additional limits on its authority tweet facebook

shrug off serious violations and say they re not a big deal because they don t want to upset the industry too much quote icon they hardly do any inspections and when they do carry out an inspection they shrug off serious violations and say they re not a big deal because they don t want to upset the industry too much said mark jones who held various supervisory positions at the atf before retiring in 2012 the proliferation of gun retailers means there are bad apples in communities across america ripe for targeting by criminals kris brown brady s president said the atf bends over backward to accommodate even the most egregious activity and americans every day pay the price brown said particularly black and brown communities across this country that are being flooded with guns from these dealers goal is to gain compliance not punish the coronavirus pandemic protests against police brutality and the election of biden spurred americans to snap up an estimated 22 million guns in 2020 shattering records and reviving concerns about whether the atf can adequately police such a booming industry the most important part of the job is keeping the guns out of criminal hands said john crecca a former atf inspector who worked in new york and pennsylvania before retiring in 2011 crecca recalled the case of bull s eye shooter supply a gun store in tacoma washington that was sued by the families of victims of the 2002 beltway sniper attacks in which two gunmen armed with a bushmaster rifle had shot and killed 10 people one of the beltway gunmen told authorities he had stolen the rifle from bull s eye the shop hadn t noticed the gun was missing until federal agents came calling a subsequent atf inspection found the store could not account for the sale of more than 230 other guns bull s eye settled the lawsuit for 2 million but did not admit liability for the shootings in the rare cases in which the agency decides to pull a license the process is slow often taking months or more than a year to complete while dealers continue to sell guns sometimes the atf holds off on finalizing a revocation specifically to give the dealer time to sell off its remaining inventory reports show the atf is the main line of defense against firearms leaking out of legal streams of commerce and into the black market the agency s weaknesses have prompted illinois new jersey and a handful of other states to create their own gun store inspection programs in illinois the atf held warning conferences with 1st class firearms in 2009 and 2013 after investigators discovered that the gun shop north of waukegan had failed to conduct background checks kept sloppy or incomplete records and illegally transferred weapons to out of state residents records show allowed to remain in business 1st class firearms went on to sell at least a dozen weapons to a trafficking ring suspected of smuggling hundreds of kilograms of cocaine into the u s from mexico according to court records inspectors returned in 2015 and cited 1st class firearms for 12 more violations this time agency officials determined that the store s license should be revoked according to records one supervisor railed against the owner craig bricco for displaying an intentional disregard and plain indifference to regulatory requirements bricco said in an interview that the problems at his shop were the fault of his employees who ran the store while he was working another job during the day have tips about inspections at gun stores contact us at gunstoreinspections thetrace org email us i got bamboozled bricco said there wasn t much i could do instead of revoking his license bricco said the atf allowed him to stay open for about six more months so he could sell off his stock of firearms bricco voluntarily surrendered his gun dealer s license after that period but the agency let him remain in business as an ammunition manufacturer he rebranded as 1st class ammo and transferred the shop s leftover gun inventory to himself a legal maneuver that enabled him to keep selling the firearms in private sales in much of the country private sales require no background checks in january 2016 1st class ammo shared a facebook post directing people to gunbroker com where bricco was selling four sig sauer pistols so it s a private sale one facebook user asked yes all private sales 1st class ammo responded you can see them on display in the ammo store some current and former atf officials defended the inspection program as an effective way of ensuring gun dealers

defense for intelligence for diversion of firearms with straw purchases brandon said brandon who now works in sales for a ballistics technology firm that contracts with the atf and law enforcement said the agency focuses its limited resources on the 1 doing it wrong in an emailed response to questions atf spokesman andre miller portrayed the penalties as tools to guide dealers into correcting violations and ensure future compliance he said the agency can revoke licenses only for willful violations and supervisors consider the totality of the inspection and its unique circumstances to ensure consistent enforcement nationwide the nature of the violations and their impact on public safety as well as atf s ability to reduce violent crime are significant considerations for the appropriate action miller said dealers inspected once every seven years a division of the justice department the atf is responsible for policing the 78 000 gun dealers manufacturers and importers in the u s it employs more than 700 investigators who perform unannounced compliance reviews digging through business records to make sure gun sellers are not providing weapons to people who shouldn t have them the goal is to inspect each license holder at least once every three years but federal data shows the agency has averaged 15 of dealers annually between fiscal years 2010 and 2019 this means dealers were visited about once every seven years of all the inspections during that decade at least a third 35 500 found dealers had broken state or federal firearms laws the agency data shows more than 81 of violators received no penalty or a written warning the atf sought revocation of only 580 violators or 1 6 in the 2020 fiscal year as the coronavirus pandemic snarled government operations

licenses revoked tweet facebook reddit share this article on reddit email email this story share share this story the most common violations cited by the atf were for gun sellers failing to acquire customers personal details omitting information required on federal forms and not keeping proper inventory and sales records the most common violations cited by the atf were for gun sellers failing to acquire customers personal details omitting information required on federal forms and not keeping proper inventory and sales records according to the reports analyzed by the trace and usa today former atf officials and gun dealers said such violations are usually innocent mistakes stemming from the labyrinthine rules governing gun sales but even seemingly minor paperwork errors can indicate a dealer s involvement in more serious forms of lawbreaking or can stymie law enforcement investigations into major crimes whenever you hear people say there s plenty of laws on the books there really aren t what there are are a lot of paperwork violations where you misrepresented something on a piece of paper said scot thomasson the atf s former chief of public affairs but what each one of these paper violations represents is a crime a crime gun and the diversion of firearms to the illegal market gun dealers almost never face criminal charges when violations are discovered in an inspection former atf officials attributed the agency s permissive regulatory approach to longstanding staffing and funding shortages as well as federal laws that shield the gun industry from accountability over the past 35 years gun groups have successfully pressured congress to limit the frequency of inspections restrict atf from consolidating and computerizing records and make it more difficult for the agency to take dealers licenses away in 1986 the national rifle association successfully lobbied for the passage of the firearm owners protection act which prevents the atf from inspecting existing gun dealers more than once a year after 9 11 congress required that the atf audit each of the nation s 9 400 explosives dealers once every three years effectively forcing it to deprioritize gun dealer inspections the number of gun dealer inspections plunged falling from an average of nearly 12 000 inspections a year in the 1990s to less than 7 000 a year in the 2000s atf is a very small agency a very unpopular agency and as a result there are a lot of people trying to push them around said howard wolfe a former atf supervisor who oversaw inspections in pittsburgh pennsylvania until he retired in 2006 wolfe said the investigators under his command would need to have visited multiple gun shops every day to meet the atf s inspection goals there was no way wolfe said people went years without being inspected and that s a big problem because how do you know how somebody s doing if you don t have a chance to go out and take a look at their records atf investigators spent an average of 84 hours on each of the inspections examined by the trace and usa today one particularly taxing case in houston took 995 hours the equivalent of half a year of workdays the investigator recommended revoking the license but was rebuffed by the industry operations director who cited the length of time taken to complete the assignment in another case in kansas a pawn shop transferred an ak 47 type rifle and a glock to a woman acquiring the weapons on behalf of her boyfriend a convicted felon court records indicate in february 2016 he used those guns to shoot 17 people in a rampage across the towns of newton and hesston an atf inspector visited a pawn shop several months later and found the store had failed to obtain proper ids sold a handgun to a self identified domestic abuser and hadn t been ascertaining whether its customers were straw purchasers according to an agency report the atf downgraded the penalty to a written warning because the store had never received an inspection in its six years of business had the atf gone in there and done an inspection earlier it might have caused this shop to clean up its act it might have prevented a mass shooting said david morantz an attorney who represented one of the hesston shooting victims surviving family members in a wrongful death lawsuit against the shop the lawsuit resulted in a 2 million settlement the shop is now closed teresa ficaretta a former senior atf attorney who went into private practice helping gun industry clients comply with the law said limited resources had led the bureau to focus on inspecting dealers who sell large numbers of crime guns frequently transfer large quantities of firearms to a single customer or raise other red flags ficaretta said that was a poor substitute for regular inspections and could embolden dealers willing to break the law tweet facebook reddit share this article on reddit email email this story share share this story teresa ficaretta a former senior atf attorney if

happens quote icon if licensees knew that atf was going to show up like clockwork they would put a lot more effort into maintaining compliance she said but right now there s this incentive for them to roll the dice and see what happens the size of the atf s inspections staff has been stagnant for decades in early 2016 after a mass shooting at a holiday banquet that killed 14 people in san bernardino california the obama administration rolled out a gun violence prevention plan that included a request for nearly 12 3 million to add 120 atf investigators the republican controlled congress balked with one gop member of the house appropriations committee saying lawmakers would not support the development of unlawful limitations on the unambiguous second amendment rights of americans b todd jones a former u s attorney who served as the atf s last senate confirmed leader before resigning in 2015 said that despite the 20 plus years of regulatory handcuffs investigators work hard to balance compliance and the adversarial relationship needed to provide oversight we did our best to plug holes and stop the worst offenders said jones who is now chief disciplinary officer for the nfl it s like setting up a speed trap you re not going to stop everyone and if you get caught speeding you have to deal with it but what s the alternative no regulation at all during delays guns end up in wrong hands the atf investigators who inspect gun stores do not carry badges or guns and cannot make arrests they can recommend hitting problem gun stores with penalties known as adverse actions but the ultimate outcome of an inspection depends heavily on directors of industry operations who make the final call the trace and usa today found wide variation in the penalties handed down by field divisions for example at the louisville field division which covers kentucky west virginia and southern indiana reporters identified 12 cases in which investigators found that a dealer s violations warranted revocation nine of those recommendations were approved by the division s industry operations director in contrast the industry operations director for the seattle field division which covers washington oregon idaho alaska hawaii and guam approved only one revocation out of the seven recommended by investigators jim zammillo a former atf deputy assistant director who oversaw the inspection program from 2004 to 2010 said the justice department s inspector general and other agency watchdogs had repeatedly faulted the bureau for applying adverse actions inconsistently prompting it to initiate a series of improvements beginning in the early 2000s chief among the reforms was a new set of guidelines establishing the minimum penalties to be issued when violations were found the guidelines specified that penalties should increase for repeat offenses and any field division wishing to spare a dealer from revocation had to get approval from headquarters know someone interested in nationwide gun store inspections by the atf share this story the increased oversight led to greater standardization zammillo said but it also caused consternation among field division heads they viewed it like i m the sheriff this is my department and i m going to run it the way that i want to zammillo said john jarowski a former industry operations director in st paul minnesota offered another explanation saying downgrades to less serious punishments help temper strict investigators inspectors go in and they want the kill they want the scalp on their belt jarowski said proprietors who receive a final revocation notice have 60 days to file an appeal in federal court a costly process that often just delays the process for months or years u s attorneys represent the government in those cases on behalf of the atf many times when the u s attorney steps in he d say this dog won t hunt and they d drop it jarowski said so you have to think about spending your resources wisely in many areas of civil and criminal law defendants cannot use ignorance as an excuse for unlawful behavior when it comes to gun sellers congress has stipulated that they can lose their licenses only for violations committed willfully forcing the atf to prove that dealers knew the rules and intentionally disregarded them jack dick s pawn shop in junction city kansas received warning letters in 2013 and 2014 and attended a warning conference in 2016 when the atf returned in 2017 it uncovered four additional violations including making false statements in required records a report shows a notice to customers entering jack and dick s pawn shop in junction city kansas lets the public know they can carry firearms inside evert nelson usa today network the false statements charge stemmed from the case of a fort riley army soldier who d accidentally shot himself in the hand using a pistol from the shop according to a police report the soldier 20 was underage for handgun purchases in kansas he had had a friend fill out the paperwork atf records indicate the investigator pushed to revoke jack dick s license based on evidence that the shop had ignored obvious signs of a straw purchase including when the friend paid using the soldier s credit card the investigator was overruled by higher ups who said it wasn t clear whether the employee knew he had accepted the wrong credit card the atf decided to give jack dick s another written warning the owner of the shop declined to comment for this article in 2017 and 2020 the shop released surveillance photos and video on its facebook page of other attempted straw purchases in an effort to expose the crime when the atf does decide to revoke a dealer s license the agency s delay in putting the penalty into effect can allow guns to wind up in the wrong hands jc s guns tackle shop in huntsville alabama received its first compliance inspection in 2013 resulting in a warning conference investigators returned two years later for a second inspection that uncovered 13 violations six of them repeated according to an atf report the shop had failed to report multiple sales falsified forms and sold guns to people who d self identified as being prohibited it failed to conduct background checks on customers but did use the background check system to screen employees which is illegal the report indicates investigators also discovered that employees had facilitated multiple straw purchases selling weapons to stand ins when background checks on the actual buyers were delayed it took the atf 16 months to revoke jc s license during that time according to court records the shop sold 11 handguns to a straw purchaser buying them on behalf of her boyfriend a convicted felon officials cite dealer ignorance to justify leniency investigators do not carry badges or guns and have no arrest authority they carry an atf photo credential instead gun store owners offered the atf a litany of excuses to explain away violations the agency spared a nebraska pawn shop from revocation after the owner said he was very busy and overwhelmed a pennsylvania sporting goods store was allowed to keep selling firearms despite being cited three times in four years for failing to report multiple handgun sales during the last inspection in 2016 the owner told an atf investigator he meant to file the reports but did not get around to it felex yukhtman said he trusted the wrong people to manage his small gun manufacturing business in bradenton florida yukhtman s company gun point specializes in building custom ars in 2017 an atf supervisor upheld an inspector s recommendation to shut yukhtman down after a review of his books turned up 15 violations they included the possession of illegal machine guns later seized by agents yukhtman was also missing 250 firearms he said in an interview the supervisor criticized yukhtman for having shown a pattern of repeated violations despite the atf educating the licensee through every inspection and through every warning conference since 2008 the industry operations director overturned the recommendation and summoned yukhtman in for another warning conference yukhtman says he believes he was spared because he reached out to the atf for advice and put in place safeguards to prevent further mistakes they re not there to take your license or make your life miserable yukhtman

ever committed to a mental institution or are otherwise precluded from possessing firearms the price of a firearms license ranges from 30 for vintage gun collectors and ammunition manufacturers to as much as 3 000 to sell strictly regulated weapons such as mortars and grenades the license held by many retail gun dealers costs 200 for the first three years and 90 for every renewal applicants do not have to undergo training or pass a test the atf instead has dealers sign a document attesting to their knowledge of gun laws and regulations before opening for business still atf officials have routinely pointed to dealer ignorance to justify leniency a dealer in pounding mill virginia avoided a warning conference after expressing his apparent shock according to a report at learning of the requirement to report customers who made back to back handgun purchases the national shooting sports foundation the gun industry s trade group works with the atf to educate license holders about how to stay within the bounds of the law and prevent illegal trafficking by and large firearm retailers are law abiding and follow local state and federal authorities said mark oliva a national shooting sports foundation spokesman we re members of our community mom and pop shops committed to keeping our communities safe the foundation recruits consultants and former atf inspectors to put shops through mock inspections for 750 the organization will run a full day compliance check that produces a confidential report of shortcomings it also hosts a hotline for retail federal firearm license holders which oliva said receives hundreds of calls a year but rich marianos a former atf assistant director said the foundation is committed to keeping regulation as weak as possible in 2020 it spent 4 5 million on lobbying more than twice as much as the national rifle association which spent 2 2 million according to opensecrets org a nonpartisan research group that tracks money in politics they re like the nra marianos said never once have they said the atf needs more money help support or resources oliva disputes that characterization he provided confidential records of the group s lobbying of congress in recent years to add millions for atf s licensing system and millions more to improve criminal background checks at the department of justice postscript the legacy of uncle sam s the call that started the unraveling of the gun trafficking operation at uncle sam s in west virginia came in april 2015 the girlfriend of a former employee contacted an atf agent to say she had learned that her name had been wrongfully listed in the store s records as the purchaser of shotguns rifles and a pistol according to court records she later told an atf agent that steven adkins had paid her 75 each time she filled out a background check form for a firearm destined for another person it was a scheme adkins had been running for at least six years and he d kept it hidden from the atf even though investigators had inspected the shop over that timeframe after being indicted in late 2015 adkins told the atf that he had hatched the gun trafficking arrangement at the behest of the store s founder roger d muncy according to court records adkins claimed muncy became furious at employees for blocking gun sales and if customers indicated on the federal form that they were prohibited from purchasing firearms muncy had them fill out a new form and instructed them how to record their answers so that the sale could go through adkins estimated that 70 of the gun sales at uncle sam s were illegal the case reverberated across the small town of man where adkins and muncy were serving on the city council in 2008 the city had renamed a street in muncy s honor adkins pleaded guilty in 2016 and the atf pulled uncle sam s gun license adkins who has since been released from prison declined requests to be interviewed for this article muncy was never charged but the revocation didn t stop him from profiting from guns after losing the license to sell firearms at uncle sam s he rented the store to a state trooper who obtained his own license and continued running a gun shop at the location the arrangement lasted until july 2019 when the two parties had a falling out in his testimony muncy denied wrongdoing in the adkins case he went on to operate uncle sam s as a pawn shop until he died in december at the age of 68 his wife died four days later since then the day to day management of the store has fallen to their son roger d b muncy who hopes to get back in the gun

issued london uk and san francisco us treatment with sotrovimab resulted in an 85 reduction in the risk of hospitalisation or death in high risk adult outpatients compared to placebo based on interim results from phase 3 comet ice trial in vitro data indicate sotrovimab maintains activity against all known variants of concern including the variant from india sotrovimab will be available for appropriate patients diagnosed with covid 19 in the u s in the coming weeks discussions with global regulators regarding authorisations in additional countries continue to advance glaxosmithkline plc lse nyse gsk and vir biotechnology inc nasdaq vir today announced the u s food and drug administration fda granted an emergency use authorization eua for sotrovimab previously vir 7831 an investigational single dose monoclonal antibody for the treatment of mild to moderate covid 19 in adults and paediatric patients 12 years of age and older weighing at least 40 kg with positive results of direct sars cov 2 viral testing and who are at high risk for progression to severe covid 19 including hospitalisation or death adrienne e shapiro m d ph d an infectious disease specialist at fred hutchinson cancer research center and investigator in the comet ice trial said monoclonal antibodies like sotrovimab are potentially one of our most effective tools for fighting covid 19 while preventive measures including vaccines can reduce the total number of cases sotrovimab is an important treatment option for those who become ill with covid 19 and are at high risk allowing them to avoid hospitalisation or worse george scangos ph d chief executive officer of vir said our distinctive scientific approach has led to a single monoclonal antibody that based on an interim analysis resulted in an 85 reduction in all cause hospitalisations or death and has demonstrated in vitro that it retains activity against all known variants of concern including the emerging variant from india i believe that sotrovimab is a critical new treatment option in the fight against the current pandemic and potentially for future coronavirus outbreaks as well at vir our aim is not only to deliver a clinically effective therapy for covid 19 but also to provide effective therapy against sars cov 2 variants and potential pandemics of tomorrow dr hal barron chief scientific officer and president r d gsk said the fast pace of covid 19 vaccinations in the u s is encouraging yet despite these aggressive efforts there is still a need to help prevent infected patients from developing complications in just over a year since starting our collaboration and in less than 10 months since beginning clinical trials we are delighted that as of today the benefits of this unique monoclonal antibody will now be available to patients in need sotrovimab has been granted an eua by the fda to facilitate the availability and use of this investigational monoclonal antibody for the treatment of covid 19 in the u s while the pandemic remains a public health emergency the fda fact sheet for healthcare providers regarding the emergency use of sotrovimab reflects the recently updated definition of high risk for covid 19 to include additional medical conditions and factors associated with increased risk for progression to severe disease the eua for sotrovimab also includes post authorisation commitments as specified in the letter of authorization sotrovimab is continuing to be studied in ongoing clinical trials an analysis of safety and efficacy data at day 29 for the full population from the comet ice trial is expected as early as the first half of 2021 gsk and vir plan to submit a biologics license application bla to the fda in the second half of 2021 evidence of sotrovimab s profound clinical efficacy the eua was granted to sotrovimab based on an interim analysis of efficacy and safety data from the phase 3 comet ice covid 19 monoclonal antibody efficacy trial intent to care early trial in high risk adult outpatients which was stopped early by an independent data monitoring committee in march 2021 due to evidence of profound clinical efficacy as previously announced interim study results demonstrated an 85 p 0 002 reduction in hospitalisation for more than 24 hours or death in those receiving sotrovimab compared to placebo the primary endpoint of the trial the most common adverse events observed in the sotrovimab treatment group in comet ice were rash 2 and diarrhoea 1 all of which were grade 1 mild or grade 2 moderate no other treatment emergent adverse events were reported at a higher rate with sotrovimab compared to placebo the eua includes a warning for hypersensitivity including anaphylaxis and infusion related reactions in vitro data indicate sotrovimab maintains activity against all known variants of concern sotrovimab targets a conserved epitope of the spike protein that is less likely to mutate over time the eua submission also included data from published in vitro studies which demonstrated that sotrovimab maintains activity against all known circulating variants of concern including the variants from brazil p 1 california b 1 427 b 1 429 india b 1 617 new york b 1 526 south africa b 1 351 and the uk b 1 1 7 gsk and vir will continue to evaluate the ability of sotrovimab to maintain activity against new and emerging variants the clinical impact of these in vitro variant data is not yet known data collection and analysis is still ongoing gsk and vir s commitment to patient access to sotrovimab gsk and vir are actively working with government agencies around the world to make sotrovimab available to patients in need of treatment on 21 may 2021 the european medicines agency s ema committee for human medicinal products chmp issued a positive scientific opinion following the referral of sotrovimab to the chmp under article 5 3 of regulation 726 2004 the opinion relates to the use of sotrovimab for the treatment of adults and adolescents aged 12 years and over and weighing at least 40 kg with covid 19 who do not require oxygen supplementation and who are at risk of progressing to severe covid 19 the ema has also started a rolling review of data on sotrovimab that will continue until enough evidence is available to support the filing of a formal marketing authorisation application in april health canada initiated a review of sotrovimab under the expedited interim order application pathway for covid 19 drugs gsk and vir are continuing discussions with other global regulators on the regulatory pathways available so that sotrovimab can be made available to patients with covid 19 as soon as possible about the comet ice study design the multi center double blind placebo controlled phase 3 comet ice trial investigated intravenous iv infusion of sotrovimab in adults with mild or moderate covid 19 at high risk of progression to severe disease this ongoing trial evaluated the safety and efficacy of a single iv infusion of sotrovimab 500 mg or placebo in non hospitalised participants globally the safety of sotrovimab is primarily based on an interim analysis from 868 patients 430 patients in the treatment arm and 438 in the placebo arm through day 15 among those studied 63 were hispanic or latino and 7 were black or african american according to the centers for disease control and prevention these populations are approximately three times more likely to be hospitalised and approximately two times more likely to die of covid 19 the primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients who have progression of covid 19 as defined by the need for hospitalisation for greater than 24 hours for acute management of illness or death in march 2021 an independent data monitoring committee recommended that the comet ice trial be stopped for enrolment due to evidence of profound efficacy about the sotrovimab clinical development program in addition to the comet ice trial the full comet clinical development program for sotrovimab includes comet peak an ongoing phase 2 trial with two parts to compare the safety and viral kinetics of 500 mg intramuscularly im administered sotrovimab to 500 mg intravenously administered sotrovimab among low risk adults with mild to moderate covid 19 and to evaluate the similarity in pharmacokinetics between sotrovimab manufactured by different processes an ongoing phase 2 trial with two parts to compare the safety and viral kinetics of 500 mg intramuscularly im administered sotrovimab to 500 mg intravenously administered sotrovimab among low risk adults with mild to moderate covid 19 and to evaluate the similarity in pharmacokinetics between sotrovimab manufactured by different processes comet tail a phase 3 trial expected to begin in the second quarter of 2021 as an early treatment for covid 19 in high risk adults to assess whether im administered sotrovimab can reduce hospitalisation or death due to covid 19 a phase 3 trial expected to begin in the second quarter of 2021 as an early treatment for covid 19 in high risk adults to assess whether im administered sotrovimab can reduce hospitalisation or death due to covid 19 comet star a phase 3 trial expected to begin in the second half of 2021 in uninfected adults at high risk to determine whether im administered sotrovimab can prevent symptomatic infection sotrovimab was also evaluated in the outpatient setting in blaze 4 a phase 2 trial sponsored by eli lilly and company designed to assess the safety and efficacy of bamlanivimab ly cov555 alone and bamlanivimab with other neutralising antibodies including sotrovimab versus placebo in low risk adults with mild to moderate covid 19 an interim analysis found that bamlanivimab 700 mg co administered with sotrovimab 500 mg demonstrated a 70 relative reduction in patients with persistently high viral load at day 7 compared to placebo meeting the primary endpoint additionally sotrovimab along with vir 7832 is being evaluated in the phase 1b 2a national health service supported agile trial in adults with mild to moderate covid 19 vir 7832 is the second monoclonal antibody from the vir gsk collaboration to be investigated as a potential covid 19 treatment about sotrovimab previously vir 7831 sotrovimab is an investigational sars cov 2 monoclonal antibody preclinical data suggest it has the potential to both block viral entry into healthy cells and clear infected cells the antibody binds to an epitope on sars cov 2 that is shared with sars cov 1 the virus that causes sars indicating that the epitope is highly conserved which may make it more difficult for resistance to develop sotrovimab which incorporates xencor s xtend technology also has been designed to achieve high concentration in the lungs to ensure optimal penetration into airway tissues affected by sars cov 2 and to have an extended half life about vir 7832 gsk4182137 vir 7832 is an investigational dual action sars cov 2 monoclonal antibody preclinical data suggest it has the potential to both block viral entry into healthy cells and an enhanced ability to clear infected cells the antibody binds to an epitope on sars cov 2 that is shared with sars cov 1 the virus that causes sars indicating that the epitope is highly conserved which may make it more difficult for resistance to develop vir 7832 which incorporates xencor s xtend and other fc technologies has been designed to achieve high concentration in the lungs to ensure optimal penetration into airway tissues affected by sars cov 2 and to have an extended half life importantly vir 7832 also has been engineered to potentially enhance virus specific t cell function which could help treat and or prevent covid 19 infection the following is a summary of information for sotrovimab healthcare providers should review the fact sheets for information on the authorized use of sotrovimab and mandatory requirements of the eua please see the fda letter of authorization fact sheet for healthcare providers and fact sheet for patients parents and caregivers important information about sotrovimab sotrovimab has been authorized by the fda for the emergency use described below sotrovimab is not fda approved for this use sotrovimab is authorized only for the duration of the declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of the emergency use of sotrovimab under section 564 b 1 of the act 21 u s c 360bbb 3 b 1 unless the authorization is terminated or revoked sooner authorized use the u s food and drug administration fda has issued an emergency use authorization eua to permit the emergency use of the unapproved product sotrovimab for the treatment of mild to moderate coronavirus disease 2019 covid 19 in adults and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older weighing at least 40 kg with positive results of direct sars cov 2 viral testing and who are at high risk for progression to severe covid 19 including hospitalization or death limitations of authorized use sotrovimab is not authorized for use in patients who are hospitalized due to covid 19 or who require oxygen therapy due to covid 19 or who require an increase in baseline oxygen flow rate due to covid 19 in those on chronic oxygen therapy due to underlying non covid 19 related comorbidity benefit of treatment with sotrovimab has not been observed in patients hospitalized due to covid 19 sars cov 2 monoclonal antibodies may be associated with worse clinical outcomes when administered to hospitalized patients with covid 19 requiring high flow oxygen or mechanical ventilation important safety information for sotrovimab warnings there are limited clinical data available for sotrovimab serious and unexpected adverse events may occur that have not been previously reported with use of sotrovimab hypersensitivity including anaphylaxis and infusion related reactions serious hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis have been observed with administration of sotrovimab if signs and symptoms of a clinically significant hypersensitivity reaction or anaphylaxis occur immediately discontinue administration and initiate appropriate medications and or supportive care infusion related reactions occurring during the infusion and up to 24 hours after the infusion have been observed with administration of sotrovimab these reactions may be severe or life threatening signs and symptoms of infusion related reactions may include fever difficulty breathing reduced oxygen saturation chills fatigue arrhythmia e g atrial fibrillation sinus tachycardia bradycardia chest pain or discomfort weakness altered mental status nausea headache bronchospasm hypotension hypertension angioedema throat irritation rash including urticaria pruritus myalgia vaso vagal reactions e g pre syncope syncope dizziness and diaphoresis consider slowing or stopping the infusion and administer appropriate medications and or supportive care if an infusion related reaction occurs hypersensitivity reactions occurring more than 24 hours after the infusion have also been reported with the use of sars cov 2 monoclonal antibodies under emergency use authorization clinical worsening after sars cov 2 monoclonal antibody administration clinical worsening of covid 19 after administration of sars cov 2 monoclonal antibody treatment has been reported and may include signs or symptoms of fever hypoxia or increased respiratory difficulty arrythmia e g atrial fibrillation tachycardia bradycardia fatigue and altered mental status some of these events required hospitalization it is not known if these events were related to sars cov 2 monoclonal antibody use or were due to progression of covid 19 limitations of benefit and potential for risk in patients with severe covid 19 benefit of treatment with sotrovimab has not been observed in patients hospitalized due to covid 19 sars cov 2 monoclonal antibodies may be associated with worse clinical outcomes when administered to hospitalized patients with covid 19 requiring high flow oxygen or mechanical ventilation therefore sotrovimab is not authorized for use in patients who are hospitalized due to covid 19 or who require oxygen therapy due to covid 19 or who require an increase in baseline oxygen flow rate due to covid 19 in those on chronic oxygen therapy due to underlying non covid 19 related comorbidity the most common treatment emergent adverse events observed in the sotrovimab treatment group in comet ice were rash 2 and diarrhea 1 all of which were grade 1 mild or grade 2 moderate no other treatment emergent adverse events were reported at a higher rate with sotrovimab compared to placebo use in specific populations pregnancy there are insufficient data to evaluate a drug associated risk of major birth defects miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcome sotrovimab should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk for the mother and the fetus lactation there are no available data on the presence of sotrovimab in human milk the effects on the breastfed infant or the effects on milk production individuals with covid 19 who are breastfeeding should follow practices according to clinical guidelines to avoid exposing the infant to covid 19 about the vir and gsk collaboration in april 2020 vir and gsk entered into a collaboration to research and develop solutions for coronaviruses including sars cov 2 the virus that causes covid 19 the collaboration uses vir s proprietary monoclonal antibody platform technology to accelerate existing and identify new anti viral antibodies that could be used as therapeutic or preventive options to help address the current covid 19 pandemic and future outbreaks the companies will leverage gsk s expertise in functional genomics and combine their capabilities in crispr screening and artificial intelligence to identify anti coronavirus compounds that target cellular host genes they will also apply their combined expertise to research sars cov 2 and other coronavirus vaccines gsk commitment to tackling covid 19 gsk s response to covid 19 has been one of the broadest in the industry with three potential treatments in addition to our vaccine candidates in development with partner organisations gsk is collaborating with several organisations on covid 19 vaccines by providing access to our adjuvant technology in addition to our work with medicago we recently announced positive phase 2 data from our collaboration with sanofi to develop an adjuvanted protein based vaccine candidate and expect to begin a phase 3 trial in q2 an earlier stage collaboration with sk bioscience is also ongoing sk bioscience receives funding from cepi and the bill and melinda gates foundation to develop differentiated affordable covid 19 vaccines for supply globally through the covax facility the use of an adjuvant can be of particular importance in a pandemic since it may reduce the amount of vaccine protein required per dose allowing more vaccine doses to be produced and contributing to protecting more people based on experience with other adjuvanted vaccines there is potential for increased cross protection against covid 19 variants which will be further studied gsk is also working with mrna specialist curevac to jointly develop next generation multi valent mrna vaccines for covid 19 with the potential to address multiple emerging variants in one vaccine gsk will also support manufacturing of up to 100m doses of curevac s first generation covid 19 vaccine gsk is also providing manufacturing support for up to 60m doses of novavax covid 19 vaccine in the uk gsk is also exploring potential therapeutic or treatment options for covid 19 patients we are collaborating with vir biotechnology to develop existing and identify new anti viral antibodies that could be used as therapeutic or preventive options for covid 19 we recently reported that an independent data monitoring committee recommended that the phase 3 comet ice trial evaluating sotrovimab as monotherapy for the early treatment of covid 19 in adults at high risk of hospitalisation be stopped for enrolment due to evidence of profound efficacy based on an interim analysis of data from the trial we have received emergency use authorization in the u s and

article content the message from cornwall city council delivered to a via rail representative on monday night was as loud and clear as an air horn advertisement 2 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content we are extremely concerned about passenger rail service for cornwall said cornwall mayor bernadette clement during a via rail presentation on a major proposed multi billion dollar long term project for the toronto quebec city corridor high frequency rail hfr that would have new dedicated passenger rail track in the region we apologize but this video has failed to load tap here to see other videos from our team try refreshing your browser or cornwall council gets out in front of via changes by voicing concerns back to video it sounds good in principle hfr being described as transformative with more reliable service to more communities more daily departures and better on time performance but where does cornwall and area fit in article content the worry is accessing all of that improvement would have passengers having to drive to access hfr to perhaps brockville or alexandria and that via has already literally abandoned cornwall by not having staff at a station that s had little or no investment in years advertisement 3 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content the city actually invited via rail to its council meeting and it was philippe cannon a director who turned out to be in the line of fire acknowledged by councillors as just the messenger but nonetheless one who was delivering unsettling and incomplete information still smarting over the recent news that greyhound canada was closing bus service across quebec and ontario a pre emptive strike from the mayor and councillors made it clear cornwall and area can t afford a transportation blow in the form of reduced train service when you look at that proposed train route map graphic cornwall looks pretty lonely sitting there compared to other municipalities the mayor told cannon to get to the new dedicated track roughly running in this region along the highway 417 corridor do we have to first drive to alexandria or brockville or ottawa we seem to be the community furthest away from accessing a new dedicated via line advertisement 4 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content it s not the first time the issue of having convenient quick travel between cornwall and the 417 corridor has come up when asked directly by coun syd gardiner if hfr would mean a reduction in services and stops for cornwall cannon said no no reduction the whole concept is to give more communities more service but specifically for cornwall and fearing the devil will eventually appear in the details council was voicing concerns long before train service could potentially go to hell here that was the point of tuesday s exercise said coun elaine macdonald this hfr and cornwall s place in it is a most unwelcome development it certainly doesn t serve our community better in this era when people are being urged to park their cars and use public transit this is going against the current of the time advertisement 5 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content clement reminded cannon cornwall isn t a one stoplight town that combined with akwesasne and the counties i would argue that there are 100 000 people here looking at this and thinking ok we have a big strategic plan to grow the region which is working by the way people are moving from the larger centres and working remotely but lack of via rail investment in cornwall taking away station staff and putting up paid parking has not helped at all and sends an opposite message a message that you don t want our business said coun justin towndale we re a town that relies heavily on connecting links whenever service is reduced to our community there is an impact including economically these are tough comments and questions for via rail but it s because we want to see cornwall succeed and have the economic drivers to ensure that advertisement 6 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content supplied cannon in his presentation said via rail owns just three per cent of the rail it operates on and that hfr would change that and ultimately serve the greater good of all communities and he said that with kingston identified as an hfr hub that a train would leave from that city early in the morning would arrive in cornwall far earlier than one departing from toronto via s hfr proposal was released in the summer of 2017 and relies on discontinued and existing railway rights of way portions of it rely on using the existing line on which via s trains between ottawa and montreal already run as via would own more track along this route it is less complicated to electrify and place high speed rolling stock on the line advertisement 7 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content the hfr would alleviate pressure the crown corporation faces in the montreal toronto corridor where it runs on cn rail s mainline and sees its schedule and

there s arguably never been a product with a greater chance of fda approval pfizer pfe 1 72 and biontech bntx 1 55 have filed for u s food and drug administration fda approval for their covid 19 vaccine that has already been given to millions of americans after receiving emergency use authorization eua in this motley fool live video recorded on may 17 healthcare and cannabis bureau chief corinne cardina and motley fool contributor keith speights discuss why this fda approval could basically be a slam dunk 10 stocks we like better than pfizer when investing geniuses david and tom gardner have a stock tip it can pay to listen after all the newsletter they have run for over a decade motley fool stock advisor has tripled the market david and tom just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now and pfizer wasn t one of them that s right they think these 10 stocks are even better buys see the 10 stocks stock advisor returns as of may 11 2021 corinne cardina pfizer and biontech were the first to receive emergency use authorization from the fda back in december for their two dose mrna vaccine as of now more than 61 million people in the u s have been fully vaccinated with this vaccine now the companies have filed for full fda approval of its covid 19 vaccine in the population of people 16 and older the application is on a rolling basis and the company has requested priority review which if that s accepted it would set the deadline to be about six months rather than the usual 10 let s talk about what investors should know about what full approval would mean for pfizer biontech in the longer term vaccination efforts in the u s keith speights all right well corinne you re right pfizer and biontech have requested priority review from the fda i personally expect that the fda will grant this priority review to the companies this status by the way is given to drugs or in this case a vaccine that could have an especially great impact on the treatment of a disease i don t think there s any argument that this vaccine doesn t meet that criteria i do expect that the fda is going to give priority review if the agency does indeed get priority review then we re probably looking at full fda approval of the pfizer biontech vaccine toward the end of this year i do expect that practically speaking though full fda approval won t mean much from a financial impact for either of these companies the vaccine is already on the market under the eua program pfizer and biontech are already getting supply deals the full fda approval won t really make a difference unless of course for some wild reason they didn t win that full fda approval then that would make a huge difference i don t think anyone sees that coming corinne we usually don t like to say there is such a thing as a slam dunk when it comes to fda approval but in this case this is probably about as close to a slam dunk as you re ever going to get with the fda i just can t imagine a scenario where the pfizer biontech vaccine would not win full fda approval it s been shown to be safe and effective it s being given to millions of americans if the fda came out and didn t approve this vaccine this would be one of the biggest healthcare stories of the century
fears of a looming media crackdown are growing in hong kong amid escalating efforts by authorities and pro beijing media to magnify the issue of fake news in the city in february chief executive carrie lam vowed to introduce new laws that would target doxxing making hate and discriminatory speech and disseminating fake news since then calls for a fake news law have been bolstered by figures including the police chief and pro beijing lawmakers and media outlets but others worry that the introduction of such a law would be accompanied by broader media censorship especially of newspapers highly critical of the government such as apple daily the tabloid owned by jailed media mogul jimmy lai on monday the issue of fake news was brought to the fore again after a number of pro beijing newspapers including state owned wen wei po and ta kung pao published exposés calling into doubt the story of k a first aider during the 2019 protests who was allegedly blinded by a bean bag round fired by the police south china morning post s kanis leung reported on the controversy after her repeated refusal two years ago to reveal her medical records to police who denied being responsible for her injury pro establishment media and politicians in hong kong have renewed their claims that she could have faked or exaggerated her case prompting the hospital authority on tuesday to reject accusations it had been involved in any such cover up protesters claimed she could have been blinded by the incident and used it as an example of alleged police brutality shouting slogans calling for an eye for an eye during a protest at hong kong international airport the controversy erupted the day before when the oriental daily news quoting exclusive sources said the woman had been spotted leaving for taiwan on september 30 last year the report which carried photographs said to be of k at the city s international airport added that her eyes looked bright and she appeared normal pro establishment lawmaker elizabeth quat referring to how the injury had deepened protesters anger towards the police force and sparked more demonstrations said the woman s case had caused far reaching harm in hong kong and called on the government to set up a law to crack down on fake information the story of k is just one bugbear for pro establishment officials in hong kong others have focused criticism on media coverage of the 8 31 incident in which police attacked subway commuters in prince edward station some protestors believe that civilians were killed in the station that evening although no evidence has emerged to substantiate the allegation the police chief also attacked media outlets for inciting hatred following negative coverage of the police s activities on national security education day during which children were photographed playing with toy police assault rifles and bazookas earlier this month the new york times austin ramzy reported on the police force s public fake news campaign and anxieties among those in the local media business the 12 page magazine distributed on wednesday to news outlets including the new york times described the police s efforts to push back against misinformation in one instance the department countered rumors that officers had attended a banquet with gang members saying the police had held their own private dinner in another it accused a local television station of smearing the police in a parody show fake news is highly destructive read one graphic carrying the hashtag youarewhatyousend there is no doubt it is the worst of times said chris yeung the chairman of the hong kong journalists association mr yeung said that the government s push against what it called fake news was an attempt to avoid accountability for public discontent they will also try to redefine the 2019 protests as something that happened because of misleading information not because of wrong decisions by the chief executive police misconduct or failed policies he said most squarely in the crosshairs may be apple daily the pro democracy newspaper owned by media mogul jimmy lai who is currently in jail for illegal assembly and pending trial for national security charges pro beijing outlets have repeatedly attacked the newspaper in recent months last week the hong kong stock exchange halted trading in the shares of its publisher next digital after police froze all of lai s assets under the national security law heightening fears about the company s future on sunday afp s su xinqi reported on the uncertain future for apple daily i am facing the greatest crisis since i took up the post over three years ago apple daily s chief editor ryan law told afp just days before authorities used a new national security law to freeze lai s assets including his media empire shares as china s crackdown gathered pace in the wake of 2019 s huge and often violent democracy protests mainland authorities made no secret of their desire to see apple daily and its next digital parent group shuttered zoe a reporter who has been at apple daily for more than five years described a constant weight pressing down on her the morale is rather bad she told afp asking to use a pseudonym to speak freely it feels like something is approaching us i worry that some day soon i may not be able to work in the press but not all newspapers are necessarily under threat in a sign of how political power has shifted since the passing of the national security law the stories and editorials put out by state affiliated media outlets in hong kong have become increasingly influential for hong kong free press yuen chan interviewed ching cheong a former deputy editor at wen wei po a state owned newspaper whose recent media campaigns along with those of fellow state owned outlet ta kung pao may indicate the return of influential mainland mouthpieces in the city

by ingo ploger entrepreneur and president of ceal brasil after major depressions comes strong economic growth after the pandemic it seems that in 2022 we will have global and regional growth above average the surprise is that global production chains remain unbalanced and highly fragile due to large regional concentrations a lack of flexible options and constant shortages electronic components such as chips show a total lack of capacity to balance demand the automotive sector so far has not recovered precisely due to the lack of these components at the beginning of the pandemic car production lines were turned off along with production of processing iron aluminum copper plastics and packaging but the 2020 crisis did not happen as generally expected demand rose sharply in various sectors industrial products for example received much higher than expected orders from the consumer pharmaceutical civil construction and agribusiness industries this imbalance in the production chains led the global industry to manage a crisis that did not come from the sales side but from the supply side prices rose and now reducing the shortage of productive elements has become an urgent priority initially it was thought that the shortage would be fleeting and that with the normalization after the pandemic everything would go back to normal but in most global companies this is no longer the forecast this imbalance was caused by an unusual reason suppliers concentrated in a few countries early withdrawal from production and a lack of supply options that is why the ones who adapted best this time were neither the biggest nor the fastest as we may be less global and more digital in the future the global production chain needs to be completely overhauled you must decentralize your suppliers and develop more creative sustainable and diversified options in different regions in fact many took new investments out of the drawer and others already planned are becoming a reality however the question remains everything in asia in europe japan and the united states some investments are being taken back home even though they have higher costs and are less competitive others are looking for new locations to increase diversity and safety the attention of strategic investors suddenly turned to latin america despite all the news and the reputation of the region suddenly the results are not so bad and the indicators of productivity and rapid adaptability show its resilience stock exchanges ipos startups and reported mergers and acquisitions show this trend countries like peru chile paraguay and uruguay despite the insecurity that the news may transmit argentina appears well referenced in agribusiness and energy brazil and mexico two engines in the region are receiving several of these investments on the international stage chinese companies followed by american and then european ones continue to have a great appetite for multilatinas to complete their long production chains it is important to differentiate the news from the facts we have seen the news of the companies that leave latin america as in the case of ford walmart among others but if we look carefully we see that the investment volume of the companies that enter is much greater than the investment of the ones leaving large companies will anchor regional development but in terms of innovation employability and sustainability medium sized companies will be the ones that will make the difference in this aspect the policies of industrialization and recovery of growth come into play we have already seen this scene in several latin american development scenarios which have no happy ending will we lose this opportunity again during the last 30 years latin american nations deindustrialized the continent early in the name of globalization currency stability and modernity the central banks abandoned the floating of their currencies to face inflation and established interest rate policies much higher than international ones in addition on account of these actions they postponed relevant reforms these policies stabilized currencies and brought the region s indebtedness below that of developed countries making economic indicators more favorable for investors however the permanent appreciation of currencies and higher interest rates do not benefit the international competitiveness of commodities for this reason there was an early deindustrialization which increased the area of services in gdp without generating the increase in per capita income that occurred in most industrialized countries at the same time democratic pressures for social issues made the state have a greater presence with worse services today we have an industrial underrepresentation and the added value of the entire economy is still small thus was a population of almost 450 million inhabitants with a per capita far below what is possible but it seems that we would have a more favorable scenario in the future due to the breaking of the chains they generate higher prices for raw materials and they produce a generalized devaluation of the currencies of the region that puts us at competitive levels exporting today makes sense we improve competitiveness and with more employment in industry we can expect a significant improvement in the quality of life the question is until when is it sustainable when they come out of the crisis the u s and europe will have higher interest rates and will continue their monetary easing plans devaluing their currencies in relation to others which will put pressure on the appreciation of our currencies however raw materials will not lower their prices as quickly and the trend towards diversification of supply will benefit investments in latin america if we do not want to lose this opportunity again public reindustrialization policies must focus on global production chains local synergies and the vocation of the region sustainability is here to stay and is part of regional vocations being an indisputable preference of global consumers regional integration has enormous potential for synergy in logistics energy services and sustainability employability together with quality of life is in the direct promotion of small and medium sized enterprises where new agendas are expected such as cooperativism not only in products but mainly in services and in the stimulation of innovation and entrepreneurship this time central banks will have the herculean task of ensuring that there is more competition to improve competitiveness in the supply of credit raising interest rates and raising the exchange rate are poisonous for reindustrialization central banks will have to balance emergency social loans with supply for small and medium sized enterprises using real competition between banks the private financial sector moved away from its social function during the pandemic leaving the most difficult and important part to public banks financial sector performance was the best among many sectors the increase in liquidity is shown in their balance sheets and in the emergency the central banks were more concerned with keeping liquidity and inflation under control now they must support the positive investment environment and secure competitive short and long term credit the new fintech technologies help in this trend to facilitate the intermediation of financial services at more competitive prices but central banks will have a more relevant mission for reindustrialization reindustrialization will have new characteristics greater innovation digitization and insertion in the production chains including small and medium sized companies in the best sustainability practices the new industry in latin america will be digitized with high international competence flexible sustainable and adapted to the new governance model am i the only one who sees this if not who do we need to convince

propaganda by labeling israel an apartheid state engaged in ethnic cleansing and war crimes furthermore the open endorsement of the bds movement which is inherently anti semitic as its primary goal is to deny the jewish people its right to self determination places a target on the backs of all jewish students on campus unsurprisingly not one jewish student helped in its writing now you may ask how does this demagogic language help to foster a peaceful campus community where students are able to freely express their ideas obviously it doesn t jewish and non jewish students alike were rightfully outraged and no one not even the university administration seems to care unsurprisingly not one jewish student helped in its writing now you may ask how does this demagogic language help to foster a peaceful campus community where students are able to freely express their ideas the statement accuses israel of perpetuating settler colonialism ethnic cleansing and apartheid to a reader unfamiliar with the conflict this extreme language may seem to be quite the indictment what is the goal to incite great hatred towards the only liberal democracy in the middle east and to the jewish people the only hope this conflict has of resolution is unity but this statement s many falsehoods serve only to divide the only hope this conflict has of resolution is unity but this statement s many falsehoods serve only to divide let s begin with what palestinians claim started the most recent conflict evictions from the sheikh jarrah neighborhood in jerusalem the statement echoes the assertion of some extremists that the evictions are an act of israeli settler colonialism this is a lie the sheikh jarrah dispute dates all the way back to 1865 when jews and muslims settled in the area around the same time two jewish trusts that shared a mission to develop the jewish population in jerusalem purchased land nearby in 1876 and formed two jewish neighborhoods shimon hatzadik and nahalat shimon in 1948 these neighborhoods were conquered by the transjordanian arab legion during the israeli war of independence and all jews were expelled from this area in 1956 the jordanian government arranged for the housing of 28 palestinian refugee families in the jewish neighborhoods where the families agreed to pay rent with the israeli government in control of the area after the 1967 six day war the jewish trusts requested the areas be returned to them in 1972 these claims were accepted in 1982 the trusts requested the removal of the 23 arab families that had stayed in the jewish area of the neighborhood the opposing sides struck an agreement the families would become protected tenants in exchange for the recognition of trust ownership however the trusts have claimed that the residents have not paid their rent since the agreement also according to the trusts some tenants have sought to destroy structures in the old jewish neighborhood including the synagogue a series of lawsuits have been brought to ensure the eviction of these families who still refuse to pay rent palestinians encouraged by hamas engaged in rioting under the belief that the courts would not side with them the case is clear this is not an issue of jews removing palestinians from the sheikh jarrah neighborhood it is simply recognizing the claims that the palestinians themselves acknowledged in 1982 the csg statement presents a gross over simplification of the incident at the center of the conflict in no way shape or form is this settler colonialism the csg statement presents a gross over simplification of the incident at the center of the conflict in no way shape or form is this settler colonialism now let s examine the csg s claim that israel is ethnically cleansing palestinians this pejorative term is widely used amongst anti semites and is irrefutably false ethnic cleansing is defined as rendering an area ethnically homogeneous by using force or intimidation to remove persons of given groups from the area 20 of israel s population is palestinian and they all have full and equal rights as jewish citizens there is no cleansing happening in israel instead hamas calls for the decimation of the jewish state and for the murder of all jews in their charter which side do you think is engaged in ethnic cleansing lastly the invocation of the term apartheid is deplorable it s ironic that many have become seemingly overnight experts in south african and middle eastern history to make such comparisons the term apartheid was coined in relation to the events that occurred in south africa it is defined as a policy or system of segregation or discrimination on grounds of race i reiterate arab israelis are 100 full citizens with the same civil and equal rights as jews they vote they can run for parliament they can intermarry and they can go to school and brunch with jews on the other hand if a muslim sells land to a jew in gaza they are executed the intent of the csg statement is clear to present a one sided summary of a conflict that has raged on for millennia in order to convince students of their lies the statement is full of falsehoods and misrepresentations and does no justice to the numerous israelis who have died throughout this conflict nor the many jews that have become the victims of anti semitic hate crimes there is no moral equivalency one side is the only jewish state in the world and the other is an internationally recognized terrorist organization hamas fired the first rockets and it seems that csg has no problem with the destruction of israel they have a lot of work to do to regain the trust of the student body hamas fired the first rockets and it seems that csg has no problem with the destruction of israel they have a lot of work to do to regain the trust of the student body it is scary to be a jew in america right now observant men must cover their yarmulkes to not be yelled at or spit on women are unable to walk with their children for fear of intimidation my family immigrated to this country as religious refugees to live harmoniously with our fellow citizens not to live in fear george washington in a letter to the hebrew congregation of newport in 1790 exemplified the importance of religious coexistence in our country may the children of the stock of abraham who dwell in this land continue to merit and enjoy the good will of the other inhabitants while every one shall sit in safety under his own vine and fig tree and there shall be none to make him afraid we must not allow these words to be erased for jewish americans are in grave danger the jewish people have always prevailed through misery and we will overcome these difficulties today to triumph once more visited 2 049 times 1 visits today

more neither road nor mountain cycling s gravel category takes the best of both worlds to create a backroad speed monster you get a lightweight bike with drop bars that churns through the miles but with the added stability and tire clearance of a mountain bike last month we spent a week in utah testing the latest gravel bikes on the market for 2021 we got up early came home late and refilled countless water bottles in between out of the dust emerged our choice for the best gravel bike specialized s diverge pro carbon campagnolo ltd is light capable incredibly stable and a hoot to ride in short the grandmaster of the bike industry specialized has really dialed in how to make a good bike so it was no surprise that it produced our choice for this year s best gravel bike with internal storage wide clearance a futuristic shock system and geometry that inspires pedaling off into the sunset and through the night and into the next day the diverge puts you in a position that inspires big miles specialized offers 12 models of the diverge gravel bike to meet all price points the diverge pro carbon campagnolo ltd 7 000 sits second from the crown just below the venerable s works

500 sram specialized diverge pro carbon gravel bike review before we go too far its important to share that 12 bikes rack the diverge lineup two of them share the diverge pro carbon name the diverge pro carbon and the diverge pro carbon campagnolo ltd we tested the diverge pro carbon campagnolo ltd unless we share otherwise we will refer to this bike as the pro carbon or simply the diverge outside the campy groupset and the smokey maroon finish the pro carbon bikes are entirely the same bike both have the latest future shock 2 0 the swat storage clearance to run 700c or 650b wheels and let s not forget a confidence inspiring geometry that every diverge bike in the lineup is known for more suspension like all of specialized s top tier diverge models the pro carbon uses the future shock 2 0 which is effectively 20 mm of suspension tucked inside the headset the future shock was first developed for the roubaix to help tackle cobbled roads turns out it works pretty well on gravel too the spring coil shock in the 2 0 has a hydraulic damper that feathers the compression and recoil inside the headset instead of the fork need more stack you can add up the 30 mm of stack from the lowest setting with the future shock or use a stem with positive rise to make it feel taller the damper is easy to adjust with the dial that replaces the headset cap turn it to the right and it stiffens the ride on climbs to the left it unleashes the shock s 20 mm of travel for those coming from the road world don t expect massive effects 20 mm is a far cry from the 120 mm of travel mountain bikers have on their cross country bike the future shock looks a little gimmicky maybe even a bygone component from a mountain bike circa 1990 but it pairs really well with the diverge it s just enough to quiet the vibrations on chip seal and gravel maybe more important than suspension is tire compatibility and clearance the diverge comes trimmed with specialized s own proprietary rubber our demo came as stock wrapped with 700 x 38c tires the frame and fork can accommodate up to 700 x 47c or 650b x 2 1 tires with 6 mm of clearance you can go bolder still but it will likely affect the collected mud from clearing the stay joints all of our bikes arrived tubeless inflated to upward of 60psi entirely too much for any gravel bike we reduced the tire pressure to the mid 20s and the 38s were suitable on gravel and road leaving just enough to negotiate the occasional erratic stone more gears power is directed to this pro carbon through campagnolo s new 1 13 groupset it s reputedly the lightest of its kind on the market and the first 1 13 for gravel the high and low end gears are fairly comparable to other bikes we tested the diverge ships stock up with a 38t chainring which is the smallest ring we tested during gravel week the extra ring on the cassette effectively creates smaller leaps between gears this might best be appreciated on the road where the lack of rolling resistance from gravel and steep hills benefit from being able to fine tune the gearing if we had a gripe it would likely be with this groupset choice thirteen cogs make this the largest cassette to date for a 1x and it s a lot of gears to squish inside a single cassette as such we found it a bit finicky in the middle ranges and sometimes struggled to immediately align with the cog the other diverge pro carbon model is powered by sram eagle a 1 12 with electronic shifting more storage specialized has been taking huge strides in developing better ways to store gear on and now in the bike the pro carbon comes with a swat door that allows you to stow supplies inside the down tube without compromising the structural integrity of the frame it s an ingenious place to stash extra food your tool kit a spare tube or even a wind jacket the swat door is also where you mount the down tube water bottle cage inside the frame s triangle because bolts go through the door it s best to pull the swat door wide open when mounting the cage otherwise you run the risk of dropping the bolt stopper inside the frame the diverge has six water bottle mounts with two inside the triangle and additional mounts on the top tube down tube and one on either fork so there s plenty of bosses to kit up for a 400 mile bikepacking race or overnighter ride tested testing multiple bikes ride after ride day after day gives you the ability to quickly assess the true gems from the ordinary outside the paint and tires many bikes are nuanced variations of each other they often look and feel very similar that is until we swung our legs over the diverge easing back into the saddle we immediately knew that the diverge would be different it feels more mountain ish in the saddle you get a sensation that you are riding inside the bike rather than on it looking at the numbers the geometry supports this geometry at the core of any bike is the frame s geometry longer chainstays will feel more flexy and stable on longer rides the length becomes a springboard a shorter wheelbase will feel stiffer and hence nimble and quick on the front end a fork s offset measures the horizontal distance between the hub and the steering axis it affects the bike s trail or the tire s footprint trailing behind the hub s axis a shorter offset means a longer trail giving the bike more stability a shorter trail will make the bike quick to turn specialized designed all models of the diverge with the intent to make the bike more capable and give the rider confidence off road but they didn t want to sacrifice that nimbleness you need for quick maneuvering on the road to get there specialized lengthened the reach made the head tube one degree slacker and increased the fork s offset by 5 mm the pro carbon had the longest offset hence shortest trail of all the bikes we tested they also lengthened the chainstays a few millimeters the length increased the wheelbase adding some 38 mm on a size 56 frame the average wheelbase we tested was 1 028 mm in a size medium the diverge measured 1 032 mm this made the diverge feel stable and eliminated toe overlap with the front wheel but we didn t think it was as nimble as some of the bikes in the test the 3t exploro max and open wi de both have a 5mm shorter offset but felt snappier they forego front suspension and have a shorter reach specialized is notorious for having low bottom brackets and with an 80mm drop it was the lowest of the bunch we tested this round specialized raised the bottom bracket s drop by 5 mm which allows you to run 650b wheels without clipping pedals in turns and it still keeps that fantastic stability that makes the diverge so much fun to ride the longer reach allowed the brand to put a shorter stem out front without disrupting the cockpit s overall length how s this work out in the saddle the shorter stem paired with the lower trail pulls the turning radius closer in and adds back a touch more nimbleness in tighter turns at speed this slows the steering effect of larger tires which we felt made the bike more lively on the front end the handlebars are compact enough to reach the brake levers while in the drops allowing you to take advantage of multiple handle positions the geometry compels tucking into the drops more than any other bike we found ourselves tucked in both while climb and descending our test course had a bit of everything neighborhood pavement highway double track single track hills to climb descents to bomb sand hard packed gravel straights and sandy turns our diverge was sent with 700c x 38mm tires run tubeless we deflated the tire pressure to 25 lbs to better handle the rough through it all the bike felt securely comfortable but it saved my lycra wrapped butt in one particular case with one hand gripping the gopro the other on the hoods i was filming my co tester on another bike while pedaling at roughly 20 mph focused on filming the gravel took a turn and i found myself pinched between a sand filled rut and encroaching desert scrub it had all the makings of a wipeout wednesday short ride before i knew it the tire hit the rut the bike wobbled i feathered the brakes with one hand and pulled through the episode with little more than frayed nerves good save i heard from the other side of the double track but i d chalk it up to good geometry value off the floor the pro carbon we tested will set you back 7 000 7 500 if you want to upgrade to the sram axs groupset with electronic shifting outside the groupset both come equipped with the swat storage the future shock 2 0 headset the 700c 650b clearance up to 47mm and the phantasmic specialized geometry but so do other bikes in the diverge lineup and that s probably the biggest value of specialized as a company they have the means to invest r d into top shelf products that trickle down the entire vertical the diverge line has 12 bikes the higher end builds s works pro expert and comp carbon feature the future shock 2 0 swat and variable layups of carbon frames you can get the diverge comp carbon with shimano ultegra for 4 200 the diverge comp e5 sport and base carbon models all use the future shock 1 5 a similar 20mm headset shock but sans the hydraulic damper that provides both compression and rebound damping with an sram apex drivetrain the diverge base carbon lists for 2 800 carbon pricing you out specialized has several aluminum models of the diverge you don t buy into the future shock system but you can still swap out 700c with 650b wheels and get that lovely well balanced diverge geometry bringing up the tail of the lineup the diverge base e5 can be had for 1 300 which we feel is an incredible value if money was no object and we had to choose between the diverge pro carbon and the pro carbon campagnolo we d pay the extra 500 for the pro carbon with sram what the cassette loses in one gear it gets back with consistency electronic shifting is really that good who s the diverge for sitting between road and mountain gravel bikes cover a wide range of territory designers tweak the geometry to move bikes toward one end or another on one side is the cyclocross ride it s stiffer lighter and quicker handling for high speed cornering on the other end mountain like adventure bikes have more clearance for fatter tires and a longer wheelbase for comfort the bottom bracket is lower and the head tube is long and has a more relaxed angle this all equates to more stability and comfort in the saddle to help make sense of it all we rode every bike tested during gravel week on the same course then we put every bike on a scale ranking bikes from 1 to 4 one indicates a bike is best suited for tamer gravel and speed with 4 being more capable of negotiating rocky rooted trails we slotted the pro carbon as a 3 for scale kona s libre s gnar friendly geometry and dropper post tipped the libre up to a 4 it rode like a rigid mountain bike with drops the alchemy a racy oriented thoroughbred was more appropriately a 2 the longish wheelbase and the lowest bottom bracket of the bunch the diverge is the most stable bike we tested which makes it perfect for long rides down drawn out gravel roads and the 20 mm of travel in the fork is just enough to hush the hand numbing chatter but not so much to negotiate rough single track the diverge s geometry pushes your weight further forward and the stem is longer too this balances your weight between the butt feet and hands allowing you to go farther more comfortably while the geometry and 20 mm of travel are what makes the diverge a standout it takes away from its ability to race tight cornered courses on the road it had the shortest trail we tested during gravel bike but we there were other bikes that felt more nimble the 3t exploro max open wi de or alchemy are more racy can it race sure but it s best suited for ultradistance bikepacking races where you get the comfort but don t need that responsive handling

based on west virginia senator joe manchin s own past comments there s no way that the democrat should vote to confirm david chipman as head of the bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives but manchin himself has been coy about whether he ll give chipman the nod when the full senate votes to confirm biden s nominee as permanent director of the atf advertisement back in 2012 manchin expressed some support for imposing new restrictions on modern sporting rifles but since then has shied away from embracing a ban in 2018 the senator told msnbc that he wouldn t take anyone s gun away and in 2019 he was even more explicit when robert francis beto o rourke declared that if he was elected president he d pass a mandatory confiscation of firearms i can tell you one thing beto o rourke s not taking my guns away from me manchin told reporters at the time i hope west virginia gun owners are flooding manchin s office with calls and emails reminding the senator that while beto o rourke isn t in the white house joe biden himself has called for the exact same ban and his atf nominee is in full support of taking guns away from legal gun owners during his confirmation hearing on wednesday david chipman admitted that he d like to see even current gun owners banned from keeping their rifles unless they registered them with the federal government if they didn t do so chipman believes they should be prosecuted under the national firearms act which means a potential ten year federal prison sentence for anyone who simply maintains possession of a gun they lawfully purchased advertisement there are an awful lot of west virginians who wouldn t register their legally owned guns with the government and manchin has to know that does he really think that those constituents of his should all be sent to prison for the crime of possessing the most popular rifle in the united states chipman has tried to explain away his views by telling senators that while he personally believes ar 15s should be banned if he s confirmed as atf director he ll follow the current law the problem with that defense is that the atf has the power to set the rules and regulations for the firearms industry to follow and the biden administration is already demonstrating its desire to go around congress and impose a new gun ban through administrative action instead of a vote in congress the department of justice and the atf are currently drafting a proposed rule that would re define millions of ar style pistols equipped with stabilizing braces as short barreled rifles which must be registered under the national firearms act the text of that proposal is likely to be released to the public next week but when biden outlined his plan back in april he made it clear that his intent was to expand the list of nfa items by executive fiat advertisement biden and chipman could easily attempt to the same thing with ar 15s and other semi automatic rifles by declaring that semi automatic rifles can be readily converted into machine guns and therefore should also fall under the auspices of the nfa in fact the atf is already trying to broadly redefine its definition of readily in another proposed rule change published last week to provide guidance on how the term readily is used to classify firearms including frame or receiver parts kits or weapon parts kits sold with incomplete or unassembled frames or receivers the nprm adds this term to 27 cfr 478 11 and 479 11 and defined as a process that is fairly or reasonably efficient quick and easy but not necessarily the most efficient speedy or easy process it would further list factors relevant in making this determining to include a time i e how long it takes to finish the process b ease i e how difficult it is to do so c expertise i e what knowledge and skills are required d equipment i e what tools are required e availability i e whether additional parts are required and how easily they can be obtained f expense i e how much it costs g scope i e the extent to which the subject of the process must be changed to finish it and h feasibility i e whether the process would damage or destroy the subject of the process or cause it to malfunction this definition and factors considered in determining whether a weapon including a weapon parts kit or unfinished or damaged frame or receiver may readily be assembled completed converted or restored to function are based on case law interpreting the terms may readily be converted to expel a projectile in 18 u s c 921 a 3 a and can be readily restored to shoot in 26 u s c 5845 b advertisement with their new broad and vague definition of readily the atf under biden could easily determine that all existing modern sporting rifles meet the definition of machine gun which is defined in the national firearms act as any firearm that shoots is designed to shoot or can be readily restored to shoot automatically more than one shot without manual reloading by a single function of the trigger gun owners actually got a hint of this strategy during the trump administration when the atf reclassified bump stocks as machine guns it wouldn t be much of a stretch for the agency to do the same with semi automatic rifles themselves and given that david chipman has already embraced the idea of classifying these rifles as machine guns it s ludicrous to believe that chipman and the biden administration would wait for congress to pass a new assault weapons ban if they thought they could do it themselves obviously any such rule change would be challenged in court but there s no guarantee that gun owners would be successful in defeating the backdoor gun ban the best way to prevent this from happening is to ensure that the batfe isn t run by

on main street in man west virginia a woman marched through the front door of uncle sam s loans a cavernous pawn shop packed with hunting bows fishing lures and camping supplies for the residents of this small appalachian town behind the counter hung the linchpin of uncle sam s business guns the woman flashed her credentials which revealed that she was an investigator with the bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives the nation s gun industry watchdog she was here to make sure uncle sam s had cleaned up its act this was the atf s third inspection of uncle sam s in seven years the two most recent audits found that the store had transferred weapons without conducting background checks and failed to provide safety notices to handgun buyers at one point atf records show more than 600 firearms that should have been in stock could not be found a red flag for gun trafficking in both cases the violations were serious enough to warrant stripping uncle sam s of its license to sell guns according to atf records but agency officials decided to spare the shop issue an official warning to its owners and give them another chance to prove they could follow the rules as the investigator leafed through handwritten ledgers in the spring of 2014 she discovered that things had hardly improved sales records were incomplete the store failed to report required information to law enforcement and safety notices still weren t going out the inspector typed out her findings and sent them to her superiors their decision issue yet another warning months later the atf learned that uncle sam s was the backbone of a sprawling gun trafficking scheme witnesses told the agency that steven adkins a longtime shop employee who d purchased a stake in the business had enlisted a host of people including a colleague s girlfriend and his brother in law to falsify paperwork so it would appear they had purchased guns in legitimate transactions according to court records in reality the guns were used to bribe coal officials in a pay to play scheme at a local mine others were sold on the black market witnesses said one accomplice told investigators hundreds if not thousands of firearms had been trafficked through uncle sam s according to court records he recalled parking his truck around the back of the store loading up guns and delivering them to a convicted felon another accomplice said he drove guns from uncle sam s to adkins s home where adkins allegedly sold them out of his basement adkins pleaded guilty to aiding and abetting a false statement relating to purchases of more than 50 firearms from late 2008 to august 2014 he was sentenced to 10 months in prison no one else was convicted in the trafficking scheme everybody knew where to get a firearm adkins said roger d b muncy whose father founded uncle sam s in 1975 we re all human but you don t send guns out the back door the atf is facing intense scrutiny as the senate considers president joe biden s pick for the agency s first permanent director in six years the confirmation of david chipman a former atf agent who has advocated stricter gun laws is unfolding against a backdrop of public anguish over mass shootings and a renewed determination from the white house to clamp down on easy access to firearms in one of the most sweeping examinations of atf inspection records the trace and usa today found that the federal agency in charge of policing the gun industry has been largely toothless and conciliatory bending over backward to go easy on wayward dealers such as uncle sam s and sometimes allowing guns to flow into the hands of criminals gun industry lobbyists have fought for decades against tougher oversight by casting gun dealers as among the most heavily regulated businesses in the usa the trace and usa today s review found that dealers are largely immune from serious punishment and enjoy layers of protection unavailable to most other industries gun sellers fear crack down from biden s nominee for atf read more reporters spent more than a year analyzing documents from nearly 2 000 gun dealer inspections that uncovered violations from 2015 to 2017 the reports showed some dealers outright flouting the rules selling weapons to convicted felons and domestic abusers lying to investigators and fudging records to mask their unlawful conduct in many cases when the atf caught dealers breaking the law the agency issued warnings sometimes repeatedly and allowed the stores to operate for months or years others are still selling guns to this day more than half of all stores with violations transferred guns without running a background check correctly waiting for the check to finish or properly recording the results more than 200 dealers were cited for selling guns to people who indicated on background check paperwork that they were prohibited from owning them dozens made false statements in official records a violation that includes facilitating illegal straw purchases a florida gun dealer got in trouble for giving a taurus handgun to a convicted felon in the parking lot and an arkansas pawnshop was cited for selling a firearm to a customer even though he d failed the background check because of an active restraining order in ohio one store transferred guns without conducting background checks 112 times another was missing some 600 firearms a pennsylvania gun retailer racked up 45 violations and received eight warnings from the atf but the store was allowed to remain in business and it went on to sell a shotgun to a man who used it to kill four family members including his 7 year old half brother the reports were obtained through a freedom of information act lawsuit by the gun control group brady and shared with the trace and usa today reporters who conducted an independent analysis the reports detail inspections of brick and mortar gun stores and pawnbrokers including home based sellers independent mom and pops and big box retailers such as walmart and dick s sporting goods others cover gun manufacturers and importers investigate read this story at the trace the data is extensive but may not be comprehensive the agency provided brady roughly 2 000 reports from inspections that resulted in warning letters warning conferences and license revocations over the two year span from july 2015 through june 2017 however annual fact sheets published by the atf include aggregate figures showing the agency issued nearly twice as many penalties during fiscal years 2016 and 2017 a period that overlaps with the brady documents the atf repeatedly declined to explain that gap but said it is investigating a single violation is enough to shutter a gun shop if atf officials can prove that the store willfully broke federal regulations in the vast majority of the cases analyzed by the trace and usa today the atf gave violators the lightest penalty available a boilerplate warning letter reminding them that their compliance is crucial to reduce violent crime and protect the public the agency revoked a gun dealer s license in less than 3 of cases gun shop owners who violate the rules seem to understand they have little to fear one owner told an atf investigator that he was busy and didn t give a s the agency records show another said he did not like being told what to do the owner of a pawn shop in northeastern kansas became very belligerent and hostile when questioned about falsifying records shaking his finger in the investigator s face as he told her to do her job and stop messing with him the atf allowed all of those dealers to keep selling firearms the bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives headquartered in washington d c is the main line of defense against firearms ending up in the black market rich clement bloomberg via getty images joseph bisbee a retired atf agent in seattle said the lack of action has fostered a culture of impunity there s really no teeth to the laws and gun dealers know that he said they can see that nobody gets prosecuted that nobody gets held accountable and that sends the signal that they can fudge things a little more and get away with it the problems extend high into the management ranks of atf the trace and usa today s review found that the managers of on the ground investigators routinely overrule recommendations to revoke licenses and order lesser punishments reporters identified 138 reports in which atf officials acknowledged that a dealer s violations were severe enough for them to lose their licenses the agency revoked 56 of those licenses just over 40 a majority were granted lesser penalties ranging from temporary license suspensions to warning letters in the reports atf officials justified backing off by citing the dealer s age recent health problems intentions to retire and in one case affluent clientele one dealer got a pass because he had been in business less than a year another because he had been in business for decades sometimes the agency was afraid that a dealer might sue in 2017 an inspector advocated pulling the license for back acre gun works after reporting the gun shop west of orlando florida had falsified records related to the transfer of an ar 15 style rifle a supervisor downgraded the penalty to a written warning noting substantial legal liabilities because the inspection had been conducted prematurely current and former atf officials say the light regulatory touch is at least partly a reflection of congressional restrictions on the agency s enforcement powers some also say the atf has increasingly adopted an industry friendly approach to lessen the risk of a backlash that could lead to budget cuts or additional limits on its authority tweet facebook reddit share this article on reddit email email this story share share this story mark jones who is retired from the atf they hardly do any inspections and when they do carry out an inspection they shrug off serious violations and say they re not a big deal because they don t want to upset the industry too much quote icon they hardly do any inspections and when they do carry out an inspection they shrug off serious violations and say they re not a big deal because they don t want to upset the industry too much said mark jones who held various supervisory positions at the atf before retiring in 2012 the proliferation of gun retailers means there are bad apples in communities across america ripe for targeting by criminals kris brown brady s president said the atf bends over backward to accommodate even the most egregious activity and americans every day pay the price brown said particularly black and brown communities across this country that are being flooded with guns from these dealers goal is to gain compliance not punish the coronavirus pandemic protests against police brutality and the election of biden spurred americans to snap up an estimated 22 million guns in 2020 shattering records and reviving concerns about whether the atf can adequately police such a booming industry the most important part of the job is keeping the guns out of criminal hands said john crecca a former atf inspector who worked in new york and pennsylvania before retiring in 2011 crecca recalled the case of bull s eye shooter supply a gun store in tacoma washington that was sued by the families of victims of the 2002 beltway sniper attacks in which two gunmen armed with a bushmaster rifle had shot and killed 10 people one of the beltway gunmen told authorities he had stolen the rifle from bull s eye the shop hadn t noticed the gun was missing until federal agents came calling a subsequent atf inspection found the store could not account for the sale of more than 230 other guns bull s eye settled the lawsuit for 2 million but did not admit liability for the shootings in the rare cases in which the agency decides to pull a license the process is slow often taking months or more than a year to complete while dealers continue to sell guns sometimes the atf holds off on finalizing a revocation specifically to give the dealer time to sell off its remaining inventory reports show the atf is the main line of defense against firearms leaking out of legal streams of commerce and into the black market the agency s weaknesses have prompted illinois new jersey and a handful of other states to create their own gun store inspection programs in illinois the atf held warning conferences with 1st class firearms in 2009 and 2013 after investigators discovered that the gun shop north of waukegan had failed to conduct background checks kept sloppy or incomplete records and illegally transferred weapons to out of state residents records show allowed to remain in business 1st class firearms went on to sell at least a dozen weapons to a trafficking ring suspected of smuggling hundreds of kilograms of cocaine into the u s from mexico according to court records inspectors returned in 2015 and cited 1st class firearms for 12 more violations this time agency officials determined that the store s license should be revoked according to records one supervisor railed against the owner craig bricco for displaying an intentional disregard and plain indifference to regulatory requirements bricco said in an interview that the problems at his shop were the fault of his employees who ran the store while he was working another job during the day have tips about inspections at gun stores contact us at gunstoreinspections thetrace org email us i got bamboozled bricco said there wasn t much i could do instead of revoking his license bricco said the atf allowed him to stay open for about six more months so he could sell off his stock of firearms bricco voluntarily surrendered his gun dealer s license after that period but the agency let him remain in business as an ammunition manufacturer he rebranded as 1st class ammo and transferred the shop s leftover gun inventory to himself a legal maneuver that enabled him to keep selling the firearms in private sales in much of the country private sales require no background checks in january 2016 1st class ammo shared a facebook post directing people to gunbroker com where bricco was selling four sig sauer pistols so it s a private sale one facebook user asked yes all private sales 1st class ammo responded you can see them on display in the ammo store some current and former atf officials defended the inspection program as an effective way of ensuring gun dealers obey the rules without driving them out of business for fleeting missteps and unintentional errors from top b todd jones served as the atf s last senate confirmed leader before resigning in 2015

defense for intelligence for diversion of firearms with straw purchases brandon said brandon who now works in sales for a ballistics technology firm that contracts with the atf and law enforcement said the agency focuses its limited resources on the 1 doing it wrong in an emailed response to questions atf spokesman andre miller portrayed the penalties as tools to guide dealers into correcting violations and ensure future compliance he said the agency can revoke licenses only for willful violations and supervisors consider the totality of the inspection and its unique circumstances to ensure consistent enforcement nationwide the nature of the violations and their impact on public safety as well as atf s ability to reduce violent crime are significant considerations for the appropriate action miller said dealers inspected once every seven years a division of the justice department the atf is responsible for policing the 78 000 gun dealers manufacturers and importers in the u s it employs more than 700 investigators who perform unannounced compliance reviews digging through business records to make sure gun sellers are not providing weapons to people who shouldn t have them the goal is to inspect each license holder at least once every three years but federal data shows the agency has averaged 15 of dealers annually between fiscal years 2010 and 2019 this means dealers were visited about once every seven years of all the inspections during that decade at least a third 35 500 found dealers had broken state or federal firearms laws the agency data shows more than 81 of violators received no penalty or a written warning the atf sought revocation of only 580 violators or 1 6 in the 2020 fiscal year as the coronavirus pandemic snarled government operations the atf inspected only 5 827 licensed dealers or 7 5 the lowest annual inspection rate since 2004 more than 2 400 of those dealers were found to have committed violations forty dealers had their licenses revoked tweet facebook reddit share this article on reddit email email this story share share this story the most common violations cited by the atf were for gun sellers failing to acquire customers personal details omitting information required on federal forms and not keeping proper inventory and sales records the most common violations cited by the atf were for gun sellers failing to acquire customers personal details omitting information required on federal forms and not keeping proper inventory and sales records according to the reports analyzed by the trace and usa today former atf officials and gun dealers said such violations are usually innocent mistakes stemming from the labyrinthine rules governing gun sales but even seemingly minor paperwork errors can indicate a dealer s involvement in more serious forms of lawbreaking or can stymie law enforcement investigations into major crimes whenever you hear people say there s plenty of laws on the books there really aren t what there are are a lot of paperwork violations where you misrepresented something on a piece of paper said scot thomasson the atf s former chief of public affairs but what each one of these paper violations represents is a crime a crime gun and the diversion of firearms to the illegal market gun dealers almost never face criminal charges when violations are discovered in an inspection former atf officials attributed the agency s permissive regulatory approach to longstanding staffing and funding shortages as well as federal laws that shield the gun industry from accountability over the past 35 years gun groups have successfully pressured congress to limit the frequency of inspections restrict atf from consolidating and computerizing records and make it more difficult for the agency to take dealers licenses away in 1986 the national rifle association successfully lobbied for the passage of the firearm owners protection act which prevents the atf from inspecting existing gun dealers more than once a year after 9 11 congress required that the atf audit each of the nation s 9 400 explosives dealers once every three years effectively forcing it to deprioritize gun dealer inspections the number of gun dealer inspections plunged falling from an average of nearly 12 000 inspections a year in the 1990s to less than 7 000 a year in the 2000s atf is a very small agency a very unpopular agency and as a result there are a lot of people trying to push them around said howard wolfe a former atf supervisor who oversaw inspections in pittsburgh pennsylvania until he retired in 2006 wolfe said the investigators under his command would need to have visited multiple gun shops every day to meet the atf s inspection goals there was no way wolfe said people went years without being inspected and that s a big problem because how do you know how somebody s doing if you don t have a chance to go out and take a look at their records atf investigators spent an average of 84 hours on each of the inspections examined by the trace and usa today one particularly taxing case in houston took 995 hours the equivalent of half a year of workdays the investigator recommended revoking the license but was rebuffed by the industry operations director who cited the length of time taken to complete the assignment in another case in kansas a pawn shop transferred an ak 47 type rifle and a glock to a woman acquiring the weapons on behalf of her boyfriend a convicted felon court records indicate in february 2016 he used those guns to shoot 17 people in a rampage across the towns of newton and hesston an atf inspector visited a pawn shop several months later and found the store had failed to obtain proper ids sold a handgun to a self identified domestic abuser and hadn t been ascertaining whether its customers were straw purchasers according to an agency report the atf downgraded the penalty to a written warning because the store had never received an inspection in its six years of business had the atf gone in there and done an inspection earlier it might have caused this shop to clean up its act it might have prevented a mass shooting said david morantz an attorney who represented one of the hesston shooting victims surviving family members in a wrongful death lawsuit against the shop the lawsuit resulted in a 2 million settlement the shop is now closed teresa ficaretta a former senior atf attorney who went into private practice helping gun industry clients comply with the law said limited resources had led the bureau to focus on inspecting dealers who sell large numbers of crime guns frequently transfer large quantities of firearms to a single customer or raise other red flags ficaretta said that was a poor substitute for regular inspections and could embolden dealers willing to break the law tweet facebook reddit share this article on reddit email email this story share share this story teresa ficaretta a former senior atf attorney if licensees knew that atf was going to show up like clockwork they would put a lot more effort into maintaining compliance but right now there s this incentive for them to roll the dice and see what happens quote icon if licensees knew that atf was going to show up like clockwork they would put a lot more effort into maintaining compliance she said but right now there s this incentive for them to roll the dice and see what happens the size of the atf s inspections staff has been stagnant for decades in early 2016 after a mass shooting at a holiday banquet that killed 14 people in san bernardino california the obama administration rolled out a gun violence prevention plan that included a request for nearly 12 3 million to add 120 atf investigators the republican controlled congress balked with one gop member of the house appropriations committee saying lawmakers would not support the development of unlawful limitations on the unambiguous second amendment rights of americans b todd jones a former u s attorney who served as the atf s last senate confirmed leader before resigning in 2015 said that despite the 20 plus years of regulatory handcuffs investigators work hard to balance compliance and the adversarial relationship needed to provide oversight we did our best to plug holes and stop the worst offenders said jones who is now chief disciplinary officer for the nfl it s like setting up a speed trap you re not going to stop everyone and if you get caught speeding you have to deal with it but what s the alternative no regulation at all during delays guns end up in wrong hands the atf investigators who inspect gun stores do not carry badges or guns and cannot make arrests they can recommend hitting problem gun stores with penalties known as adverse actions but the ultimate outcome of an inspection depends heavily on directors of industry operations who make the final call the trace and usa today found wide variation in the penalties handed down by field divisions for example at the louisville field division which covers kentucky west virginia and southern indiana reporters identified 12 cases in which investigators found that a dealer s violations warranted revocation nine of those recommendations were approved by the division s industry operations director in contrast the industry operations director for the seattle field division which covers washington oregon idaho alaska hawaii and guam approved only one revocation out of the seven recommended by investigators jim zammillo a former atf deputy assistant director who oversaw the inspection program from 2004 to 2010 said the justice department s inspector general and other agency watchdogs had repeatedly faulted the bureau for applying adverse actions inconsistently prompting it to initiate a series of improvements beginning in the early 2000s chief among the reforms was a new set of guidelines establishing the minimum penalties to be issued when violations were found the guidelines specified that penalties should increase for repeat offenses and any field division wishing to spare a dealer from revocation had to get approval from headquarters know someone interested in nationwide gun store inspections by the atf share this story the increased oversight led to greater standardization zammillo said but it also caused consternation among field division heads they viewed it like i m the sheriff this is my department and i m going to run it the way that i want to zammillo said john jarowski a former industry operations director in st paul minnesota offered another explanation saying downgrades to less serious punishments help temper strict investigators inspectors go in and they want the kill they want the scalp on their belt jarowski said proprietors who receive a final revocation notice have 60 days to file an appeal in federal court a costly process that often just delays the process for months or years u s attorneys represent the government in those cases on behalf of the atf many times when the u s attorney steps in he d say this dog won t hunt and they d drop it jarowski said so you have to think about spending your resources wisely in many areas of civil and criminal law defendants cannot use ignorance as an excuse for unlawful behavior when it comes to gun sellers congress has stipulated that they can lose their licenses only for violations committed willfully forcing the atf to prove that dealers knew the rules and intentionally disregarded them jack dick s pawn shop in junction city kansas received warning letters in 2013 and 2014 and attended a warning conference in 2016 when the atf returned in 2017 it uncovered four additional violations including making false statements in required records a report shows a notice to customers entering jack and dick s pawn shop in junction city kansas lets the public know they can carry firearms inside evert nelson usa today network the false statements charge stemmed from the case of a fort riley army soldier who d accidentally shot himself in the hand using a pistol from the shop according to a police report the soldier 20 was underage for handgun purchases in kansas he had had a friend fill out the paperwork atf records indicate the investigator pushed to revoke jack dick s license based on evidence that the shop had ignored obvious signs of a straw purchase including when the friend paid using the soldier s credit card the investigator was overruled by higher ups who said it wasn t clear whether the employee knew he had accepted the wrong credit card the atf decided to give jack dick s another written warning the owner of the shop declined to comment for this article in 2017 and 2020 the shop released surveillance photos and video on its facebook page of other attempted straw purchases in an effort to expose the crime when the atf does decide to revoke a dealer s license the agency s delay in putting the penalty into effect can allow guns to wind up in the wrong hands jc s guns tackle shop in huntsville alabama received its first compliance inspection in 2013 resulting in a warning conference investigators returned two years later for a second inspection that uncovered 13 violations six of them repeated according to an atf report the shop had failed to report multiple sales falsified forms and sold guns to people who d self identified as being prohibited it failed to conduct background checks on customers but did use the background check system to screen employees which is illegal the report indicates investigators also discovered that employees had facilitated multiple straw purchases selling weapons to stand ins when background checks on the actual buyers were delayed it took the atf 16 months to revoke jc s license during that time according to court records the shop sold 11 handguns to a straw purchaser buying them on behalf of her boyfriend a convicted felon officials cite dealer ignorance to justify leniency investigators do not carry badges or guns and have no arrest authority they carry an atf photo credential instead gun store owners offered the atf a litany of excuses to explain away violations the agency spared a nebraska pawn shop from revocation after the owner said he was very busy and overwhelmed a pennsylvania sporting goods store was allowed to keep selling firearms despite being cited three times in four years for failing to report multiple handgun sales during the last inspection in 2016 the owner told an atf investigator he meant to file the reports but did not get around to it felex yukhtman said he trusted the wrong people to manage his small gun manufacturing business in bradenton florida yukhtman s company gun point specializes in building custom ars in 2017 an atf supervisor upheld an inspector s recommendation to shut yukhtman down after a review of his books turned up 15 violations they included the possession of illegal machine guns later seized by agents yukhtman was also missing 250 firearms he said in an interview the supervisor criticized yukhtman for having shown a pattern of repeated violations despite the atf educating the licensee through every inspection and through every warning conference since 2008 the industry operations director overturned the recommendation and summoned yukhtman in for another warning conference yukhtman says he believes he was spared because he reached out to the atf for advice and put in place safeguards to prevent further mistakes they re not there to take your license or make your life miserable yukhtman said the less work they have to do at your store the less time they have to be there the better it is for them our subscribers make this reporting possible please consider supporting investigative

a photograph along with a four page form containing basic business and biographical information the form also requires applicants to check a box to indicate whether they have a felony conviction were ever committed to a mental institution or are otherwise precluded from possessing firearms the price of a firearms license ranges from 30 for vintage gun collectors and ammunition manufacturers to as much as 3 000 to sell strictly regulated weapons such as mortars and grenades the license held by many retail gun dealers costs 200 for the first three years and 90 for every renewal applicants do not have to undergo training or pass a test the atf instead has dealers sign a document attesting to their knowledge of gun laws and regulations before opening for business still atf officials have routinely pointed to dealer ignorance to justify leniency a dealer in pounding mill virginia avoided a warning conference after expressing his apparent shock according to a report at learning of the requirement to report customers who made back to back handgun purchases the national shooting sports foundation the gun industry s trade group works with the atf to educate license holders about how to stay within the bounds of the law and prevent illegal trafficking by and large firearm retailers are law abiding and follow local state and federal authorities said mark oliva a national shooting sports foundation spokesman we re members of our community mom and pop shops committed to keeping our communities safe the foundation recruits consultants and former atf inspectors to put shops through mock inspections for 750 the organization will run a full day compliance check that produces a confidential report of shortcomings it also hosts a hotline for retail federal firearm license holders which oliva said receives hundreds of calls a year but rich marianos a former atf assistant director said the foundation is committed to keeping regulation as weak as possible in 2020 it spent 4 5 million on lobbying more than twice as much as the national rifle association which spent 2 2 million according to opensecrets org a nonpartisan research group that tracks money in politics they re like the nra marianos said never once have they said the atf needs more money help support or resources oliva disputes that characterization he provided confidential records of the group s lobbying of congress in recent years to add millions for atf s licensing system and millions more to improve criminal background checks at the department of justice postscript the legacy of uncle sam s the call that started the unraveling of the gun trafficking operation at uncle sam s in west virginia came in april 2015 the girlfriend of a former employee contacted an atf agent to say she had learned that her name had been wrongfully listed in the store s records as the purchaser of shotguns rifles and a pistol according to court records she later told an atf agent that steven adkins had paid her 75 each time she filled out a background check form for a firearm destined for another person it was a scheme adkins had been running for at least six years and he d kept it hidden from the atf even though investigators had inspected the shop over that timeframe after being indicted in late 2015 adkins told the atf that he had hatched the gun trafficking arrangement at the behest of the store s founder roger d muncy according to court records adkins claimed muncy became furious at employees for blocking gun sales and if customers indicated on the federal form that they were prohibited from purchasing firearms muncy had them fill out a new form and instructed them how to record their answers so that the sale could go through adkins estimated that 70 of the gun sales at uncle sam s were illegal the case reverberated across the small town of man where adkins and muncy were serving on the city council in 2008 the city had renamed a street in muncy s honor adkins pleaded guilty in 2016 and the atf pulled uncle sam s gun license adkins who has since been released from prison declined requests to be interviewed for this article muncy was never charged but the revocation didn t stop him from profiting from guns after losing the license to sell firearms at uncle sam s he rented the store to a state trooper who obtained his own license and continued running a gun shop at the location the arrangement lasted until july 2019 when the two parties had a falling out in his testimony muncy denied wrongdoing in the adkins case he went on to operate uncle sam s as a pawn shop until he died in december at the age of 68 his wife died four days later since then the day to day management of the store has fallen to their son roger d b muncy who hopes to get back in the gun business the day my daddy and mommy died i was calling alcohol tobacco firearms wanting to know if i was able to get a firearms license he said they said i need to file my application for this project usa today partnered with the trace a nonprofit newsroom dedicated to improving public understanding of gun violence increasing accountability and identifying solutions
for the last three decades the world has seen exponential increase in capital formation through formation of idea based enterprises by some crazy young enthusiasts who dared to think different challenged the status quo with their insanely disruptive ideas and have made the impossible possible i am referring to entrepreneurs like gates jobs bezos zuckerberg page jack ma musk and countless others who have created companies that are valued in trillions of dollars besides fundamentally changing the life for the entire humanity much of this revolution has occurred due to exponential technologies that have emerged starting from a phenomenal and ceaseless increase in computing power connectivity of billions of people through the internet and social media and the infinite amount of data that is freely available these developments have produced an entrepreneurial culture of big thinking leading to continuous transformation of conventional forms of business and way of life a process that is continuously reducing costs improving customer experience and creating a world of abundance this culture is generating thousands of new entities called start ups based on ground breaking ideas by entrepreneurs that are constantly transforming old practices into new and efficient ways to solve some of the biggest problems faced by humanity in the process the speed of wealth creation is multiplying to unimaginable levels let me illustrate how this system is working from conception of ideas formation of start ups a few of them becoming unicorns a unicorn is a private tech company valued at one billion dollars or more and their exit through initial public offering ipo via an example of an innovative healthcare insurance company that i came across formed by a few colleagues of my younger brother who is in actuarial professional based in san francisco this company alignment healthcare inc engaged in providing some unique healthcare plans products and services for seniors in the us through a technology based platform with 24 7 access at low cost was conceived in 2013 by its founder and ceo john kao based on an idea that came to him due to the personal dissatisfaction he experienced with the existing fragmented healthcare system while caring for his ailing mother together with a small team he partnered with healthcare leaders from across the industry to build a new kind of patient centric healthcare company that envisioned a connected approach to care and coverage thus the name alignment leveraging innovative technologies and best practices to drive better outcomes for patients and families the company achieved remarkable success in growing its members customers and revenues over the last seven years reached nearly 1 billion in the last financial year and attained unicorn status about a year back through an ipo in march 2021 it has raised 390 million by selling just 14 percent of its shares at a price of 18 per share compared to the book value of only 0 02 per share despite the company having remained in losses net losses for cy 2020 2019 of 22 million and 44 million respectively at ipo price the company s market cap was 3 5 billion which increased to 24 per share on may 25 2021 with reported market cap of 4 5 billion this means that a seven year old loss making company just listed on nasdaq has higher market value than the combined market cap of pakistan s largest company ogdcl 2 5 billion largest bank hbl 1 2 billion and the pakistan stock exchange 085 billion this is just one example of how value is being created in tech based innovative companies virtually every day in the new world the story of amazon which continued incurring losses for several years after its formation listed in 1997 with market cap of around 300 million has and has now achieved a market cap of 1 6 trillion is not different at present there are around 600 known unicorns in the world with an aggregate valuation of 2 trillion most of these are based in the us china europe india and israel there are hundreds of unicorns that have exited this list either through ipo listing or through merger acquisition whose values have multiplied today eight out of the top ten largest companies are data and technology related apple microsoft amazon alphabet google facebook alibaba tesla tencent with aggregate market cap of over 10 trillion the start up ecosystem and formation of unicorns is also picking momentum in india which has over 50 000 start ups and around 100 unicorns with combined value of 240 billion according to a report of credit suisse group while we have seen some increase in this activity in terms of some conferences and webinars setting up of incubation centres and hundreds of start ups being established at lahore islamabad and karachi relatively very few have achieved significant funding or valuation the aggregate funding mobilized for start ups and most of it comes from private equity pe venture capital vc firms outside pakistan has ranged around 50 to 70 million per annum in the last two year which is far too low for fifth largest country in the world compared to this the level of funding in india through pe vc activity has remained around 10 billion per annum so far while there have been few significant entities like afiniti careem keeptruckin with pakistani founders that have achieved over a billion dollar valuation not a single unicorn has been produced within pakistan s ecosystem nor any significant size company listed on the stock exchange clearly pakistan seriously lags behind most of the world in the new economy in terms of india pakistan comparison in the year 2000 the indian economy was five times bigger than pakistan in the last 20 years this equation has materially changed as the indian economy with its current gdp of around 3 trillion is now more than 10 times of pakistan s economy the bad news is that this equation is continuously deteriorating at very fast pace since in the new tech innovation ecosystem pakistan is a small fraction of india in a following article i will discuss further the reasons pakistan s share remains negligible in the new economy and what needs to be done to enhance its scale and dynamism the writer is a former managing partner of a leading professional services firm and has done extensive work on governance in the public and
