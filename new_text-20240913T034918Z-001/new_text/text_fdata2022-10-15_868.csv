updated october 14 2022 at 1 56 pm et london british prime minister liz truss fired her finance minister and close ally kwasi kwarteng then hours later she announced a u turn on their economic package attempting to calm financial markets and reinforce her shaky leadership position little more than a month after taking office the government said former health secretary jeremy hunt is taking over as chancellor of the exchequer the united kingdom s treasury he is the fourth chancellor this year shortly after sacking the finance minister truss held a news conference at downing street and appeared visibly nervous saying we need to act now to reassure the markets of our fiscal discipline she announced she was canceling a proposed corporation tax cut a central part of the new government s economic plan that created turmoil in british politics and financial markets and sent the pound plunging late last month truss course correction comes as her administration has sustained mounting criticism from opposition politicians and legislators within her own party as well as international economists and investors who have continued to divest themselves of british assets stefan rousseau wpa pool getty images getty images u k prime minister liz truss and chancellor of the exchequer kwasi kwarteng visit a construction site in birmingham earlier this month the two met this morning over finance policy kwarteng stood by her vision kwarteng had to depart early from washington d c thursday evening where he had been meeting with counterparts at the international monetary fund he and truss held urgent talks in downing street shortly after his return to london when you asked me to serve as your chancellor i did so in full knowledge that the situation we faced was incredibly difficult with rising global interest rates and energy prices kwarteng said in his departure letter however your vision of optimism growth and change was right prior to her public speech truss office and her supporters had repeatedly said she would not change her broader approach to kick starting economic growth and that she and kwarteng would continue to work together toward a common goal it isn t the first economic plan reversal truss took over from former prime minister boris johnson in early september within days then finance minister kwarteng had proposed a series of tax cuts and spending measures without saying how they would be funded the proposal led the pound to weaken to a record low against the dollar millions of homeowners faced steep increases to their mortgage rates and government borrowing costs skyrocketed that prompted the bank of england to step in to prevent a crisis earlier this month the government backtracked on another part of its controversial economic package by scrapping proposed tax cuts for higher earners as confidence and anticipation have grown for further changes the pound inched up in value on thursday and bond markets stabilized some and in the minutes that followed truss speech friday the currency rallied significantly often a sign of increased investor confidence in a country s economic future her party s reactions are mixed thérèse coffey the deputy prime minister and health secretary who is one of truss longest standing allies in parliament tweeted her support for friday s decisions she wrote that truss was right to act now to ensure our country s economic stability particularly given the deteriorating economic picture worldwide which she attributed to russia s invasion of ukraine meanwhile veteran conservative lawmaker roger gale said it was hard to understand why truss had forced out kwarteng he wrote on twitter that the former finance chief was a good man who had simply been promoting the policies upon which she was elected as conservative leader by the party s grassroots members gale did though describe the new chancellor hunt as an experienced pair of hands on the financial tiller but former conservative leader william hague told times radio he believes truss is barely hanging on as prime minister it s been a catastrophic episode said hague a former foreign secretary and i think it hangs by a thread is the honest answer to your question of her position because yes these were her policies too and plenty of warning was given by many of us about what would happen if we had unfunded tax cuts and whether it would be financially and politically sustainable still hague said he hoped she would survive because having yet another prime minister would be stretching credibility too far for the conservative party copyright 2022 npr to see more visit

this year the extended tax filing deadline for u s citizens or residents sole proprietorships c corporations and single owner llcs is monday october 17 2022 through the course of the tax year companies often engage in transactions that require tax return disclosures these disclosures may not be top of mind until the taxpayer starts its tax return preparation depending on the transactions that occurred during the tax year some disclosures may require significant analysis and consideration prior to drafting the form or disclosure additionally in some cases the reporting obligations and disclosure rules are nuanced and require a careful reading of the code treasury regulations or the irs instructions to the form additionally taxpayers simply may not be aware of a reporting obligation that resulted from a transaction below we have included a non exclusive list of some of the common tax return reporting obligations for taxpayers that are preparing their tax returns in the coming weeks should you have questions about any of the items on this list or any other compliance item please reach out to us immediately early identification of a compliance obligation helps to ensure accurate and complete reporting on the tax return and avoid potential penalties outbound transfers of property form 926 if a u s citizen or resident domestic corporation or a domestic estate or trust has transferred property tangible or intangible to a foreign corporation in a transaction described in sections 6038b a 1 a 367 d or 367 e that u s person must file a form 926 return by a u s transferor of property to a foreign corporation this applies whether the property had a built in gain or a built in loss the failure to file a form 926 is a failure to comply with section 6038b under section 6038b c the penalty for failure to furnish information at the time and in the manner required by the regulations is 10 percent of the fair market value of the property at the time of the exchange but not greater than 100 000 unless the failure was due to intentional disregard treas reg 1 6038b 1 statement in addition to the form 926 a u s person that transfers property to a foreign corporation must file a treas reg 1 6038b 1 statement with respect to transfers described in section 6038 a 1 a that includes the information required in treas reg 1 6038b 1 c or d as applicable the failure to file this statement is a failure to comply with section 6038b and can result in the same penalty under section 6038b c described above gain recognition agreements gras under treas reg 1 367 a 8 a u s person as defined in section 7701 a 30 which includes a citizen or resident of the united states a domestic partnership a domestic corporation and any estate or trust other than a foreign estate or trust a u s transferor that transfers stock or securities of a foreign corporation to another foreign corporation must recognize gain on the transaction under section 367 a 1 unless i the u s person owns less than 5 percent of the vote and value of the stock of the transferee foreign corporation immediately after the transfer or ii the u s person owns 5 percent or more of the vote and value of the stock of the transferee foreign corporation and the u s person enters into a gain recognition agreement with respect to the transferred stock or securities as required under treas reg 1 367 a 8 thus if the u s person is a 5 percent or more shareholder and files a gra section 367 a 1 is turned off and the u s person does not have to immediately recognize gain on the outbound stock transfer this is a significant benefit if there is a large built in gain in the stock that was transferred outbound a commonly misunderstood aspect about gras is that gra disclosure is an ongoing obligation for the five year term of the gra as part of entering into a gra the u s transferor agrees to include with its timely filed tax return for each of the five full taxable years following the taxable year of the initial transfer i an annual certification containing the information described in treas reg 1 367 a 8 g or ii a new gra reporting a disposition or event that requires a new gra in addition to filing a gra for the year of the initial transfer the u s transferor must file a form 926 and a form 8838 consent to extend the time to assess tax under section 367 the failure to file an

by michael s derby new york reuters atlanta federal reserve president raphael bostic said on friday that over the last few years some of his personal investing activity inadvertently happened in periods where it was forbidden by u s central bank ethics rules at the time bostic explained in a note that accompanied revised financial disclosure forms going back to the start of his tenure as atlanta fed president in 2017 that trades violating the ethics code were made by financial advisors since i assumed office i have ensured that my assets were held in managed accounts that neither i nor my personal investment adviser had the ability to direct bostic wrote due to my reliance on a third party manager i was unaware of any specific trades or their timing including a limited number that took place during federal open market committee blackout periods or financial stress periods bostic wrote similarly i was unaware of when my holdings of u s treasury funds in 2021 exceeded the limits set forth by the fomc s trading and investing rules at no time did i knowingly authorize or complete a financial transaction based on nonpublic information or with any intent to conceal or sidestep my obligations of transparent and accountable reporting bostic said adding that he sincerely regretted if his actions had raised questions about his or the fed s standards and behavior under the rules then in place fed officials were prohibited from owning stocks in banks overseen by the central bank they were also prohibited from trading during the so called blackout periods around the meetings of the fed s policy setting committee when officials are not supposed to speak publicly on economic or monetary policy issues the rules also told fed policymakers and senior staff to avoid engaging in investments that would create the appearance of a conflict of interest fed ethics rules are designed to ensure that officials who set the central bank s policy are not profiting off their decisions and knowledge independent review bostic s revised financial statements are the latest development in a broader controversy facing the central bank just over a year ago the leaders of the dallas and boston fed banks resigned after their financial disclosure forms showed both had been actively trading in financial markets while also helping to set monetary policy robert kaplan who was then the leader of the dallas fed had reported trading millions of dollars in stocks and other investments since taking over as head of that regional bank eric rosengren who had led the boston fed since 2007 reported more modest trades at the start of this year richard clarida who was then second in command of the central bank resigned from his position early amid questions about his trading in 2020 earlier this year the fed imposed a much more stringent code limiting what officials and senior staff can invest in while also requiring pre approval of trades it extended the new ethics restrictions to family members of central bank leaders and senior staff in his statement on friday bostic said that as soon as he realized his financial activities strayed beyond what the rules allowed he brought it to the attention of the atlanta fed s board of directors and top lawyer as well as the u s central bank elizabeth smith who chairs the atlanta fed s board said in a statement that the panel acknowledges the violations and accepts president bostic s explanation my board colleagues and i have confidence in president bostic s explanation that he did not seek to profit from any fomc related knowledge a fed spokesperson said in a statement that fed chair jerome powell has asked the office of inspector general for the federal reserve board of governors to initiate an independent review of president bostic s financial disclosures we look forward to the results of their work and will accept and take appropriate actions based on their findings the fed spokesperson said bostic s investing issues echoed those of powell in july a report from the central bank s inspector general identified that he also had some trades that happened during blackout periods in 2020 the inspector general cleared powell and clarida of wrongdoing but said an investigation of regional fed trading activity is ongoing reporting by michael s derby editing by paul simao

in this month s esg market alert we cover the fca and other market regulators criticism of esg benchmarking the european commission s ban on goods being produced using forced labour anti esg backlash and what s new in market practice the practical esg steps being taken by corporates and central banks fca and other market regulators criticise esg benchmarking despite the prevalence of esg efforts and with more than half of ftse 100 companies having dedicated esg committees regulators are questioning the credibility of investment firms esg benchmarking practices due to lack of standardised methodologies of measuring and reporting in a portfolio letter published on 8th september 2022 the fca warned that the subjective nature of esg factors give rise to an increased risk for poor disclosures in relation to esg this stance echoes the underlying concern expressed by the eu authorities who published their own benchmarking rules for esg that were subsequently adopted by the european commission in april 2022 notable concerns include companies cherry picking how they assess themselves on an esg basis commonly known as greenwashing or investment firms developing and using their own esg rating systems to assess their funds across the atlantic regulators are taking similar action with the u s securities and exchange commission having enhanced its scrutiny of esg funds and practices earlier this year the sec s proposal requires more detailed disclosures in prospectuses and extends its name rules and the 80 investment policy to require respectively esg funds to define the terms in its name in plain english and to have a minimum of 80 of a fund s assets being consistent with its name for example a fund that considers esg factors alongside but not more centrally than other non esg factors in its investment decision making would not be permitted to use esg or similar terminology in its name european commission bans goods produced using forced labour the european commission has made a proposal to prohibit products made with forced labour being sold in the eu a stance which will be discussed by the european parliament and the council of the eu if passed the new regulation would apply to both imported goods and goods produced within the eu the proposal is based on definitions and standards established by the international labour organisation ilo and if enacted as law would apply to products for which forced labour has been used at any stage of production by all economic operators making it one of the broadest product related forced labour bans in the world as part of the regulation each eu member state would have to designate national authorities who would be responsible for enforcing the regulation these authorities would conduct investigations across multiple phases with a ban being implemented on any products within the eu market that were determined to have been made using forced labour it is expected that if the regulation were to be enacted it would take effect in 2025 at the earliest this proposal is part of a general global trend towards policing forced labour issues as evidenced by the uyghur forced labour prevention act passed in the united states in june 2022 the legislation presumes that any product originating from the xinjiang uygur autonomous region is a product of forced labour and unless contrary evidence is provided at border control such products are not be allowed to enter the united states anti esg backlash despite increasing focus on esg driven by the united nations sustainable development goals an anti esg exchange traded fund etf has attracted over us 300 million in funds in less than a month the etf in question strive asset management s us energy etf drll is listed on the new york stock exchange launched in august by vivek ramaswamy strive asset management s co founder and executive chairman this etf aims to refocus companies on delivering shareholder returns rather than setting social political cultural and environmental goals in this new etf ramaswamy has called on energy companies to reduce their focus on cutting carbon emissions unless doing so can be proven to increase shareholder value the launch of ramaswamy s etf comes in light of increasing anti esg sentiment in certain political spheres in the united states the state of florida has passed a resolution barring its pension funds from using esg factors in decision making glenn hegar the comptroller for texas has targeted esg investing by blacklisting ten financial groups for boycotting energy companies in their investment strategies under a law passed by the texas administration in 2021 state pension and school funds may be forced to divest shares they hold in financial groups that appear on this list what s new in market practice practical esg steps being taken by corporates and central banks at a minimum the uk corporate governance code requires companies with a premium listing in the uk to have in place audit remuneration and nomination committees however 54 of ftse 100 companies have now taken the additional step of putting in place a committee dedicated to focusing on esg issues by contrast analysis from 2020 2021 in the united states has shown only 13 of s p 500 companies had assigned responsibility to an esg or sustainability committee this practical shift from the leading uk companies is particularly prevalent in the oil gas and mining sectors where a number of the big energy giants have a dedicated esg committee this step demonstrates a recognition that a dedicated esg committee can enhance a company s ability to meet its sustainability and net zero goals with better esg credentials also supporting share price and improving eligibility for esg focused funds at the european level following an announcement in july 2022 of its intention to incorporate climate change considerations into its monetary policy framework the european central bank the ecb has revealed its commitment to decarbonising its approximately 385 billion of corporate bond holdings this move by the ecb aims to reduce the eurosystem s exposure to climate related financial risk and to support a green transition of the economy in line with the eu s climate neutrality objectives the ecb s plan includes decarbonising its corporate bond holdings portfolio as well as the introduction of new climate scores assessed in terms of greenhouse gas emissions carbon reduction targets and climate related disclosures which will be taken into account in all eurosystem corporate bond purchases the ecb also intends to start publishing climate related information on its corporate bond holdings during the first quarter of 2023 and will regularly report

with the recent deluge of affordable turkish mp5 clones imported by century arms most shooters have forgotten about the pof 5pk and that s unfortunate because these pakistani pseudo subguns offer unique features and solid build quality making them desirable for collectors and shooters on a budget but can they really compete with the new ap5s from turkey let s take a closer look at the pof 5pk and find out on a side note don t forget to check out my recent guide to affordable quality mp5 magazines pakistan ordnance factory or pof is a state run arms maker from you guessed it pakistan they manufacture a wide assortment of armaments ranging from mp5s to anti submarine missiles though for this review we re regrettably focusing on the mp5 as the name implies this gun is a de facto 9mm mp5 yes it is a clone but it s more than that the pof 5pk is a licensed clone meaning the original machinery it was built on came from germany does that mean it is equal to its german counterpart no the good news is that it is very much mechanically and dimensionally an mp5 so it uses the same components and accessories as the real deal but by the same measure if you handed me the full technical data package and all the machinery to manufacture an ak 47 i most likely could not because i would also need countless hours of experience and expertise to build the guns correctly thankfully at least based on my limited experience pof has exactly that if you ve never seen die hard or simply never bothered looking at the coolest small arms of the 20th century the mp5 is a roller delayed magazine fed 9mm submachine gun the model i reviewed is limited to semi automatic to meet atf regulations but it s unique for more than just that reason affordable hipster pof mp5 the pof 5pk i reviewed is what is known as a reverse stretch model where all 9mm german mp5s are either of the full sized or kurz mp5k variety the reverse stretch is a special configuration that combines both reverse stretch mp5s utilize the receiver of a full sized gun and combine it with the short barrel of an mp5k this might seem pointless but it actually has a few interesting advantages for starters by utilizing a full sized receiver a reverse stretch gun can use all mp5 stocks and braces which are vastly more numerous than those available for the k model it also reduces the severity of the recoil impulse as well as the strain on the internal components and for shooters with a registered drop in auto sear rdias the reduced impulse also means a slower more controllable rate of fire if you re scratching your head and wondering who would want such a thing the answer is several shooters in fact until recently the only way to get a reverse stretch mp5 was to have a custom builder put one together for you which would cost thousands of dollars thankfully the pof 5pk is vastly less expensive than that the pof mp5 price around 1 150 not cheap by cheap gun standards but very inexpensive when compared to german mp5s or custom built ones pof 5pk features before i get too into it let s talk about what the pof mp5 is what it ships with and all of its unique features like i said earlier the pof 5pk is a roller delayed magazine fed stamped steel semi automatic pistol chambered in 9mm it feeds from stagger column box type mp5 magazines and includes one pakistan made 30 round steel example in the box that s it it lacks an optics rail but features a recoil stop block that allows it to utilize a standard mp5 optics rail i opted for an mfi rail as i own several and they have tolerated years of abuse from me but let s jump back to the muzzle and first walk through every feature on the gun so to start things out the 5pk features a 5 51 inch barrel with a 1 2 28 threaded muzzle for attaching muzzle devices like a suppressor the front sight is your standard hooded mp5 post while the rear sight is a full sized mp5 drum diopter this is noteworthy because mp5ks normally have a castle style rear sight with open notches instead of apertures behind the threaded muzzle the pof 5pk includes a smooth featureless handguard that works ok but shooters would be better served with a hand stop of what kind given how short both the barrel and the handguard are while it might make hk purists scoff the new magpul handguard works fantastically in this regard and covers the barrel trunnion preventing shooters from burning themselves on it after extended firing sessions behind this the pof 5pk s receiver is built from a single piece of folded steel welded together the magazine well looks perfect and includes a stamped importer mark filled in with white paint that looks pretty good the magazine well also includes a nice feature a sling loop for a third point attachment while most will never use this it s a nice touch that makes the pof look and feel like a legit mp5 just behind this is the other major departure pof took from a classic mp5 design the lower receiver while every other mp5 maker utilizes a polymer lower receiver with an integral grip the pof 5pk includes uses a steel g3 style sef marked one this means shooters can utilize hk g3 pistol grips on the gun that are both plentiful and affordable the only downside is that the use of steel makes the gun a little heavier but only by a few ounces lastly the back of the receiver is topped off with a polymer end cap that features a permanently affixed sling attachment point i immediately removed this and replaced it with an sb tactical mp5 folding brace since it makes the gun infinitely more stable and drastically improves the ergonomics pof 5pk performance i fired 1 000 rounds of federal 124gr fmj american eagle through my personally owned pof 5pk pistol and encountered only three malfunctions the first was due to a random 380 acp round getting mixed into an ammo can and the second was a failure to extract the latter was easily cleared by extracting the magazine charging the action a few times and reinserting the mag overall a remarkably reliable gun despite the fact that i never cleaned or oiled the gun from the factory as for the third it was a failure to chamber issue stemming from one specific brand of defense ammunition winchester 124gr p hex vent hollow points these rounds simply would not chamber when hand cycled though interesting enough if a different round were put ahead of a full magazine of these rounds they would chamber fine not a solution mind you so be sure to buy just one box of defense ammo for this gun for testing before committing to a full case that said other defensive rounds like federal hydra shok 124gr jhp and hornady s critical duty 135gr jhp worked flawlessly regarding accuracy the 5pk grouped around 2 inches at 50 yards when fired from a shooting bench with the magazine resting on the table with nearly every brand of ammo tested p rounds shot somewhat higher but not so much that i would worry about zeroing the gun with them if i committed it to a home defense role downsides now that i ve finished drooling over the gun let s talk about the less desirable aspects of the 5pk while the build quality was excellent the finish on the gun wasn t very durable the outer gloss finish seems to be similar to grill paint and scratches fairly easily another issue i dealt with was the cocking tube on my test gun the tube was slightly canted to the left the sights were still dead on from the factory and the cant wasn t significant enough to make zeroing an optic impossible but it s certainly something to keep in mind i recommend inspecting a gun in person before buying it if possible pof 5pk 9mm verdict overall the pof 5pk is a solid choice for home defense plinking or shooters searching for something unusual for their collection if you ve always wanted an mp5 but couldn t spend 3 000 to buy one this is a very solid option about jim grant jim is one of the elite editors for ammoland com who can wield a camera with expert finesse in

for you to your inbox still there are a number of strategies you can use to reduce your food costs experts say here are some of them 1 stock up on staples artem lysanev istock getty images make sure your kitchen and pantry are always stocked with certain basics experts say having an ample supply of staple goods will allow you to buy fewer new items each week some of the most useful foods to have on hand include eggs pasta rice bread canned tomatoes frozen vegetables and fruit onions and potatoes said leanne brown author of good enough a self care cookbook consider buying these products in large quantities if you have the space to cut costs over time many meals can be made with these ingredients alone and they serve as the foundation for countless more 2 shop with a grocery list don t show up to the supermarket without a grocery list and some ideas of what you ll be cooking for the week brown said meal planning definitely reduces costs she said if you stick to it you don t waste food that you bought without a plan while you map out your dishes for the week try to think of recipes with easily repurposed leftovers brown said that will enable you to buy less for example a pot of chili can later be used to fill burritos or as nacho topping more from personal finance 32 of americans are struggling to pay their bills consumers prioritize netflix amazon prime over groceries gas nearly half of americans make this mistake with credit cards you can decide eating certain foods on repeat is sad or monotonous or like so much else with life you can choose to look at it more positively having the same breakfast every day for a week can be really comforting and simplify things both wallet wise and decision making wise brown said then you can do something else the next week so you don t feel bored meanwhile shopping with a grocery list probably won t prevent all your impulse buys but that doesn t mean you shouldn t use one even if you stick to them somewhat that is great brown said we don t need to worry about perfection as a treat she purposefully plans to buy one or two things off her list she said 3 compare stores for the best deals you can usually browse discounts on a supermarket s website or app or find them listed at the retailer experts say take a look at your grocery list before you decide where to do your buying said erin clarke author of the well plated cookbook then try to find the store that offers the best value on the particular items you re looking for if you re doing a produce heavy trip look for a store with frequent produce sales clarke said if you re stocking up on shelf stable goods choose a store that has the best value for those even if other items like produce cost more look beyond supermarkets too billy vasquez who runs the 99 cent chef blog said he picks up many of his nonperishable items including mayonnaise ketchup mustard hot sauce dried pasta beans and tortilla chips at his local dollar store timing is everything with food vasquez added buy when fruit and veggies are in season he said they are often on sale around st patrick s day memorial day and independence day you can find steep discounts on items such as corned beef carrots cabbage turkey duck roasts ham boxed stuffing hamburgers and hot dogs many of which can be stored in the freezer for long periods vasquez said year round generic and store brands tend to be the cheaper varieties brown said adding that buying more canned and frozen vegetables when many aren t in season is another evergreen choice 4 change your menu meat and dairy tend to be the more expensive items at the supermarket especially of late in response aim to make more meals that don t rely on them as the central ingredient brown said using meat sparingly as flavor like adding a bit of bacon to a mushroom risotto is more economical she said consuming less meat also helps you to lower your environmental footprint she added buying foods with a longer shelf life can cut your trips to the supermarket altogether even certain produce may last for more time than others especially if you store it properly cabbage carrots brussels sprouts and beets can last for two weeks or longer when stored in the crisper drawer clarke said delaying your return is always good for your wallet she said every time you walk into the store that s an opportunity for impulse purchases to drive up the bill

as a new strategy is underway to position grand rapids as the technology hub of the midwest a startup founder in the financial technology space affirms the region s capability jeff lambert is no stranger to the budding potential for companies to launch and witness success out of the grand rapids area after founding the local investor relations and pr firm lambert co he has witnessed the region s promising trajectory through the growth of his own firm which is now a national company with clients in 20 different states it s really the last place you would ever think to start a national agency 25 years ago lambert said but we proved that we could do it from here in 2020 lambert also launched tiicker an app and website that connects public companies to their shareholders with a variety of incentives and perks the startup which is based out of grand rapids and detroit seeks to bridge a connection gap between individuals and companies in an efficient way with experience in the local fintech space and an affinity for grand rapids lambert recognizes a similar opportunity for others it is my home but it also is a great opportunity to create a lifestyle for tech he said this opportunity is the primary focus of a new plan for west michigan in september the right place inc shared a report with a vision to grow the tech sector in the greater grand rapids region the strategy calls for 20 000 new jobs in tech over the next decade increasing the sector to 10 of all regional employment to bring this idea to fruition the strategy focuses on three categories talent ecosystem and growth for lambert the key to positioning grand rapids as a tech hub isn t as much about infrastructure as it is about attracting talent which the 10 year strategy also cites as a fundamental component for overall execution i think the right place and the michigan economic development corporation are right to be thinking about this lambert said we re a great place to live a great place to raise a family and relatively inexpensive market and that s attractive to talent on the coasts that have not seen their housing prices go down even in the post covid world that we re in locally based companies like acrisure have been making strides in the financial technology space and bringing talent to the region but grand rapids which is consistently known for its advancements in health care and manufacturing technology could benefit from strengthening additional areas according to lambert i believe we have to be competitive in our traditional strengths but fintech has to be on the radar for west michigan to be successful in tech he said fintech has not been as much of our core historically in west michigan but is definitely in the fastest growing category of technology according to deloitte an industry leading provider of auditing services global fintech industry revenue is expected to reach 179 billion by the end of this year and is predicted to reach 213 billion by 2024 deloitte also reported the existence of 26 000 fintech startups worldwide currently an increase from approximately 12 000 in 2019 tiicker is one of those startups and lambert said 35 000 visitors are using the platform each month he said he also expects 2023 to be the company s breakout year and expects to grow the linked assets to 1 billion and boost what he called the industry of shareholder loyalty right now in addition to challenges with the stock market one of the current challenges lambert and the tiicker team faces is getting others to understand the concept we re inventing an industry that is foreign to marketers and investor relations professionals and ceos lambert said it s much harder to sell an idea than it is to sell a product at the same time he said he finds it rewarding to be part of a startup and have a team that wants to be part of this creation his vision is for tiicker to become that 1 billion unicorn out of grand rapids emphasizing the potential the region offers in terms of the right place s tech strategy lambert is optimistic for the future of the sector i have full faith and confidence that 10 years from now we ll talk about the leadership and vision and what a success it was lambert said referring to the strategy he said that regardless of his own experience with tiicker he feels it s beneficial to have this kind of vision here and have people who support it i think it s important to have courage to say this is an area where we aren t strong today but we have a lot of the assets to ultimately win lambert said and i think that s exciting this story can be found in the oct 17 issue of the grand rapids business journal to get more stories like this delivered to your mailbox subscribe here

are a number of strategies you can use to reduce your food costs experts say here are some of them 1 stock up on staples artem lysanev istock getty images make sure your kitchen and pantry are always stocked with certain basics experts say having an ample supply of staple goods will allow you to buy fewer new items each week some of the most useful foods to have on hand include eggs pasta rice bread canned tomatoes frozen vegetables and fruit onions and potatoes said leanne brown author of good enough a self care cookbook consider buying these products in large quantities if you have the space to cut costs over time many meals can be made with these ingredients alone and they serve as the foundation for countless more 2 shop with a grocery list don t show up to the supermarket without a grocery list and some ideas of what you ll be cooking for the week brown said meal planning definitely reduces costs she said if you stick to it you don t waste food that you bought without a plan while you map out your dishes for the week try to think of recipes with easily repurposed leftovers brown said that will enable you to buy less for example a pot of chili can later be used to fill burritos or as nacho topping more from personal finance 32 of americans are struggling to pay their bills consumers prioritize netflix amazon prime over groceries gas nearly half of americans make this mistake with credit cards you can decide eating certain foods on repeat is sad or monotonous or like so much else with life you can choose to look at it more positively having the same breakfast every day for a week can be really comforting and simplify things both wallet wise and decision making wise brown said then you can do something else the next week so you don t feel bored meanwhile shopping with a grocery list probably won t prevent all your impulse buys but that doesn t mean you shouldn t use one even if you stick to them somewhat that is great brown said we don t need to worry about perfection as a treat she purposefully plans to buy one or two things off her list she said 3 compare stores for the best deals you can usually browse discounts on a supermarket s website or app or find them listed at the retailer experts say take a look at your grocery list before you decide where to do your buying said erin clarke author of the well plated cookbook then try to find the store that offers the best value on the particular items you re looking for if you re doing a produce heavy trip look for a store with frequent produce sales clarke said if you re stocking up on shelf stable goods choose a store that has the best value for those even if other items like produce cost more look beyond supermarkets too billy vasquez who runs the 99 cent chef blog said he picks up many of his nonperishable items including mayonnaise ketchup mustard hot sauce dried pasta beans and tortilla chips at his local dollar store timing is everything with food vasquez added buy when fruit and veggies are in season he said they are often on sale around st patrick s day memorial day and independence day you can find steep discounts on items such as corned beef carrots cabbage turkey duck roasts ham boxed stuffing hamburgers and hot dogs many of which can be stored in the freezer for long periods vasquez said year round generic and store brands tend to be the cheaper varieties brown said adding that buying more canned and frozen vegetables when many aren t in season is another evergreen choice 4 change your menu meat and dairy tend to be the more expensive items at the supermarket especially of late in response aim to make more meals that don t rely on them as the central ingredient brown said using meat sparingly as flavor like adding a bit of bacon to a mushroom risotto is more economical she said consuming less meat also helps you to lower your environmental footprint she added buying foods with a longer shelf life can cut your trips to the supermarket altogether even certain produce may last for more time than others especially if you store it properly cabbage carrots brussels sprouts and beets can last for two weeks or longer when stored in the crisper drawer clarke said delaying your return is always good for your wallet she said every time you walk into the store that s an opportunity for impulse purchases to drive up the bill
what do you do when you buy a coupe and then need more space to carry your equipment to work the most common solution is to trade it for a pickup but a honda owner opted for the hard way integrating a bed at the back of his civic the bespoke pickup is based on a seventh gen honda civic 2001 2005 unlike other conversions which include cutting the roof and compromising interior space this one retains the entire greenhouse and most of the body panels of the donor car this means that despite the two door pickup bodystyle it still has the stock four seater cabin see also this honda cr v conversion to a rugged pickup doesn t look that bad the side view reveals the extent of the modifications that are focused at the back the rear bed comes from a first gen nissan navara frontier complete with the tailgate taillights chrome plated bumper and toolbox this makes for the longest rear overhang we have seen for a while resembling a school bus the rear panels are smoothly integrated into the civic s bodywork but the extravagant proportions make it look very unconventional the civic truck with the heavily tinted windows was spotted in a parking lot by rob levinson who shared it on facebook group called front and rear end swaps a quick search on the net revealed that the vehicle nicknamed dragon fly was spotted five years ago in georgia by a reddit user interestingly this is not the first time we see a honda civic based pickup conversion last year we saw a two door pickup based on the sixth generation hatchback while in 2018 honda built its own civic type r pickup called project p that was based on the 10th generation hatchback thanks to rob levinson for the photos

a number of strategies you can use to reduce your food costs experts say here are some of them 1 stock up on staples artem lysanev istock getty images make sure your kitchen and pantry are always stocked with certain basics experts say having an ample supply of staple goods will allow you to buy fewer new items each week some of the most useful foods to have on hand include eggs pasta rice bread canned tomatoes frozen vegetables and fruit onions and potatoes said leanne brown author of good enough a self care cookbook consider buying these products in large quantities if you have the space to cut costs over time many meals can be made with these ingredients alone and they serve as the foundation for countless more 2 shop with a grocery list don t show up to the supermarket without a grocery list and some ideas of what you ll be cooking for the week brown said meal planning definitely reduces costs she said if you stick to it you don t waste food that you bought without a plan while you map out your dishes for the week try to think of recipes with easily repurposed leftovers brown said that will enable you to buy less for example a pot of chili can later be used to fill burritos or as nacho topping more from personal finance 32 of americans are struggling to pay their bills consumers prioritize netflix amazon prime over groceries gas nearly half of americans make this mistake with credit cards you can decide eating certain foods on repeat is sad or monotonous or like so much else with life you can choose to look at it more positively having the same breakfast every day for a week can be really comforting and simplify things both wallet wise and decision making wise brown said then you can do something else the next week so you don t feel bored meanwhile shopping with a grocery list probably won t prevent all your impulse buys but that doesn t mean you shouldn t use one even if you stick to them somewhat that is great brown said we don t need to worry about perfection as a treat she purposefully plans to buy one or two things off her list she said 3 compare stores for the best deals you can usually browse discounts on a supermarket s website or app or find them listed at the retailer experts say take a look at your grocery list before you decide where to do your buying said erin clarke author of the well plated cookbook then try to find the store that offers the best value on the particular items you re looking for if you re doing a produce heavy trip look for a store with frequent produce sales clarke said if you re stocking up on shelf stable goods choose a store that has the best value for those even if other items like produce cost more look beyond supermarkets too billy vasquez who runs the 99 cent chef blog said he picks up many of his nonperishable items including mayonnaise ketchup mustard hot sauce dried pasta beans and tortilla chips at his local dollar store timing is everything with food vasquez added buy when fruit and veggies are in season he said they are often on sale around st patrick s day memorial day and independence day you can find steep discounts on items such as corned beef carrots cabbage turkey duck roasts ham boxed stuffing hamburgers and hot dogs many of which can be stored in the freezer for long periods vasquez said year round generic and store brands tend to be the cheaper varieties brown said adding that buying more canned and frozen vegetables when many aren t in season is another evergreen choice 4 change your menu meat and dairy tend to be the more expensive items at the supermarket especially of late in response aim to make more meals that don t rely on them as the central ingredient brown said using meat sparingly as flavor like adding a bit of bacon to a mushroom risotto is more economical she said consuming less meat also helps you to lower your environmental footprint she added buying foods with a longer shelf life can cut your trips to the supermarket altogether even certain produce may last for more time than others especially if you store it properly cabbage carrots brussels sprouts and beets can last for two weeks or longer when stored in the crisper drawer clarke said delaying your return is always good for your wallet she said every time you walk into the store that s an opportunity for impulse purchases to drive up the bill
