metals commented we continue to focus on the goals set forth when we announced our operational turnaround program maintaining our strong commitment to health safety environment and the well being of our stakeholders in the current reduced commodities price and high inflation environment we continue to monitor operations and production to determine any necessary modifications to our plans earlier this year we provided a timeline for delivering initial improvements at our operations which included a plan to ramp up production starting in q2 of this year our turnaround program is starting to take effect with quarter over quarter improvements at yauricocha we report quarter over quarter improvements to average daily tonnage and slightly higher grades for all metals except lead with a 12 increase in copper equivalent production over q1 2022 at bolivar when compared to q1 2022 we report a 37 quarter over quarter improvement in average daily throughput during this quarter along with slight increases to grades which resulted in a 62 increase in copper equivalent production over q1 2022 at cusi an unexpected underground flooding event during the quarter resulted in a 38 decrease in quarter over quarter silver equivalent production he concluded we are trending in the right direction with consolidated production improvements from our mines having achieved production within our guidance for h1 our disciplined approach to achieve stabilized mining operations continues with our primary goal in mind to achieve a full recovery at bolivar infill drilling and exploration programs

4 16pm fed chair powell says us not in a recession the dow closed wednesday up 436 points 1 4 at 32 198 the nasdaq composite jumped 470 points 4 1 to 12 032 and the s p 500 added 103 points 2 6 to finish at 4 024 the benchmarks were positive but relatively unchanged for most of the day until the federal reserve announced its decision to raise interest rates another 75 basis points bps coupled with a suggestion from chairman jerome powell that rate hikes could slow in the coming months at that point the indices all swerved sharply upward in the final hours of trading as the stance of monetary policy tightens further it likely will become appropriate to slow the pace of increases while we assess how our cumulative policy adjustments are affecting the economy and inflation powell said at a press conference he added that he did not believe the us is in a recession noting that there are too many areas of the economy that are performing too well 2 10pm the fed hike interest rates again as expected the us federal reserve has raised interest rates yet again by another 0 75 in an effort to stem the tide of recession the move hikes short term borrowing rates to between 2 25 and 2

nasdaq was up 2 5 at 11 855 chief market analyst naeem aslam said the fed did what they said will do by increasing the interest rate by 75 basis points this action was very largely priced into the market as a result we have seen weakness in the dollar index while the stock markets is holding on to its gains aslam wrote going forward the fed needs to make sure that they continue to address all the noise about the future interest rate hike as it is highly likely that the next interest rate will not be 75 basis points we expect a lot of noise in the market as different fed members will send mixed signals aslam also noted that traders also need to keep in mind the us non farm payroll nfp data released next week as the fed will fine tune their monetary policy based on the health of the us economy 12 05pm stocks in the green all three major us indices are in the green midday pushing higher ahead of the us federal reserve decision on interest rates at 2 pm et today at noon the dow jones

according to interest rate futures an increase of 75 basis points is tipped to be the most likely outcome but at the same time an increase of 100 basis points cannot be ruled out in the past two weeks we have seen a couple of surprises from central banks as the bank of canada and the european central bank lifted rates by larger amounts than anticipated seeing as the boc upped the ante the fed might use that as cover to press ahead with a 1 lift madden added madden also noted us equity traders have shrugged off the disappointing forecast from walmart yesterday google s parent alphabet revealed

up 182 points at 11 745 points oanda senior market analyst craig erlam noted that there was plenty more to come from big tech but first investors would hear from the fed which was expected to hike interest rates by another 75 basis points finds itself in an uncomfortable spot with markets now pricing in a relatively swift u turn in 2023 from aggressive tightening to loosening in order to support the economy he said the fed must walk a fine line as any validation of that will undermine its efforts to tighten and get a grip on inflation attention will be on its guidance over the coming

laden nasdaq 100 added 1 7 however everything today will hinge on the afternoon interest rate decision from the us federal reserve and its accompanying statement due at 2 15pm et the fed is widely expected to raise interest rates by 75 basis points but the key question is whether such a hike will have the desired effect of tackling inflation which is currently at multi decade highs jeffrey halley senior market analyst asia pacific oanda noted after what seems like an interminable wait we are finally at fomc day markets have baked another 75 basis points into their loaves of bread but it s going to be all about what the fed and jerome powell say and not what they do the imf downgraded world growth forecasts last night and there are plenty of recessionary signs around the world what we re not yet seeing is easing commodity prices and supply chain pressures flowing through to lower prices he continued markets will be betting heavily that the federal reserve may mollify some of its inflationary language these were the same markets that just recently were pricing in 100 basis points today in a panicked manner so don t take their wisdom as gospel although the fed may well be pleased that some of their harsh medicine is taking effect by virtue of voice and intent rather than action it wouldn t make much sense for them to take their foot off the brakes right now and pivot to being dovishly hawkish the fed already has a credibility issue thanks to being so vehemently in team transitory and although my expectations for them are nearly as low as the reserve bank of new zealand monetary custodial of my beloved but now thoroughly messed up country i expect them to stay on message halley concluded on the earnings front the latest numbers from alphabet and microsoft both came in below expectations but had some bright spots and both shares rose microsoft blamed a strong us dollar and a slowing pc market although it was noted that q4 revenues were still a record 51 87bn and 12 up over the same period a year ago as for alphabet advertising revenues were also good but again below expectations youtube revenue came in at 7 34bn below 7 52bn while advertising revenues rose 12 to 56 3bn on wednesday after hours the earnings spotlight will be on facebook ower meta inc and music streaming firm spotify inc while both apple inc and amazon com inc nasdaq amzn

u s federal reserve board chairman jerome powell holds a news conference after the fed decided to once again raise interest rates by three quarters of a percentage point at the william mcchesney martin jr building in washington d c july 27 the fed hopes to temper inflation rates which have reached their highest levels in 40 years epa yonhap the federal reserve on wednesday raised its benchmark interest rate by a hefty three quarters of a point for a second straight time in its most aggressive drive in more than three decades to tame high inflation the fed s move will raise its key rate which affects many consumer and business loans to a range of 2 25 percent to 2 5 percent its highest level since 2018 speaking at a news conference after the fed s latest policy meeting chair jerome powell stressed that the central bank remains committed to defeating chronically high inflation at the same time worry that the fed s efforts could eventually cause a recession are growing as consumers and businesses struggle with both high prices and rising borrowing rates on wednesday powell passed up several opportunities to say the fed would slow its hikes if a recession occurred while inflation was still high roberto perli an economist at piper sandler an investment bank said the fed chair emphasized that even if it caused a recession bringing down inflation is important but powell also said the pace of the fed s hikes could slow in coming months now that its key rate is roughly at a level that is believed to neither support nor restrict growth that suggestion helped ignite a powerful rally on wall street with the sp 500 stock market index surging 2 6 percent the prospect of lower interest rates generally fuel stock market gains at the same time powell was careful during his news conference not to rule out another three quarter point hike when the fed s policymakers next meet in september he said that rate decision will depend upon what emerges from the many economic reports that will be released between now and then i do not think the u s is currently in a recession powell said at his news conference in which he suggested that the fed s rate hikes have already had some success in slowing the economy and possibly easing inflationary pressures the central bank s decision follows a jump in inflation to 9 1 percent the fastest annual rate in 41 years and reflects its strenuous efforts to slow price gains across the economy by raising borrowing rates the fed makes it costlier to take out a mortgage or an auto or business loan consumers and businesses then presumably borrow and spend less cooling the economy and slowing inflation the surge in inflation and fear of a recession have eroded consumer confidence and stirred public anxiety about the economy which is sending frustratingly mixed signals and with the november midterm elections nearing americans discontent has diminished president joe biden s public approval ratings and increased the likelihood that the democrats will lose control of the house and senate

spirit airlines and frontier airlines agreed wednesday to abandon their merger proposal opening the doors for jetblue to acquire spirit washington spirit airlines and frontier airlines agreed wednesday to abandon their merger proposal opening the way for jetblue airways to acquire spirit spirit the largest budget carrier in the united states said it was still in discussions with jetblue and expects to provide a further update in the near future the decision by spirit and frontier to terminate their deal was announced while spirit shareholders were still voting on the proposal it was apparent that despite the support of spirit s board shareholders were prepared to reject the frontier deal the frontier offer was worth more than 2 6 billion in cash and stock far short of jetblue s all cash bid of 3 7 billion a combination of spirit with either frontier or jetblue would create the nation s fifth largest airline although it would be still quite a bit smaller than american united delta and southwest competing with jetblue s richer cash offer the spirit board and frontier argue that antitrust regulators will block jetblue from buying spirit making the jetblue bid an illusory one jetblue of course disagrees the biden administration was always likely to take a close look at either deal the president and his top antitrust official in the justice department have both indicated a dislike for corporate mergers some analysts said that the small size of frontier and spirit would have earned them a pass from antitrust regulators in previous administrations but not any more still the jetblue deal did appear more problematic in part because the justice department was already suing to break up a regional partnership in the northeast between jetblue and american airlines frontier and spirit announced their deal on feb 7 saying they would create a huge discount airline that would save consumers 1 billion a year in airfares by creating a powerful new competitor to american united delta and southwest the proposal would have brought together two very similar airlines both tempt travelers with rock bottom fares but tack on fees for some things that bigger carriers include with most tickets from soft drinks to room for a bag in the overhead bin they even share financial roots bill franke s indigo partners private equity firm invested in spirit before taking an 82 stake in frontier and investing in budget carriers in mexico chile and hungary frontier and spirit said that together they would have enough planes to fly many new routes that aren t yet served by a discount airline and they would create 10 000 new jobs by 2026 in the process a merger would also address one of the biggest complaints consumers have about frontier and spirit they are so small with such limited schedules that when they cancel a flight it can take days to find seats for all the passengers on later flights jetblue ceo robin hayes decided that he could not sit back and watch frontier and spirit become bigger than his airline on april 5 jetblue started a bidding war by announcing its own plan to take over spirit jetblue figured that buying spirit was the best way it could quickly add planes and pilots and break out of the second tier of u s airlines jetblue argued that it would help consumers too by driving down fares more effectively than frontier and spirit new york based jetblue mounted a furious campaign to convince spirit shareholders to reject the frontier offer it worked forcing spirit s board to postpone a vote on the frontier proposal four times in july frontier ceo barry biffle admitted his side was losing badly both frontier and jetblue raised their bids including and increasing break up fees for spirit shareholders at the end frontier offered 4 13 in cash plus 1 9126 shares of its stock for each share of spirit that was worth about 2 65 billion at frontier s closing price on tuesday and spirit shareholders would own 48 5 of the combined company jetblue s bid was more straightforward 33 50 per share plus a ticking fee to cover any delay in regulatory review which would push the value of the offer to 3 7 billion all in cash jetblue investors seem unimpressed with the airline s pursuit of spirit since jetblue entered the bidding its shares have fallen 45 more than other u s airline except regional carrier mesa once spirit s fate is settled analysts believe that more mergers are possible among the smaller airlines but not likely any deals involving american united delta or southwest because of antitrust issues

updated july 27 2022 at 2 01 pm et with prices rising at their fastest pace in a generation the federal reserve is ratcheting up its fight against inflation on wednesday the fed raised its benchmark interest rate by an additional three quarters of a percentage point this is the fourth time the central bank has raised rates this year it follows an increase of the same size in june rate hikes at this pace and magnitude have not occurred since the late 1980s despite these fast and furious moves the central bank has its work cut out for it its goal is to rein in inflation without kickstarting a recession the labor market is extremely tight and inflation is much too high fed chair jerome powell said at a news conference where he explained the unusually large move up in rates he and his colleagues are trying to fight inflation by tackling demand they are pushing up the cost of of credit what consumers and companies pay to borrow money and they are trying to deal with a jobs market the fed chair has called unsustainably hot where wages are rising fast because many businesses are paying more to find workers in a statement the fed said that some parts of the economy like spending and production have weakened however it noted that job gains have been robust in recent months and the unemployment rate has remained low the key goal of course is to fight inflation which remains elevated at 9 1 the highest in four decades the fed noted that pandemic s supply chain issues have continued to push prices and the russia ukraine war is adding additional pressure on food and energy prices my colleagues and i are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship especially on those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food housing and transportation powell said powell stressed that it was a time of great uncertainty in the economy however he s clearly trying to achieve what economists call a soft landing for the economy to do that the fed is ratcheting up interest rates but this isn t a precise or painless process as policymakers continue to raise rates growth will slow further and the unemployment rate which is close to its pre pandemic low will rise the fed would like those adjustments to happen in a measured way but that is easier said than done in june inflation rose by 9 1 from a year earlier and the fed is tackling a problem that is shaped by factors outside of its control the central bank is equipped to deal with demand which surged as the u s emerged from the darkest days of the pandemic but it can t fix supply chain issues or end the war in ukraine both of which have led to higher prices especially of gasoline and food economy continues to create jobs but housing has slowed powell and his colleagues on the federal open market committee are closely tracking economic data but they have been mixed on the one hand inflation didn t peak in may the consumer price index ticked up in june thanks in large part to higher energy prices on the other hand the labor market has remained strong in june it added 372 000 new jobs more than wall street expected which brought the total number of jobs added in the first half of the year to 2 7 million meanwhile the housing market has been slowing down thanks to higher interest rates according to freddie mac the average rate on a 30 year fixed rate mortgage is now 5 54 close to double from the beginning of the year which has iced out many buyers new home construction and sales have also declined then there is the stock market this year the broad based s p 500 is down about 17 and the tech heavy nasdaq which is in a bear market has fallen by about 25 later this week the commerce department will release its quarterly report card on economic growth in the first three months of the year gross domestic product shrunk by 1 4 there s a lot of evidence that economic growth has slowed over the first half of this year says ryan wang a u s economist at hsbc economic numbers are difficult to process but there s no clarity in the data michael gapen the head of u s economics research at bank of america securities says crosscurrents make these numbers difficult to process when you have data points that are in conflict with each other you have to ask yourself which ones do you believe he says trust the instruments that you believe in economists know that data distortions tend to diminish over time the u s department of labor revises its monthly jobs numbers for instance and the gdp figures we ll get on thursday are only the commerce department s first estimate but in this moment it is hard for powell and his colleagues to be patient inflation has become a political issue because rising prices are weighing so heavily on consumer sentiment according to a recent morning consult politico poll 65 of registered voters believe the u s economy is currently in a recession that s despite the fact that a recession hasn t been declared by the national bureau of economic research the nonprofit group that officially makes that determination doing nothing at this stage not getting on top of the inflation problem likely means course correcting later is even harder says gapen if inflation becomes entrenched and long run inflation expectations move higher history says breaking that spiral is much harder and the downturn would likely be much deeper win mcnamee getty images getty images federal reserve chair jerome powell is trying to achieve a soft landing for the u s economy bringing inflation under control without kickstarting a recession some prices are coming down like powell economists are scrutinizing the data looking for signs that the fed s policies are working michelle meyer who is the u s chief economist at the mastercard economics institute sees some promising signs oil has been trading lower and gas prices have fallen according to aaa the average price for a gallon of regular gas is 4 33 which is about 0 69 lower than its record high set in june if you look at a broad range of commodity prices in the markets they are starting to come down meyer says inventory levels are starting to pick up for certain categories supply chains are starting to open up so the cost of production is coming down those data may give powell confidence what he and his colleagues are trying to engineer is working copyright

despite the penalties the trade had continued between the countries until covid presented another obstacle an undated surveillance image provided in a u s department of justice complaint for forfeiture released may 9 2019 shows what is described as the north korean vessel wise honest being loaded with coal in nampo north korea a trade official in south pyongan province says that north korea is again exporting coal from the port north korea has resumed shipping coal to energy starved china to secure much needed foreign currency despite u n sanctions prohibiting the transactions rfa has learned u n security council resolution 2371 adopted in august 2017 forbids countries from buying coal that originates in north korea the sanctions are aimed at depriving pyongyang of cash and resources that could be funneled into its nuclear and missile programs but china s energy needs are great and north korea s coal is of exceptionally high quality so sales of coal stocks to chinese buyers resumed in mid july a trade official in north korea s south pyongan province north of pyongyang told rfa s korean service on condition of anonymity for security reasons trading companies affiliated with the party and the military resumed exporting coal to earn foreign currency on orders of the central committee said the source coal exported to china is transported from nampo port to the west sea the source said referring to the body of water west of the korean peninsula known internationally as the yellow sea it is common for the coal to be transferred from the north korean trading company s ships to chinese ships on the open sea the source said the ship to ship transfers are an effort to avoid detection although monitors have known the sales have continued since the sanctions were imposed in 2019 the u s treasury penalized two taiwanese citizens and three shipping companies for transferring petroleum products with north korean ships on the high seas in october 2021 rfa reported that coal exports from north korea to china sometimes through ship to ship transfers were on the rise as china struggled with severe coal shortages that led to rolling blackouts in many parts of the country maritime trade between the two countries has been on and off during the coronavirus pandemic it was off again at the time that north korea declared a maximum emergency in may when a major outbreak was traced to a military parade in late april authorities have apparently made an exception in the case of coal some trading companies are getting bolder and forego ship to ship transfers entirely the source said some of the powerful party affiliated trading companies bring the chinese ships into the port of nampo where they are loaded with coal and then sail directly to chinese ports they can receive the cash right there on the spot the source said foreign currency earned from coal exports is not deposited into the foreign trade bank of the dprk but is collected directly by the party the coal shipped out of nampo goes to various ports in china s shandong province with longkou being the most popular destination sources said coal is also transferred over a much shorter distance between ryongchon county in the northwestern province of north pyongan and donggang china a trade official in north pyongan told rfa on condition of anonymity to speak freely these days at jinhung wharf in ryongchon county military trading companies that have received permission to resume coal exports from the central committee are exporting coal through the sea he said powerful trading companies are earning foreign currency by exporting hundreds of thousands of tons of coal at a time by borrowing large ships from china said the second source a ton of north korea s high quality anthracite coal can fetch between u s 100 and 110 in china according to the second source this is almost double the cost per ton quoted by sources in the rfa report from october 2021 military companies are using the foreign currency they earn from coal exports to secure fuel for border guard patrol boats and warships and food for military personnel the second source said sources told rfa that they were not able to determine if the resumption of coal exports is being carried out under any agreement with the chinese government rfa contacted offices at the united nations including the u s mission to the u n by phone and email but had not received any response as of 4 p m wednesday a u s state department spokesperson told rfa that united nations sanctions on the dprk remain in place we will continue to implement them and encourage others to fully implement them including at the united nations and with the dprk s neighbors the spokesperson said the dprk continues to fund its wmd and ballistic missile programs through sanctions evasion efforts in violation of un security council resolutions it is important for the international community to send a strong unified message that the dprk must halt provocations abide by its obligations under un security council resolutions and engage in sustained and intensive negotiations with the united states translated by leejin j chung

the fed s latest hike its fourth since march will further magnify borrowing costs for homes cars and credit cards example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video washington higher mortgage rates have sent home sales tumbling credit card rates have grown more burdensome and so have auto loans savers are finally receiving yields that are actually visible while crypto assets are reeling the federal reserve s move wednesday to further tighten credit raised its benchmark interest rate by a sizable 0 75 percentage point for a second straight time the fed s latest hike its fourth since march will further magnify borrowing costs for homes cars and credit cards though many borrowers may not feel the impact immediately the central bank is aggressively raising borrowing costs to try to slow spending cool the economy and defeat the worst outbreak of inflation in two generations the fed s actions have ended for now an era of ultra low rates that arose from the 2008 2009 great recession to help rescue the economy and then re emerged during the brutal pandemic recession when the fed slashed its benchmark rate back to near zero chair jerome powell hopes that by making borrowing more expensive the fed will succeed in slowing demand for homes cars and other goods and services reduced spending could then help bring inflation most recently measured at a four decade high of 9 1 back to the fed s 2 target yet the risks are high a series of higher rates could tip the u s economy into recession that would mean higher unemployment rising layoffs and further downward pressure on stock prices how will it all affect your finances here are some of the most common questions being asked about the impact of the rate hike i m considering buying a house what s happening with mortgage rates higher interest rates have torpedoed the housing market rates on home loans have nearly doubled from a year ago to 5 5 though they ve leveled off in recent weeks even as the fed has signaled that more credit tightening is likely that s because mortgage rates don t necessarily move in tandem with the fed s increases sometimes they even move in the opposite direction long term mortgages tend to track the yield on the 10 year treasury note which in turn is influenced by a variety of factors these factors include investors expectations for future inflation and global demand for u s treasurys investors expect a recession to hit the u s economy later this year or early next year this would force the fed to eventually cut its benchmark rate in response the expectation that the fed will have to reverse some of its hikes next year has helped reduce the 10 year yield from 3 5 in mid june to roughly 2 8 will it be easier to find a house sales of existing homes have dropped for five straight months while new home sales plunged in june if you re financially able to go ahead with a home purchase you re likely to have more choices than you did a few months ago in many cities the options are few but the number of available houses nationwide has started to rise after falling to rock bottom levels at the end of last year there are now 1 26 million homes for sale according to the national association of realtors up 2 4 from a year ago i need a new car should i buy one now the fed s rate hikes typically make auto loans more expensive but other factors also affect these rates including competition among car makers which can sometimes lower borrowing costs rates for buyers with lower credit ratings are most likely to rise as a result of the fed s hikes because used vehicle prices on average are rising monthly payments will rise too what will happen to my credit card for users of credit cards home equity lines of credit and other variable interest debt rates would rise by roughly the same amount as the fed hike usually within one or two billing cycles that s because those rates are based in part on banks prime rate which moves in tandem with the fed those who don t qualify for low rate credit cards might be stuck paying higher interest on their balances the rates on their cards would rise as the prime rate does the fed s rate increases have already sent credit card borrowing rates above 20 for the first time in at least four years according to lendingtree which has tracked the data since 2018 how will this affect my savings you can now earn more on bonds cds and other fixed income investments and it depends on where your savings if you have any are parked savings certificates of deposit and money market accounts don t typically track the fed s changes instead banks tend to capitalize on a higher rate environment to try to boost their profits they do so by imposing higher rates on borrowers without necessarily offering any juicer rates to savers but online banks and others with high yield savings accounts are often an exception these accounts are known for aggressively competing for depositors the only catch is that they typically require significant deposits how have the rate hikes influenced crypto like many highly valued technology stocks cryptocurrencies like bitcoin have sunk in value since the fed began raising rates bitcoin has plunged from a peak at about 68 000 to 21 000 higher rates mean that safe assets like bonds and treasuries become more attractive to investors because their yields are now higher that in turn makes risky assets like technology stocks and cryptocurrencies less attractive all that said bitcoin is suffering from its own problems that are separate from economic policy two major crypto firms have failed the shaken confidence of crypto investors is not being helped by the fact that the safest place you can park money now bonds seems like a safer move will my student loan payment go up right now payments on federal student loans are suspended until aug 31 as part of an emergency measure that was put in place early in the pandemic inflation means that loan holders have less disposable income to make payments still a slowed economy that reduces inflation could bring some relief by fall

best 100 dealerships to work for in 2022 this is an outstanding achievement and continues to set us apart from everyone else i continue to remain confident about the opportunities i see across our diversified enterprise thanks to all of you that joined us today and i ll turn it over to the operator for any of your questions thank you question and answer session operator our first question comes from the line of john murphy with bank of america please go ahead roger penske hey john john murphy good afternoon roger â roger shelley and tony just â roger one of the big concerns i think people have is that eventually volumes are going to recover and grosses may come under a bit of pressure then which will be a market dynamic but what you can control in a pretty significant way is your sg a costs so i m just curious as volumes recover and inventory rebuilds probably not going to be until late 2023 that we figure this all out but what kind of actions on sg a do you think you can take to keep a lid on them in inflating and if you could just maybe remind us how sales comp plans are generally structured because that would be a big portion of variable that could theoretically inflate as volume comes back or maybe not roger penske well john first let s go back and look at pre covid our sg a was running 78 of gross today it s at 66 it s up 3 from q1 sequentially and i think that we re going to end up somewhere in the low 70s as we tend to get back to normal to a normal business now obviously we ve had some impact due to salaries and wages there s pressure on that we ve had the opportunity to open up our people to be able to travel which has increased some of our sg a our marketing costs and advertising is down the good news is we took 10 of our people out during the covid which has reduced our sg a from that standpoint not including obviously the additions we ve had from our acquisitions overall i think that taxes have increased some but i think that today we are really tight our turnover right now is at 17 to 18 depending on which area of the country you look at when you talk about comp to growth we re running at about 40 overall and that s consistent with what it was last year when you look at our variable compensation it runs about 25 of gross and on the fixed side which is parts and service it runs about 25 so overall i think those are steady they re in line and we don t see really anything driving those higher because a big part of our business is variable when you think about flat rate mechanics you think about sales and the good news on the sales side with the reduction of our people we ve been able to get more productivity and that s helped us drive some of these grosses from the standpoint of reducing the number of sales people but adding more units per person which has been key so again we re going to be driven here from an sg a probably with the supply shortages from a marketing and advertising standpoint we re going to keep that pretty much in hand and not grow that and expect where we need to maybe on a new acquisition in the marketplace we think that as we look at the business pre covid we really looked at how we would restructure the business and we ve kept those parts of our business in line and that s given us i think the ability to maintain probably anywhere from 500 to 700 basis points better as we get into a more normal operation and again with a 10 reduction in people john murphy okay that s incredibly helpful and then just a second question and this is kind of a high class problem and it s kind of a little bit tough to give you a hard time about this but 0 7 times your net leverage i mean that s pretty that s reasonably conservative relative to what a lot of your peers are running at admittedly you did 1 3 billion in acquisitions and 275 million in buybacks year to date so you are actually deploying capital so you re pushing it but i m just curious if there may be an opportunity to maybe even take on leverage and get a little bit more aggressive on buybacks or acquisitions whether itâ d be in new used or maybe even in the commercial truck side roger penske well i think right now in the current business conditions and a lot of the uncertainties we want to be safe and secure and basically we ve driven almost 1 billion worth of debt out since i think the end of 2020 and we want to continue to have that flexibility i think we ll see within our numbers here that with that lower i think it was 0 7 times gives us really a war chest to do something but right now we re going to look at buyback versus acquisitions and right now with the high prices i think that we ll have to look at that even further quarter by quarter but we continue to like our stock from the standpoint of buying it back if it s necessary and we ve seen some great opportunities on underperforming maybe lower costs for some of these acquisitions that we re making throughout our total network around the world so overall if you look at acquisitions we made 1 9 billion over the last 18 months plus the share buyback which was about 8 of our stock so i think that it s going to balance between that and it s so fluid it d be hard for me to say which is going to be the main focus i think we re going to look at all of them on a monthly basis as we look at our overall capital structure john murphy roger if you were to think about sort of normal times without all the chaos that appears to be swirling at the moment what would you think sort of net leverage could or should be what would be the target that you and shelley would be looking at there roger penske well i guess when things get back to normal probably what two somewhere at shelley shelley hulgrave yes i think two is accurate i think certainly our target to remain below 2 5 on an adjusted basis and we certainly have a lot of runway to get us there anthony pordon but we have flexed the balance sheet in the past to make acquisitions like we did with the pts acquisition to go above three if we needed to shelley hulgrave that s right roger penske you might mention where we are from a credit rating perspective what the expectations are from the agencies shelley hulgrave yes so the conversations that we ve had if we can keep that adjusted level below 2 5 to three times for the remainder of the year we could start talking about investment grade and as i mentioned we ve got a lot of room we ve got a lot of runway to get there and all the things that we ve mentioned the acquisitions the share buybacks the dividend all of that has kept has been able to finance that through cash flow from operations and keep our debt at steady levels so it certainly hasn t keeping our leverage at 0 7x certainly hasn t hindered us from a capital allocation standpoint roger penske and we want to be very careful we don t stray off road where we are obviously we are seeing the benefit of our pts investment australia continues to grow and we look at what we re doing there from the standpoint of that business and overall we just had our board of directors in the uk and the ability for them to grow is a real opportunity there as people move forward so overall we re going to try to stay safe and secure john but i think we d like to get to investment grade we re certainly in a position to move on into bigger acquisitions but they re going to come to us and we re not going to overstretch if possible john murphy okay thank you very much i appreciate it thank you roger penske thanks john operator thank you mr murphy next question comes from the line of rajat gupta with jpmorgan please go ahead roger penske hi rajat rajat gupta hey good afternoon tony roger shelley just had a question on ptl the first one really strong trends again in the second quarter could you quantify like what the gain on sale impact was in the quarter and excluding gain on sale how do you see trends for the remainder of the year maybe if you could give us some color across the different business lines how you see them progressing through the remainder of the year and i have a follow up thanks roger penske yeah good from a full service lease perspective our revenue was up 8 and commercial rental was up 35 and remember 50 of our commercial rental business comes from our lease customers and with the growth we ve had on that over the last three years that s paying real dividends for us for now and i think vehicles on rent from a commercial rental perspective daily have been running about 65 000 if you can believe it we have the largest rental fleet probably in the world when you look at it and it probably is two to three times higher than our closest competitor when you look at the revenue coming out of that and from overall â from the overall standpoint our business was still up 7 to 8 if you take out â if you just take out the gain on sale increase over the years so again it s still been a very big growth business and we think that logistics impact we ve had we were up 11 in the quarter our consumer rental was down and that s the one where rent it here leave it there but the good news is we re able to repurchase those trucks into our commercial rental fleet which obviously we re getting markup and good margins on that probably the biggest impact we have is we only have 4 000 units to sell because we re being backlogged from the truck manufacturers with over 60 000 units on order and we get those â and as soon as we get them we either add them into our rental fleet get an older unit out which will reduce our maintenance cost so we re pushing hard on the oems and we still see that going to be probably through 2023 into 2024 before we get back to a normal supply chain capability for us on heavy trucks rajat gupta got it and the gain on sale in 2q and how much was that year over year roger penske well it was 140 million and it was up 95 million now we get in â from the standpoint of pag we get 27 million of that what would accrue to our profitability for the quarter tony anthony pordon correct our ownership percentage of 28 9 times the 95 million is 27 million that would have increased on a year over year basis in the second quarter rajat gupta got it got it and maybe just to follow up on like the sg a question there s going to be a number of electric vehicles hitting the market in next 12 months to 18 months maybe if you could give us a sense of how those models coming in changes just the headcount structure of the store the composition payroll just productivity given those units are going to require a little bit more of an educational experience and maybe a little bit more of hand holding relative to the eyes of new customers so maybe any thoughts on that how you see that progressing and changing just the look and feel of the dealership thanks roger penske well i think that s a good point we see that training is necessary we see the tools and also the facility changes we have to make to be able to handle a bev vehicle because of electrification and that will take some of the â at least initially it s going to be all under warranty but as we go out into the longer life of a vehicle â electric vehicle those will come back into the shops so i feel that will be a benefit we have to train our people based on oem requirements we talked about the number of electrification points we have from the standpoint of already â and that s to meet many of the oems requirements for fast charging and we ll continue to add to that as we go forward but from a training perspective this is always accomplished with â arm in arm with the oem rajat gupta got it great thanks for the color and iâ ll jump back in queue roger penske all right thanks rajat operator thank you mr gupta our next question comes from the line of daniel imbro with stephens inc please go ahead roger penske hey daniel daniel imbro congrats on the quarter roger penske thanks daniel daniel imbro roger i want to start on the demand side of the equation can you just maybe provide an update on however you measure it the amount of inventory presold or how many â how much visibility you have basically into the back half of the year on to the demand side and then maybe can you touch on auto and commercial truck and how that differs roger penske well let s look at auto here in the us right now we get allocations and giving it now maybe 30 to 60 days and they might give an allocation of 300 cars and within a week they pull it back so again it s really a variable we re selling into that allocation on a day to day basis and typically as we look at our inventory at 12 days everything that s coming in is going back out in fact when i look at i think we re running at 95 of allocation we re turning and that s how we re driving obviously the inventory from a lookout some of the high priced cars corvettes and some of the fancier luxury cars we probably have six months to a year on the other hand if we go to the uk where people typically spec their car and build it we have 35 000 forward sold orders in the uk today representing about us 130 million when you look at it from a standpoint and we have a 30 flow through on that roughly as we look at it going forward so quite positive from the truck side again we re sold out through 2022 on the heavy duty truck side and we re all as i said earlier i think we re going to be starting to have allocation september october into 2023 and we can even see that from the standpoint of what s available across our leasing business daniel imbro got it that s helpful and maybe on the used on the auto side i wanted to touch on carshop i think of the slide that said same store units were flat but obviously overall retail same store was still i think down 11 so how was that segment able to outperform so materially and can you accelerate that growth or use some of those learnings back across the rest of the dealership channel roger penske well i would say today carshop both in the us and the uk has a huge focus because where we normally farm within the say â 12 000 to â 14 000 or â 15 000 vehicle in the uk we just can t buy them and in the us we ve had to move up from a 20 000 cost car to a 30 000 we tried to back up and look at these 8 000 to 10 000 to 12 000 vehicles but to me they re really wholesale and we just told our people the customer experience the guest experience buying those cars along we ve seen our policy go way up on those types of vehicles so we ve really had to pull back because we just don t have the ability to buy the cars that we want because of the lower new car volume that s reducing the number of used into the market and therefore that we re really looking at volumes being down over the next several months until this whole market changes but we re going to use technology we re going to shorten up the time potentially between reconditioning because we think we ve got money there that we re losing because of just logistics getting cars into our locations to be able to recondition them properly for the customers so there s quite a bit of opportunity i think that self sourcing is key in the uk we ve got to use more we re using more of auctions we re here in the us we ve been able to move that up we re up to about 80 to 85 which is certainly good but it s a focus for us we re in the business we re staying in it but i would have to say that with all the turmoil right now i think the best thing we re doing is it s making us better building a stronger foundation and we ll continue to look for ways that we can enhance our gross margin daniel imbro great great and last one for me just on the used commercial truck side you mentioned new backlog is still real strong but on the used side are you seeing any softening of demand as the freight market softened or anything changing there as we see prices begin to fall in the used truck side roger penske well i think right now the reason we re seeing price falling is because they re way too high i mean just realistically a lot of these trucks that were being purchased at these high margins were owner operators but with freight rates or with freight availability being down these people just can t afford these payments on these higher priced used and i think that s having some impact on the overall market right now our big customers from ptg have been selling their trucks themselves so we have the opportunity as we go forward to action some of those trucks into our inventory and we re pricing those today on a 30 day basis meaning that we re not giving you a price on a trade more than 30 days out and we ll continue to adjust those accordingly and we ve seen that come down and yet we made an acquisition south west in portland and salem and we took on some trucks newer trucks what i would say two to three years old or low mileage which obviously are at higher rates and those seem to have some impact on some of our margins right now but that s 100 to 150 trucks so as we get through those we ll be back pretty much at the level on the other hand when you look at pts at our truck leasing business i think i mentioned it earlier that we re selling trucks that are four to five to six years old and those margins continue to be very strong we see very little deterioration on those at the moment so i think overall we re in pretty good shape daniel imbro great thanks so much guys good luck going forward roger penske thanks operator thank you mr imbro our next question comes from the line of david whiston with morningstar please go ahead roger penske hi david david whiston hi everyone i guess i want to start with a used vehicle question obviously it s very expensive to buy a car for both consumers and for the retailers right now but is that affordability issue is that are you seeing any indication that s hitting the carshop customer more than it is at the franchise level customer roger penske i would say so for sure wouldn t you tony anthony pordon yes absolutely roger penske basically we re remember that carshop with someone and i m talking about in the uk we re talking say â 12 000 to â 15 000 and in the us we re looking at a car being sold between 20 000 and 23 000 well obviously the revenue per unit has gone up considerably as we look at the business right now and that s just taking some people out of the market and i always say with our acquisition costs it s squeezing our margin too at the same time and in the uk obviously they re looking at buying they have 6 000 cars in inventory and turning it about i d say 32 or 33 days but the margin has really been impacted because of the overall cost of sale david whiston yes i hear you there i guess on sg a going back to that earlier discussion is there any more you can take out without reducing headcount roger penske well look there s always more that we can take out i mean i think that when we think about people traveling now we want our people out we run this business with zoom and some of these other things for the last 12 to 18 months and our people want to get out we want them to we think training is important a lot of the things we re doing with the oems and that s going to continue to grow from a standpoint i said there s certainly wage pressures with inflation right now people are living in a different environment so we re having additional costs there and certainly when you look at our company vehicles you look at the cost of fuel costs just i don t know how many i forget how many loaner cars we have but several thousand and we are providing those to our customers so these costs will continue to go up on the other hand we re going to be looking for ways to certainly through our technology that we ll be able to reduce costs time to customer and other things that we re doing that will reduce our overall margin i mean our overall costs as we do business across whether it s new used or parts and service and i think we can do that right now the customer on service doesn t even have to come in the shop we got to a point where he makes his appointment online he drops his car off he pays online and either we can deliver it so these are things that will take less people and we ll be more efficient in our shops and i think the training that we ve been able to do from the standpoint of our parts and services made a big difference and our commitment and technology in body shops where we re doing a lot of wheelwork now which we hadn t been doing before across all the high the german brands are quite honestly they re really piling it in the uk but made a big difference as far as margin anthony pordon david this is tony there s also other processes that we re working on to improve automation that should help reduce some of the costs as we move forward too so you can look for that to come in the future david whiston yes do you think that s more of a six month story or more won t be realized for another couple of years on the automation anthony pordon both to that roger penske i think it s happening every day but we re also getting costs going up so it s remember we were in the high 70s pre covid we re at 63 in q1 we ve opened up travel and what have you we got some higher rents that have come in and we re now we went from 63 to 66 i said earlier in our conversation we d be looking to settle somewhere around 70 to 71 which still is a 10 reduction on where we were before which is significant david whiston yes it s been really cool to see all the improvement both on costs and also on your balance sheet with the leverage ratio going down just one other quick one on australia i m just curious how you were able to grow ebt 5 despite a 14 top line decline roger penske well i think basically it was again as we merged the businesses we had two businesses there before our off highway and on highway we merged those together so we re using single facilities which has helped us from a cost perspective and the margins that we re getting on our truck business has made a big difference even though the volume is down and i think that the mix is better and fusion of course is where we re doing the parts and service on trucks within our own what i would say the after sale network that we had available to us for the off highway business and again the margins we re getting on when you think about right now when we look at gensets over 1 200 kw we probably got 50 of the market which is really key and we continue to get repowers we ve got about 650 trucks running in australia and new zealand with big mtu 4 000 engines and we re doing a lot more repowers which are giving us more margin even though the truck business is down meaning the commercial truck business is down which would hurt our overall volume again parts and service will be the annuity when you think about the fixed coverage in australia is 160 and the fixed coverage in new zealand is 130 so we think we got a solid business then you take the when you look at the 500 billion of spend that the government is going to have over the next 10 years and you think about the things that we ve won there from the standpoint of our contracts on power packs on combat vehicles the offshore patrol vessels and we re working on the collins class repower submarines all of these things are key as we go forward and many of those don t have a sales dollar we re getting paid on some of those just for the labor hours that we provide for the government so this might be some of the reasons you see that benefit but it will ebb and flow as we go through the rest of the year david whiston okay thanks a lot roger penske okay thanks david operator thank you mr whiston our next question comes from the line of glenn chin with seaport global please go ahead glenn chin great thank you good afternoon folks roger penske hi glenn tony facione hi glenn shelley hulgrave hi glenn glenn chin roger or maybe shelley given your underleveraged status and the abundance of capital you have to deploy can you just fill us in on what you re seeing in the pipeline just in terms of availability maybe what you re seeing on valuations whether or not they ve come in at all and then what your preference maybe light vehicle versus commercial vehicle and then i guess further to that given that you ve done some deals up north what your preference may be u s versus canada shelley hulgrave sure glenn i can take this one we ve acquired 1 9 billion in the last in the trailing 12 months it s roughly 50 50 auto and truck and we really like it there trucks are a cheaper multiple typically about 50 of the multiple of an automotive dealership they don t have the cpi or the ci requirements that we see on the auto side however we ve made some really great acquisitions on the auto side at valuations that are attractive to us so u s and canada both of those on the truck side our acquisitions have been along major highway routes so it s very important to us from a customer standpoint to be able to take care of that trucker from start to finish on his run and all both canada and the u s we see a 60 gross profit related to service so that s really important to us we also have made quite a few acquisitions and we announced one this morning and that s on the automotive side we made one earlier with bmw and plan to make the mercedes one here before the end of q3 so it s really a mixed bag there s no script we re not following any particular discipline only that we re evaluating each opportunity as they come up and i know i sound like a broken record in saying we re disciplined but it really has proven out for us glenn chin okay and speaking of discipline can you just speak to us about what you re seeing in terms of valuations recently have they come in versus last year holding up roger penske let me answer that one glenn i would say if you re looking at a premium luxury german brand so bmw and mercedes porsche audi you re looking at probably eight or nine times trailing 12 ebt for goodwill plus assets would be what we see we ve been able to make acquisitions for less than that where they re smaller and maybe not in the premium luxury side toyota and honda are very strong and to me there are some people that just are going to get out of the business at this point i think there is competition out there to buy these better points but what s happening is many of us are running into what we call framework agreements which limit the amount of stores you can have in a particular market or with a particular brand and on top of that your csi and some of the other components of customer satisfaction become a factor so that will play into it as we go forward but right now the premium side is at a high multiple and we re all experiencing that i don t think we re just the only one on the other hand as we go to europe in the u k we see that down significantly from what we re paying here shelley hulgrave and it has to make sense from an sg a perspective we have our area markets and the acquisitions that we made have made sense so that we re not taking on additional administrative costs but using them from what we have purchased so bmw of escondido is a great example we already have presence in that auto mall and it fits really nicely into our socal management group as well as the bmw and mercedes dealerships in the u k holding really well to the structure that we already have there so that is one way we ll continue to reduce costs is to make acquisitions that make sense for us from a cost standpoint too glenn chin okay very good thank you shelley hulgrave thanks operator thank you mr chin our next question comes from the line of mike ward with benchmark please go ahead roger penske hey mike mike ward thank you very much good afternoon everyone tony facione hey mike mike ward i m just curious about you see some of the other dealers getting into financing and an acquisition that you just announced is 0 5 billion of revenue from with mercedes stores in the u k it seems like you have a lot of growth opportunities with your additional structure i m just curious what you think about alternate businesses whether it s captive financing or anything else that makes that you re looking at roger penske we ve been calling ourselves the big d diversified i m glad to see other people now are following calling the same route but look all of us have different reasons we re growing our business in our peer group and look i d take my hat off to them but i ve talked to our board over the last five or six years many many times we ve looked at it but we just don t think at this time that a captive finance company really makes sense for us because when you look at our brand mix 70 of it is premium and in the premium side leasing is a big factor of that along with certified and when you look at half â on third or one fourth of our business is in the uk and when we look at it from the standpoint of our carshop business we re doing we ll do say 12000 to 20000 units over the next say 12 months in that business we just don t have enough volume and when you look at the average length of the customer financing it s probably 72 months and the credit score is probably below 700 and today with delinquencies going up on retail across all other markets i wonder and then you re going to blow up your balance sheet and on top of that you re going to have to take that and sell it into the market securitize it and i think today the people that buy that are going to say is this really what we want to buy 72 month or 60 month paper from the standpoint in the car business with the inflation that we ve had on used car prices so not that we won t ever get into it but we think it s a bad idea right now we don t think that glove fits our hand mike ward okay that makes sense shelley can you talk a little bit about the cadence of expected dividends from ptl i think it was 105 million is that what it was in the second quarter shelley hulgrave yes so we received 105 million so that related to our q4 and our q1 of 2022 earnings and so it s a straight 50 dividend policy and so we can just follow that cadence and we ll receive additional dividends in august and november mike ward august and november super thanks very much roger penske thanks mike operator thank you mr ward currently there are no questions waiting at this time i would like to pass the conference back to mr penske for any final comments roger penske bethany thank you thanks everyone for joining us and we ll see you at the end of the next quarter have a good day bye bye operator that concludes today s conference call i

inflated costs have changed how joaquin mayoral of leroy does his grocery shopping mayoral is a retiree who enjoys driving a truck but he has stopped using that vehicle for his commute to bloomington normal instead he and his wife travel via a small car it s cheaper than gas for his truck half a tank is like 80 and i m on a fixed income that adds up mayoral said he and his wife also have postponed a trip to the west coast to see their son we second guess that trip for sure and my brother lives up in michigan mayoral said i ll bite the bullet on that one and visit him for sure so far he said inflation is more of an annoyance than a devastating issue inflation costs can be a bigger problem for people who drive a lot gary kovalaske of bloomington drives a mail delivery truck for his postal carrier job in minonk a daily 65 mile round trip it makes me wonder if i should move to minonk kovalaske said i work in minonk so i m driving back and forth plus i do have a 100 mile route six days a week it costs quite a bit more for me to do my job kovalaske said he and his wife both work so they re doing ok but higher costs hit them at the grocery store too he said they shop at lower cost grocers now i probably buy more at aldi and walmart now kovalaske said we still buy plenty of food at sam s club and meijer but we watch for sales and look for the best deals they got for some prices can still be too steep at discount grocers susan from normal who declined to give her last name said she and her husband love chicken wings but she got sticker shock when she went to buy a bag i thought oh 14 99 that s not bad i ve seen it at sam s a lot more even though it s probably a larger bag then i look at the price i was paying per pound which was 3 80 which for chicken wings i can t since she lives on the outskirts of town susan said she tries to bundle errands together to save on gas adding she s fortunate as a retiree and empty nester that she s not trying to feed a family anymore retiree challenges retirees face their own challenges when dealing with rising costs their cost of living adjustments through social security have not kept pace with inflation rich gray of bloomington retired early from state farm nearly 20 years ago like many others he s had to cut corners with costs going up but he has no plans to stop his daily visits to the coffee shop that is more about camaraderie than coffee i hope the doughnut place stays in business to have a place to go drink coffee in the morning and listen to lies across the table gray quipped during his regular stop at denny s doughnuts in bloomington but gray said it s no lie that he can t afford to eat out as often i go once a week to a restaurant now gray said you go in and have breakfast at the parkview inn and it s 8 and something for biscuits and gravy and coffee those prices keep going up gray said he also doesn t trade cars trucks and motorcycles like he used to adding he s living off about half the monthly income he was paid when he was working but it s enough to get by gray said he worked as a part time driver for a few years after he retired but has no plans to do that now willie adams of bloomington drove a concrete mixer until he retired about 15 years ago you can t get as much as you used to anymore he said you have to figure out what you are doing gas prices that s what s so high the food nowadays going twice as high as what it should be adams said he set aside for retirement while he worked and his wife did too their combined retirement incomes are getting them through these uncertain financial times it helps for the present time but if you don t have social security and retirement you re not going to make it adams said retired teachers don t have social security to fall back on state pensions that they pay into have to be enough kathryn gossard of bloomington was a speech pathologist and grade school teacher in unit 5 she s been retired for more than a decade and said her pension can withstand the higher costs but not everyone is as fortunate i do know that older retirees and some from smaller school districts in the state get by on a much lower pension that i do said gossard she said retired teachers can pay into a foundation through the illinois retired teachers association to help other retired teachers cover certain medical costs noting she tries to conserve to help others i need to be as careful as i can with the things that i use and ride my bike when i can and walk when i take care of errands that are close by home and do as many things as i can to make my pension stretch gossard said 401ks are hurting many retirees and those close to it rely on a 401k style plan to cover their retirement years courtesy ajay samant dean of the college of business at illinois state university ajay samant is dean of the illinois state university college of business and a finance professor samant said those with 401ks are not feeling great right now the decline in the stock market accompanied by inflation is a double whammy on those who are either retired or are contemplating retirement samant said the steady drop in the stock market this year has caused some to rethink when they retire sean craig is an investment planner in bloomington there s been a lot of people that have talked about delaying retirement or even going back to work a little bit due to dropping 20 on their investments he said referring to how much the stock market fell in the first half of the year bonds are usually considered a much safer investment but those have done poorly too samant said many investors are spooked adding inflation worker shortages and the war in ukraine have helped create a bearish wall street when there s so much uncertainty when companies are not able to hire the people they want when there are supply chain bottlenecks and they are concerns about corporate earnings this has resulted in a downturn in the stock market samant said it s not clear how long it will take for the markets to rebound craig said the best advice for investors is to not overreact and just ride it out but that can be tough when there s so much uncertainty we just don t know how long inflation is going to last and how long is the market going to continue to go down craig said samant thinks the federal reserve has taken the proper steps to slow inflation through a series of interest rate hikes including another 75 basis point rate hike on wednesday they are intended to cool the economy the downside samant said is that it means a recession is likely these are all steps in the right direction but unfortunately they will cause some pain and the pain will not be evenly distributed across the economy that s what a recession is he said samant said a recession will hurt those on a fixed income the most people who can t negotiate for better pay or find another job with better pay also would suffer he said it helps that gas prices are starting to drop but that too could be a mixed signal it could also be consumer sentiment is turning a little pessimist when consumer sentiment turns pessimistic it impacts consumer demand and that is usually the first cause of a recession said samant who predicts it will take at least another year for the u s economy to stabilize and it s not clear what a new economic normal will be

spirit airlines and frontier airlines agreed wednesday to abandon their merger proposal opening the way for jetblue airways to acquire spirit after a months long bidding war for the budget carrier the decision by spirit and frontier to terminate their deal was announced while spirit shareholders were still voting on the proposal it was apparent that despite the support of spirit s board shareholders were prepared to reject the deal spirit ceo ted christie said he was disappointed in dropping the merger with frontier the spirit board of directors will continue our ongoing discussions with jetblue as we pursue the best path forward for spirit and our stockholders he said in a statement the frontier offer was worth more than 2 6 billion in cash and stock far short of jetblue s all cash bid of 3 7 billion a combination of spirit with either frontier or jetblue would create the nation s fifth largest airline although it would be still quite a bit smaller than american united delta and southwest related man sues american airlines after mistaken identity lands him in jail for 17 days attention now will turn toward regulatory hurdles to a deal between spirit and jetblue spirit s board stood by the frontier deal for months in the face of a higher priced offer from jetblue by arguing that antitrust regulators would never let jetblue buy the nation s biggest budget airline and remove it as a competitor to higher priced carriers not surprisingly jetblue disagreed with that view the biden administration was always likely to take a close look at either deal the president and his top antitrust official in the justice department have both indicated a dislike for corporate mergers some analysts said that the small size of frontier and spirit would have earned them a pass from antitrust regulators in previous administrations but not any more still a jetblue deal does appear more problematic in part because the justice department is already suing to break up a regional partnership in the northeast between jetblue and american airlines frontier and spirit announced their deal on feb 7 saying they would create a huge discount airline that would save consumers 1 billion a year in airfares by creating a powerful new competitor to american united delta and southwest the proposal would have brought together two very similar airlines both tempt travelers with rock bottom fares but tack on fees for some things that bigger carriers include with most tickets from soft drinks to room for a bag in the overhead bin jetblue is a more conventional airline that some travelers prefer because of its amenities including free tv and internet access during flights in that sense spirit seems an odd fit flight information for a spirit airlines flight is displayed on the information board at the miami international airport on july 27 2022 in miami florida photo by joe raedle getty images expand once spirit was in play for a merger however jetblue ceo robin hayes decided that he could not sit back and watch two budget carriers combine and leapfrog his airline in size on april 5 jetblue started a bidding war by announcing its own plan to take over spirit jetblue saw acquiring spirit as the best way to quickly add planes and pilots and break out of the second tier of u s airlines related flight attendant bluntly shares travel tips we will not help you if you are mean jetblue argued that it would help consumers too by driving down fares more effectively than frontier and spirit new york based jetblue mounted a furious campaign to convince spirit shareholders to reject the frontier offer and the tide seemed to turn in its favor spirit s board postponed votes on the frontier deal four time and this month frontier ceo barry biffle admitted his side was losing badly both frontier and jetblue raised their bids in recent weeks including and increasing break up fees for spirit shareholders at the end frontier offered 4 13 in cash plus 1 9126 shares of its stock for each share of spirit that was worth about 2 65 billion at frontier s closing price on tuesday and spirit shareholders would have owned 48 5 of the combined company jetblue s bid was more straightforward 33 50 per share plus a ticking fee to cover any delay in regulatory review which would push the value of the offer to 3 7 billion all in cash jetblue investors seem unimpressed with the airline s pursuit of spirit from the time jetblue entered the bidding through tuesday its shares fell 45 more than other u s airline except regional carrier mesa once spirit s fate is settled analysts believe that more mergers are possible among the smaller airlines but not likely any deals involving american united delta or southwest because of antitrust issues jetblue and alaska airlines fought a bidding war over virgin america in 2016 which seattle based alaska won alaska s strength on the west coast and jetblue s network on the east coast and the caribbean have long made them the subject of merger speculation
pinned the federal reserve raised interest rates by three quarters of a percentage point on wednesday continuing its aggressive campaign to cool rapid inflation even as the economy begins to slow central bankers voted unanimously to make the unusually large interest rate move and the policy setting federal open market committee signaled in its post meeting statement that more is coming saying that it anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate the fed s policy rate which trickles out through the economy to affect other borrowing costs is now set to a range of 2 25 to 2 5 percent the fed began raising interest rates from near zero in march and policymakers have picked up the pace since after making a quarter point move to start they raised by half a point in may and by three quarters of a point in june which was the largest single step since 1994 fed officials made a second supersize increase on wednesday because they are trying urgently to wrestle rapid inflation back under control here are the takeaways from wednesday s decision and fed chair jerome h powell s post meeting news conference another big rate move could be coming in september mr powell was clear that a third unusually large three quarter point rate increase is possible at the fed s next meeting but he was clear that we have a long time between now and then and officials will be watching each new piece of data as they make decisions mr powell does not think the u s is in a recession he highlighted evidence that the economy is slowing but said it was not yet clear by how much mr powell also pointed to the strength of the labor market as a reason he does not think the economy is currently in a downturn and he cautioned that fresh data on economic growth set for release on thursday should be taken with a grain of salt a downturn is not inevitable mr powell said that he thinks a slowdown isn t assured though he highlighted that it may be difficult to lower inflation without one and noted that the path toward avoiding such a downturn has narrowed but we need growth to slow mr powell said some slowing of the economy is good from the fed s perspective mr powell emphasized while cooling off economic activity enough to lower inflation will probably involve weakening the labor market a little bit of pain is necessary now to put the economy on a more sustainable path we don t want this to be bigger than it needs to be mr powell said but when thinking about the medium and long term price stability is what makes the whole economy work mr powell s comments were precisely what stock investors wanted to hear investors have worried about the fed tipping the american economy into recession so wall street on wednesday honed in on signals that the fed could slow its pace of interest rate increases in the future and that mr powell is aware of early signs of a slowdown in the economy the s p 500 stock index ended the day up 2 6 percent and the nasdaq composite posted its best day since april 2020 markets can quickly change their tune though especially with new data on growth coming out thursday the last two times the fed raised rates the s p 500 rallied on the day of the announcement but fell sharply the day after

that we believe will be helpful the presentation can be accessed on our investor relations website and if you have not downloaded a copy yet i encourage you to do so i m going to start today by providing an overview of the major highlights of the quarter and then i ll turn the call over to marcy to provide more details on our financials i m very pleased with our performance this quarter we had good contribution from the entire team across our footprint resulting in accelerated loan growth significant expansion in our net interest margin and further improvement in asset quality in addition to successfully executing on the great western core system conversion all of this resulted in a substantial increase in our profitability as we generated 0 92 in earnings per share excluding acquisition related expenses and some other items we are starting to see the benefits of our increased scale following the merger particularly given our strong revenue growth as our adjusted efficiency ratio improved to 50 8 from 62 2 from the prior quarter underlying our strong performance our healthy economic conditions throughout our markets which contributed to 6 4 annualized loan growth excluding ppp loans in the second quarter our loan production was 30 higher than the prior period with growth accelerating as the quarter progressed ending with 10 annualized growth in the month of june our well balanced production resulted in increases in most of the major portfolios headed into the third quarter we are capitalizing on this momentum and we have a strong pipeline going into the second half of the year we are particularly pleased with the higher level of growth we are seeing in the legacy first interstate footprint with every market contributing positively including wyoming which as you know was a headwind last year overall the legacy first interstate branch network had an annualized loan growth rate of 15 in the second quarter with montana idaho eastern washington markets leading the charge as always we are maintaining discipline in our pricing and as a result our new production reflected the impact of higher interest rates the average rate on new loan production in the second quarter was 25 basis points higher than it was in the first quarter as we discussed last quarter we intended to deploy more of our excess liquidity into higher yielding assets earning assets both in loans and the investment portfolio this allowed us to benefit from higher interest rates resulting in a 45 basis points increase in our net interest margin more importantly our core net interest margin expanded 36 basis points to 3 01 we saw a significant increase in our yield on earning assets while keeping our core our cost of funds flat with the prior quarter while deposits declined a little bit more than we originally anticipated in the quarter we were encouraged by the stickiness of our noninterest bearing and our interest bearing demand deposits and the performance of the legacy fib footprint overall during the quarter a large portion of the attrition was discretionary on our part as we chose not to retain expensive non relationship acquired balances additionally we are taking a proactive and strategic approach to product and pricing in this environment to drive incremental client growth from here with our strong financial performance and capital position we were able to increase our return of capital to our shareholders during the second quarter with the resumption of our share repurchase activity during the second quarter we repurchased 1 7 million shares of our common stock at a weighted average price of 37 38 and paid a dividend yielding 4 6 on an annualized basis and with that i will turn the call over to marcy to provide some additional details on the second quarter results go ahead marcy marcy mutch chief financial officer thanks kevin and good morning everyone as i walk through our financial results unless otherwise noted all of the prior period comparisons will be with the first quarter of 2022 of course a significant portion of the variance will be the full quarter impact from the great western merger so as i move through my review i will just focus on any other notable items and i ll start with the income statement our net interest income increased by 59 9 million as we saw improved yields along with an increase in average earning assets our reported net interest margin increased 45 basis points from the prior quarter to 3 25 excluding purchase accounting accretion and ppp related income our adjusted net interest margin increased 36 basis points to 3 01 from the prior quarter driven by a favorable shift in our mix and increased yields on our earning assets while our cost of funds was unchanged at 10 basis points with the continued redeployment of our excess liquidity on an average basis loans increased to 58 1 of earning assets in the second quarter up from 55 6 in the prior quarter looking ahead we believe we re well positioned to see a continued expansion in our net interest margin due to a number of factors we anticipate a continuation of the positive earning asset mix changes into the third quarter investment security purchases continue to be accretive to current book yield new loan production is coming on the books at higher rates and is currently at or above roll off yields and variable and adjustable rate loans and securities will continue to benefit from the recent fed rate increases all of this will more than offset some anticipated increases to funding costs we re beginning to raise our deposit pricing as we head into the third quarter as we believe based on what we re seeing in our local markets this can provide us a competitive advantage to attract new clients as a result you should expect to see a higher cost of deposits into the next quarter that said we still expect to see a relatively low deposit beta over this cycle and that the increase in our yield on earning assets should exceed any increases to our funding costs in the coming quarters our noninterest income increased 1 8 million quarter over quarter to 51 million we saw continued strong results from our payment services businesses as well as the full quarter impact of adding great western s wealth management business adding great western s wealth business allowed us to offset the negative impact to total assets under management from the market pullback excluding the 3 4 million recovery of mortgage servicing rights impairment we had last quarter our mortgage banking revenues were flat going forward we expect them to remain relatively stable as we head into the back half of the year as the increased production volumes we should see from our new markets will help us offset the lower overall demand resulting from higher mortgage rates when compared with last quarter s outlook given the incremental interest rate and market driven headwinds on mortgage wealth management and swap fee income we have made a slight reduction to the run rate for noninterest income that we expect by the fourth quarter of 2022 adjusting the run rate to be approximately 50 million down from the prior range of 52 million to 54 million moving to total noninterest expense exclusive of acquisition related expenses our noninterest expense increased 22 5 million from the prior quarter which was primarily attributable to the additional one month of great western s operations and consistent with what we told you to expect last quarter with the completion of the core system conversion in late may we will now start to realize more of the cost savings projected for the transaction by the fourth quarter of 2022 we still expect our quarterly run rate for total operating expenses to be approximately 160 million moving to the balance sheet our loans held for investment increased 262 million excluding ppp loans from the end of the prior quarter with growth in all of our major portfolios with the exception of ag as of june 30th we had approximately 12 1 million in ppp loans remaining on our balance sheet net of 300 000 of remaining associated deferred loan fees our investment portfolio increased by approximately 1 4 billion from the end of the prior quarter as we continue to take advantage of higher rates we also terminated a 5 million forward starting excuse me 500 million forward starting pay fixed swap on june 1st this resulted in a 23 3 million gain that will be accreted into income through may 2026 at the end of the quarter the duration of the investment portfolio was 3 9 years or 3 8 years when you include the impact of our remaining 200 million interest rate hedge on the liability side our total deposits decreased 1 2 billion which primarily came from outflows in our savings and jumbo cd balances a meaningful portion of the decline was attributable to the intentional runoff of higher cost non relationship deposits carried over from great western within our legacy footprint we saw a decline of 1 7 but remain in line with our year to date expectations given the unseasonal growth we saw in that deposit base in the first quarter given our strong liquidity position headed into this quarter we funded the runoff out of our cash balances in aggregate our balances of noninterest bearing and interest bearing demand deposits were just about flat during the quarter which reflects the stability that we typically see in our core deposit base moving to asset quality we saw positive trends across the portfolio with declines in nonperforming assets and criticized and classified loans the decline in criticized loans was largely driven by our continued progress in working through the problem loans added in the great western acquisition the strong performance of our loan portfolio is also reflected in the very low level of net charge offs which were just 300 000 or one basis point of average loans in the quarter given the positive trends and the low level of loss in the portfolio we recorded a negative provision of 1 7 million for the quarter a bias toward a more negative economic outlook was offset by the positive trends in our portfolio relative to last quarter the allowance declined 26 8 million as part of our reevaluation of the acquired loan portfolio there was a release of 24 8 million of specific reserves on certain pcd loans which was booked as an adjustment to the acquired balance sheet and resulted in a net reduction to goodwill this brought our allowance as a percentage of loans held for investment to 1 28 while our coverage of nonperforming loans remain relatively unchanged at 201 as further noted on slide 4 of the investor presentation in addition to the pcd loans i just mentioned we also adjusted the initial credit marks on our acquired held for sale portfolio on a combined basis the after tax impact of these adjustments resulted in a decrease to goodwill of 37 8 million and had a corresponding increase to regulatory and tangible capital and with that i ll turn the call back over to kevin kevin riley president and chief executive officer thanks marcy i ll wrap up with a few comments on our outlook our markets remain resilient and we have not yet seen higher rates or inflationary pressures having a material impact on economic activity loan demand or asset quality loan production remained strong and we see many catalysts for continuing our positive trend in loan growth as i mentioned earlier our legacy first interstate markets are performing very well and we are seeing better than expected trends already from the acquired footprint and we continue to work with our colleagues who joined us from great western to accelerate business development efforts in our new markets this includes omaha and lincoln area where we have put new leadership in place in colorado and arizona where we believe we can more effectively capitalize on the strong economic activity in these markets additionally as rates move higher it is likely that we will see a decline in payoffs which are less than one of the headwinds to loan growth given these catalysts and the trends we are seeing we are optimistic that we can achieve the mid single digit annualized loan growth over the second half of the year which is an improvement from our outlook a quarter ago while our growth outlook has improved it should be noted that through our proactive management practices we continue to resolve acquired credit challenges well inside of our initial loss assumptions we told you on the onset of the acquisition that the credit marks were capital that belong to the shareholders we take that responsibility seriously and we are very proud that we ve been able to recoup some of those marks for the benefit of all constituents as marcy mentioned we expect to continue seeing expansion in our net interest margin and with the core system conversion now behind us we will see some of the more synergies that we projected from the great western merger the combination of continued loan growth margin expansion the realization of more cost savings from the merger should lead to continued improvement in our levels of profitability and finally even after this quarter s repurchase activity we continue to run capital levels in excess of our internal targets while our markets continue to perform well we are mindful of the broader macroeconomic concerns and the potential recessionary environment given the strength of our franchise we believe we are well positioned to perform well in whatever type of economic environment materializes in the future i want to end my prepared remarks to reiterate how proud we are of the entire team for what has been a very successful conversion at the end of may we have noted the similarities of our two organizations from the onset and now that we are a one organization we are experiencing the synergies of our cultures coming together as one the result of our recent published gallup poll survey are a positive sign we are heading in the right direction lastly as part of the 21 million donation to our foundation related to this acquisition we have agreed to donate 1 million across our footprint through our believe in local grant campaign this has encouraged our colleagues from across the footprint in support of local employee sponsored not for profits in all 14 states i could not be happier with the support for this effort we are truly moving together as one cohesive company so with that we ll open the call up for comments questions answers operator thank you kevin and our first question is from the line of jared shaw of wells fargo your line is now open if you d like to proceed jared shaw wells fargo securities analyst hey good morning thank you kevin riley president and chief executive officer good morning jared jared shaw wells fargo securities analyst hey everybody maybe just starting on the credit side and the provision how much of the provision reverse or i guess was most of that provision reversal great western and just the better performance there and how should we be thinking about the allowance ratio here at call it 129 ex ppp and then migrating toward that day one level with the combined bank marcy mutch chief financial officer so jared the provision reversal of 1 7 million was really reflective of the credit quality of the entire portfolio that was slightly offset by kind of a negative bias so higher qualitative factor for macroeconomic factors in terms of going back to day one again we were around 120 as of cecl day one we re at 128 now and as we continue to see credit improvement which we expect to do it will be slightly offset by probably a more negative bias toward a negative economic outlook so it s hard to say it s only eight basis points how quickly we ll go back to the day one i would expect it to stay kind of stable from here it was not any big shift one way or another unless we see something turning in the economic conditions more negatively than we are today kevin riley president and chief executive officer yeah i think i ll just add a little bit jared to that i think the thing is that we believe asset quality will continue to improve right now in the short run even though the macroeconomic factors might get a little bit worse they might we re looking at they could offset each other improvement in asset quality macroeconomics so they all offset so we think our allowance should be pretty much stable from this point until something dramatic drastically changes marcy mutch chief financial officer yep jared shaw wells fargo securities analyst ok and then in terms of like the remaining loans that you re trying to resolve from great western any change in sort of the pace of that either the appetite for sales or helping to work that out or how should we be thinking about that continued resolution kevin riley president and chief executive officer thing is i think as you look at jared is that we re working through it the pace of getting rid of it is going just the way we expected it s going very well and it s not going to be any kind of wholesale selling of the loans marcy mutch chief financial officer yeah we ll work through the criticized book just in the north course of business and the held for sale will most likely come off by the end of the year jared shaw wells fargo securities analyst ok thanks and then on the funding side you ve been able to keep data extremely low which is great as we go forward here how should we be thinking about what you ll do to defend deposits at this level in terms of beta and how does the deposit mix look with the potential for dda growth or stability from here kevin riley president and chief executive officer yeah i think that these as last rate cycle we were pretty aggressive with our deposit pricing because we could afford it because we re very asset sensitive and so we re not going to see the beta that we saw last time which it was about 27 we are going to increase some of our pricing in the deposit area to give our employees a product to be able to defend our position within the market and also i think it s we have the ability to take market share due to the fact that some other banks are unwilling or unable to increase deposit costs so we re going to do some deposit price raising in specific areas to defend and possibly grow market share but it will not be at the beta that we saw in the past rate hikes and it s not going to eat into our earnings projections of the future either jared shaw wells fargo securities analyst ok great and then just finally for me any update on are you still seeing similar trends in terms of migration into the markets from some of the coastal areas or has that started to slow down at all kevin riley president and chief executive officer no it s continuing and it s pretty robust so it s like we said in my remarks economic activity is strong pretty much throughout our footprint and we have not seen that kind of come down much yet jared shaw wells fargo securities analyst great thanks operator and our next question is from the line of jeff rulis of d a davidson jeff your line is now open if you d like to continue with your question unknown speaker thanks good morning kevin riley president and chief executive officer good morning jeff unknown speaker this is actually andrew on for jeff rulis i just had a question on specifically relating to deal conversion and the closing of the deal now that we re through both of those just wondering how net personnel flow has gone are you guys seeing departures or new additions kevin riley president and chief executive officer can you clarify that question again unknown speaker now that we re through the closing and conversion of gwb just wondering about just personnel employee flow are you guys seeing additions to your team or departures kevin riley president and chief executive officer well the thing is you re talking about unexpected departures and employees of great western is that what you re talking about in that area unknown speaker right kevin riley president and chief executive officer but no quite frankly we i mean it s typical in a bank you re going to lose a banker here and there we re not seeing anything outside of normal swapping of some people back and forth from other banks so no we do not see any major departure of employees that we really wanted to stay on unknown speaker ok thank you and second question just wondering gain on sale expectation for 2023 for mortgage marcy mutch chief financial officer i think that s a little bit too early for us to comment on that at this point i think we ve talked about before we have a digital product that we intend to roll out across the great western footprint so we re hoping to see some increased volume from that product but at this point i m not going to speak to 2023 expectations unknown speaker ok thank you next question loan growth in june was at 10 and now with guiding to mid single digits was the growth in june due to demand getting pulled forward in anticipation of higher rates in the future kevin riley president and chief executive officer no i think it just was the growth in when we say mid single digits i think we re going to have a good third quarter and i think the fourth quarter will be normally seasonally like we ve seen in the past where growth will be a little harder in the fourth quarter due to the fact that and stuff like that so you have that headwind so that s why we re saying mid single digits we re hoping that one quarter will be better than the other but that s why we re targeting mid single digits marcy mutch chief financial officer yes that s into the second half of the year so just to be clear unknown speaker got it thank you and last question from me just wondering about buyback appetite going forward with the tce ratio at 6 6 and the cet1 ratio down linked quarter kevin riley president and chief executive officer well i think the thing is we have we still believe we have excess capital to do share repurchases and the board authorized 5 million and we bought back 1 7 million and we will continue to look at our position with regards to buyback as we move forward unknown speaker ok thank you congrats on the quarter kevin riley president and chief executive officer thank you marcy mutch chief financial officer thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of andrew terrell of stephens andrew your line will be open now if you would like to proceed with your question andrew terrell of stephens your line is open now andrew terrell stephens inc analyst can you hear me kevin riley president and chief executive officer now we can hear you go ahead marcy mutch chief financial officer hi andrew andrew terrell stephens inc analyst hey kevin hey marcy sorry about that i wanted to start on the expense side maybe for marcy reiterated the 160 million run rate by 4q i was curious when you announced the deal you expected i think 56 million annually in cost saves how much of that has been realized to date and do you think there s any opportunity still to do better than the 160 million 4q run rate or does kind of some of the inflation maybe continued investments limit that ability kevin riley president and chief executive officer i marcy mutch chief financial officer yeah so we re right in line with where we expected to be andrew we re not anticipating any other changes based on inflation or other investments that we ve seen that are going to take us above that 160 million in the fourth quarter kevin riley president and chief executive officer yes i think the thing is andrew i ll put it another way i think we re seeing a little bit better in some of the expenses than we anticipated but we have inflationary expenses that are creeping in soaring wages are putting pressure on that in some of the other areas so i think where we re seeing increased costs because of inflation is being offset because we re doing better than we anticipated andrew terrell stephens inc analyst yep understood ok and do you have how much of the just total announced cost saves you ve realized like a percentage to date kevin riley president and chief executive officer they re all my finance people are kind of sitting here shaking their head they are let s get back to you on that andrew terrell stephens inc analyst yeah no problem thank you marcy mutch chief financial officer but the most of it andrew will be in the second half of the year so again andrew terrell stephens inc analyst ok yes got it ok wanted to move over to the deposits it looks like the runoff mostly this quarter was from kind of the higher cost or higher beta acquired balances do you anticipate any more of those to kind of move out of the bank in the back half of the year or do some of the actions you re taking on pricing kind of prevent that and then just overall thoughts on what you expect for net deposit growth in the second half kevin riley president and chief executive officer yeah that s a great question i would say that we don t anticipate any of those large amounts to go out that we saw in the second quarter i think our pricing will stem the tide of other maybe outflows but what we re looking at around with deposits is pretty much being flat from here to the remainder of the year andrew terrell stephens inc analyst got it ok and last question just on just the efficiency ratio the revenue trends sound really solid you ve got continued cost savings coming through the benefit from fed interest rates in 3q 4q do you think you can work the efficiency ratio it improved a lot this quarter but do you think you can get it down to like a low 50 type number in the back half kevin riley president and chief executive officer we re hoping yes we re hoping marcy mutch chief financial officer yes we ll go lower than we were this quarter yes we should continue to come down andrew terrell stephens inc analyst ok i appreciate you taking my questions i ll step back kevin riley president and chief executive officer alright thank you marcy mutch chief financial officer thank you andrew operator thank you and our next question is from the line of matthew clark of piper sandler matthew your line is now open matthew clark piper sandler analyst hey good morning kevin riley president and chief executive officer morning matt matthew clark piper sandler analyst yeah that was a good question there by andrew and one of mine that i was going to ask it does seem like if there s still a fair amount of cost saves left to be realized by the end of the year your run rate should come down even if you assume some annual growth in comp but we can follow up on that shifting to the core nim the core margin do you happen to know that the average core margin was in the month of june just trying to get a sense for whether or not we might see core nim expansion that might be larger than what we saw here in 2q marcy mutch chief financial officer so matt we don t normally give out that information and so i think i m just going to leave it at that again we continue to have 26 of our loans that are going to reprice immediately part of our investment portfolio even if we do a little bit of have a little bit higher cost of funds we should see core net interest margin expansion next quarter kevin riley president and chief executive officer we just we re not just going to try to tell you what the number might be but it will expand matthew clark piper sandler analyst no i hear you 36 might be a stretch basis points yes now the and then did you happen to i guess i m trying to hone in on kind of the deposit cost increases that we might see i know you mentioned that the beta is going to be lower this cycle no reason for it not to given your loan to deposit ratio but any comments on kind of the spot rate on deposits coming out of the quarter or kind of rates on promotion on some promotional offerings you might be using right now marcy mutch chief financial officer so that s go ahead kevin riley president and chief executive officer well first of all i feel those who haven t heard the promotional rates that were going to be offered so it will be a little bit premature to start talking about it on our earnings call but the rates are going to come up i mean we re not we re trying to look at the market we re trying to be protecting it you have credit unions out there you have other online banks that are out there offering and our customers we re making a lot of money want a return on their money so we re just going to be kind of very strategic surgical and trying to price the deposits in areas where we believe that we have to give our customers that return but again it s we re going to be very cautious we re not going to try to go to hog wild with regard to pricing but i think if we have to our customers want increases and i think we have to proactively move in that direction matthew clark piper sandler analyst ok thank you operator thank you and our next question is from the line of chris mcgratty of kbw chris your line is now open please proceed chris mcgratty keefe bruyette and woods analyst great thanks kevin or marcy the i m interested in the remixing comment on the balance sheet in your prepared remarks you took cash down quite a bit in the quarter so i guess two part question what s the what do you think is the reasonable amount of cash that you need to run and then also maybe monthly or quarterly cash flows off the bond book and presumably if you re guiding to flat deposits there ll be some remix going forward thanks kevin riley president and chief executive officer yes so the cash flow coming off of the investment portfolio is about 300 million a quarter with regard to holding cash balances we re going to try to hold cash balances of i would say below 500 million and in regards to deposits flat what was your part of the question marcy mutch chief financial officer just on an average basis the loans will come up quarter over quarter kevin riley president and chief executive officer yes marcy mutch chief financial officer and we expect to continue to see loan growth that we can fund with some of that security portfolio runoff chris mcgratty keefe bruyette and woods analyst got it ok great and we ve seen some of your peers given what the futures market is pricing for cuts reduce take steps to reduce some of the asset sensitivity or lock it in i m interested in any thoughts there about just strategies or swaps you might be doing to kind of lock in if we do get a cut in the next 18 months kevin riley president and chief executive officer yeah that and chris that leads into why we did we got rid of the 500 million swap the that s why we got rid of that to start changing the balance sheet a little bit to protect from a down rate environment so that was one that actually took and we re looking at other actions we do have another 200 million swap out there so we are looking at taking but we don t want to do it all in one interest rate cycle just like we didn t want to invest the whole investment portfolio in one interest rate cycle we re trying to be cautious of how we do that but i hear what you re saying and we are looking at that operator we have no further questions being registered at this time so it s my pleasure to hand back to kevin riley for any closing remarks kevin riley president and chief executive officer thank you for your questions and as always we welcome calls from our investors and analysts please reach out to us if you have any follow up questions and thanks for tuning in to the call today goodbye operator duration 0 minutes call participants lisa slyter bray executive assistant kevin riley president and chief executive officer marcy mutch chief financial officer jared shaw wells

washington ap higher mortgage rates have sent home sales tumbling credit card rates have grown more burdensome and so have auto loans savers are finally receiving yields that are actually visible while crypto assets are reeling the federal reserve s move wednesday to further tighten credit raised its benchmark interest rate by a sizable 0 75 percentage point for a second straight time the fed s latest hike its fourth since march will further magnify borrowing costs for homes cars and credit cards though many borrowers may not feel the impact immediately the central bank is aggressively raising borrowing costs to try to slow spending cool the economy and defeat the worst outbreak of inflation in two generations the fed s actions have ended for now an era of ultra low rates that arose from the 2008 2009 great recession to help rescue the economy and then re emerged during the brutal pandemic recession when the fed slashed its benchmark rate back to near zero chair jerome powell hopes that by making borrowing more expensive the fed will succeed in slowing demand for homes cars and other goods and services reduced spending could then help bring inflation most recently measured at a four decade high of 9 1 back to the fed s 2 target yet the risks are high a series of higher rates could tip the u s economy into recession that would mean higher unemployment rising layoffs and further downward pressure on stock prices how will it all affect your finances here are some of the most common questions being asked about the impact of the rate hike i m considering buying a house what s happening with mortgage rates higher interest rates have torpedoed the housing market rates on home loans have nearly doubled from a year ago to 5 5 though they ve leveled off in recent weeks even as the fed has signaled that more credit tightening is likely that s because mortgage rates don t necessarily move in tandem with the fed s increases sometimes they even move in the opposite direction long term mortgages tend to track the yield on the 10 year treasury note which in turn is influenced by a variety of factors these factors include investors expectations for future inflation and global demand for u s treasurys investors expect a recession to hit the u s economy later this year or early next year this would force the fed to eventually cut its benchmark rate in response the expectation that the fed will have to reverse some of its hikes next year has helped reduce the 10 year yield from 3 5 in mid june to roughly 2 8 will it be easier to find a house sales of existing homes have dropped for five straight months while new home sales plunged in june if you re financially able to go ahead with a home purchase you re likely to have more choices than you did a few months ago in many cities the options are few but the number of available houses nationwide has started to rise after falling to rock bottom levels at the end of last year there are now 1 26 million homes for sale according to the national association of realtors up 2 4 from a year ago i need a new car should i buy one now the fed s rate hikes typically make auto loans more expensive but other factors also affect these rates including competition among car makers which can sometimes lower borrowing costs rates for buyers with lower credit ratings are most likely to rise as a result of the fed s hikes because used vehicle prices on average are rising monthly payments will rise too what will happen to my credit card for users of credit cards home equity lines of credit and other variable interest debt rates would rise by roughly the same amount as the fed hike usually within one or two billing cycles that s because those rates are based in part on banks prime rate which moves in tandem with the fed those who don t qualify for low rate credit cards might be stuck paying higher interest on their balances the rates on their cards would rise as the prime rate does the fed s rate increases have already sent credit card borrowing rates above 20 for the first time in at least four years according to lendingtree which has tracked the data since 2018 how will this affect my savings you can now earn more on bonds cds and other fixed income investments and it depends on where your savings if you have any are parked savings certificates of deposit and money market accounts don t typically track the fed s changes instead banks tend to capitalize on a higher rate environment to try to boost their profits they do so by imposing higher rates on borrowers without necessarily offering any juicer rates to savers but online banks and others with high yield savings accounts are often an exception these accounts are known for aggressively competing for depositors the only catch is that they typically require significant deposits how have the rate hikes influenced crypto like many highly valued technology stocks cryptocurrencies like bitcoin have sunk in value since the fed began raising rates bitcoin has plunged from a peak at about 68 000 to 21 000 higher rates mean that safe assets like bonds and treasuries become more attractive to investors because their yields are now higher that in turn makes risky assets like technology stocks and cryptocurrencies less attractive all that said bitcoin is suffering from its own problems that are separate from economic policy two major crypto firms have failed the shaken confidence of crypto investors is not being helped by the fact that the safest place you can park money now bonds seems like a safer move will my student loan payment go up right now payments on federal student loans are suspended until aug 31 as part of an emergency measure that was put in place early in the pandemic inflation means that loan holders have less disposable income to make payments still a slowed economy that reduces inflation could bring some relief by fall depending on the state of the economy the government may choose at the end of summer to extend the emergency measure that s deferring the loan payments president joe biden is also considering some form of loan forgiveness borrowers who take out new private student loans should prepare to pay more rates vary by lender but are expected to increase ____ associated press journalists ken sweet adriana morga and cora lewis contributed to this report morga and lewis

spirit airlines and frontier airlines agreed wednesday to abandon their merger proposal opening the doors for jetblue to acquire spirit washington spirit airlines and frontier airlines agreed wednesday to abandon their merger proposal opening the way for jetblue airways to acquire spirit spirit the largest budget carrier in the united states said it was still in discussions with jetblue and expects to provide a further update in the near future the decision by spirit and frontier to terminate their deal was announced while spirit shareholders were still voting on the proposal it was apparent that despite the support of spirit s board shareholders were prepared to reject the frontier deal the frontier offer was worth more than 2 6 billion in cash and stock far short of jetblue s all cash bid of 3 7 billion a combination of spirit with either frontier or jetblue would create the nation s fifth largest airline although it would be still quite a bit smaller than american united delta and southwest competing with jetblue s richer cash offer the spirit board and frontier argue that antitrust regulators will block jetblue from buying spirit making the jetblue bid an illusory one jetblue of course disagrees the biden administration was always likely to take a close look at either deal the president and his top antitrust official in the justice department have both indicated a dislike for corporate mergers some analysts said that the small size of frontier and spirit would have earned them a pass from antitrust regulators in previous administrations but not any more still the jetblue deal did appear more problematic in part because the justice department was already suing to break up a regional partnership in the northeast between jetblue and american airlines frontier and spirit announced their deal on feb 7 saying they would create a huge discount airline that would save consumers 1 billion a year in airfares by creating a powerful new competitor to american united delta and southwest the proposal would have brought together two very similar airlines both tempt travelers with rock bottom fares but tack on fees for some things that bigger carriers include with most tickets from soft drinks to room for a bag in the overhead bin they even share financial roots bill franke s indigo partners private equity firm invested in spirit before taking an 82 stake in frontier and investing in budget carriers in mexico chile and hungary frontier and spirit said that together they would have enough planes to fly many new routes that aren t yet served by a discount airline and they would create 10 000 new jobs by 2026 in the process a merger would also address one of the biggest complaints consumers have about frontier and spirit they are so small with such limited schedules that when they cancel a flight it can take days to find seats for all the passengers on later flights jetblue ceo robin hayes decided that he could not sit back and watch frontier and spirit become bigger than his airline on april 5 jetblue started a bidding war by announcing its own plan to take over spirit jetblue figured that buying spirit was the best way it could quickly add planes and pilots and break out of the second tier of u s airlines jetblue argued that it would help consumers too by driving down fares more effectively than frontier and spirit new york based jetblue mounted a furious campaign to convince spirit shareholders to reject the frontier offer it worked forcing spirit s board to postpone a vote on the frontier proposal four times in july frontier ceo barry biffle admitted his side was losing badly both frontier and jetblue raised their bids including and increasing break up fees for spirit shareholders at the end frontier offered 4 13 in cash plus 1 9126 shares of its stock for each share of spirit that was worth about 2 65 billion at frontier s closing price on tuesday and spirit shareholders would own 48 5 of the combined company jetblue s bid was more straightforward 33 50 per share plus a ticking fee to cover any delay in regulatory review which would push the value of the offer to 3 7 billion all in cash jetblue investors seem unimpressed with the airline s pursuit of spirit since jetblue entered the bidding its shares have fallen 45 more than other u s airline except regional carrier mesa once spirit s fate is settled analysts believe that more mergers are possible among the smaller airlines but not likely any deals involving american united delta or southwest because of antitrust issues

google s revenue growth during the past quarter decelerated to its slowest pace in two years as advertisers reined in their spending amid intensifying fears of an economic recession the regression reported tuesday by google s corporate parent alphabet is the latest sign that the tailwinds propelling big technology companies during the pandemic have shifted the array of new challenges facing the industry has already caused the tech driven nasdaq composite index to plummet by 26 so far this year in alphabet s case revenue during the april june period totaled 69 7 billion a 13 increase from the same time last year that would be impressive growth for most companies outside of tech but it marked alphabet s lowest growth rate since the the april june quarter of 2020 when the company suffered the first and so far only year over year revenue decline in its history the cause advertisers retreated while most consumers were being corralled at home during the pandemic s early stages the more sluggish spending was especially evident at youtube where major advertisers have increasingly gravitated to promote their brands with short commercials youtube s ad revenue rose by 5 from the previous year during the second quarter the lowest rate of year over year quarterly growth since alphabet began to disclose the video site s financial results in late 2019 ruth porat alphabet s chief financial officer attributed some of youtube s meager growth to truly extraordinary ad spending at the same time last year as vaccines emboldened more consumers to begin returning to their pre pandemic lifestyles and spending patterns despite the slowdown alphabet remains extremely profitable the mountain view california company earned 16 billion or 1 21 per share during the second quarter although even that was a 14 decrease from last year as usual most of that money poured in from google s dominant search engine and a wide range of other popular services including its maps gmail chrome browser youtube video site and android software for smartphones even though both the revenue and earnings came in slightly below analyst estimates the numbers apparently weren t as bad as investors feared alphabet s slumping stock price gained more than 5 in extended trading after the numbers were released the rally gained momentum after alphabet ceo sundar pichai and other top executives assured analysts during a late tuesday conference call that the company intended to be more judicious about its spending in the months ahead a commitment likely to bolster profits even if revenue growth continues to falter personally i find moments like this clarifying pichai explained during the call it gives us a chance to look at everything we do through a critical lens the second quarter results reflect greater caution among digital advertisers are remaining cautious as the federal reserve contemplates more aggressive action meaning higher interest rates to bring down the highest inflation in more than 40 years a mission that threatens to drag the economy into a recession the next rate increase is expected wednesday we use the term uncertainty because that is the best way to characterize what we are seeing porat said during a conference call with analysts late tuesday she also acknowledged google has been affected by pullbacks among an unspecified number of advertisers the tightening in ad budgets has repercussions beyond google it squeezed the social platform snap so severely that its earnings plunged below management warnings of poor business results creating such a cloudy outlook that its executives refused to make predictions for the current quarter facebook s corporate parent meta also has been bracing for tougher times ahead meta ceo mark zuckerberg is expected to elaborate on his take on the current state of digital advertising wednesday when the company is scheduled to release its second quarter results besides the current economic certain both snap and facebook have been hurt by privacy protections that apple imposed last year to prevent social media services and a wide variety of other apps from tracking people s interests and locations on iphones to help sell ads without users permission that safeguard hasn t affected google as much because its search engine can learn so much about people from their queries although the company is better positioned than most to navigate the economic turbulence that appears to be looming ahead it s clear google has its work cut out for it in the back half of the year said insider intelligence analyst evelyn mitchell google already began girding for potential recession by recently announcing plans to slow hiring and then went even further by imposing a two week freeze on extending job offers to candidates but before that pause alphabet beefed up its payroll significantly during the quarter it added more than 10 000 employees from the end of march through june up from increase of roughly 7 400 workers during the first thee months of the year the company ended the quarter with about 174 000 employees worldwide porat told analysts the downturn in google s hiring probably won t start showing up in its quarterly numbers until next year partly because of the job offers already in the pipeline and the expectation that it will complete its 5 4 billion acquisition of cybersecurity

advisors the statement is slightly dovish and is bolstering the tech led stock rally that started this morning some wall street analysts were less optimistic that the fed may opt for more moderate rate increases from here especially because inflation has accelerated to 9 1 the fastest annual pace in 41 years advertisement charlie ripley senior investment strategist at allianz investment management called the increase warranted that being said recent economic data is now introducing a higher degree of uncertainty around the path of policy as we move forward from here ripley said in a note wednesday analysts at citi said that although powell mentioned that a slowdown in rate increases would be appropriate at some point exactly when that might be remains undetermined they said they would not view this as a particularly dovish comment advertisement we continue to expect core inflation to push the fed to hike more aggressively than they or markets anticipate the analysts wrote

forefront of investors minds however markets were spooked monday after retail giant walmart warned that its earnings are being hurt by rising prices for food and gas which are forcing shoppers to cut back on more profitable discretionary items such as clothing the retailer s profit warning in the middle of the quarter was rare and raised worries about how the highest inflation in 40 years is affecting the entire retail sector advertisement meanwhile some parts of the economy particularly the housing industry are already slowing because the fed has raised rates sales of previously occupied

state commissions in montana south dakota and nebraska and the federal energy ferc regulatory commission currently our utility businesses are held in the same legal entity under the proposed restructuring plan we would legally separate our montana public utility business from our south dakota and nebraska public utility business and establish a holding company to hold the ownership interests of all of the subsidiaries the purpose of the reorganization is to integrate our organizational structure to be more transparent and in line with the public utility industry the

decision granting our waiver requests from crep compliance in 2015 and 2016 the expense associated with this penalty has been accrued for within our second quarter 2022 results we intend to file an appeal with the montana supreme court supply chain and inflation challenges we place significant reliance on our third party business partners to supply materials equipment and labor necessary for us to operate our utility and reliably serve current customers and future customers as a result of current macroeconomic conditions both nationally and globally we have recently experienced issues with our supply chain for materials and components used in our operations and capital project construction activities issues include higher prices scarcities shortages longer fulfillment times for orders from our suppliers workforce availability and wage increases should these conditions continue we could have difficulty completing the operations activities necessary to serve our customers safely and reliably and or achieving our capital investment program which ultimately could result in higher customer utility rates longer outages and could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and operations during the third quarter of 2021 we decided to discontinue our plans to build a 30 40 mw electric generation plant near aberdeen south dakota as a result of significant increases in estimated construction cost as a result of global supply chain challenges also as we developed our forecast of capital expenditures we estimate that these supply chain and inflation challenges increased our forecasted 2022 capital spend by approximately 2 percent further challenges with product and services availability and price inflation could increase this impact on our capital spend forecasts or could cause us to experience delays fire mitigation with changing weather conditions which include more significant wind events drought conditions and warmer air temperatures we do not consider the fire season specific to a time of year but rather a condition that may exist at any time of year each year s weather conditions impact these situations differently early season rains encourage plant growth which fuels fires later in the growing season and winters with little snow leave dry plant material available for late season fires the threat is not only in forested areas where insect infestations and resulting tree death has been severe but across the entire system including rural areas where grassland fires could be ignited along with urban areas where extreme weather conditions pose a great risk to heavily populated areas recognizing the risk of significant wildfires in montana we continue to proactively seek to mitigate wildfire risk we have developed an enhanced fire mitigation plan addressing five key areas situational awareness operational practices system preparedness vegetation management and public communications and outreach this plan builds upon several key initiatives that were initiated and executed over the past decade including nearly 80 million spent on vegetation management and hazard tree removal programs and our growing annual investment to harden our transmission and distribution system infrastructure because of ever increasing wildfire risk our plan includes greater focus on situational awareness to monitor changing environmental conditions operational practices that are more reactive to changing conditions increased frequency of patrol and repairs and more robust system hardening programs that target higher risk segments in our transmission and distribution systems we expect to include a request for expected costs associated with the mitigation plan in our 2022 montana electric rate review

associated with contracts covered by the public utility regulatory policies act of 1978 purpa as part of a 2002 stipulation with the mpsc and other parties reflects a 5 1 million gain in 2022 as compared with a 9 2 million gain for the same period in 2021 due to the combination of a 1 8 million favorable reduction in costs for the current contract year to record the annual adjustment for actual output and pricing as compared with a 2 6 million favorable reduction in costs in the prior period a favorable adjustment decreasing the qf liability by 3 3 million reflecting annual actual contract price escalation for the 2023 2024 contract year which was less than previously estimated partly offset by an increase in estimated contract prices for the 2023 2024 contract year which is the last year of the contract that contains variable pricing terms this is compared to an unfavorable adjustment of 2 1 million in the prior year due to higher actual price escalation and a favorable

in accordance with gaap as well as other financial measures such as utility margin adjusted non gaap pretax income adjusted non gaap net income and adjusted non gaap diluted eps that are considered non gaap financial measures generally a non gaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a company s financial performance financial position or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are included in or excluded from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap we define utility margin as operating revenues less fuel purchased supply and direct transmission expense exclusive of depreciation and depletion as presented in our condensed consolidated statements of income this measure differs from the gaap definition of gross margin due to the exclusion of operating and maintenance property and other taxes and depreciation and depletion expenses which are presented separately in our condensed consolidated statements of income a reconciliation of utility margin to gross margin the most directly comparable gaap measure is included above management believes that utility margin provides a useful measure for investors and other financial statement users to analyze our financial performance in that it excludes the effect on total revenues caused by volatility in energy costs and associated regulatory mechanisms this information is intended to enhance an investor s overall understanding of results under our various state regulatory mechanisms our supply costs are generally collected from customers in addition utility margin is used by us to determine whether we are collecting the appropriate amount of energy costs from customers to allow recovery of operating costs as well as to analyze how changes in loads due to weather economic or other conditions rates and other factors impact our results of operations our utility margin measure may not be comparable to that of other companies presentations or more useful than the gaap information provided elsewhere in this report management also believes the presentation of adjusted non gaap pre tax income adjusted non gaap net income and adjusted non gaap diluted eps is more representative of normal earnings than gaap pre tax income net income and eps due to the exclusion or inclusion of certain impacts that are not reflective of ongoing earnings the presentation of these non gaap measures is intended to supplement investors understanding of our financial performance and not to replace other gaap measures as an indicator of actual operating performance our measures may not be comparable to other companies similarly titled measures special note regarding forward looking statements this press release contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 including without limitation the information under significant items not contemplated in

in good faith and believe such statements are based on reasonable assumptions including without limitation management s examination of historical operating trends data contained in records and other data available from third parties we cannot assure you that we will achieve our projections factors that may cause such differences include but are not limited to adverse determinations by regulators

the fed s latest hike its fourth since march will further magnify borrowing costs for homes cars and credit cards example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video washington higher mortgage rates have sent home sales tumbling credit card rates have grown more burdensome and so have auto loans savers are finally receiving yields that are actually visible while crypto assets are reeling the federal reserve s move wednesday to further tighten credit raised its benchmark interest rate by a sizable 0 75 percentage point for a second straight time the fed s latest hike its fourth since march will further magnify borrowing costs for homes cars and credit cards though many borrowers may not feel the impact immediately the central bank is aggressively raising borrowing costs to try to slow spending cool the economy and defeat the worst outbreak of inflation in two generations the fed s actions have ended for now an era of ultra low rates that arose from the 2008 2009 great recession to help rescue the economy and then re emerged during the brutal pandemic recession when the fed slashed its benchmark rate back to near zero chair jerome powell hopes that by making borrowing more expensive the fed will succeed in slowing demand for homes cars and other goods and services reduced spending could then help bring inflation most recently measured at a four decade high of 9 1 back to the fed s 2 target yet the risks are high a series of higher rates could tip the u s economy into recession that would mean higher unemployment rising layoffs and further downward pressure on stock prices how will it all affect your finances here are some of the most common questions being asked about the impact of the rate hike i m considering buying a house what s happening with mortgage rates higher interest rates have torpedoed the housing market rates on home loans have nearly doubled from a year ago to 5 5 though they ve leveled off in recent weeks even as the fed has signaled that more credit tightening is likely that s because mortgage rates don t necessarily move in tandem with the fed s increases sometimes they even move in the opposite direction long term mortgages tend to track the yield on the 10 year treasury note which in turn is influenced by a variety of factors these factors include investors expectations for future inflation and global demand for u s treasurys investors expect a recession to hit the u s economy later this year or early next year this would force the fed to eventually cut its benchmark rate in response the expectation that the fed will have to reverse some of its hikes next year has helped reduce the 10 year yield from 3 5 in mid june to roughly 2 8 will it be easier to find a house sales of existing homes have dropped for five straight months while new home sales plunged in june if you re financially able to go ahead with a home purchase you re likely to have more choices than you did a few months ago in many cities the options are few but the number of available houses nationwide has started to rise after falling to rock bottom levels at the end of last year there are now 1 26 million homes for sale according to the national association of realtors up 2 4 from a year ago i need a new car should i buy one now the fed s rate hikes typically make auto loans more expensive but other factors also affect these rates including competition among car makers which can sometimes lower borrowing costs rates for buyers with lower credit ratings are most likely to rise as a result of the fed s hikes because used vehicle prices on average are rising monthly payments will rise too what will happen to my credit card for users of credit cards home equity lines of credit and other variable interest debt rates would rise by roughly the same amount as the fed hike usually within one or two billing cycles that s because those rates are based in part on banks prime rate which moves in tandem with the fed those who don t qualify for low rate credit cards might be stuck paying higher interest on their balances the rates on their cards would rise as the prime rate does the fed s rate increases have already sent credit card borrowing rates above 20 for the first time in at least four years according to lendingtree which has tracked the data since 2018 how will this affect my savings you can now earn more on bonds cds and other fixed income investments and it depends on where your savings if you have any are parked savings certificates of deposit and money market accounts don t typically track the fed s changes instead banks tend to capitalize on a higher rate environment to try to boost their profits they do so by imposing higher rates on borrowers without necessarily offering any juicer rates to savers but online banks and others with high yield savings accounts are often an exception these accounts are known for aggressively competing for depositors the only catch is that they typically require significant deposits how have the rate hikes influenced crypto like many highly valued technology stocks cryptocurrencies like bitcoin have sunk in value since the fed began raising rates bitcoin has plunged from a peak at about 68 000 to 21 000 higher rates mean that safe assets like bonds and treasuries become more attractive to investors because their yields are now higher that in turn makes risky assets like technology stocks and cryptocurrencies less attractive all that said bitcoin is suffering from its own problems that are separate from economic policy two major crypto firms have failed the shaken confidence of crypto investors is not being helped by the fact that the safest place you can park money now bonds seems like a safer move will my student loan payment go up right now payments on federal student loans are suspended until aug 31 as part of an emergency measure that was put in place early in the pandemic inflation means that loan holders have less disposable income to make payments still a slowed economy that reduces inflation could bring some relief by fall depending on the state of the economy the government may choose at the end of summer to extend the emergency measure that s deferring the loan payments president joe biden is also considering some form of loan forgiveness borrowers who take out new private student loans should prepare to pay more rates vary by lender but are expected to increase

spirit airlines and frontier airlines agreed wednesday to abandon their merger proposal opening the doors for jetblue to acquire spirit washington spirit airlines and frontier airlines agreed wednesday to abandon their merger proposal opening the way for jetblue airways to acquire spirit spirit the largest budget carrier in the united states said it was still in discussions with jetblue and expects to provide a further update in the near future the decision by spirit and frontier to terminate their deal was announced while spirit shareholders were still voting on the proposal it was apparent that despite the support of spirit s board shareholders were prepared to reject the frontier deal the frontier offer was worth more than 2 6 billion in cash and stock far short of jetblue s all cash bid of 3 7 billion a combination of spirit with either frontier or jetblue would create the nation s fifth largest airline although it would be still quite a bit smaller than american united delta and southwest competing with jetblue s richer cash offer the spirit board and frontier argue that antitrust regulators will block jetblue from buying spirit making the jetblue bid an illusory one jetblue of course disagrees the biden administration was always likely to take a close look at either deal the president and his top antitrust official in the justice department have both indicated a dislike for corporate mergers some analysts said that the small size of frontier and spirit would have earned them a pass from antitrust regulators in previous administrations but not any more still the jetblue deal did appear more problematic in part because the justice department was already suing to break up a regional partnership in the northeast between jetblue and american airlines frontier and spirit announced their deal on feb 7 saying they would create a huge discount airline that would save consumers 1 billion a year in airfares by creating a powerful new competitor to american united delta and southwest the proposal would have brought together two very similar airlines both tempt travelers with rock bottom fares but tack on fees for some things that bigger carriers include with most tickets from soft drinks to room for a bag in the overhead bin they even share financial roots bill franke s indigo partners private equity firm invested in spirit before taking an 82 stake in frontier and investing in budget carriers in mexico chile and hungary frontier and spirit said that together they would have enough planes to fly many new routes that aren t yet served by a discount airline and they would create 10 000 new jobs by 2026 in the process a merger would also address one of the biggest complaints consumers have about frontier and spirit they are so small with such limited schedules that when they cancel a flight it can take days to find seats for all the passengers on later flights jetblue ceo robin hayes decided that he could not sit back and watch frontier and spirit become bigger than his airline on april 5 jetblue started a bidding war by announcing its own plan to take over spirit jetblue figured that buying spirit was the best way it could quickly add planes and pilots and break out of the second tier of u s airlines jetblue argued that it would help consumers too by driving down fares more effectively than frontier and spirit new york based jetblue mounted a furious campaign to convince spirit shareholders to reject the frontier offer it worked forcing spirit s board to postpone a vote on the frontier proposal four times in july frontier ceo barry biffle admitted his side was losing badly both frontier and jetblue raised their bids including and increasing break up fees for spirit shareholders at the end frontier offered 4 13 in cash plus 1 9126 shares of its stock for each share of spirit that was worth about 2 65 billion at frontier s closing price on tuesday and spirit shareholders would own 48 5 of the combined company jetblue s bid was more straightforward 33 50 per share plus a ticking fee to cover any delay in regulatory review which would push the value of the offer to 3 7 billion all in cash jetblue investors seem unimpressed with the airline s pursuit of spirit since jetblue entered the bidding its shares have fallen 45 more than other u s airline except regional carrier mesa once spirit s fate is settled analysts believe that more mergers are possible among the smaller airlines but not likely any deals involving american united delta or southwest because of antitrust issues
appleton it appears appleton voters will get a say on whether wisconsin should legalize marijuana for personal use the city s safety and licensing committee on wednesday recommended the city hold an advisory referendum on nov 8 asking the following question should marijuana be legalized for adult use taxed and regulated like alcohol in the state of wisconsin the committee s recommendation will be considered by the common council next wednesday a majority of the 15 member council already has indicated support for the referendum four council members alex schultz nate wolff kristin alfheim and chris croatt backed the referendum in committee and another five council members have co signed a resolution calling for the referendum we re surrounded by states that have legalized marijuana in one form or another schultz told the post crescent people are going out of state constantly to get the stuff and bring it back in why don t we make money on it instead of sending it out to our partners the referendum wouldn t carry the force of law rather according to the resolution it would measure public opinion on allowing adults 21 years of age and older to engage in the personal use of marijuana while also regulating commercial marijuana related activities and imposing a tax on the sale of marijuana council member sheri hartzheim opposed the referendum in committee she said legalizing marijuana is a state thing and the state is behind in acting i believe that if we put pressure personally on our state representatives that can and will make a difference hartzheim said but i don t believe that an advisory referendum in appleton will make a huge difference wolff said despite broad support for legalizing marijuana state legislators haven t acted that is why i m supporting this wolff said i think that we have to continue to tell them that this is something that the people of wisconsin want schultz said appleton s referendum would be part of a broader effort among municipalities to bring the legalization of marijuana to a vote of the people this is about asking the state of wisconsin what they think about legalization and we need to be part of that discussion schultz said i think not being part of this discussion makes us look detached or essentially not involved and i think that would be a shame related appleton s trout museum of art wants to relocate to a new building at ellen kort peace park related appleton library project encounters a second delay pushing the opening into early 2024 city clerk kami lynch said appleton would be responsible for the cost of the referendum which she estimated at 2 250 the exact amount she said wouldn t be known until the ballots are printed and the election programming is finished in december 2018 the appleton council passed a resolution urging the state to legalize medical marijuana the wording of the proposed nov 8 referendum doesn t distinguish between medical and recreational marijuana the appleton resolution calling for the referendum includes the following statements criminalizing marijuana or cannabis use has failed to curb its use and according to a gallup survey conducted in july 2021 49 of americans say they have used marijuana up from 30 in 1985 in a marquette university law school poll conducted in february 61 of wisconsinites said that marijuana should be fully legalized and regulated like alcohol and recent polls show a majority of americans favor legalization of adult recreational use of marijuana thirty seven states including every state surrounding wisconsin have legalized some form of marijuana a study in late 2021 by municipal bond strategists at barclays suggests that by 2030 states that have legalized marijuana and regulate its sale may realize 12 billion per year in tax revenue to help balance their budgets appleton is failing to benefit from marijuana related small business opportunities and sales tax that neighboring states are increasingly capitalizing on marijuana use as an alternative to prescription pain killers has been shown to reduce opioid addiction and 22 of u s military veterans report using medical marijuana to treat post traumatic stress disorder legalization would undercut the illicit market and ensure that marijuana use and sale are regulated and safe the time appleton law enforcement officers spend enforcing existing marijuana laws and ordinances negatively impacts the time they have available to solve more serious crimes and apprehend more dangerous criminals contact duke behnke at 920 993 7176 or dbehnke gannett com follow him on twitter at dukebehnke

the fed s latest hike its fourth since march will further magnify borrowing costs for homes cars and credit cards example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video washington higher mortgage rates have sent home sales tumbling credit card rates have grown more burdensome and so have auto loans savers are finally receiving yields that are actually visible while crypto assets are reeling the federal reserve s move wednesday to further tighten credit raised its benchmark interest rate by a sizable 0 75 percentage point for a second straight time the fed s latest hike its fourth since march will further magnify borrowing costs for homes cars and credit cards though many borrowers may not feel the impact immediately the central bank is aggressively raising borrowing costs to try to slow spending cool the economy and defeat the worst outbreak of inflation in two generations the fed s actions have ended for now an era of ultra low rates that arose from the 2008 2009 great recession to help rescue the economy and then re emerged during the brutal pandemic recession when the fed slashed its benchmark rate back to near zero chair jerome powell hopes that by making borrowing more expensive the fed will succeed in slowing demand for homes cars and other goods and services reduced spending could then help bring inflation most recently measured at a four decade high of 9 1 back to the fed s 2 target yet the risks are high a series of higher rates could tip the u s economy into recession that would mean higher unemployment rising layoffs and further downward pressure on stock prices how will it all affect your finances here are some of the most common questions being asked about the impact of the rate hike i m considering buying a house what s happening with mortgage rates higher interest rates have torpedoed the housing market rates on home loans have nearly doubled from a year ago to 5 5 though they ve leveled off in recent weeks even as the fed has signaled that more credit tightening is likely that s because mortgage rates don t necessarily move in tandem with the fed s increases sometimes they even move in the opposite direction long term mortgages tend to track the yield on the 10 year treasury note which in turn is influenced by a variety of factors these factors include investors expectations for future inflation and global demand for u s treasurys investors expect a recession to hit the u s economy later this year or early next year this would force the fed to eventually cut its benchmark rate in response the expectation that the fed will have to reverse some of its hikes next year has helped reduce the 10 year yield from 3 5 in mid june to roughly 2 8 will it be easier to find a house sales of existing homes have dropped for five straight months while new home sales plunged in june if you re financially able to go ahead with a home purchase you re likely to have more choices than you did a few months ago in many cities the options are few but the number of available houses nationwide has started to rise after falling to rock bottom levels at the end of last year there are now 1 26 million homes for sale according to the national association of realtors up 2 4 from a year ago i need a new car should i buy one now the fed s rate hikes typically make auto loans more expensive but other factors also affect these rates including competition among car makers which can sometimes lower borrowing costs rates for buyers with lower credit ratings are most likely to rise as a result of the fed s hikes because used vehicle prices on average are rising monthly payments will rise too what will happen to my credit card for users of credit cards home equity lines of credit and other variable interest debt rates would rise by roughly the same amount as the fed hike usually within one or two billing cycles that s because those rates are based in part on banks prime rate which moves in tandem with the fed those who don t qualify for low rate credit cards might be stuck paying higher interest on their balances the rates on their cards would rise as the prime rate does the fed s rate increases have already sent credit card borrowing rates above 20 for the first time in at least four years according to lendingtree which has tracked the data since 2018 how will this affect my savings you can now earn more on bonds cds and other fixed income investments and it depends on where your savings if you have any are parked savings certificates of deposit and money market accounts don t typically track the fed s changes instead banks tend to capitalize on a higher rate environment to try to boost their profits they do so by imposing higher rates on borrowers without necessarily offering any juicer rates to savers but online banks and others with high yield savings accounts are often an exception these accounts are known for aggressively competing for depositors the only catch is that they typically require significant deposits how have the rate hikes influenced crypto like many highly valued technology stocks cryptocurrencies like bitcoin have sunk in value since the fed began raising rates bitcoin has plunged from a peak at about 68 000 to 21 000 higher rates mean that safe assets like bonds and treasuries become more attractive to investors because their yields are now higher that in turn makes risky assets like technology stocks and cryptocurrencies less attractive all that said bitcoin is suffering from its own problems that are separate from economic policy two major crypto firms have failed the shaken confidence of crypto investors is not being helped by the fact that the safest place you can park money now bonds seems like a safer move will my student loan payment go up right now payments on federal student loans are suspended until aug 31 as part of an emergency measure that was put in place early in the pandemic inflation means that loan holders have less disposable income to make payments still a slowed economy that reduces inflation could bring some relief by fall

for the period was 29 8 million or 0 54 per diluted share as compared with net income of 37 2 million or 0 72 per diluted share for the same period in 2021 the decrease in net income was primarily due

recorded a reduction in pre tax earnings of 0 8 million and 1 6 million respectively 10 of the variance for the three and six months ended june 30 2021 electric supply costs exceeded the pccam base revenues by approximately 5 2 million and 13 5 million respectively as a result during the three and six months ended june 30 2021 we deferred 4 7 million and 12 2 million respectively of costs for future collection from customers and recorded a reduction in pre tax earnings of 0 5 million and 1 3 million respectively montana fixed cost recovery mechanism fcrm on april 15 2022 we requested that the mpsc continue to defer implementation of the existing fcrm pilot program currently set for july 1 2022 the mpsc granted our request on june 9 2022 including our intention to redesign the decoupling mechanism in our upcoming 2022 montana electric rate review filing holding company filings on june 1 2022 we filed a legal corporate restructuring application restructuring plan with the state commissions in montana south dakota and nebraska and the federal energy ferc regulatory commission currently our utility businesses are held in the same legal entity under the proposed restructuring plan we would legally separate our montana public utility business from our south dakota and nebraska public utility business and establish a holding company to hold the ownership interests of all of the subsidiaries the purpose of the reorganization is to integrate our organizational structure to be more transparent and in line with the public utility industry the restructuring plan does not propose and we do not expect any procedural or substantive change in how the state public utility commissions regulate those services implementation of the restructuring plan is subject to receipt of all regulatory approvals on july 26 2022 the nebraska public service commission approved our restructuring plan application montana community renewable energy projects creps we have been involved in litigation associated with our past progress towards meeting obligations to acquire renewable energy projects as mandated by the recently repealed montana crep requirement although we had been granted waivers by the mpsc and the crep requirement was subsequently repealed by the montana legislature on may 9 2022 the montana district court imposed a 2 5 million penalty against us payable to the universal low income assistance fund in montana in connection with the petition filed by the montana environmental information center challenging the mpsc s decision granting our waiver requests from crep compliance in 2015 and 2016 the expense associated with this penalty has been accrued for within our second quarter 2022 results we intend to file an appeal with the montana supreme court supply chain and inflation challenges we place significant reliance on our third party business partners to supply materials equipment and labor necessary for us to operate our utility and reliably serve current customers and future customers as a result of current macroeconomic conditions both nationally and globally we have recently experienced issues with our supply chain for materials and components used in our operations and capital project construction activities issues include higher prices scarcities shortages longer fulfillment times for orders from our suppliers workforce availability and wage increases should these conditions continue we could have difficulty completing the operations activities necessary to serve our customers safely and reliably and or achieving our capital investment program which ultimately could result in higher customer utility rates longer outages and could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and operations during the third quarter of 2021 we decided to discontinue our plans to build a 30 40 mw electric generation plant near aberdeen south dakota as a result of significant increases in estimated construction cost as a result of global supply chain challenges also as we developed our forecast of capital expenditures we estimate that these supply chain and inflation challenges increased our forecasted 2022 capital spend by approximately 2 percent further challenges with product and services availability and price inflation could increase this impact on our capital spend forecasts or could cause us to experience delays fire mitigation with changing weather conditions which include more significant wind events drought conditions and warmer air temperatures we do not consider the fire season specific to a time of year but rather a condition that may exist at any time of year each year s weather conditions impact these situations differently early season rains encourage plant growth which fuels fires later in the growing season and winters with little snow leave dry plant material available for late season fires the threat is not only in forested areas where insect infestations and resulting tree death has been severe but across the entire system including rural areas where grassland fires could be ignited along with urban areas where extreme weather conditions pose a great risk to heavily populated areas recognizing the risk of significant wildfires in montana we continue to proactively seek to mitigate wildfire risk we have developed an enhanced fire mitigation plan addressing five key areas situational awareness operational practices system preparedness vegetation management and public communications and outreach this plan builds upon several key initiatives that were initiated and executed over the past decade including nearly 80 million spent on vegetation management and hazard tree removal programs and our growing annual investment to harden our transmission and distribution system infrastructure because of ever increasing wildfire risk our plan includes greater focus on situational awareness to monitor changing environmental conditions operational practices that are more reactive to changing conditions increased frequency of patrol and repairs and more robust system hardening programs that target higher risk segments in our transmission and distribution systems we expect to include a request for expected costs associated with the mitigation plan in our 2022 montana electric rate review

higher natural gas retail volumes were driven by colder spring weather in all jurisdictions and customer growth the less favorable adjustment to our electric qf liability unrecoverable costs associated with contracts covered by the public utility regulatory policies act of 1978 purpa as part of a 2002 stipulation with the mpsc and other parties reflects a 5 1 million gain in 2022 as compared with a 9 2 million gain for the same period in 2021 due to the combination of a 1 8 million favorable reduction in costs for the current contract year to record the annual adjustment for actual output and pricing as compared with a 2 6 million favorable reduction in costs in the prior period a favorable adjustment decreasing the qf liability by 3 3 million reflecting annual actual contract price escalation for the 2023 2024 contract year which was less than previously estimated partly offset by an increase in estimated contract prices for the 2023 2024 contract year which is the last year of the contract that contains variable pricing terms this is compared to an unfavorable adjustment of 2 1 million in the prior year due to higher actual price escalation and a favorable

consolidated interest expense for the three months ended june 30 2022 was 24 0 million as compared with 23 5 million in the same period in 2021 this increase was primarily due to higher interest on

in accordance with gaap as well as other financial measures such as utility margin adjusted non gaap pretax income adjusted non gaap net income and adjusted non gaap diluted eps that are considered non gaap financial measures generally a non gaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a company s financial performance financial position or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are included in or excluded from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap we define utility margin as operating revenues less fuel purchased supply and direct transmission expense exclusive of depreciation and depletion as presented in our condensed consolidated statements of income this measure differs from the gaap definition of gross margin due to the exclusion of operating and maintenance property and other taxes and depreciation and depletion expenses which are presented separately in our condensed consolidated statements of income a reconciliation of utility margin to gross margin the most directly comparable gaap measure is included above management believes that utility margin provides a useful measure for investors and other financial statement users to analyze our financial performance in that it excludes the effect on total revenues caused by volatility in energy costs and associated regulatory mechanisms this information is intended to enhance an investor s overall understanding of results under our various state regulatory mechanisms our supply costs are generally collected from customers in addition utility margin is used by us to determine whether we are collecting the appropriate amount of energy costs from customers to allow recovery of operating costs as well as to analyze how changes in loads due to weather economic or other conditions rates and other factors impact our results of operations our utility margin measure may not be comparable to that of other companies presentations or more useful than the gaap information provided elsewhere in this report management also believes the presentation of adjusted non gaap pre tax income adjusted non gaap net income and adjusted non gaap diluted eps is more representative of normal earnings than gaap pre tax income net income and eps due to the exclusion or inclusion of certain impacts that are not reflective of ongoing earnings the presentation of these non gaap measures is intended to supplement investors understanding of our financial performance and not to replace other gaap measures as an indicator of actual operating performance our measures may not be comparable to other companies similarly titled measures special note regarding forward looking statements this press release contains forward looking statements

washington the federal reserve said on wednesday it would not flinch in its battle against the most intense breakout of inflation in the united states since the 1980s even if that means a sustained period of economic weakness and a slowing jobs market as he explained the logic behind the stiffest interest rate increases in roughly four decades fed chair jerome powell was peppered with questions about whether the u s economy was in or on the cusp of a recession a notion he rejected because u s firms continue to hire in excess of 350 000 additional workers each month advertisement i do not think the u s is currently in a recession he told reporters after the end of the u s central bank s latest policy meeting citing an unemployment rate that is still near a half century low and solid wage growth and job gains it doesn t make sense that the u s would be in recession but the 75 basis point rate increase announced by the fed on wednesday coupled with earlier actions in march may and june has now jacked the central bank s overnight interest rate from near zero to a level between 2 25 percent and 2 50 percent that is the fastest tightening of monetary policy since former fed chair paul volcker battled double digit inflation in the 1980s the cure then involved back to back recessions consumer prices haven t yet breached the 10 percent annual mark this time but at 9 1 percent they are close enough to raise the stakes for both the fed and the biden administration which is particularly sensitive on the issue ahead of congressional elections in november while powell said he did not think a recession would be needed to fix the problem this time he acknowledged that the economy was slowing and would likely need to slow more for the fed to bring the pace of price increases back to earth we do want to see demand running below potential for a sustained period to create slack in the economy powell said in a news conference we re trying to do just the right amount we re not trying to have a recession but he was adamant that the behavior of inflation would drive the fed s course and that another unusually large rate increase could be appropriate when the fed next meets if inflation does not begin to slow advertisement powell and many of his fed colleagues have been caught out this year making policy commitments based on data particularly on inflation that has surprised them in negative ways and forced them to adjust on the fly the fed chief offered little specific guidance about what to expect next a fact that puts a heavy focus on two months of upcoming data the fed s usual six week interlude between policy meetings is eight weeks this time providing what powell called quite a lot of data to digest including july and august inflation readings that will either show evidence of slowing price increases or not restoring price stability is just something we have got to do powell said there isn t an option to fail when measured by the fed s preferred gauge inflation is running at more than three times the central bank s 2 percent target fed officials are acutely aware of the hardship that inflation imposes on american households particularly for those with limited means powell said and they will not relent in their effort until presented with compelling evidence that inflation is coming down while jobs gains have remained robust officials noted in the new policy statement that recent indicators of spending and production have softened a nod to the fact that the aggressive rate hikes they have put in place since march are beginning to bite data dependent new data due to be released on friday will show to what extent growth slowed in the second quarter powell said some of the impact of fed rate increases to date is still building in the economy and depending on how inflation responds in coming months that could allow the central bank to begin to slow the pace of rate increases the policy rate is now at the level most fed officials feel has a neutral economic impact in effect marking the end of pandemic era efforts to encourage household and business spending with cheap money the rate also matches the high point of the central bank s previous tightening cycle from late 2015 to late 2018 a level reached this time in the span of just four months investors expect the fed to raise its policy rate by at least half a percentage point at its sept 20 21 meeting while another unusually large increase could be appropriate at our next meeting that is a decision that will depend on the data we get between now and then powell said we will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting and communicate our thinking as clearly as possible futures markets tied to fed policy expectations tilted somewhat back toward a more moderate increase for the next meeting as powell spoke on wednesday in the u s treasury market which plays a key role in the transmission of fed policy decisions into the real economy yields on the 2 year note moved lower the yield on the 10 year note was little changed stocks on wall street added to broad gains in the session with the s p 500 index closing 2 6 percent higher while the dollar

from here it is possible that the fed slows its tightening pace reassured by the likely peaking of inflation and pullback in inflation expectations as oil prices have fallen seema shah chief global strategist at principal global investors said in a note however with the labor market still a picture of strength wage growth still uncomfortably high and core inflation set to decline at a glacially slow pace the fed certainly cannot stop tightening nor can it down shift gears too much

loans held for sale increased 171 1 million or 16 6 to 1 20 billion this growth was the product of strong origination volumes combined with intentionally holding loans available for sale for longer periods of time before sale as discussed in more detail below average loans and leases were 6 93 billion during the second quarter of 2022 compared to 6 72 billion during the first quarter of 2022 excluding paycheck protection program ppp loans the total loan and lease portfolio increased by 362 5 million or 5 5 compared to march 31 2022 and 1 42 billion or 25 4 compared to june 30 2021 the

million during the second quarter of 2022 an increase of 94 6 million or 10 9 from the first quarter of 2022 excluding ppp loans loan and lease originations decreased 154 3 million or 13 9 from the second quarter of 2021 deposits total deposits increased to 8 16 billion at june 30 2022 an increase of 518 6 million compared to march 31 2022 and an increase of 1 63 billion compared to june 30 2021 the increase in total deposits from the prior periods provides support for the growth in the loan and lease portfolio average total interest bearing deposits for the second quarter of 2022 increased 453 5 million or 6 3 to 7 70 billion compared to 7 25 billion for the first quarter of 2022 the ratio of average total loans and leases to average interest bearing deposits was 89 9 for the second quarter of 2022 compared to 92 8 for the first quarter of 2022 borrowings borrowings totaled 86 2 million at june 30 2022 compared to 196 9 million and 1 01 billion at march 31 2022 and june 30 2021 respectively during the second quarter of 2022 the company decreased borrowings by 110 7 million and 926 2 million as compared to march 31 2022 and june 30 2021 respectively primarily by reducing the outstanding balance in the federal reserve s paycheck protection program liquidity facility to 48 2 million as of june 30 2022 net interest income net interest income for the second quarter of 2022 increased to 79 9 million compared to 77 8 million for the first quarter of 2022 and 71 5 million for the second quarter of 2021 the net interest margin for the second and first quarters of 2022 was 3 89 and 4 02 respectively a decrease of thirteen basis points quarter over quarter this decrease was due to heightened average liquidity levels combined with recent interest rate increases where deposits are repricing more rapidly than the company s loan portfolio during the second quarter of 2022 the average cost of interest bearing liabilities increased by eighteen basis points while the average yield on interest earning assets increased by four basis points the increase in net interest income for the second quarter of 2022 compared to the second quarter of 2021 was driven by growth in both average yield and volume for the total loan and lease portfolio outpacing moderate growth in interest bearing liabilities combined with an increase in average cost of funds the benefit of rising rates on the company s cash and loan portfolio was mitigated by the increase in the average cost of funds from 0 86 for the second quarter of 2021 to 0 99 for the second quarter of 2022 noninterest income noninterest income for the second quarter of 2022 increased to 128 5 million compared to 32 7 million for the first quarter of 2022 and 70 1 million for the second quarter of 2021 the primary drivers in noninterest income changes are outlined below the largest driver of the increase in noninterest income for the second quarter of 2022 arose from equity method investments income of 119 1 million principally comprised of the 120 5 million gain associated with fiserv inc s acquisition of the company s ownership in finxact in comparison the second quarter of 2021 had a 44 1 million gain related to the company s investment in greenlight financial technologies which partially offset the overall increase over the prior year the loan servicing asset revaluation resulted in a loss of 8 7 million for the second quarter of 2022 compared to 1 6 million for the first quarter of 2022 and 3 2 million for the second quarter of 2021 the increase in the loss on loan servicing asset revaluation for both periods was principally the result of negative market pricing influenced by heightened interest rates and broader movements in market conditions net gains on sales of loans decreased by 15 3 million compared to the first quarter of 2022 and 10 6 million compared to the second quarter of 2021 this decrease was a product of heightened sales in the first quarter of 2022 in advance of expected market premium changes combined with the second quarter of 2022 emergence of the negative market conditions discussed above the average net gain on sale premium was 108 109 and 112 for the second quarter of 2022 first quarter of 2022 and second quarter of 2021 respectively based primarily upon these market conditions the company decreased the volume of guaranteed loans sold to 68 8 million for the second quarter of 2022 compared to 219 7 million sold in the first quarter of 2022 and 130 9 million sold in the second quarter of 2021 the net loss on loans accounted for under the fair value option totaled 4 5 million for the second quarter of 2022 a 5 0 million decrease compared to the 516 thousand net gain for the first quarter of 2022 and a 5 6 million decrease compared to the 1 1 million net gain for the second quarter of 2021 the decrease in valuation of loans accounted for under the fair value option compared to both prior periods was largely the result of negative market pricing influences discussed above noninterest expense noninterest expense for the second quarter of 2022 totaled 80 9 million compared to 65 7 million for the first quarter of 2022 and 57 6 million for the second quarter of 2021 the primary drivers in noninterest expense changes are outlined below salaries and employee benefits for the second quarter of 2022 increased 7 8 million compared to the first quarter of 2022 and increased 13 4 million compared to the second quarter of 2021 the increase in salaries and employee benefits compared to both prior periods was principally related to continued investment in human resources to support strategic and growth initiatives the second quarter of 2022 included an additional 7 5 million bonus accrual related to the earlier discussed finxact gain largely comprising the increase over the first quarter of 2022 contributions and donations for the second quarter of 2022 increased 4 8 million compared to both the first quarter of 2022 and second quarter of 2021 this increase was related to a special charitable donation during the second quarter of 2022 of 5 0 million made in connection with the finxact gain discussed earlier asset quality during the second quarter of 2022 the company recognized net charge offs for loans carried at historical cost of 2 5 million compared to net charge offs of 2 4 million in both the first quarter of 2022 and second quarter of 2021 net charge offs as a percentage of average held for investment loans and leases carried at historical cost annualized for the quarters ended june 30 2022 march 31 2022 and june 30 2021 was 0 19 0 19 and 0 21 respectively unguaranteed nonperforming nonaccrual loans and leases excluding 3 6 million and 4 5 million accounted for under the fair value option at june 30 2022 and march 31 2022 respectively decreased to 12 0 million or 0 22 of loans and leases held for investment which are carried at historical cost at june 30 2022 compared to 19 5 million or 0 38 at march 31 2022 provision for loan and lease credit losses the provision for loan and lease credit losses for the second quarter of 2022 totaled 5 3 million compared to 1 8 million for the first quarter of 2022 and 7 8 million for the second quarter of 2021 the level of provision expense in the second quarter of 2022 was primarily the result of charge off experience from one relationship the allowance for credit losses on loans and leases totaled 65 9 million at june 30 2022 compared to 63 1 million at march 31 2022 the allowance for credit losses on loans and leases as a percentage of total loans and leases held for investment carried at historical cost was 1 24 and 1 23 at june 30 2022 and march 31 2022 respectively income tax income tax expense and related effective tax rate was 25 3 million and 20 7 for the second quarter of 2022 8 4 million and 19 6 for the first quarter of 2022 and 12 6 million and 16 5 for the second quarter of 2021 respectively the higher level of income tax expense for the second quarter of 2022 compared to the first quarter of 2022 and second quarter of 2021 was primarily from the increased pretax income resulting from the finxact gain the higher effective tax rate in 2022 compared to 2021 is principally due to lower levels of expected renewable energy tax credits in 2022 combined with tax benefits arising from the vesting of stock unit awards which vested in 2021 shareholders equity total shareholders equity increased by 78 3 million or 11 0 during the second quarter of 2022 this increase was primarily due to 97 0 million in net income partially offset by 22 8 million of negative market impacts on the company s available for sale investment portfolio included in accumulated other

the fed s latest hike its fourth since march will further magnify borrowing costs for homes cars and credit cards example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video washington higher mortgage rates have sent home sales tumbling credit card rates have grown more burdensome and so have auto loans savers are finally receiving yields that are actually visible while crypto assets are reeling the federal reserve s move wednesday to further tighten credit raised its benchmark interest rate by a sizable 0 75 percentage point for a second straight time the fed s latest hike its fourth since march will further magnify borrowing costs for homes cars and credit cards though many borrowers may not feel the impact immediately the central bank is aggressively raising borrowing costs to try to slow spending cool the economy and defeat the worst outbreak of inflation in two generations the fed s actions have ended for now an era of ultra low rates that arose from the 2008 2009 great recession to help rescue the economy and then re emerged during the brutal pandemic recession when the fed slashed its benchmark rate back to near zero chair jerome powell hopes that by making borrowing more expensive the fed will succeed in slowing demand for homes cars and other goods and services reduced spending could then help bring inflation most recently measured at a four decade high of 9 1 back to the fed s 2 target yet the risks are high a series of higher rates could tip the u s economy into recession that would mean higher unemployment rising layoffs and further downward pressure on stock prices how will it all affect your finances here are some of the most common questions being asked about the impact of the rate hike i m considering buying a house what s happening with mortgage rates higher interest rates have torpedoed the housing market rates on home loans have nearly doubled from a year ago to 5 5 though they ve leveled off in recent weeks even as the fed has signaled that more credit tightening is likely that s because mortgage rates don t necessarily move in tandem with the fed s increases sometimes they even move in the opposite direction long term mortgages tend to track the yield on the 10 year treasury note which in turn is influenced by a variety of factors these factors include investors expectations for future inflation and global demand for u s treasurys investors expect a recession to hit the u s economy later this year or early next year this would force the fed to eventually cut its benchmark rate in response the expectation that the fed will have to reverse some of its hikes next year has helped reduce the 10 year yield from 3 5 in mid june to roughly 2 8 will it be easier to find a house sales of existing homes have dropped for five straight months while new home sales plunged in june if you re financially able to go ahead with a home purchase you re likely to have more choices than you did a few months ago in many cities the options are few but the number of available houses nationwide has started to rise after falling to rock bottom levels at the end of last year there are now 1 26 million homes for sale according to the national association of realtors up 2 4 from a year ago i need a new car should i buy one now the fed s rate hikes typically make auto loans more expensive but other factors also affect these rates including competition among car makers which can sometimes lower borrowing costs rates for buyers with lower credit ratings are most likely to rise as a result of the fed s hikes because used vehicle prices on average are rising monthly payments will rise too what will happen to my credit card for users of credit cards home equity lines of credit and other variable interest debt rates would rise by roughly the same amount as the fed hike usually within one or two billing cycles that s because those rates are based in part on banks prime rate which moves in tandem with the fed those who don t qualify for low rate credit cards might be stuck paying higher interest on their balances the rates on their cards would rise as the prime rate does the fed s rate increases have already sent credit card borrowing rates above 20 for the first time in at least four years according to lendingtree which has tracked the data since 2018 how will this affect my savings you can now earn more on bonds cds and other fixed income investments and it depends on where your savings if you have any are parked savings certificates of deposit and money market accounts don t typically track the fed s changes instead banks tend to capitalize on a higher rate environment to try to boost their profits they do so by imposing higher rates on borrowers without necessarily offering any juicer rates to savers but online banks and others with high yield savings accounts are often an exception these accounts are known for aggressively competing for depositors the only catch is that they typically require significant deposits how have the rate hikes influenced crypto like many highly valued technology stocks cryptocurrencies like bitcoin have sunk in value since the fed began raising rates bitcoin has plunged from a peak at about 68 000 to 21 000 higher rates mean that safe assets like bonds and treasuries become more attractive to investors because their yields are now higher that in turn makes risky assets like technology stocks and cryptocurrencies less attractive all that said bitcoin is suffering from its own problems that are separate from economic policy two major crypto firms have failed the shaken confidence of crypto investors is not being helped by the fact that the safest place you can park money now bonds seems like a safer move will my student loan payment go up right now payments on federal student loans are suspended until aug 31 as part of an emergency measure that was put in place early in the pandemic inflation means that loan holders have less disposable income to make payments still a slowed economy that reduces inflation could bring some relief by fall depending on the state of the economy the government may choose at the end of summer to extend the emergency measure that s deferring the loan payments president joe biden is also considering some form of loan forgiveness borrowers who take out new private student loans should prepare to pay more rates vary by lender but are expected to increase
washington the us federal reserve fed yesterday july 27 again raised the benchmark interest rate by three quarters of a percentage point in its ongoing battle to tamp down raging price pressures that are squeezing american families it was the second straight 75 basis point increase and the fourth rate increase this year as us central bankers move aggressively to cool the strongest surge in inflation in more than four decades without derailing the world s largest economy while the fed noted signs that the us economy is slowing it signalled plans to continue to increase borrowing costs â and fed chair jerome powell made it clear an even bigger rate hike is possible â inflation is much too high â powell told reporters saying the fed will keep raising rates until there is solid evidence that inflation is moving back towards the 2 goal another â unusually large increase could be appropriateâ at the next meeting in september powell said stressing that us central bankers â wouldnâ t hesitate to make a larger move than we did todayâ if justified president joe biden is facing political backlash for surging prices which he has mainly blamed on the russian invasion of ukraine that sent global food and energy prices soaring in a vote that was unanimous â unlike the decision made in june â the fed s policy setting federal open market committee fomc raised its benchmark lending rate to a range of 2 25 to 2 5 after starting the year near zero economists say this has been the most aggressive fed tightening cycle since the 1980s when stagflation â a wage price spiral and stagnant growth â crippled the us economy but the fed chief acknowledged that at some point policymakers will be able to slow the pace of rate increases wall street seemed cheered by powellâ s comments with solid gains in all three major stock indices including the blue chip dow which ended with an increase of more than 430 points the challenge for policymakers is to quell inflation before it becomes dangerously entrenched and without sending the worldâ s largest economy into a recession that would reverberate around the globe powell has made it clear they are willing to risk a downturn but yesterday he expressed confidence that the us can avoid that fate and the fed can engineer a â soft landingâ taming inflation without causing a recession â weâ re trying to do just the right amount weâ re not trying to have a recession and we donâ t think we have to â powell said the fed chair nevertheless acknowledged that the path to thread that needle â has narrowed â with government data on second quarter gross domestic product due out today there is intense focus on whether another negative reading will mean the economy is in recession the economy contracted 1 6 in the january march period and though the consensus forecast calls for modest growth in the latest three months many economists expect a downturn two consecutive quarters of negative growth are generally considered a sign the economy is in recession although that is not the official criterion but powell said he does not think the country is currently in a recession because â there are too many areas of the economy that are performing too wellâ while â itâ s necessary to have growth slow down we think that thereâ s a path for us to be able to bring inflation down while sustaining a strong labor marketâ us prices have continued to rise and he lamented the hardships faced by families whose paycheques donâ t stretch as far at the grocery store but the pace seems to be slowing and petrol prices at the pump have fallen more than 70 cents from the record of just over us 5 a gallon in mid june meanwhile rising mortgage rates have slowed housing sales for five straight months and the fomc statement noted that â recent indicators of spending and production have softenedâ policymakers seemed to acknowledge that some factors are beyond their control â russiaâ s war against ukraine is causing tremendous human and economic hardship the war and related events are creating additional upward pressure on inflation and are weighing on global economic activity â the fomc statement said nancy vanden houten of oxford economics still expects another three quarter point rate increase at the next policy meeting but after that she says â we look for the fed to downshift to a slower pace of 25bp rate hikes â other economists are now calling for a smaller half point increase the fed will see two more key monthly data releases by then on employment and consumer prices â afp

governor mills mayor william doyle of saco mayor alan casavant of biddeford the town manager of scarborough thomas hall as well as many other elected officials and community leaders were able to talk with a number of maine water s passionate water professionals who live and work in the biddeford saco community the center replaces the original biddeford water treatment plant first constructed in 1884 when chester arthur was president and before biddeford had access to electricity it was located entirely in the 100 year flood plain of the saco river making it vulnerable to service interruptions from catastrophic flooding the original plant served the community for 138 years and the saco river drinking water resource center is designed to provide another century of reliable

the fed s latest hike its fourth since march will further magnify borrowing costs for homes cars and credit cards example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video washington higher mortgage rates have sent home sales tumbling credit card rates have grown more burdensome and so have auto loans savers are finally receiving yields that are actually visible while crypto assets are reeling the federal reserve s move wednesday to further tighten credit raised its benchmark interest rate by a sizable 0 75 percentage point for a second straight time the fed s latest hike its fourth since march will further magnify borrowing costs for homes cars and credit cards though many borrowers may not feel the impact immediately the central bank is aggressively raising borrowing costs to try to slow spending cool the economy and defeat the worst outbreak of inflation in two generations the fed s actions have ended for now an era of ultra low rates that arose from the 2008 2009 great recession to help rescue the economy and then re emerged during the brutal pandemic recession when the fed slashed its benchmark rate back to near zero chair jerome powell hopes that by making borrowing more expensive the fed will succeed in slowing demand for homes cars and other goods and services reduced spending could then help bring inflation most recently measured at a four decade high of 9 1 back to the fed s 2 target yet the risks are high a series of higher rates could tip the u s economy into recession that would mean higher unemployment rising layoffs and further downward pressure on stock prices how will it all affect your finances here are some of the most common questions being asked about the impact of the rate hike i m considering buying a house what s happening with mortgage rates higher interest rates have torpedoed the housing market rates on home loans have nearly doubled from a year ago to 5 5 though they ve leveled off in recent weeks even as the fed has signaled that more credit tightening is likely that s because mortgage rates don t necessarily move in tandem with the fed s increases sometimes they even move in the opposite direction long term mortgages tend to track the yield on the 10 year treasury note which in turn is influenced by a variety of factors these factors include investors expectations for future inflation and global demand for u s treasurys investors expect a recession to hit the u s economy later this year or early next year this would force the fed to eventually cut its benchmark rate in response the expectation that the fed will have to reverse some of its hikes next year has helped reduce the 10 year yield from 3 5 in mid june to roughly 2 8 will it be easier to find a house sales of existing homes have dropped for five straight months while new home sales plunged in june if you re financially able to go ahead with a home purchase you re likely to have more choices than you did a few months ago in many cities the options are few but the number of available houses nationwide has started to rise after falling to rock bottom levels at the end of last year there are now 1 26 million homes for sale according to the national association of realtors up 2 4 from a year ago i need a new car should i buy one now the fed s rate hikes typically make auto loans more expensive but other factors also affect these rates including competition among car makers which can sometimes lower borrowing costs rates for buyers with lower credit ratings are most likely to rise as a result of the fed s hikes because used vehicle prices on average are rising monthly payments will rise too what will happen to my credit card for users of credit cards home equity lines of credit and other variable interest debt rates would rise by roughly the same amount as the fed hike usually within one or two billing cycles that s because those rates are based in part on banks prime rate which moves in tandem with the fed those who don t qualify for low rate credit cards might be stuck paying higher interest on their balances the rates on their cards would rise as the prime rate does the fed s rate increases have already sent credit card borrowing rates above 20 for the first time in at least four years according to lendingtree which has tracked the data since 2018 how will this affect my savings you can now earn more on bonds cds and other fixed income investments and it depends on where your savings if you have any are parked savings certificates of deposit and money market accounts don t typically track the fed s changes instead banks tend to capitalize on a higher rate environment to try to boost their profits they do so by imposing higher rates on borrowers without necessarily offering any juicer rates to savers but online banks and others with high yield savings accounts are often an exception these accounts are known for aggressively competing for depositors the only catch is that they typically require significant deposits how have the rate hikes influenced crypto like many highly valued technology stocks cryptocurrencies like bitcoin have sunk in value since the fed began raising rates bitcoin has plunged from a peak at about 68 000 to 21 000 higher rates mean that safe assets like bonds and treasuries become more attractive to investors because their yields are now higher that in turn makes risky assets like technology stocks and cryptocurrencies less attractive all that said bitcoin is suffering from its own problems that are separate from economic policy two major crypto firms have failed the shaken confidence of crypto investors is not being helped by the fact that the safest place you can park money now bonds seems like a safer move will my student loan payment go up right now payments on federal student loans are suspended until aug 31 as part of an emergency measure that was put in place early in the pandemic inflation means that loan holders have less disposable income to make payments still a slowed economy that reduces inflation could bring some relief by fall
