earnings of 1 162 000 or 0 38 per share for the first quarter of 2021 the change in first quarter s net loss as compared to the same quarter last year was driven primarily from an increase in unrealized equity losses prompted by increased treasury yields and widening of corporate bond rate spreads book value per share decreased to 21 16 at march 31 2022 from 22 69 at december 31 2021 as a

ceded to reinsurers 2 290 000 of earned premiums compared to 2 472 000 of earned premiums for the first quarter of 2021 the slight decrease in the premium cessions reflects lower ceding rates by about

business net premiums earned grew by 3 968 000 or 32 9 to 16 017 000 for the three months ended march 31 2022 from 12 049 000 for the same period in 2021 the increase in net premiums earned is consistent with prior year s increased premium writings coupled with less earned premium ceded to reinsurers net loss totaled 160 000 or 0 05 per share for the first quarter of 2022 compared to net earnings of 1 162 000 or 0 38 per share for the first quarter of 2021 the change in first quarter s net loss as compared to the same quarter last year was driven primarily from an increase in unrealized equity losses prompted by increased treasury yields and widening of corporate bond rate spreads book value per share decreased to 21 16 at march 31 2022 from 22 69 at december 31 2021 as a result of both the current quarter s net loss and a significant decrease in comprehensive income driven by a large decline in our fixed security portfolio for the first quarter of 2022 the company ceded to reinsurers 2 290 000 of earned premiums compared to 2 472 000 of earned premiums for the first quarter of 2021 the slight decrease in the premium cessions reflects lower ceding rates by about 4 5 offset in part by increased direct premiums net investment income increased by 116 000 or 14 5 to 917 000 for the first quarter of 2022 as compared to 801 000 for the same period in 2021 our bond

other operating expenses increased by 1 304 000 or 29 2 to 5 772 000 for the first quarter of 2022 from 4 468 000 for the same period in 2021 direct commissions a key component of policy acquisition costs increased 31 5 compared to a 28 6 increase in written premiums and reflect a necessary cost of organic growth these commissions are expensed as premiums are earned and therefore the increase in

houston business wire magnolia oil gas corporation magnolia we our or the company nyse mgy today announced its financial and operational results for the first quarter of 2022 first quarter 2022 highlights in millions except per share data for the quarter ended march 31 2022 for the quarter ended march 31 2021 net income 208 6 91 5 diluted weighted average total shares outstanding 1 227 4 249

quarter 2022 highlights magnolia reported first quarter 2022 net income attributable to class a common stock of 166 0 million or 0 90 per diluted share first quarter 2022 total net income increased 128 to 208 6 million and diluted weighted average total shares outstanding decreased by 9 to 227 4 million 1 compared to first quarter 2021 adjusted ebitdax was 298 4 million during the first quarter of 2022 driven by strong production growth and significantly higher product prices as compared to prior year results total drilling and completions d c capital during the first quarter was 83 4 million representing just 28 of adjusted ebitdax net cash provided by operating activities was 238 9 million during the first quarter and the company generated free cash flow 2 of 197 9 million magnolia generated operating income as a percentage of revenue of 62 total production in the first quarter of 2022 grew 15 from the first quarter of 2021 to 71 8 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day mboe d and at the high end of our production guidance led by our giddings asset production at giddings and other of 42 9 mboe d in the first quarter of 2022 grew 24 compared to the prior year first quarter including year over year oil production growth of 31 during the first quarter magnolia repurchased a total of 6 0 million shares of class a and class b common stock for 129 6 million at the end of the first quarter magnolia had 14 3 million class a common shares remaining under its current repurchase authorization during the quarter magnolia paid the final semi annual cash dividend related to 2021 results of 0 20 per share bringing the total dividend payment associated with 2021 to 0 28 per share magnolia ended the year with 346 4 million of cash on the balance sheet the company remains undrawn on its 450 million revolving credit facility with no debt maturities until 2026 and has no plans to increase its debt levels we currently expect our d c capital to be approximately 400 million for 2022 compared to our earlier guidance of 350 million the increase is due to additional net wells in giddings resulting from faster drilling times the drilling of longer laterals as well as other operational efficiencies combined with oil field service cost inflation these efficiencies and longer laterals result in greater well activity and are now expected to provide full year 2022 production growth in excess of 10 compared to our previous estimate of high single digit growth 1 weighted average total shares outstanding include diluted weighted average shares of class a common stock outstanding during the period and shares of class b common stock which are anti dilutive in the calculation of weighted average number of common shares outstanding 2 adjusted ebitdax and free cash flow are non gaap financial measures for reconciliations to the most comparable gaap measures please see non gaap financial measures at the end of this press release we had a very strong start to the year as demonstrated by our record quarterly financial and operating results said chairman president and ceo steve chazen the ongoing execution of our strategy and business plan which includes disciplined capital spending continues to provide moderate and steady production growth high pre tax operating margins and significant free cash flow the absence of hedges which resulted in strong product price realizations combined with our continued efforts around cost containment is reflected in record quarterly pre tax operating margins of 62 percent our operating team continues to make strong progress steadily advancing the development of our giddings asset as giddings is still in the relatively early stages of development our team has been successful in offsetting some of the oil field cost inflation through ongoing efficiency gains during the first quarter of 2022 we grew our total production by more than 3 percent sequentially while spending just 28 percent of our adjusted ebitdax we generated nearly 200 million of free cash flow during the quarter and returned 89 percent of this to our shareholders mainly through share repurchases of 130 million as well as 46 million for the final semi annual dividend payment related to our 2021 results we repurchased a total of 6 million shares during the first quarter and our total diluted shares outstanding declined by 9 percent compared to last year s first quarter despite the significant return of cash to our shareholders we ended the quarter with 346 million of cash on our balance sheet and roughly unchanged during the quarter we continue to operate two drilling rigs with one completion crew split between our two assets at giddings and in the karnes county area our gradual and measured approach toward both the appraisal and development of the giddings field has created operating efficiencies leading to some acceleration of our well activity this year faster drilling combined with the drilling of longer laterals at giddings and oil field service cost inflation is expected to add a small amount of capital to our program for the remainder of the year this is also expected to boost our full year production growth to more than 10 percent compared to our previous outlook of high single digits at current product prices we expect our capital spending to be around a third of our adjusted ebitdax well below our 55 percent spending cap and resulting in significant free cash flow most of the free cash flow is expected to be allocated toward improving the per share value of the company including our plan to repurchase more than 1 percent of our outstanding shares each quarter we would also expect our dividend to grow at least 10 percent annually based on the continued successful execution of our strategy operational update first quarter 2022 total company production averaged 71 8 mboe d representing a more than 3 percent sequential increase and 15 percent higher than the prior year s first quarter overall production grew during the quarter despite our spending only 28 percent of adjusted ebitdax on drilling and completing wells production was at the high end of our guidance mainly due to better well performance at our giddings asset compared to the same period last year giddings and other production grew 24 percent and oil production at giddings grew 31 percent magnolia continues to operate two drilling rigs and expects to maintain this level of activity for the balance of the year one rig will continue to drill multi well development pads in our giddings asset the second rig will drill a mix of wells in both the karnes and giddings areas including some appraisal wells in giddings we continue to realize efficiency gains at giddings as evidenced by approximately a 20 percent improvement in our drilling feet per day compared to the first quarter of 2021 our average lateral length per well continues to rise and we expect this year s average length to be around 8 000 feet with some wells surpassing 10 000 feet we also plan to drill some larger pads in giddings during the second half of the year efficiencies such as the reduction in drilling times longer laterals and more wells per pad leads to more net well activity during the year and a little more capital these efficiencies should also help mitigate some of the service cost inflation in addition to boosting our production during the remainder of 2022 and into early next year our overall lease operating expenses increased compared to the prior year mainly due to higher workover related activity which can vary from period to period g a expenses declined on a year over year basis as a result of savings from the termination of the enervest operating services agreement and partly offset by higher personnel costs associated with our growth additional guidance we estimate our second quarter d c capital to be approximately 100 to 110 million and currently expect it to be in this range for the remaining quarters of the year and with full year capital estimated at about 400 million total production for the second quarter is estimated to be approximately 72 to 74 mboe d most of our wells in the current quarter are expected to be turned in line during the latter half of the period and resulting in higher production during the second half of the year based on continued strong well performance faster drilling times and other operational efficiencies seen at giddings we now expect our total production growth to exceed 10 percent for the full year 2022 and compared to our earlier estimate of high single digit growth production at giddings is also expected to grow approximately 25 percent during this year oil price differentials are anticipated to be approximately a 3 per barrel discount to magellan east houston and magnolia remains completely unhedged for all its oil and natural gas production the fully diluted total share count for the second quarter of 2022 is expected to be approximately 223 million shares which is 8 percent lower than second quarter 2021 levels quarterly report on form 10 q magnolia s financial statements and related footnotes will be

measure that is used by management and external users of our consolidated financial statements such as industry analysts investors lenders and rating agencies we define adjusted ebitdax as net income before interest expense income taxes depreciation depletion and amortization amortization of intangible assets exploration costs and accretion of asset retirement obligations adjusted to exclude the effect of certain items included in net income adjusted ebitdax is not a measure of net income in accordance with gaap our management believes that adjusted ebitdax is useful because it allows them to more effectively evaluate our operating performance and compare the results of our operations from period to period and against our peers without regard to our financing methods or capital structure we also believe that securities analysts investors and other interested parties may use adjusted ebitdax in the evaluation of our company we exclude the items listed above from net income in arriving at adjusted ebitdax because these amounts can vary substantially from company to company within our industry depending upon accounting methods and book values of assets capital structures and the method by which the assets were acquired adjusted ebitdax should not be considered as an alternative to or more meaningful than net income as determined in accordance with gaap or as an indicator of our operating performance or liquidity certain items excluded from adjusted ebitdax are significant components in understanding and assessing a company s financial performance such as a company s cost of capital and tax structure as well as the historic costs of depreciable assets none of which are components of adjusted ebitdax our presentation of adjusted ebitdax should not be construed as an inference that our results will be unaffected by unusual or non recurring items our computations of adjusted ebitdax may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies the following table presents a reconciliation of net income to adjusted ebitdax our most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap for the quarters ended in

our presentation of adjusted cash operating margin and total adjusted cash operating costs are supplemental non gaap financial measures that are used by management total adjusted cash operating costs exclude the impact of non cash activity we define adjusted cash operating margin per boe as total revenues per boe less operating expenses per boe management believes that total adjusted cash operating costs per boe and adjusted cash operating margin per boe provide relevant and useful information which is used by our management in assessing the company s profitability and comparability of results to our peers as a performance measure total adjusted cash operating costs and adjusted cash operating margin may be useful to investors in facilitating comparisons to others in the company s industry because certain items can vary substantially in the oil and gas industry from company to company depending upon accounting methods book value of assets and capital structure among other

an iconic portrait of marilyn monroe by andy warhol soared to 195 million at christie s in new york on monday the second highest result for an artwork at auction and the biggest test of the masterpiece market since march 2020 plummeting stocks in all major sectors from banking to oil and gas appeared to have minimal impact on the bidding at christie s rockefeller center salesroom nevertheless the 170 million hammer total for warhol s shot sage blue marilyn 1964 fell short of its unpublished 200 million estimate after less than four minutes of bidding the work was purchased by mega dealer larry gagosian in the salesroom he declined to say whether he bought the work for himself or a client the picture was offered along with 35 other lots from the estate of swiss sibling dealers thomas and doris ammann all told the sale generated 317 8 million toward the lower end of its 284 million to 420 million estimate thirty four out of 36 lots found buyers in a way gagosian s purchase marks a return the painting had been in the ammann collection since gagosian himself sold it to thomas out of my gallery on 23rd street in 1986 the dealer told artnet news after the sale he didn t even know it was in the gallery he came to see something else and he bought it on the spot the evening was the first event in a two week 2 billion auction marathon with more trophy art up for grabs than the market has seen in years testing the demand are a bevy of rothkos monets and picassos along with scores of flipped works by young artists the marilyn result became highest price for an american artist at auction wresting the title from jean michel basquiat whose untitled canvas of a skull sold for 110 5 million five years ago all the proceeds from the ammann sale will benefit charities providing urgent medical and educational care to children according to christie s it represents the largest philanthropic sale since the rockefeller auction in 2018 the winner of the warhol also has the opportunity to nominate the charities to which 20 percent of the marilyn proceeds will be allocated pending the foundation s approval i don t think it s about the stock market that picture said asher edelman who was a corporate raider before becoming an art dealer it s a matter of someone in abu dhabi or elsewhere wanting it for a museum there are no more russians but there are others the priciest painting ever sold is leonardo da vinci s salvator mundi which fetched 450 3 million in 2017 with a presale estimate of 100 million that work carried lower expectations than the marilyn which was the highest estimated work ever sold at auction it s a once in a lifetime chance to own this painting said alberto mugrabi art dealer and scion of the family that has the largest warhol collection in private hands this is the ultimate there s nothing bigger than this warhol first painted marilyn in 1962 on a smaller scale and returned to his famous and tragic muse twice more over the course of his career the larger and more detailed format that he created in 1964 is considered the most desirable subset of the motif which itself is the most desirable in warhol s oeuvre shot sage blue marilyn is one in a series of five that also includes versions in red orange and turquoise their title comes from an incident when performance artist dorothy podber shot the four stacked canvases with a revolver right between marilyn s eyes only one version the turquoise was spared the assault the ammann siblings bought the painting from condé nast mogul and mega collector si newhouse 36 years ago in a sale brokered by gagosian the marilyn series has a storied market history in 1998 newhouse picked up another version of the painting the orange one for 17 3 million against a high estimate of 6 million it was a watershed moment in the art business which had never seen such a sum spent at auction after newhouse s death in 2017 billionaire hedge fund manager ken griffin bought that work privately for around 200 million according to people familiar with the deal other paintings in the series belong to newsprint mogul peter brant who purchased the blue version for 5 000 in 1967 steve cohen who bought the turquoise marilyn for 80 million in 2007 and greek magnate philip niarchos who owns the red version i have spoken to all the other guys who have these paintings and they will never sell them said mugrabi detailing various unprintable afflictions they would rather incur brant attended the auction when asked if he would part with his marilyn he said no way never the painting was the final lot of the ammann sale a smorgasbord of high and low figurative and abstract with a particular flair for appropriation art it was a testament to the eclectic tastes of thomas ammann who died in 1993 and doris ammann who took over the gallery and ran it until her death a year ago strong results for 1980s works by white male artists including francesco clemente enzo cucchi donald baechler peter halley and ross bleckner defied prevailing trends which have favored new figurative paintings with particularly strong competition for work by women and artists of color a small painting of three birds by ann craven i wasn t sorry 2003 also fetched a record 680 400 flying past the presale estimate of 20 000 to 30 000 a mike bidlo painting not picasso bather with beachball 1932 1987 sold for a picasso like price of 1 3 million triple the conceptual appropriation artist s auction record gagosian was an active buyer during the sale snapping up two paintings by cy twombly for 16 9 million and 21 million and franz west s pink sculpture for 592 200 but not every lot flew a sigmar polke painting estimated at 1 5 million to 2 million and an all black brice marden estimated at 5 million to 7 million failed to find buyers a large scale but low quality basquiat his glue sniffing valet 1984 also struggled hammering at the low estimate of 6 million 7 3 million with fees with just one bidder it was the same for lucian freud s man resting 1988 an unappealing nude which hit the low estimate of 1 2 million 1 5 million with fees a large scale work by the bruce high quality foundation once a hot art collective hammered at 22 000 way below the low estimate of 40 000 asian bidding was thin throughout the sale with only 10 percent of asian participation compared with 45 percent of american bidding according to christie s the hong kong salesroom was quiet when the marilyn came up and middle eastern bidders didn t seem to materialize either the question is was asia s presence so low because of what s going on in the world or because it wasn t the material that they are chasing said art adviser abigail asher tonight s 21st century sale at

washington sought to portray a united front against russia s invasion of ukraine as president joe biden signed a bipartisan measure to reboot the world war ii era lend lease programme which helped defeat nazi germany to bolster kyiv and eastern european allies the signing on monday comes as the us congress is poised to unleash billions more to fight the war against russia with democrats preparing 40 billion in military and humanitarian aid larger than the 33 billion package biden has requested it all serves as a rejoinder to russian president vladimir putin who has seized on victory in europe day the anniversary of germany s unconditional surrender in 1945 and russia s biggest patriotic holiday to rally his people behind the invasion this aid has been critical to ukraine s success on the battlefield biden said in a statement biden said it was urgent that congress approve the next ukraine assistance package to avoid any interruption in military supplies being sent to help fight the war with a crucial deadline coming in 10 days we cannot allow our shipments of assistance to stop while we await further congressional action he said he urged congress to act and to do so quickly in a letter delivered to capitol hill on monday defence secretary lloyd austin and secretary of state antony blinken urged congress to act before may 19 when the existing drawdown funds run out the pentagon has already sent or committed all but 100 million of the 3 5 billion in weapons and equipment that it can send to ukraine from its existing stockpiles and that final 100 million is expected to be used no later than may 19 they said in short we need your help they said in the letter which was obtained by the associated press the ability to draw upon existing dod stocks has been a critical tool in our efforts to support the ukrainians in their fight against russian aggression allowing us to quickly source equipment and ensure a sustained flow of security assistance to ukraine the resolve from biden and congress to maintain support for ukraine has been lasting but also surprising still as the months long war with russia grinds on the bipartisan showing for ukraine will be tested as the us and allies are drawn closer toward the conflict the house could vote as soon as this week on the bolstered ukraine aid package sending the legislation to the senate which is working to confirm biden s nominee bridget brink as the new ukrainian ambassador with the president s party holding only the slimmest majorities in the house and senate republican cooperation is preferred if not vital in some cases for passage of the president s strategy toward the region i think we will be able to do it as quickly as possible house speaker nancy pelosi said over the weekend about an emerging aid package we have great bipartisanship in terms of our support for the fight for democracy that the people of ukraine are making despite their differences over biden s approach to foreign policy and perceived missteps in confronting russia when it comes to ukraine the members of the house and senate have held together to support the president s strategy the lend lease bill that biden signed into law monday revives the world war ii era strategy to more quickly send military equipment to ukraine launched under during world war ii it signalled the us would become what franklin d roosevelt called he arsenal of democracy helping britain and the allies fight nazi germany before signing the bill biden said putin s war was once more bringing wanton destruction of europe drawing reference to the significance of the day flanked by two democratic lawmakers and one republican biden signed the bill which had widespread bipartisan support it sailed through the senate last month with unanimous agreement without even the need for a formal roll call vote it passed overwhelmingly in the house drawing opposition from just 10 republicans it really matters biden said of the bipartisan support for ukraine it matters one of the bill s chief republican sponsors sen john cornyn of texas said in a statement the measure will give ukraine the upper hand against russia and i m glad america could act as the arsenal of democracy for this critical partner other measures including efforts to cut off russian oil imports to the us and calls to investigate putin for war crimes have also gained widespread support though some lawmakers have pushed biden to do even more while president putin and the russian people celebrated victory day today we re seeing russian forces commit war crimes and atrocities in ukraine as they engage in a brutal war that is causing so much suffering and needless destruction said white house press secretary jen psaki she said putin was perverting history to attempt to justify his unprovoked and unjustified war biden acknowledged his request for more in military and humanitarian aid for ukraine would have to be separated from money he also sought from congress to address the covid 19 crisis at home decoupling the two funding requests would be a setback for the president s push for more covid 19 spending but a nod to the political reality of the congress republicans in congress are resisting spending more money at home as the pandemic crisis shifts to a new phase and biden did not want to delay money for ukraine by trying to debate the issue further biden said he was told by congressional leaders in both parties that keeping the two spending packages linked would slow down action we cannot afford delay in this vital war effort biden said in the statement hence i am prepared to accept that these two measures move separately so that the ukrainian aid bill can get to my desk right away as the now bolstered ukraine package makes its way through the house and senate with votes possible soon lawmakers are showing no signs of flinching countless lawmakers have made weekend excursions to the region to see firsthand the devastation of the war on ukraine and surrounding countries as more than 5 million refugees flee the country rather than fight the spending overseas as had been an increasingly popular viewpoint during the trump era some lawmakers in both parties want to boost the amount of u s aid being sent to ukraine

in a third interim analysis for the randomized phase 2 arc 7 study both anti tigit domvanalimab containing arms continued to show meaningful differentiation compared to the anti pd1 antibody zimberelimab alone when given as a treatment for first line metastatic non small cell lung cancer nsclc we expect to provide a data update in 2h2022 arcus and gilead continue to expand their late stage clinical program for domvanalimab with the goal of establishing a best in class pd 1 tigit antibody backbone and triplet regimens the third registrational phase 3 study star 121 will evaluate the combination of domvanalimab plus zimberelimab and chemotherapy versus standard of care pembrolizumab with chemotherapy in first line nsclc pd l1 all comers expected to initiate in 4q 2022 arcus is well positioned to advance its programs including four registrational phase 3 trials with 1 3 billion in cash and cash equivalents and funding into 2026 hayward calif business wire arcus biosciences inc nyse rcus a clinical stage global biopharmaceutical company focused on developing differentiated molecules and combination therapies for people with cancer today reported financial results for the first quarter ended march 31 2022 and provided a pipeline update on its six clinical stage molecules targeting tigit the adenosine axis cd73 and dual a2a a2b receptor hif 2a and pd 1 across multiple common cancers in addition today arcus announced encouraging results from the third interim analysis of the ongoing phase 2 arc 7 study in this interim analysis both domvanalimab containing arms continued to show meaningful differentiation compared to zimberelimab alone across multiple efficacy measures including overall response rate orr and duration of response dor the clinical activity of zimberelimab alone was in line with established anti pd 1 therapies in this patient population at the time of data cut off no unexpected safety signals were observed we are optimistic about the potential for and committed to the goal of domvanalimab becoming a best in class anti tigit antibody said terry rosen ph d chief executive officer of arcus the results from our most recent interim analysis further support the significant investment we and gilead are making in the domvanalimab program which is on track to increase from two ongoing to four phase 3 studies by year end and include expansion into new areas of unmet need with broader populations in lung and upper gastrointestinal cancers moreover with a strong cash balance and six clinical stage molecules across multiple cancer types we are well positioned to develop potentially practice changing therapies for cancer patients in need of better treatment options anti tigit program domvanalimab and ab308 update on arc 7 arcus conducted a third interim analysis ia3 for arc 7 a randomized phase 2 study evaluating the safety and efficacy of zimberelimab alone vs domvanalimab plus zimberelimab doublet vs domvanalimab plus zimberelimab and etrumadenant triplet as a first line treatment for metastatic nsclc pd l1 tps 50 with no actionable mutations the study has a target total enrollment of 150 patients who are being randomized 1 1 1 across three study arms and treated until disease progression or loss of clinical benefit arc 7 is an ongoing study and the data continues to mature as more patients are enrolled and patients are followed for longer durations gilead and arcus are co developing and equally share co development costs for the three investigational molecules domvanalimab an fc silent anti tigit antibody etrumadenant a dual adenosine a2a a2b receptor antagonist and zimberelimab an anti pd1 antibody summary of efficacy and safety observations from ia3 with more patients and longer follow up both domvanalimab containing arms continued to show meaningful differentiation compared to zimberelimab alone across multiple efficacy measures including orr and dor since the last interim analysis orr for the doublet continued to increase and further separate from zimberelimab alone although early the depth of response for the triplet remains encouraging arcus and gilead will continue to monitor the triplet for potential differentiation in duration and depth of response vs the doublet at this interim analysis arcus performed its first assessment of dor while the data are still immature at the time of ia3 arcus observed a substantial improvement for the domvanalimab containing arms compared to zimberelimab alone zimberelimab alone continued to demonstrate activity consistent with that of marketed anti pd 1 antibodies in the setting no unexpected safety signals were observed early safety data from this interim analysis showed a lower incidence of infusion reactions relative to published numbers from other anti tigit plus anti pd l 1 clinical studies other anti tigit updates in may 2022 arcus presented phase 1 and preclinical data at the annual meeting of the american association of immunologists the data demonstrated the potential of domvanalimab as an fc silent antibody to achieve anti tumor effects and the incidence of pruritis rash maculopapular rash and infusion related adverse events appear to be lower than fc enabled anti tigit monoclonal antibodies the poster can be found in the publications section of the arcus website 2022 anti tigit milestones enrollment for arc 7 remains on track to complete mid 2022 we expect to provide a data update in the second half of 2022 arcus and gilead plan to initiate star 121 in 4q 2022 a phase 3 registrational trial to evaluate the combination of domvanalimab plus zimberelimab and chemotherapy versus standard of care pembrolizumab with chemotherapy in first line nsclc pd l1 all comers star 221 a pivotal phase 3 study of a domvanalimab based combination in upper gastrointestinal cancers is currently in advanced stages of planning arcus and gilead expect to initiate two signal finding phase 2 studies to further evaluate multiple domvanalimab combinations including triplet combinations with etrumadenant and quemliclustat by year end etrumadenant a2a a2b adenosine receptor antagonist recent etrumadenant updates gilead announced the addition of etrumadenant plus trodelvy sacituzumab govitecan hziy cohorts in the ongoing phase 2 arc 6 trial in castration resistant prostate cancer

with gilead ab521 hif 2a inhibitor recent ab521 updates initial pk pd data from the evaluation of ab521 in healthy human volunteers as well as preclinical data for ab521 alone and in combination with cabozantinib were presented at the esmo targeted anticancer therapies congress in march 2022 the early clinical data suggest that ab521 potentially has an improved clinical profile compared to that of the approved hif 2a inhibitor 2022 ab521 milestones a phase 1 1b study to explore ab521 in clear cell renal cell carcinoma alone and in combination with other molecules including those targeting the cd73 adenosine axis is anticipated to be initiated in mid 2022 data from the healthy volunteer study should enable arcus to start dose escalation in patients at a biologically relevant dose level

a baby formula shortage is concerning parents across the country forty percent of the baby formula supply in the united states was out of stock by april it s attributed to supply chain issues and a voluntary recall of three popular brands similac alimentum and elecare the white house addressed the issue on monday by saying the fda is working with formula manufacturers to help increase production what they re trying to do in the shorthand is increase supply by working with a range of manufacturers in what their capacity is to ensure that the kinds of formula that was recalled is where they re able to help ensure it s on the shelves white house press secretary jen psaki said the shortage is putting stress on parents in minnesota including elaina borak she lives in cologne and celebrated her daughter s first birthday on monday baby formula shortage credit john crowley cc by sa 2 0 if this was last year when she was born i don t know what we would ve done borak said she explained they started buying a couple of extra boxes when they went to the store as a precaution months ago when there were signs of a possible shortage soon they were driving to other communities to try to buy it having to go to minnetonka having to go somewhere closer to the cities she explained borak turned to the internet as formula became harder to find i thought oh i ll just order it online because if we re not finding it at target i can just order it she said it worked for two or three times and then all of a sudden i think it was last month i went online to grab it and nothing was available so then i was kind of nervous we counted out what we had left and it seemed about three weeks luckily her father located a box while on vacation in florida she said they re now hoping that will hold them over as they can transition their daughter to whole milk i really can t even imagine what it would be like if we had a baby that was a few months old borak said it s unbelievable i mean something needs to be figured out physicians are encouraging parents to reach out for help if they can t find formula i think this is such a challenging problem for families said dr gigi chawla the chief of general pediatrics at children s minnesota she advises parents that they can switch to a different brand of formula if their primary choice isn t available most of the formulas have essentially the same composition and can be readily switched back and forth said dr chawla it is not our first choice our first preference but it is far better than any of the options for babies she warns parents against watering down formula to make it stretch further according to dr chawla increasing the amount of water could cause nutritional imbalances and lead to serious health problems in addition parents should not substitute other kinds of milk for formula nor should they try to make their own formula infant formula is highly specialized she said you are not as an individual able to match the right calories the right nutrients that babies really need in order to grow and thrive we really encourage parents to reach out for help when you can t find formula dr eric barth a pediatrician at the allina health clinic in ramsey told 5 eyewtiness news babies could develop metabolic or electrolyte imbalances if they re fed homemade formula the longer you used a formula that was homemade the more risk there would be that if something was off they would develop an issue he said barth said this is the worst shortage of its kind since he started practicing medicine he agrees it is ok for parents to try a new brand of formula as long as their baby doesn t have an allergy or health condition that requires a specific type the difficulty comes if a baby has a milk allergy a true allergy or a health condition that requires them to be on a really specialized formula he explained but the vast majority of babies can take whatever is on the shelf he suggests parents select the type of formula that s the most similar to what their baby has been using the closest to what you re used to what the baby is used to is certainly a good idea but there is a saying any port in a storm well in this case you might have to take whatever is available barth said both doctors suggest parents reach out to their pediatrician for help if they cannot find formula for their baby

tells me her whole family is on the hunt for formula for her four month old son mason because of the current shortage i actually just drove 20 minutes away from my house last night to get small can of formula for him julia started mason on similac formula at two months old because her breast milk was in short supply but then recall on similac and other formulas combined with supply chain issues exacerbating the shortage it s lot of anxiety wondering if you re going to be able to continue to feed your kids this is for gassy babies dr selma al faqih owner of nana pediatric center says families should check with their pediatrician since they can get samples shipped and another piece of advice lot of store brands carry the exact same formulas and that s what may be lot of parents are not aware of meanwhile parents may wonder if they can dilute their formula so it lasts longer al faqih ways in absolutely no noise diluting formula when you dilute the formula and i have seen this the babies end up getting too much water and they can end up having low salt in their body leading to seizures dr al faqih also advises against making your own formula using goat s milk or importing concoctions found online this is parents like julia are just trying to take it day by day it s kind of like with covid with the hand sanitizer and toilet paper and all that kind of stuff that seems like it s starting to move that direction with formula now with no end of the shortage and site in orlando marlin martinez west two news advertisement the baby formula supply problem is getting worse here s why share copy link copy for months stores nationwide have been struggling to stock enough baby formula manufacturers say they re producing at full capacity and making as much formula as they can but it s still not enough to meet current demand the out of stock rate for baby formula hovered between 2 and 8 in the first half of 2021 but began rising sharply last july between november 2021 and early april 2022 the out of stock rate jumped to 31 data from datasembly showed that rate increased another 9 percentage points in just three weeks in april and now stands at 40 the statistics show in six states iowa south dakota north dakota missouri texas and tennessee more than half of baby formula was completely sold out during the week starting april 24 datasembly said and although seven states had between 40 50 of baby formula products out of stock as of early april 26 states are now struggling with supply this issue has been compounded by supply chain issues product recalls and historic inflation datasembly ceo ben reich said unfortunately given the unprecedented amount of volatility to the category we anticipate baby formula to continue to be one of the most affected products in the market cvs and walgreens confirmed that it is limiting customers nationwide to three toddler and infant formulas per transaction we continue to work diligently with our supplier partners to best meet customer demands walgreens said in a statement to cnn business a target spokesperson confirmed that the retailer has limited baby formula purchases to four units per customer for online purchases there is no limit on the number of units that can be bought in person in target stores the company said customers shared images on social media of walmart imposing similar constraints on its sales of baby formula though walmart did not confirm if it was a nationwide policy images shared with cnn business show empty shelves where baby formula should be and a sign saying only five units were allowed per customer walmart did not immediately respond to a request for comment from cnn business the shortage has been exacerbated by the food and drug administration s shutdown of an abbott nutrition facility in sturgis michigan abbott is a major producer of baby formula in february the u s food and drug administration recalled three brands of powdered baby formulas made by the company due to potential bacterial infections including salmonella the agency advised parents not to buy or use certain batches of similac alimentum and elecare powdered infant formulas all abbott brands a former employee of abbott nutrition filed a whistleblower complaint with the fda months before the recall documenting their concerns that the company was hiding safety problems at its sturgis mich plant the formulas manufactured at the facility were recalled after four infants drinking it had fallen ill with rare infections caused by cronobacter sakazakii bacteria two infants died the complaint said abbott said the former employee was fired because of serious violations of abbott s food safety policies and that it will investigate new allegations after dismissal the former employee through their attorney has made evolving new and escalating allegations to multiple authorities an abbott spokesperson said in a statement the abbott spokesperson also said that products tested for cronobacter sakazakii and salmonella all came back negative and that no salmonella was found at the sturgis facility during the investigation the cronobacter sakazakii that was found in environmental testing during the investigation was in non product contact areas of our sturgis facility and has not been linked to the two available patient samples or any other known infant illness the spokesperson said finding standard formula has become difficult for parents many of whom described the extraordinary lengths they ve gone to in order to score even a single can or bottle specialized formula is even harder to locate amid the widespread shortage parents are driving to neighboring states to try their luck and many are pleading for help on social media imploring strangers to share or even barter any extra supply they may have abbott told cnn in a statement saturday it is working closely with the fda to resume operations in its michigan plant we continue to make progress on corrective actions and will be implementing additional actions as we work toward addressing items related to the recent recall in the meantime we are working to increase the supply of infant formula by prioritizing infant formula production at our facilities that provide product to the u s market abbott said in a statement to cnn business

lagos nigeria nigeria s national airlines will suspend operations beginning this week until further notice due to the rising cost of jet fuel citing scarce supplies of fuel domestic flights have been disrupted since march with some airlines canceling domestic schedules after russia s invasion of ukraine caused a price surge in the crude oil market global jet fuel prices have soared increasing costs significantly for both airlines and passengers in a statement the airline association said jet fuel prices rose to 1 68 per liter in nigeria from 45 cents and the cost of a one hour flight has more than doubled to 297 airline passengers in nigeria pay for fares in naira which has weakened sharply due to devaluations meanwhile fuel suppliers are paid in dollars which is scarce in nigeria which remains africa s leading economy the association said the continued rise in the cost of jet fuel has created operational pressures that put into question the airlines financial viability stating to this end therefore the airline operators of nigeria informs the general public that member airlines will discontinue operations nationwide with effect from monday 9th may 2022 until further notice
this is not to neglect the challenges that face the business be they its withdrawal from russia which will knock around 3pc off group sales this year or the ongoing pushback against smoking from regulators and health authorities alike it is still far from clear to what degree next generation products such as vapour and heated tobacco products will over the long term compensate for a decline in cigarette volumes but in the short term bat does offer investors one valuable attribute price inelasticity of demand or in plain english the ability to put up prices and get its customers to pay them this makes the company s business model better suited than many to an inflationary or stagflationary environment and the explanation for the shares good run in 2022 could just lie here any investor who fears a sustained bout of inflation or indeed stagflation may therefore be inclined to look more towards consumer staples such as tobacco and perhaps alcohol too rather than more consumer discretionary items and in this respect bat fits the bill unless the investor runs those esg screens a test the company will fail bat could yet keep puffing higher hold questor says hold ticker bats share price at close 33 02 update telecom plus one trap into which this column occasionally falls headlong despite its best intentions is to mistakenly conflate a solid business model with a safe stock the result is often portfolio pain as the price or valuation paid to access the company s profit and cash flow streams is too high and that skews the reward risk balance in an undesirable direction despite its admiration for multi utility telecom plus this column now faces this very dilemma a capital gain of about 35pc since our initial study at 11 62 a share in december 2016 with dividends of another 294p a share on top only adds to the stock s lustre and a trading statement late last month did nothing to diminish our admiration telecom plus is well placed to help those unfortunate householders whose energy suppliers no longer trade and positive word of mouth from its partners will also help particularly as those partners continue to grow in numbers strong customer additions bode well for the future especially as a period of investment in the service proposition may be drawing to a close a further boost to profits the issue of valuation refuses to go away however the stock trades on almost 30 times forecast earnings for the year to march 2023 based on analysts consensus any upgrades to forecasts could make that figure deceptive but as ratings go it looks very full and after missing the chance to lock in gains at strix ip group and others it would be remiss to do so now time to reluctantly take profits questor says sell ticker tep share price at close 15 62 russ mould is investment director at aj bell the stockbroker read the latest questor column on telegraph co uk every sunday tuesday wednesday thursday and friday from 5am read questor s rules of investment before you follow our tips

manila the philippines woke to a new but familiar political dawn on tuesday may 10 after an election triumph by ferdinand marcos jr paved the way for a once unimaginable return to the country s highest office for its most notorious political dynasty marcos better known as bongbong trounced bitter rival leni robredo to become the first candidate in recent history to win a philippines presidential election majority marking a stunning comeback by the son and namesake of an ousted dictator that has been decades in the making marcos fled into exile in hawaii with his family during a 1986 people power uprising that ended his father s autocratic 20 year rule and has served in congress and the senate since his return to the philippines in 1991 marcos s runaway victory in monday s election now looks certain with 96 of the eligible ballots counted in an unofficial tally showing he has more than 30 million votes double that of robredo an official result is expected around the end of the month there are thousands of you out there volunteers parallel groups political leaders that have cast their lot with us because of our belief in our message of unity marcos said in a statement streamed on facebook standing beside a national flag though marcos 64 campaigned on a platform of unity political analysts say his presidency is unlikely to foster that despite the margin of victory philippine stocks fell about 3 on tuesday tracking weaker global equities but with analysts also citing concerns about a marcos win particularly its fiscal implications if he follows through on pledges to subsidise food and fuel the peso currency meanwhile rose 0 3 against the dollar many among the millions of robredo voters are angered by what they see as a brazen attempt by the disgraced former first family to use its mastery of social media to reinvent historical narratives of its time in power thousands of opponents of marcos senior suffered persecution during a brutal 1972 1981 era of martial law and the family name became synonymous with plunder cronyism and extravagant living with billions of dollars of state wealth disappearing the marcos family has denied wrongdoing and many of its supporters bloggers and social media influencers say historical accounts are distorted students stage protest around 400 people mostly students staged a protest outside the election commission on tuesday against marcos and citing election irregularities the election commission which said the poll was relatively peaceful is due on tuesday to rule on petitions seeking to overturn its dismissal of complaints trying to bar marcos from the presidential race human rights group karapatan called on filipinos to reject the new marcos presidency which it said was built on lies and disinformation to deodorize the marcoses detestable image marcos who shied away from debates and interviews during the campaign recently praised his father as a genius and a statesman but has also been irked by questions about the martial law era as the vote count showed the extent of the marcos win robredo told her supporters to continue their fight for truth until the next election it took time to build the structures of lies we have time and opportunity to fight and dismantle these she said marcos gave few clues on the campaign trail about what his policy agenda would look like but is widely expected to closely follow outgoing president rodrigo duterte who targeted big infrastructure works close ties with china and strong growth duterte s tough leadership style won him big support washington needed to engage with manila rather than criticise the democratic headwinds buffeting the philippines said greg poling a southeast asia analyst from the washington d c based center for strategic and international studies this is not the end of philippine democracy though it may accelerate its decay said poling live tv

it s walking up to scenes like this that are keeping parents up at night walgreens cvs target sam s costco all of those and they re all out of stock are hard to get julia frankie lives in oviedo and tells me her whole family is on the hunt for formula for her four month old son mason because of the current shortage i actually just drove 20 minutes away from my house last night to get small can of formula for him julia started mason on similac formula at two months old because her breast milk was in short supply but then recall on similac and other formulas combined with supply chain issues exacerbating the shortage it s lot of anxiety wondering if you re going to be able to continue to feed your kids this is for gassy babies dr selma al faqih owner of nana pediatric center says families should check with their pediatrician since they can get samples shipped and another piece of advice lot of store brands carry the exact same formulas and that s what may be lot of parents are not aware of meanwhile parents may wonder if they can dilute their formula so it lasts longer al faqih ways in absolutely no noise diluting formula when you dilute the formula and i have seen this the babies end up getting too much water and they can end up having low salt in their body leading to seizures dr al faqih also advises against making your own formula using goat s milk or importing concoctions found online this is parents like julia are just trying to take it day by day it s kind of like with covid with the hand sanitizer and toilet paper and all that kind of stuff that seems like it s starting to move that direction with formula now with no end of the shortage and site in orlando marlin martinez west two news advertisement the baby formula supply problem is getting worse here s why share copy link copy for months stores nationwide have been struggling to stock enough baby formula manufacturers say they re producing at full capacity and making as much formula as they can but it s still not enough to meet current demand the out of stock rate for baby formula hovered between 2 and 8 in the first half of 2021 but began rising sharply last july between november 2021 and early april 2022 the out of stock rate jumped to 31 data from datasembly showed that rate increased another 9 percentage points in just three weeks in april and now stands at 40 the statistics show in six states iowa south dakota north dakota missouri texas and tennessee more than half of baby formula was completely sold out during the week starting april 24 datasembly said and although seven states had between 40 50 of baby formula products out of stock as of early april 26 states are now struggling with supply this issue has been compounded by supply chain issues product recalls and historic inflation datasembly ceo ben reich said unfortunately given the unprecedented amount of volatility to the category we anticipate baby formula to continue to be one of the most affected products in the market cvs and walgreens confirmed that it is limiting customers nationwide to three toddler and infant formulas per transaction we continue to work diligently with our supplier partners to best meet customer demands walgreens said in a statement to cnn business a target spokesperson confirmed that the retailer has limited baby formula purchases to four units per customer for online purchases there is no limit on the number of units that can be bought in person in target stores the company said customers shared images on social media of walmart imposing similar constraints on its sales of baby formula though walmart did not confirm if it was a nationwide policy images shared with cnn business show empty shelves where baby formula should be and a sign saying only five units were allowed per customer walmart did not immediately respond to a request for comment from cnn business the shortage has been exacerbated by the food and drug administration s shutdown of an abbott nutrition facility in sturgis michigan abbott is a major producer of baby formula in february the u s food and drug administration recalled three brands of powdered baby formulas made by the company due to potential bacterial infections including salmonella the agency advised parents not to buy or use certain batches of similac alimentum and elecare powdered infant formulas all abbott brands a former employee of abbott nutrition filed a whistleblower complaint with the fda months before the recall documenting their concerns that the company was hiding safety problems at its sturgis mich plant the formulas manufactured at the facility were recalled after four infants drinking it had fallen ill with rare infections caused by cronobacter sakazakii bacteria two infants died the complaint said abbott said the former employee was fired because of serious violations of abbott s food safety policies and that it will investigate new allegations after dismissal the former employee through their attorney has made evolving new and escalating allegations to multiple authorities an abbott spokesperson said in a statement the abbott spokesperson also said that products tested for cronobacter sakazakii and salmonella all came back negative and that no salmonella was found at the sturgis facility during the investigation the cronobacter sakazakii that was found in environmental testing during the investigation was in non product contact areas of our sturgis facility and has not been linked to the two available patient samples or any other known infant illness the spokesperson said finding standard formula has become difficult for parents many of whom described the extraordinary lengths they ve gone to in order to score even a single can or bottle specialized formula is even harder to locate amid the widespread shortage parents are driving to neighboring states to try their luck and many are pleading for help on social media imploring strangers to share or even barter any extra supply they may have abbott told cnn in a statement saturday it is working closely with the fda to resume operations in its michigan plant we continue to make progress on corrective actions and will be implementing additional actions as we work toward addressing items related to the recent recall in the meantime we are working to increase the supply of infant formula by prioritizing infant formula production at our facilities that provide product to the u s market abbott said in a statement to cnn business

etoro s market analyst and crypto expert simon peters gives us his weekly crypto and blockchain update this week focusing on the decline in value of the cryptoasset market before we get into peters assessment analyst josh gilbert put bitcoin s decline into perspective saying bitcoin had been quite resilient so far in 2022 given the current state of the macro environment but is now feeling the full effect of the market correction bitcoin s rising correlation with other asset classes is climbing such as equities and stocks in that sense bitcoin is the victim of its own success with more institutions getting involved and therefore trading differently from around 3 4 years ago bitcoin is now facing its biggest test after breaking below us 30 000 this is the lowest bitcoin has been since july 2021 and if the move below us 30 000 is sustained we could see some heavy selling which could spell further downside in the short term inflation data coming out of the us on wednesday will be key to this market correction if we see inflation start to ease year over year and stabilise month over month this could potentially help calm markets investors should buckle up for a volatile few days ahead and remember the basic tenets of investing diversify understand what you are investing in control your emotions and never invest more than you can afford to lose compounding struggles for cryptoasset market the cryptoasset market faced a major sell off last week compounding struggles for the market since the beginning of the year bitcoin has seen its value plunge 16 in the past few days having traded up to around us 39 000 earlier in the week it has been on a downward path since thursday and is currently trading just above the us 33 000 level it is now over 50 down on its all time high ath set in november last year ether has suffered a more severe fall of around 17 since thursday as the cryptoasset has struggled in the face of many market obstacles ether traded up to around us 2 900 on thursday but has since fallen away to trade just above us 2 400 the concern now for cryptoasset investors is when the slide will end the market is caught in the wider adversity of investment markets that are battling to decide where comfortable levels are in the wake of interest rate hikes designed to quell soaring inflation around the western world the market is now moving more closely with other major risk assets such as tech and other stocks this is indicative of the major shift in the presence of institutions within the cryptoasset market which now account for a much greater proportion of ownership and tend to bundle their decision making on crypto with other major assets while perhaps not succour for cryptoasset investors facing significant falls there is a wider point here that retail investors are no longer facing the market alone and the very presence of institutions as holders is a positive for the long term value and potential market volatility and underperformance tends to correct in time so what is key now is for investors to ensure they re happy with their investment cases and are prepared to stay the course for more volatility ahead market instability threatens ust stablecoin peg the ongoing uncertainty of the cryptoasset market has caused the ust stablecoin to briefly lose its peg against the us dollar ust is one of a basket of stablecoins that are essentially digital tokens that mirror the value of traditional fiat currencies ust uses a basket of assets in order to maintain the peg with usd but this is being tested by adverse market conditions over the weekend there was dumping of assets onto various platforms and removal from liquidity pools us 150 million in withdrawals came from the stablecoin s backers terraform labs tfl which redeposited the money once it realised ust was depegging it is not the only time the stablecoin has temporarily depegged its value from usd but the environment of fear and uncertainty in the crypto market at the moment has made it more probable tfl now has a job like a nation state would with a fiat currency to defend the peg this essentially means throwing assets at it to maintain its value the worrying thing here is oftentimes when a country faces a currency crisis it can only defend its money for so long before the price has to fall this may soon be the case with ust depending on tfl s reserves meta to launch nft support reports are circulating that support for nfts on meta s platforms such as facebook and instagram could be imminent the plans will use blockchains such as solana ethereum flow and polygon per a coindesk report a pilot scheme is set to launch as early as today it comes at a tricky time for the nft market amid wider cryptoasset and indeed traditional asset sell offs nfts have seen market values drop significantly but some launches that continue to come through are still witnessing really strong demand suggesting appetite is still there to hold some of these assets the impact of meta launching nfts won t necessarily change the face of the market but it will likely help to grease the wheels of it so to speak any opportunity for the technology to be easier for normal people to access is a good thing and helps the future potential for the market gucci to start accepting crypto fashion brand gucci has said it plans to accept cryptoasset payments in some of its us stores customers will be able to pay in cryptoassets such as bitcoin dogecoin ether litecoin and shiba inu this is set to be launched in its la branch and in new york too while the move of the luxury brand into crypto is unlikely to be the break that bursts the dam of cryptoasset use it is a notable moment to see a trendsetter like gucci engaging with the space while forays into nfts from luxury brands have been fairly frequent in the past year they still lag broadly on cryptoasset payments fashion brands such as gucci make a living as trendsetters so it will be interesting to see if any more fashion houses follow suit to keep up

desperate mothers across the us have been forced to buy formula they know will make their babies sick as the country grapples with a shortage that has left shelves bare and has caused prices to skyrocket to 120 a can the share of baby formula out of stock across the u s hit 40 percent on april 24 according to datasembly that s up from 29 percent in march wynter balthrop of gallatin tennessee says she broke down inside her car after driving to six stores and calling others as far as three hours away only to receive the same answer the enfamil s
it s walking up to scenes like this that are keeping parents up at night walgreens cvs target sam s costco all of those and they re all out of stock are hard to get julia frankie lives in oviedo and tells me her whole family is on the hunt for formula for her four month old son mason because of the current shortage i actually just drove 20 minutes away from my house last night to get small can of formula for him julia started mason on similac formula at two months old because her breast milk was in short supply but then recall on similac and other formulas combined with supply chain issues exacerbating the shortage it s lot of anxiety wondering if you re going to be able to continue to feed your kids this is for gassy babies dr selma al faqih owner of nana pediatric center says families should check with their pediatrician since they can get samples shipped and another piece of advice lot of store brands carry the exact same formulas and that s what may be lot of parents are not aware of meanwhile parents may wonder if they can dilute their formula so it lasts longer al faqih ways in absolutely no noise diluting formula when you dilute the formula and i have seen this the babies end up getting too much water and they can end up having low salt in their body leading to seizures dr al faqih also advises against making your own formula using goat s milk or importing concoctions found online this is parents like julia are just trying to take it day by day it s kind of like with covid with the hand sanitizer and toilet paper and all that kind of stuff that seems like it s starting to move that direction with formula now with no end of the shortage and site in orlando marlin martinez west two news advertisement the baby formula supply problem is getting worse here s why share copy link copy for months stores nationwide have been struggling to stock enough baby formula manufacturers say they re producing at full capacity and making as much formula as they can but it s still not enough to meet current demand the out of stock rate for baby formula hovered between 2 and 8 in the first half of 2021 but began rising sharply last july between november 2021 and early april 2022 the out of stock rate jumped to 31 data from datasembly showed that rate increased another 9 percentage points in just three weeks in april and now stands at 40 the statistics show in six states iowa south dakota north dakota missouri texas and tennessee more than half of baby formula was completely sold out during the week starting april 24 datasembly said and although seven states had between 40 50 of baby formula products out of stock as of early april 26 states are now struggling with supply this issue has been compounded by supply chain issues product recalls and historic inflation datasembly ceo ben reich said unfortunately given the unprecedented amount of volatility to the category we anticipate baby formula to continue to be one of the most affected products in the market cvs and walgreens confirmed that it is limiting customers nationwide to three toddler and infant formulas per transaction we continue to work diligently with our supplier partners to best meet customer demands walgreens said in a statement to cnn business a target spokesperson confirmed that the retailer has limited baby formula purchases to four units per customer for online purchases there is no limit on the number of units that can be bought in person in target stores the company said customers shared images on social media of walmart imposing similar constraints on its sales of baby formula though walmart did not confirm if it was a nationwide policy images shared with cnn business show empty shelves where baby formula should be and a sign saying only five units were allowed per customer walmart did not immediately respond to a request for comment from cnn business the shortage has been exacerbated by the food and drug administration s shutdown of an abbott nutrition facility in sturgis michigan abbott is a major producer of baby formula in february the u s food and drug administration recalled three brands of powdered baby formulas made by the company due to potential bacterial infections including salmonella the agency advised parents not to buy or use certain batches of similac alimentum and elecare powdered infant formulas all abbott brands a former employee of abbott nutrition filed a whistleblower complaint with the fda months before the recall documenting their concerns that the company was hiding safety problems at its sturgis mich plant the formulas manufactured at the facility were recalled after four infants drinking it had fallen ill with rare infections caused by cronobacter sakazakii bacteria two infants died the complaint said abbott said the former employee was fired because of serious violations of abbott s food safety policies and that it will investigate new allegations after dismissal the former employee through their attorney has made evolving new and escalating allegations to multiple authorities an abbott spokesperson said in a statement the abbott spokesperson also said that products tested for cronobacter sakazakii and salmonella all came back negative and that no salmonella was found at the sturgis facility during the investigation the cronobacter sakazakii that was found in environmental testing during the investigation was in non product contact areas of our sturgis facility and has not been linked to the two available patient samples or any other known infant illness the spokesperson said finding standard formula has become difficult for parents many of whom described the extraordinary lengths they ve gone to in order to score even a single can or bottle specialized formula is even harder to locate amid the widespread shortage parents are driving to neighboring states to try their luck and many are pleading for help on social media imploring strangers to share or even barter any extra supply they may have abbott told cnn in a statement saturday it is working closely with the fda to resume operations in its michigan plant we continue to make progress on corrective actions and will be implementing additional actions as we work toward addressing items related to the recent recall in the meantime we are working to increase the supply of infant formula by prioritizing infant formula production at our facilities that provide product to the u s market abbott said in a statement to cnn business

fashion is asking wall street for something investors just might not have patience in a time of confusion the sector soared through the pandemic last year with consumer demand outweighing supply chain troubles and the evolving pandemic but now fashion is facing a much more uncertain environment with inflation at a 40 year high china in a covid 19 deep freeze and war raging in ukraine more from wwd so chief executive officers are arguing their businesses are set up to thrive after two years of pandemic under armour inc chief patrik frisk and adidas ceo kasper rorsted were the latest to make the case last friday while investors are in a very what have you done for me lately mood the dichotomy shows in the stock market where many fashion brands are being hit especially hard as shares swing wildly and the reality of much higher interest rates starts to settle in with investors more shakeups could be in the offing if the generally strong consumer starts to show more signs of weakness which is starting to happen on the lower end of the income scale wall street started this week off with another jolt the dow jones industrial average dropped 2 percent or 653 67 points to 32 245 70 on monday as investors looked for some calm in the storm and couldn t find it in either stock or the bond markets so far this year the dow jones has fallen 11 3 percent and most fashion companies have taken an even bigger step back from the latest darling to leaders of industry allbirds inc is down 67 3 percent while under armour is off 46 8 percent and companies as diverse as pvh corp vf corp kering moncler hermès international capri holdings and nike inc have all lost at least a third of their value so far in 2022 complicating the picture is the american consumer who has hung on despite it all and by many measures is still spending away particularly among the more well to do shoppers the bank of america institute s latest consumer checkpoint study found that credit and debit card spending per household was up 23 7 percent last month overall transactions were up 8 percent year over year a more normalized indication of overall consumer health bank of america said last week but the study also had two callouts that could be significant for fashion bank of america found that the big swing to spending on goods over services has substantially reversed as the economy emerges from the latest pandemic wave marking a renewal of the tug of war between buying goods like fashion and spending on experiences and the study also noted lower income average spending growth appears to have flattened over recent weeks but this may represent usual seasonality the slowdown in spending for lower income shoppers could be a canary in the inflation coal mine that ultimately impacts the broader economy forecaster craig johnson president of customer growth partners is seeing similar trends a generally strong consumer profile that nonetheless is showing cracks on the lower end as inflation wreaks its havoc johnson noted that nominal incomes are up and that household balance sheets are up carrying 1 3 trillion in dry powder that s ready to spend when you dig down in some of the household demographic subsectors that s when you see a bifurcation johnson said noting that higher end consumers in the upper three quintiles are sailing right along they may be in fact spending a little more but the picture is changing among consumers in the bottom two income quintiles we are seeing a clear pullback in their spending johnson said we re not sure this has showed up in the government statistics yet but we re seeing it ourselves higher end consumers have much more wiggle room in their finances and johnson said are less vulnerable now to any wealth effect from the declining stock market since the job market is so strong so as upper tier and luxe companies are continuing to expand further down the line income scale inflation and especially gas prices is starting to take a toll according to aaa the price of a gallon of regular has soared to 4 33 up from 2 96 a year ago and there are predictions that as the summer driving season approaches gasoline prices could go even higher johnson said that change in gas prices is taking about 15 billion away from retail sales a month if you have companies that are sort of in the middle range like a kohl s or a j c penney the phenomenon that we re seeing is that there s a trade down effect from those places to the lower end johnson said but there s not a trade down from the upper two quintiles the macy s and nordstrom shoppers into the kohl s and the j c penney s in a normal time that kind of shift in the consumer and potentially big losses for the midtier would be enough to keep the retail and fashion crowd on their toes but these are not normal times as adidas chief rorsted told analysts the reality is that we re operating in a very dynamic environment with heightened uncertainty the devastating war in ukraine the continued challenging market environment in greater china covid 19 related restrictions in the east supply chain challenges and inflationary pressure have left their mark on our first quarter results and they will continue to be leaving their mark on our business in 2022 the ceo said covid 19 lockdowns are now affecting 45 large cities in china dinging the company s business there but he asserted that the 80 percent of the adidas business from europe to north america and latin america to other parts of asia is slated to grow by double digits this year on the other side of the atlantic under

it s walking up to scenes like this that are keeping parents up at night walgreens cvs target sam s costco all of those and they re all out of stock are hard to get julia frankie lives in oviedo and tells me her whole family is on the hunt for formula for her four month old son mason because of the current shortage i actually just drove 20 minutes away from my house last night to get small can of formula for him julia started mason on similac formula at two months old because her breast milk was in short supply but then recall on similac and other formulas combined with supply chain issues exacerbating the shortage it s lot of anxiety wondering if you re going to be able to continue to feed your kids this is for gassy babies dr selma al faqih owner of nana pediatric center says families should check with their pediatrician since they can get samples shipped and another piece of advice lot of store brands carry the exact same formulas and that s what may be lot of parents are not aware of meanwhile parents may wonder if they can dilute their formula so it lasts longer al faqih ways in absolutely no noise diluting formula when you dilute the formula and i have seen this the babies end up getting too much water and they can end up having low salt in their body leading to seizures dr al faqih also advises against making your own formula using goat s milk or importing concoctions found online this is parents like julia are just trying to take it day by day it s kind of like with covid with the hand sanitizer and toilet paper and all that kind of stuff that seems like it s starting to move that direction with formula now with no end of the shortage and site in orlando marlin martinez west two news advertisement the baby formula supply problem is getting worse here s why share copy link copy for months stores nationwide have been struggling to stock enough baby formula manufacturers say they re producing at full capacity and making as much formula as they can but it s still not enough to meet current demand the out of stock rate for baby formula hovered between 2 and 8 in the first half of 2021 but began rising sharply last july between november 2021 and early april 2022 the out of stock rate jumped to 31 data from datasembly showed that rate increased another 9 percentage points in just three weeks in april and now stands at 40 the statistics show in six states iowa south dakota north dakota missouri texas and tennessee more than half of baby formula was completely sold out during the week starting april 24 datasembly said and although seven states had between 40 50 of baby formula products out of stock as of early april 26 states are now struggling with supply this issue has been compounded by supply chain issues product recalls and historic inflation datasembly ceo ben reich said unfortunately given the unprecedented amount of volatility to the category we anticipate baby formula to continue to be one of the most affected products in the market cvs and walgreens confirmed that it is limiting customers nationwide to three toddler and infant formulas per transaction we continue to work diligently with our supplier partners to best meet customer demands walgreens said in a statement to cnn business a target spokesperson confirmed that the retailer has limited baby formula purchases to four units per customer for online purchases there is no limit on the number of units that can be bought in person in target stores the company said customers shared images on social media of walmart imposing similar constraints on its sales of baby formula though walmart did not confirm if it was a nationwide policy images shared with cnn business show empty shelves where baby formula should be and a sign saying only five units were allowed per customer walmart did not immediately respond to a request for comment from cnn business the shortage has been exacerbated by the food and drug administration s shutdown of an abbott nutrition facility in sturgis michigan abbott is a major producer of baby formula in february the u s food and drug administration recalled three brands of powdered baby formulas made by the company due to potential bacterial infections including salmonella the agency advised parents not to buy or use certain batches of similac alimentum and elecare powdered infant formulas all abbott brands a former employee of abbott nutrition filed a whistleblower complaint with the fda months before the recall documenting their concerns that the company was hiding safety problems at its sturgis mich plant the formulas manufactured at the facility were recalled after four infants drinking it had fallen ill with rare infections caused by cronobacter sakazakii bacteria two infants died the complaint said abbott said the former employee was fired because of serious violations of abbott s food safety policies and that it will investigate new allegations after dismissal the former employee through their attorney has made evolving new and escalating allegations to multiple authorities an abbott spokesperson said in a statement the abbott spokesperson also said that products tested for cronobacter sakazakii and salmonella all came back negative and that no salmonella was found at the sturgis facility during the investigation the cronobacter sakazakii that was found in environmental testing during the investigation was in non product contact areas of our sturgis facility and has not been linked to the two available patient samples or any other known infant illness the spokesperson said finding standard formula has become difficult for parents many of whom described the extraordinary lengths they ve gone to in order to score even a single can or bottle specialized formula is even harder to locate amid the widespread shortage parents are driving to neighboring states to try their luck and many are pleading for help on social media imploring strangers to share or even barter any extra supply they may have abbott told cnn in a statement saturday it is working closely with the fda to resume operations in its michigan plant we continue to make progress on corrective actions and will be implementing additional actions as we work toward addressing items related to the recent recall in the meantime we are working to increase the supply of infant formula by prioritizing infant formula production at our facilities that provide product to the u s market abbott said in a statement to cnn business

esg that are increasingly guiding investors preferences and decisions globally for more news updates past and future apa group highlights sustainability apa group apa is heavily exposed to brown infrastructure but the company used its investor day to highlight the role of gas as a transition fuel its green ambitions and esg credentials in a bid to reassure investors social and governance metrics highlighted during apa group s investor day brokers examine decarbonisation prospects the race between renewables investment and stranded assets by sarah mills apa group s apa annual investor day focused on the company s sustainability initiatives a fear point for investors and morgan stanley and ord minnett took the opportunity to examine apa s esg exposures and reporting progress in particular the company highlighted the important role it believes gas will play in the green transition management unveils esg metrics starting with announcements the company has implemented board level accountability for climate change health safety environment and heritage issues including first nation s engagement and has undertaken to provide interim decarbonisation targets at it fy22 result management revealed several esg metrics particularly social and governance metrics the company reports 40 female board and senior management representation 50 female graduate intern apprentice intake an increase in parenting leave a 65 rise in employee engagement and the company has built in first nations kpis into employment and supply chain kpis in recent construction contracts morgan stanley notes the company does not yet report on its waste recycling water usage or net contribution to biodiversity it says the company is in the third tertile for gender diversity compared with sector and regional peers but fails to specify whether that is upper third or the lower third brokers examine decarbonisation prospects the company owns and operates australia s largest natural gas infrastructure and other energy infrastructure assets such as gas storage and wind farms morgan stanley notes that while apa group derives 95 of earnings ebitda from fossil fuel infrastructure methane in particular the company s future investment is being directed towards the transition sustainable products currently generate about 4 of earnings the company is building stakes in hydrogen renewables and onshore and offshore electricity transmission and is highly leveraged to the orderliness a euphemism of the use of gas as transition fuel of the energy transition notes morgan stanley so investors no doubt will be pinning their hopes on the manifestation of said orderliness much will depend on the pace of the transition as well while gas has been included in the european taxonomy it was a reluctant admission and should the investment in renewables accelerate sharply gas will be one of the first ugly ducklings to be turfed from the nest ord minnett says management highlighted the important role gas will play in the transition and the company s ability to leverage these opportunities the broker says the company pointed to the uk as an example of a disorderly transition where poor gas availability combined with low renewables generation had sharply boosted energy prices for consumers apa believes its brown assets gas pipeline are well positioned to meet transition demands and to ensure an orderly transmission and expects its growing suite of renewable power and transmission assets will also serve it well management also aims to link re contracting and growth opportunities to the transition race between new investment and stranded assets this suggests apa group is embarking on a delicate balancing act one in which analysts appear to believe it will succeed the company is eyeing new energy infrastructure developments in australia and possibly north america ord minnett says no information was provided on a potential us acquisition which the company has been working on for three years but the company remains confident of finding a suitable prospect and considers valuations to be reasonably attractive compared to australia morgan stanley believes the company enjoys a considerable competitive advantage in procurement and approvals add to that apa group s strong free cash flow solid balance sheet and the large market for energy transition investment not to mention the willingness of capital to be directed to green investment and the broker is modestly confident the transition strategy will be sufficient to mitigate the risk of stranded assets and to ensure apa group can continue to access capital which is increasingly esg oriented the analyst also considers the commercial benefits of apa group s esg performance are underappreciated brokers have their say meanwhile morgan stanley notes the share prices has rallied 13 this year which compares with a flat performance for toll roads and airports the closest peers and retains an equal weight rating industry view cautious and 10 00 target price the broker appreciates the company s defensive and diversified earnings base and balance sheet the company s risk reward profile falls in the middle of the broker s utilities and infrastructure stock coverage rising global interest rates remain a risk as does esg sentiment valuation regulatory changes shipping recontracting and large corporate activity ord minnett notes apa management reiterated that 80 to 90 of revenue is linked to the consumer price index lending strong defensive characteristics in the current market believing the company s finances could benefit from rising inflation the broker retains a hold recommendation and 10 50 target price all up in the fnarena database apa group is enjoying four hold ratings with

and mortgage rates are up and the economy actually shrank in the first three months of this year is the united states at risk of enduring another recession just two years after emerging from the last one for now even the more pessimistic economists don t foresee any imminent downturn at least not before next year ap photo tony dejak washington ap inflation is at a 40 year high stock prices are sinking the federal reserve is making borrowing much costlier and the economy actually shrank in the first three months of this year is the united states at risk of enduring another recession just two years after emerging from the last one for now even the more pessimistic economists don t expect a downturn anytime soon despite the inflation squeeze consumers the primary driver of the economy are still spending at a healthy pace businesses are investing in equipment and software reflecting a positive outlook and the job market is more robust than it s been in years with hiring strong layoffs way down and many employers desperate for more workers yet several worrisome developments in recent weeks suggest that the risk of recession may be rising high inflation has proved far more stubborn than many economists had expected russia s invasion of ukraine has exacerbated global food and energy prices extreme lockdowns in china over covid 19 are worsening supply shortages and when federal reserve chairman jerome powell spoke at a news conference last week he reinforced the central bank s determination to do whatever it might take to curb inflation including raising interest rates so high as to weaken the economy if that happens the fed could potentially trigger a recession perhaps in the second half of next year economists say by mid 2023 the fed s benchmark short term rate which affects many consumer and business loans could reach levels not seen in 15 years analysts say the u s economy which has thrived for years on the fuel of ultra low borrowing costs might not be able to withstand the impact of much higher rates recession risks are low now but elevated in 2023 as inflation could force the fed to hike until it hurts ethan harris global economist at bank of america said in a note to clients the nation s unemployment rate is at a near half century low of 3 6 and employers are posting a record high number of open jobs so what might cause an economy with such a healthy labor market to suffer a recession here s what the path to an eventual downturn could look like the fed s rate hikes are sure to slow spending in areas that require consumers to borrow with housing the most visible example the average rate on a 30 year fixed mortgage has already jumped to 5 25 the highest level since 2009 a year ago the average was below 3 home sales have fallen in response and so have mortgage applications a sign that sales will keep slowing a similar trend could occur in other markets for cars appliances and furniture for example borrowing costs for businesses are rising as reflected in increased yields on corporate bonds at some point those higher rates could weaken business investment if companies pull back on buying new equipment or expanding capacity they will also start to slow hiring falling stock prices may discourage affluent households who collectively hold the bulk of america s stock wealth from spending as much on vacation travel home renovations or new appliances broad stock indexes have tumbled for five straight weeks falling share prices also tend to diminish the ability of corporations to expand rising caution among companies and consumers about spending freely could further slow hiring or even lead to layoffs if the economy were to lose jobs and the public were to grow more fearful consumers would pull back further on spending the consequences of high inflation would worsen this scenario wage growth adjusted for inflation would slow and leave americans with even less purchasing power though a weaker economy would eventually reduce inflation until then high prices could hinder consumer spending eventually the slowdown would feed on itself with layoffs mounting as economic growth slowed leading consumers to increasingly cut back out of concern that they too might lose their jobs the clearest sign that a recession might be nearing economists say would be a steady rise in job losses and a surge in unemployment as a rule of thumb an increase in the unemployment rate of three tenths of a percentage point on average over the previous three months has meant a recession will eventually follow many economists also monitor changes in the interest payments or yields on different bonds for a recession signal known as an inverted yield curve this occurs when the yield on the 10 year treasury falls below the yield on a short term treasury such as the 3 month t bill that is unusual because longer term bonds typically pay investors a richer yield in exchange for tying up their money for a longer period inverted yield curves generally mean investors expect a recession will occur and will compel the fed to slash rates inverted curves often predate recessions still it can take as long as 18 or 24 months for the downturn to arrive after the yield curve inverts a very brief inversion occurred last month when the yield on the 2 year treasury fell below the 10 year yield yet most economists downplayed it because it was short lived many analysts also say that comparing the 3 month yield to the 10 year has a better track record those rates are not close to inverting now at his news conference last week powell said the fed s goal was to raise rates to cool borrowing and spending so that companies would reduce their huge number of job openings in turn powell hopes companies won t have to raise pay as much thereby easing inflation pressures but without significant job losses or an outright recession we have a good chance to have a soft or soft ish landing powell said but i ll say i do expect that this will be very challenging it s not going to be easy though economists say it s possible for the fed to succeed most also say they re skeptical that the central bank can tame such high inflation without eventually derailing the economy that s never been done before said peter hooper deutsche bank s global head of economic research it would be remarkable if the fed is able to achieve it deutsche bank economists think the fed will have to raise its key rate to at least 3 6 by mid 2023 enough to cause a recession by the end of that year still hooper suggested that the recession would prove relatively mild with unemployment rising to only about 5 karen dynan a harvard economics professor and a former top economist at the treasury department also said she thought a recession if there is one would likely be mild american families are in much better financial shape than they were before the extended 2008 2009 great recession when plunging home prices and lost jobs ruined many households finances considerably more people have some financial cushion dynan said even if it does take a recession to bring down inflation it probably won t have to be a deep or long one people wear

tells me her whole family is on the hunt for formula for her four month old son mason because of the current shortage i actually just drove 20 minutes away from my house last night to get small can of formula for him julia started mason on similac formula at two months old because her breast milk was in short supply but then recall on similac and other formulas combined with supply chain issues exacerbating the shortage it s lot of anxiety wondering if you re going to be able to continue to feed your kids this is for gassy babies dr selma al faqih owner of nana pediatric center says families should check with their pediatrician since they can get samples shipped and another piece of advice lot of store brands carry the exact same formulas and that s what may be lot of parents are not aware of meanwhile parents may wonder if they can dilute their formula so it lasts longer al faqih ways in absolutely no noise diluting formula when you dilute the formula and i have seen this the babies end up getting too much water and they can end up having low salt in their body leading to seizures dr al faqih also advises against making your own formula using goat s milk or importing concoctions found online this is parents like julia are just trying to take it day by day it s kind of like with covid with the hand sanitizer and toilet paper and all that kind of stuff that seems like it s starting to move that direction with formula now with no end of the shortage and site in orlando marlin martinez west two news advertisement the baby formula supply problem is getting worse here s why share copy link copy for months stores nationwide have been struggling to stock enough baby formula manufacturers say they re producing at full capacity and making as much formula as they can but it s still not enough to meet current demand the out of stock rate for baby formula hovered between 2 and 8 in the first half of 2021 but began rising sharply last july between november 2021 and early april 2022 the out of stock rate jumped to 31 data from datasembly showed that rate increased another 9 percentage points in just three weeks in april and now stands at 40 the statistics show in six states iowa south dakota north dakota missouri texas and tennessee more than half of baby formula was completely sold out during the week starting april 24 datasembly said and although seven states had between 40 50 of baby formula products out of stock as of early april 26 states are now struggling with supply this issue has been compounded by supply chain issues product recalls and historic inflation datasembly ceo ben reich said unfortunately given the unprecedented amount of volatility to the category we anticipate baby formula to continue to be one of the most affected products in the market cvs and walgreens confirmed that it is limiting customers nationwide to three toddler and infant formulas per transaction we continue to work diligently with our supplier partners to best meet customer demands walgreens said in a statement to cnn business a target spokesperson confirmed that the retailer has limited baby formula purchases to four units per customer for online purchases there is no limit on the number of units that can be bought in person in target stores the company said customers shared images on social media of walmart imposing similar constraints on its sales of baby formula though walmart did not confirm if it was a nationwide policy images shared with cnn business show empty shelves where baby formula should be and a sign saying only five units were allowed per customer walmart did not immediately respond to a request for comment from cnn business the shortage has been exacerbated by the food and drug administration s shutdown of an abbott nutrition facility in sturgis michigan abbott is a major producer of baby formula in february the u s food and drug administration recalled three brands of powdered baby formulas made by the company due to potential bacterial infections including salmonella the agency advised parents not to buy or use certain batches of similac alimentum and elecare powdered infant formulas all abbott brands a former employee of abbott nutrition filed a whistleblower complaint with the fda months before the recall documenting their concerns that the company was hiding safety problems at its sturgis mich plant the formulas manufactured at the facility were recalled after four infants drinking it had fallen ill with rare infections caused by cronobacter sakazakii bacteria two infants died the complaint said abbott said the former employee was fired because of serious violations of abbott s food safety policies and that it will investigate new allegations after dismissal the former employee through their attorney has made evolving new and escalating allegations to multiple authorities an abbott spokesperson said in a statement the abbott spokesperson also said that products tested for cronobacter sakazakii and salmonella all came back negative and that no salmonella was found at the sturgis facility during the investigation the cronobacter sakazakii that was found in environmental testing during the investigation was in non product contact areas of our sturgis facility and has not been linked to the two available patient samples or any other known infant illness the spokesperson said finding standard formula has become difficult for parents many of whom described the extraordinary lengths they ve gone to in order to score even a single can or bottle specialized formula is even harder to locate amid the widespread shortage parents are driving to neighboring states to try their luck and many are pleading for help on social media imploring strangers to share or even barter any extra supply they may have abbott told cnn in a statement saturday it is working closely with the fda to resume operations in its michigan plant we continue to make progress on corrective actions and will be implementing additional actions as we work toward addressing items related to the recent recall in the meantime we are working to increase the supply of infant formula by prioritizing infant formula production at our facilities that provide product to the u s market abbott said in a statement to cnn business
