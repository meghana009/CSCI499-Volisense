with china emerging as a major economic power being the second largest economy after the united states it has become a country of tremendous influence in the global economy and financial markets in the last decade it has contributed more than 30 to global economic growth according to reports the central banks around the world are increasing yuan holdings in their reserves as china while its economic might grows wants its money to replace the us dollar as global currency and the bangladesh bank is following suit the bangladesh bank has been building up the share of yuan in its foreign exchange reserve cutting down the share of dollar as the chinese currency is gaining acceptance faster in global markets for international payments as an alternative to the greenback the share of yuan in bangladesh s foreign exchange reserve increased to 1 32 in august this year from 1 in 2017 when the dominating us dollar reserve fell significantly to 75 from 81 during the period according to bangladesh bank data other reserve currencies have also seen a surge for instance the euro is the second highest reserve currency and the share of euro holdings increased to 5 in august this year from 3 84 in 2017 while the share of the pound increased to 4 4 from 3 43 according to central bank data the share of yuan has been growing steadily in the country s foreign exchange reserve after the chinese currency was included in the special drawing rights sdr currency basket of the international monetary fund imf in 2016 the bangladesh bank declared yuan as approved currency for reserve holding some time after and started to build up the share of chinese currency in the reserve aiming to facilitate foreign investors amid rising business engagement with china as of august 2022 528 million retained as yuan remained invested in the chinese financial market the figure was 323 million in january 2017 according to the bangladesh bank meanwhile china has offered currency swap agreement between the bangladesh bank and the people s bank of china its central bank for using both renminbi and taka as currencies of pricing and settlement in bilateral trade in a letter sent on 19 august this year the embassy of china in dhaka said a currency swap agreement will help to mitigate foreign exchange rate risk and reduce the cost of foreign exchange transactions when contacted a senior executive of the bangladesh bank said they are working positively on this issue as chinese currency is now internationally convertible and bangladesh is holding yuan in reserve it will be easier to go for currency swap he said china is the top trading partner of bangladesh in terms of import the total import from china was tk1 lakh crore in fy21 and exports from bangladesh to the country was tk4 804 crore the imf included the yuan in its sdr basket as a fifth currency along with the us dollar the euro the japanese yen and the british pound the inclusion in the sdr basket means yuan is now an internationally convertible currency at present chinese yuan ranks third in terms of weight in the sdr basket after the us dollar and the euro the sdr short for special drawing rights is an international reserve asset supplementing members official reserves which can be exchanged among governments for freely usable currencies in times of need after inclusion of the yuan in the sdr china strengthened its effort to promote the internationalisation of the yuan and the opening up of its financial market to attract foreign investors to invest in the chinese market as part of promoting its currency china has largely moved away from giving loans in dollars to the yuan when it comes to financial assistance to bangladesh its loan commitment in yuan has more than doubled in four years from fy17 to fy20 while disbursement in yuan has increased by more than seven times china emerged as one of the biggest sources of funds entering into the top development partner list of bangladesh at the time the share of china in total foreign aid increased to 11 2 in fy21 securing the sixth highest bilateral development partner position of bangladesh a tremendous growth considering that funding from china was zero after independence china s commitment in yuan more than quadrupled in 2016 17 from the previous year mainly riding on three projects construction of a tunnel under the river karnaphuli dasherkandi sewage treatment plan and procurement of six vessels in 2018 19 china disbursed all of its assistance in yuan completely bypassing the dollar direct investment by chinese firms in related projects was worth 15 billion last year a quarter of which was in yuan china now settles 15 of its foreign trade in the currency up from 11 in 2015 how yuan is emerging as global reserve currency some 85 of central banks say they have invested or are mulling investing in yuan up from 81 a year ago according to the ubs asset management s annual reserve manager survey released in july this year ubs asset management americas inc is a full service asset manager providing investment and sub advisory services to individual investors financial advisors and institutions in the us foreign exchange managers at central banks on average expect to hold 5 8 of their reserves in yuan in the 10 year time up from 5 7 last year that would be a significant increase from the 2 9 level reported by the imf as of june 2022 central banks share of us dollar holdings stood at 63 on average according to the survey down from 69 in the previous year but the ubs said fewer latin american banks which typically hold more dollars were surveyed this year according to media reports more than 81 of respondents to the ubs survey said yuan will benefit from a shift to a multipolar world some 46 said the dollar will benefit in a sign of the asset s appeal during times of economic or geopolitical tension

we first identified all firms registered with the sec in the country next we filtered out firms that don t offer financial planning services those that don t primarily serve individual clients and those that have disclosures on their record the qualifying firms were then ranked according to the following criteria aum firms with more total assets under management are ranked higher firms with more total assets under management are ranked higher individual client count firms that serve more individual clients as opposed to institutional clients are ranked higher firms that serve more individual clients as opposed to institutional clients are ranked higher clients per advisor firms with a lower ratio of clients per financial advisor are ranked higher firms with a lower ratio of

s more important now than ever to review your retirement plan with a fiduciary financial advisor here s why the pandemic has shown us just how quickly decades of planning investing and saving can be completely upended this could mean your current financial plan might leave you without enough money to last your retirement additionally emotionally charged decisions to sell off large quantities of stocks or other investments now lock in your losses removing any chance for future growth research suggests people who work with a financial advisor feel more at ease about their finances and could end up with about 15 more money to spend in retirement 1 consider this example a recent vanguard study found that on average a hypothetical 500k investment would grow to over 3 4 million under the care of an advisor over 25 years whereas the expected value from self management would be 1 69 million or 50 less in other words an advisor managed portfolio would average 8 annualized growth over a 25 year period compared to 5 from a self managed portfolio 2 a 2020 northwestern mutual study found that 71 of u s adults admit their financial planning needs improvement however only 29 of americans work with a financial advisor 3 assuming 5 annualized growth of 500k portfolio vs 8 annualized growth of advisor managed portfolio over 25 years the hypothetical study discussed above assumes a 5 net

win wearing an oscar gold dress with a long train and seated in the middle of the front row olivia colman seated much further back is announced the winner and seems genuinely discombobulated that it s her and not glenn my greatest surprise and reward is when my lifelong idol barbra streisand comes on to introduce the best picture nomination and is given a standing ovation just for being here after the awards there s a celebrity cattle crush to get into the ballroom to finally eat something unbeknownst to me oilly spots the sequined black beret that streisand is wearing some distance ahead alerts melissa who then grabs my arm richard s daughter who he affectionately calls oilly attended the ceremony with him instead of his wife barbra meet richard well swaziboy you didn t win that little gold guy tonight but this is the golden moment to top all of your goldens my iphone aloft and flashing before i ve even secured her actual permission as we chat along with others she notices that the large art deco lozenge shaped brooch strategically placed in the middle of her chest has come unfixed and she is now futzing to get it reattached need my glasses may i help sure swaziboy is now on his knees leaning in and taking his sweet time to get his fingers dexterously around that rogue pin and making sure it s reattached veeeeeeeery s l o w l y thanks you re very polite stay another ten minutes then excuse myself to find oilly who shakes her head and says just as well mum s not here olivia colman whispers up and says amy adams and i are having a lock up later please come try stopping me olivia s oscar is passed around and posed with amy adams is doing karaoke and there s a cram of us queuing to make fools of ourselves mic in my hand and belting out bowie s life on mars with abandon i clock that oilly has her head in her hands dawn by the time we crawl back into the hotel wednesday september 1 2021 richard and joan at the rhs chelsea flower show 2019 held at the royal hospital chelsea in london the doctor who visits joan tells me he has rarely come across such levels of determination do you mind my asking if your wife is a very strong willed person he says that s an understatement i reply as he s leaving the district nurse notices that joan s breathing has become much shallower and closer to the end she might die tonight what do i do call the out of hours district nurse and one of the team will come out to certify that she has died then it s your call to get in touch with a funeral director she manages to tell me all of this in a simultaneously pragmatic and compassionate tone as she drives away i start shaking uncontrollably it s one thing to be grown up and practical when a stranger is giving you instructions but another feeling entirely when the impact of what they re advising hits you with such meteoric force return to joan s bedside and hold her hand with my left while scrolling through local funeral directors on my iphone with my right truly feel that my joan has left us in spirit already and it s only her body that is struggling on beside me thursday september 2 joan doesn t wake properly apart from the odd eye flicker sit stroking her hand and talking softly about some of the daft things we ve done at 7pm her breathing slows quite suddenly keep repeating it s all okay my angel don t hold on we all love you so so so much after each intake of breath the gap until the next inhalation gets longer at 7 25 i thought that her hand felt like it was cooling in mine richard sadly lost his beloved wife joan on september 2 last year was i just imagining this no it is getting colder do i let go of her hand and call oilly to come can t let go now then another breath and count the seconds before the next one none comes she died at 7 30pm let go of her hand and call out for oilly to come quickly feels like my heart is going to explode out of my chest such is the intensity of this grief even though we had warning that this was imminent even though we knew that her time was terminally measured out in months weeks and days even though we knew all of this nothing can properly prepare us for this moment friday september 3 moment my eyes opened was hit by a tsunami of grief so overwhelming i felt like i would drown her handbag is next to our bed as is her tapestry kit with the needle and thread waiting for her next move make up on the chest of drawers with a lipstick that s no longer needed her pile of bedside books her handwriting in her book of crossword puzzles all hers and yet no her here any more condolences come in from everywhere kevin kline and phoebe cates call from new york we ve only just heard how can this be joining the chorus of disbelief from people we haven t heard from or seen for ages saturday september 4 cannot quite compute the thousands of messages we ve received and the plethora of flowers on every available surface and outside the front door oilly looks at me then plaintively asks can you ever run out of tears dadda wednesday september 8 the day before joan s funeral woke up at dawn to help with the delivery and storage of all the catering kit tables crockery cutlery glasses teacups and urns to feed and water 80 guests how can we be preparing a tea party in her honour and she s not here to enjoy it all mowed the lawn then drove over to a florist in cirencester and bought their entire stock of joan s favourite lilies to cover her casket back at the cottage a huge bouquet has been delivered from the prince of wales and duchess of cornwall with a four page deeply empathetic handwritten letter from prince charles oilly and i read it together sitting on a bench at a carwash somewhat different from where the future king composed his letter at birkhall on the balmoral estate thursday september 9 the four minutes that follow the end of the funeral service are the most intensely pain filled of my life as the music crescendoed i got up and stood beside her coffin held on to it then moved up to the head and wept my final farewell to the woman i have loved unequivocally and completely for almost four decades despite the rain everyone trooped back to our cottage signed the condolence book ate drank reminisced and celebrated her life autumn 2021 it s the sheer aloneness of being alone whoever and however many people you meet and play with you return alone sitting solo in the pub for sunday lunch knowing what joan would have ordered her murmured commentary on the clientele identifying their accents that person s clothing and this person s speed of eating all of this going through my mind the absence of her feels blinding back in london and going through her things oilly and i discover that joan has kept everything all of oilly s kindergarten drawings school reports prizes photos and birthday cards hidden in a wooden trunk she really is proud of me pops monday november 1 2021 posted a video on social media today is our posthumous 35th wedding anniversary what s so incomprehensible is that we can never touch or talk to one another ever again we just have to count on the feeling that the love goes on accompanied by

have lost and loved or who long for love returning to our country cottage where we d spent the past 18 months together is bracing it s utterly country winter night silent here no distant urban hum just a kind of white noise in your ears no matter how many lunch and dinner arrangements are made calls texts or emails received nothing can protect you from this silence how to get through it after our 38 year conversation where nothing was too trivial to talk about who said this and what do you think was meant by that and how much did this cost and can you believe what he did to her and why the hell did those two ever get married and why is it that with some couples you love one of them but loathe the other and did you see what he ate has she had a stroke or is that botox and do you reckon they still have sex where shall we go tomorrow or shall we just stay at home get a takeaway or have our beloved beans on toast with marmite instead of butter us we let s now it s solitary single solo

maria bartiromo this morning on fox news got emotional as she recounted her experience on 9 11 and in the days after her vivid personal account is really very gripping and very moving it s a pretty stark contrast with some other comments today her heartfelt emotion and sincerity come through and it will get to you she doesn t make it about domestic foes she remembers who the adversaries were and what the terrible day meant to all of us but you cannot help but think after seeing this about the domestic foes today not because they are the same as the islamic terrorists who acted out of fanaticism lust for power and infamy and hatred of religious freedom no you can t help but think of them because they do say and are saying that about us i mean compare hillary s response to dana bash to what maria bartiromo says here hillary walking through the city for photo ops versus maria on the floor of the stock exchange hillary politicking while america was hurting hillary making it about trump now maria still making it about what happened that day and after twenty one years later her perspective remains hillary and biden aren t literal terrorists that doesn t mean they aren t evil it means they didn t fly planes into the twin towers neither of them would make the same concession about maria though they absolutely compare maria to those terrorists and even want you to believe maria is worse pretty stark contrast alright

financial literacy and economic development go hand in hand this is especially true for emerging countries such as the philippines financial literacy is integral to ensuring the sustainability of an economy in the future with various market forces affecting global and regional economies we must prepare ourselves and become knowledgeable on financial issues and information that can empower us and enable us to make the right financial decisions and protect our investments unfortunately financial literacy in the philippines is an almost foreign concept to the majority of our nation s citizens with only 25 of the filipino population being able to answer financial literacy questions through surveys this is generally alarming since financial literacy plays an integral part in ensuring the sustainability of the philippine economy in this article we ll talk about what financial literacy is why it s important for today s workforce and how organizations companies and even educational institutions can promote financial literacy in the philippines what is financial literacy in a broad sense financial literacy refers to the ability of individuals to effectively apply financial skills for efficient budgeting investment and management of personal finances while financial literacy is an important factor in every filipino s life this is especially crucial for the middle class and workforce with financial literacy heavily dictating how they re able to have a positive relationship with money in connection to owned businesses educational support and retirement without financial literacy one cannot make important decisions regarding investment savings borrowing and most certainly about insurance indeed it has been found for example that lack of understanding of interest rates has placed creditors at risk what is the state of financial literacy in the philippines today numerous studies and surveys that tackle financial literacy in the filipino population yielded almost the same results with the majority of filipinos having no concrete grasp on financial management one of these surveys was conducted s p an international credit rating agency that produces financial research s p conducted its 2014 s p rating services global financial literacy survey touted to be the most extensive measurement of global financial literacy to date and discovered that the philippines ranked in the bottom 30 of 144 countries surveyed only 25 percent of adult filipinos are literate on the basics of finance the survey was conducted by interviewing 150 000 adults throughout 144 countries on four basic financial concepts numeracy interest risk diversification inflation and compound interest the study was conducted with the participation of the gallup world poll the world bank and the global financial literacy excellence center gflec based at george washington university among the surprising findings is that two thirds of adults worldwide are financially illiterate and that only one third of adults worldwide are financially literate this means that around 3 5 billion adults worldwide are financially illiterate it also noted that those most likely to be financially illiterate are women the poor and the less educated men were found to be more literate 35 percent than women 30 percent interestingly the study found that those availing themselves of financial services such as those of banks and credit card companies would most likely have higher financial literacy regardless of wealth or educational attainment nonetheless the study concluded that generally the rich have better financial skills than the poor interestingly also financial literacy increases as income increases and educational attainment goes higher another astonishing finding is that financial literacy improves from general proficiency in mathematics this is also evident in the prevalence of formal savings in filipino households according to the statistics only a dismal 40 of adult filipinos save of those who save 68 keep their saved money at home 33 keep their money in formal financial institutions 7 5 save through cooperatives and 2 6 keep their money in group savings or paluwagan however the blame should not be put entirely on the population since access to banks and formal financial institutions are scarce in some areas in the philippines as of 2014 per bangko sentral ng pilipinas bsp data 595 municipalities in the country have no banks this is out of a total of 1 490 municipalities in the country this is notwithstanding the fact that domestic banking offices increased from 7 585 in 2001 to 10 315 by the end of december 2014 a significant increase can also be observed in the distribution of automated teller machines which grew from 3 882 in 2001 to 15 562 by the end of december 2014 so while financial knowledge may be easily disseminated throughout the filipino population a significant percentage of the population will still be unable to effectively use the best practices in financial literacy in the philippines this goes to show that financial literacy needs to co exist with better banking accessibility for it to be practiced in full why is financial literacy important in the philippines today a significant number of filipinos are still easily swindled from their hard earned money through various elaborate scams these include high yielding pyramid scams that do not hold a solid asset base to generate expected returns financial misinformation can create a ripple effect that can destroy individual savings households financial institutions and potentially economies the most obvious solution to this financial problem however is to promote financial literacy on different levels regardless of a person s social status and income level through financial literacy programs in the philippines filipinos can learn how to build effective financial plans manage savings and expenses and build both short term and long term financial goals including retirement planning life insurance and pension funds which can strongly support the maturing portion of the population through improved financial literacy in the philippines filipinos can also achieve financial independence through smart investments as well as demand better financial services and conditions for loans and lines of credit on a larger scale it can increase domestic savings rates and foster an environment of financial inclusion which can allow us to increase domestic productivity in a more sustainable manner and create a dramatic shift from being consumption driven to becoming an investment driven economy how can we promote financial literacy in the philippines fortunately both government and private institutions are well on the way to promoting financial literacy citiseconline and bpi securities provide free seminars on investing in the stock market to educate retail investors in the same manner local shows like on the money in anc features a wide range of investment topics financial instruments and guest experts that share their knowledge with viewers on the basics of spending and investing likewise we at finex also contribute to financial literacy by working hand in hand with the government and other private sector representatives hosting a series of seminars that aim to increase financial education of the public to promote financial inclusion and sustainable growth for private companies financial literacy may be a secondary goal to your organization s vision of providing a thriving culture to your employees as of the moment the most common concern of an employee in terms of finances pertains to retirement collaborative research made by bank of america and merrill lynch in 2015 showed that workers responded

mills the continued rally for the stock market looks reasonably healthy in the short term but it is probably too early to call for the all clear according to jeff mills of bryn mawr trust that 3 900 level on the s p 500 is important technically and the move that we saw off of it has been fairly strong at this point i don t know if it is strong enough to call it a very clear reversal but in terms of the breadth and strength of the bounce it has been reasonably encouraging mills said investor positioning and economic data may have also helped the recent rally mills said but the stubbornly high yields in the treasury market are a cause for skepticism the 10 year treasury yield is up about 4 basis points on monday afternoon trading near 3 364 you saw this in the june rally as well where the market kind of bought into this possibility of a fed pivot or a less difficult outcome for the economy but the bond market never really did and by and large that s what you saw last week as well mills

misplaced expectations of a dovish federal reserve has recently taken a significant hit according to principal global investors chief global strategist seema shah in mid june as oil prices started to decline many investors began to believe that the oncoming peak in inflation would permit the fed to wrap up its rate hiking cycle said shah markets also reasoned that an economic slowdown could prompt the fed to stop monetary tightening early at the jackson hole symposium and since however the fed has been firm in its stance that it will do what it takes to combat high inflation and keep with tightening policy until the job is done the fed s stance is quite clear said shah due to the enormity of the inflation task ahead a weakening economy cannot stand in the way of further monetary tightening and rates will need to remain at a restrictive setting for a prolonged period this means investors need to be prepared for more rate hikes and higher interest rates ahead for investors position portfolios for a more sustained monetary tightening campaign said shah carmen reinicke new york fed survey shows cooling inflation expectations amid falling gas prices a decline in gas prices

bounce siegel says wharton professor jeremy siegel said on squawk box that he thinks the stock market could see some upside surprises from here and one of the main reasons for that is weakening u s

aggressive means the dollar can go down it really it has gone down that s very very important in terms of the foreign earnings siegel said jesse pound inflation has peaked says jpmorgan jpmorgan

likely weigh on stocks adam parker says corporate earnings estimates are still too high and that presents more downside risk for stocks according to trivariate research founder adam parker the second quarter earnings season was a mixed bag for wall street with notable weakness in parts of the retail and tech sectors even as overall numbers largely held up however that bright side may soon disappear parker said the key things to watch will be any signs of margin erosion or inventory builds in the october earnings season our suspicion is that a combination of estimate reductions and a hawkish fed will make for choppy and a potentially lower equity market over the coming weeks parker wrote in a note to clients on sunday parker s base case for downside risk is around 3 700 on the s p

walt disney co chief executive bob chapek has been leading the burbank entertainment giant since february 2020 taking the role just before the covid 19 pandemic shuttered its businesses since then the narratives around chapek s tenure have largely been defined by people other than chapek advertisement the indiana native and three decade disney veteran was judged less by what he was than what he was not e g he was not his revered charismatic predecessor bob iger he took the heat for a high profile legal battle with black widow star scarlett johansson over box office bonuses and most glaringly he let himself get caught between employees who wanted him to speak out forcefully against florida s parental rights in education bill dubbed don t say gay legislation by advocates and conservative politicians and media figures who attacked him when he belatedly did so but now with the backing of disney s board and a recent three year contract extension chapek has an opportunity to turn to a new phase in his reign and close the books on those rocky early days chapek over the weekend hosted thousands of disney fans at his first d23 expo as ceo at the anaheim convention center where the company previewed a bevy of new movies and shows for disney teased james cameron s avatar sequel and movies from marvel studios lucasfilm disney animation and pixar much of the content is designed to boost disney which has 152 million subscribers advertisement i think what this represents now is a chance for me to speak for myself rather than other folks speaking for me and trying to create an identity as to who i am chapek said in an interview at d23 thanks to covid finally being in the rearview mirror it s a little bit liberating that i can speak for myself and show people where i want the company to go company town as chapek weathers disney drama board gathers in florida he has the board s support but disney ceo bob chapek has had a rough time with desantis a slipping stock and concerns about disney how long will he hold on chapek spoke to the times about the possibility of integrating hulu with disney the theatrical movie business and his ideas about how disney can play in the metaverse this interview has been edited and condensed for clarity now that you ve got the three year contract extension do you feel like you ve been able to turn the page on the earlier part of your tenure advertisement my timing was impeccable because i got the job and i think within a week we closed the company that put us in an unfortunate situation not only in terms of my lack of being able to speak for myself in the world because we were all locked down at home but also because of the financial pressures that were put on our operation you have essentially all of your revenue shut down and the heavy debt load from the fox acquisition you re just trying to do what you can for your employee base to try to keep them going so you ve got no money coming in and a lot of money going out i was trying to do this new job from a computer from my home in westlake village and there was a null set i had been in the hollywood business for 19 years on the movie studio side then i spent the last 10 years not doing that so people are like who is this guy so i think what this represents now is a chance for me to speak for myself rather than other folks speaking for me and trying to create an identity as to who i am thanks to covid finally being in the rearview mirror it s a little bit liberating that i can speak for myself and show people where i want the company to go and i think this d23 expo is the perfect place to do that and the 100th anniversary is a perfect catalyst for us to lay out our new strategic direction advertisement after the political firestorm in florida over what critics dubbed the don t say gay bill have you been able to regain the trust of employees the advantage of having 200 000 employees is that we get to listen to 200 000 different points of view it gave me an opportunity to get very close to those folks because we listened we took their points of view into account and we assimilated them into the more modern interpretation of what the walt disney co can be and will be in the future in hindsight it actually acted as a big opportunity to welcome them in the fold take their input and program our business around the needs of all of our constituents the art of this job is to take the needs of all our constituents and blend them together our cast members have always been an important part of that and really for the first time we got to hear their opinions on these things that might have been festering quietly before people felt more comfortable expressing their points of view advertisement disney has had much success iterating on existing franchises do you think the company is doing enough to make sure that it is generating new franchises and ip for the next 100 years well i think if you sit through the animation panel that we had two days ago you ll see that a lot of the ideas are original for us it s about a blend it s about a portfolio in terms of things that do have roots in ip you can look at something like the star wars universe or the marvel universe and i don t think there s any reason for anybody to suggest they might be less than vibrant if you re kevin feige the move to streaming has given you the ability to tell stories in a different way i don t think wandavision ever would have gotten made without a streaming service i don t think the mandalorian gets made without that advertisement we have 11 000 marvel characters we have 11 000 stories to tell we haven t even scratched the surface i don t see that as limiting at all you re making so much stuff exclusively for disney how do theatrical releases for movies fit into your strategy does box office ever return to pre pandemic levels the theatrical business is and always has been an incredibly important part of our overall way to reach consumers and show our films in their absolute best setting we re as committed to theatrical as we always have been part of the reason that we ve completely ramped up on spending on new content is that we want to fully satiate theatrical exhibition as one distribution channel but we ll do that with films that have the highest propensity to succeed in this new world order advertisement we also want to make sure that we have enough content to fully satiate the opportunity in streaming and that is much more than we ever dreamed it was now we re finally getting to a steady state on both and that s a very good thing for us i think theatrical will come back i don t think it ll come back at the same level nor do i think it will come back necessarily in the same way that it s always been i think it s going to be a business driven by blockbusters that s already happened that s already happened we do have huge blockbusters that will live a full life in theatrical exhibition but without the unnecessary requirement of us sitting on an asset for six months waiting for that next window to open up on our films we ve been somewhere in the 30 to 45 day window from theatrical to streaming what s really stood out to me in the panels over the last week is that prior to this filmmakers would almost sheepishly talk about their film going to streaming now there s no sense of that at all they re proud of it it s a completely legitimized distribution channel and guess what they ve now caught up to the consumer advertisement there s a theory that disney has trained consumers to no longer go to theaters because they can just wait 30 or 45 days to see movies on disney it s rhetoric that people like to promote that somehow people don t go to theaters because films are available on disney i don t believe that when a film does over a billion dollars in box office consumers know that it s coming to disney and it s not stopping them are you interested in merging hulu with disney or more closely integrating hulu s more non disney branded content with disney right now you re limited because comcast still owns a stake in hulu which you ll be able to buy out in 2024 or perhaps before advertisement when you ask our disney consumers the no 1 thing they want yes they want more marvel yes they want more star wars but the no 1 thing they really want is more general entertainment and once we we will be able to entertain questions like that as to whether we manage it more like we have in europe where there s a six brand tile on disney or we manage it as a soft bundle which is what we have now or move to more of a hard bundle in the future just for the folks at home a hard bundle would give viewers access to all of these services from the same app whereas now you get them separately even if you re paying with one credit card right so there are going to be some people i think eventually who are going to want a frictionless experience the consumer essentially dictates everything advertisement you ve spoken before about your general ideas about a disney metaverse as a way of having virtual worlds interact with how people experience disney in real life through the parks what s an example of how that kind of thing could work ninety percent of our consumers around the world will never have a chance to experience our disney parks the question is how can we build some experience that approximates it it s going to be different but maybe there are things that you can t do in real life that you can do with next generation storytelling maybe you really want to get off the haunted mansion ride and go see that ballroom dancing scene i can assure you that a lot of fans want to do that you can get off any attraction at any spot and go explore pirates of the caribbean wouldn t that be cool even if you have access to a park we can make that happen in a digital sense

financial literacy in this country has steadily declined over the last 12 years according to a recent study but the root cause remains elusive in 2021 the average respondent correctly answered 2 6 out of 5 financial literacy questions according to the findings from the finra foundation national financial capability study that surveyed nearly 30 000 u s adults down from 3 0 out of 5 questions in 2009 high financial literacy was considered answering more than 3 correctly advertisement advertisement why financial literacy is declining its correlation with smart money behaviors and how to improve all is vexing experts who hope any connection can ultimately help more folks reach financial security the 14 drop in financial literacy from 2009 to 2021 is certainly notable but much more surprising is the 21 increase in the number of don t know responses to the financial literacy quiz questions over the same time finra research director gary mottola told yahoo money we do not yet fully understand why so many more people are reporting don t know in recent years one hypothesis is that the growing complexity of our financial world could indicate that people are increasingly aware of their own knowledge limitations financial literacy quiz to evaluate respondents financial literacy the 2021 nfcs used seven quiz questions covering fundamental economics and personal finance one reason for the drop in financial literacy scores may be the growing complexity of our financial world according to finra research director gary mottola photo credit getty creative boonchai wedmakawand via getty images the questions ran the gamut of asking about compounding interest for example suppose you had 100 in a savings account and the interest rate was 2 per year after 5 years how much do you think you would have in the account if you left the money to grow the possible answers included more than 102 exactly 102 less than 102 and don t know another was imagine that the interest rate on your savings account was 1 per year and inflation was 2 per year after 1 year how much would you be able to buy with the money in this account answers ranged from more than today exactly the same less than today and don t know another question do you think the following statement is true or false buying a single company stock usually provides a safer return than a stock mutual fund see answers below the results indicate that those with higher financial literacy are more likely to have taken steps to plan for their long term financial future such as calculating retirement savings needs 52 compared to 29 among those with lower financial literacy and having a retirement account 70 vs 43 they are 23 more likely to spend less than their income and 26 less likely to use high cost forms of borrowing than those who display low financial literacy according to the finra survey story continues financial education programs are only one piece of the puzzle how successful financial literacy efforts truly are is often batted around there s no credible evidence that these financial education programs actually give people the tools that they need to protect themselves or to make optimal choices for their own situation and values lauren willis associate dean for research and professor of law at loyola university said in a recent financial literacy webinar hosted by the financial access initiative the market changes so quickly that things that we teach people even habits often end up being outdated if regulators can t keep up with the speed of financial innovation we can t expect educators to and we certainly can t expect their students to just because you can even calculate compound interest does not save you from a bank who has highly detailed information about your online behavior figuring out how to micro target an offer to you that s going to be highly profitable for them and suboptimal for you advertisement advertisement mottola is realistic how successful financial literacy efforts truly are is often batted around yet when results like those from finra are released it s easy to fall back on the idea that the solution is to ramp up more money classes in schools phot credit getty creative klaus vedfelt via getty images it s important to note that better financial knowledge is not a panacea he said other factors like income educational attainment systemic racism and lack of access to financial products and services are tied to indicators of lower financial capability such factors need to be addressed by policymakers and advocates who want to improve people s financial capability the core issue is that while financial savvy is essential circumstances make it hard to get a grip on some of these challenges for a swath of the population amid these overall gains in financial capability there are segments that continue to struggle particularly younger adults those with lower income and education levels black african americans hispanic latino americans and those who were laid off or furloughed due to covid 19 mottola said the reality is that many disadvantaged people face hurdles and barriers that many others do not he said for example those whose parents were on stronger financial footing are more likely to have learned about money from their families as well as have better financial outcomes later in life themselves therefore these do not reflect a direct link between financial literacy and financial behaviors it takes money to make money making good financial choices mostly comes from having enough money that good financial choices are possible especially having enough money to make a few mistakes this is the way all of us really learn how to manage our finances not by taking a class timothy n ogden managing director of the financial access initiative at new york university s wagner school of public service told yahoo money people with more money have more experience with financial tools and services and therefore have higher financial literacy timothy n ogden managing director of the financial access initiative at new york university s wagner school of public service told yahoo money photo credit getty creative anyaberkut via getty images people with more money have more experience with financial tools and services and therefore have higher financial literacy telling someone they should have an emergency fund or save instead of borrowing presumes they are making more than enough money to cover basic expenses and enjoy life on a regular basis he said people don t borrow from payday lenders because they don t know how compound interest works they re borrowing because they don t have enough money and they don t have other cheaper alternatives teaching them about the importance of retirement planning isn t going to change the need to pay the rent or the electric bill this month advertisement advertisement yet when results like those from finra are released it s easy to fall back on the idea that the solution is to ramp up more money classes in schools financial literacy is perceived to be a panacea because it s so much easier to do something about than the difficult and messy policy problems of ensuring there is affordable housing affordable medical care affordable transportation and good paying jobs ogden said you can t fix this problem with boring mandated financial literacy courses taught by high school gym teachers who would rather be doing anything else it s crazy that anyone thinks that mandated classes in school are a solution to these issues the finra findings are a wake up call in some respects that more needs to be done to ramp up basic financial skills and will have a lasting impact on the finances of millions of americans and in turn the economy but it s only part of the puzzle i really don t think it s the financial literacy community that s saying that financial education alone will save everything laura levine president and ceo of the jump tart coalition for personal financial literacy told yahoo money financial education is a critical component to achieving financial well being when coupled with things like suitable products and services consumer protections fair and equitable access and opportunities and clear reliable information and for those of you checking to see if you had the right responses to finra

individuals and entities associated with 1globe a family investment office that is owned and controlled by defendant jiaqiang li li li was sinovac s largest shareholder when 1globe s chief executive officer made an offer in january 2016 to buy sinovac for approximately 350 million li supported a competing group that sought to buy sinovac for a higher price rather than provide this support in an open and transparent manner li and 1globe used deceptive practices to advance their position after sinovac adopted the rights agreement on march 28 2016 which contained a poison pill that limited the amount of sinovac stock that a shareholder could acquire defendants made many intentionally false and misleading statements and violated their statutory disclosure obligations under section 13 d of the securities exchange act of 1934 section 13 d in order to conceal the extent and purpose of li s and 1globe s ownership of sinovac stock in addition to misrepresenting the amount of sinovac stock that li and 1globe owned defendants misrepresented their secret plan to act in concert with other shareholders to try to take control of the company while sinovac knew that li and 1globe were acting in concert based on the company s private communications with them during the battle for control of the company this information was not known to public shareholders plaintiff and the class are sinovac shareholders that have been caught in the middle of this battle between sinovac s management and 1globe for control of the company while plaintiff and the class also seek to receive fair value if sinovac is taken private defendants behind the scenes scheming impeded this effort instead defendants have caused plaintiff and the class substantial harm by making them lose their ability to collect at least millions of shares they would have otherwise been entitled to under the rights agreement even the purchase of a single share of sinovac stock above the rights agreement s 15 thresholder constitutes a trigger event under the rights agreement all of li s and 1globe s purchases of sinovac stock that they made or directed to be made on their behalf after march 28 2016 therefore triggered sinovac s poison pill defendant s intentionally false statements and omissions concerning the true nature of li s and 1globe s ownership of sinovac stock caused the exchange exchange under the rights agreement to be delayed by several years if li had fully disclosed his ownership of sinovac stock as he was required to do under section 13 d it would have been clear as day that the rights agreement was triggered by may 2016 at the latest while sinovac knew enough information starting in 2016 largely based on private correspondence to determine that 1globe and li triggered the rights agreement defendants hid the full extent of their ownership of sinovac stock and their agreements in connection with the battle for control of the company defendants therefore also tortiously interfered with sinovac s contractual obligations to its shareholders under the rights agreement if 1globe and li s actions were disclosed publicly as they were required to be under section 13 d plaintiff s rights would have been exercisable based on that disclosure and an exchange would have occurred based on that date by misrepresenting the true nature of their ownership of sinovac stock defendants caused that date to be delayed almost three years until february 22 2019 resulting in plaintiff and the class losing their rights to acquire additional shares of sinovac stock for all of their shares that they sold in the interim while sinovac should have implemented the rights agreement in 2016 based on the information available to it at the time 1globe and li exacerbated

said this the crimes of the united states have been systematic constant vicious remorseless but very few people have actually talked about them you have to hand it to america it has exercised a quite clinical manipulation of power worldwide while masquerading as a force for universal good it s a brilliant even witty highly successful act of hypnosis pinter was a friend of mine and possibly the last great political sage that is before dissenting politics were gentrified i asked him if the hypnosis he referred to was the submissive void described by leni riefenstahl it s the same he replied it means the brainwashing is so thorough we are programmed to swallow a pack of lies if we don t recognise propaganda we may accept it as normal and believe it that s the submissive void in our systems of corporate democracy war is an economic necessity the perfect marriage of public subsidy and private profit socialism for the rich capitalism for the poor the day after 9 11 the stock prices of the war industry soared more bloodshed was coming which is great for business today the most profitable wars have their own brand they are called forever wars afghanistan palestine iraq libya yemen and now ukraine all are based on a pack of lies iraq is the most infamous with its weapons of mass destruction that didn t exist nato s destruction of libya in 2011 was justified by a massacre in benghazi that didn t happen afghanistan was a convenient revenge war for 9 11 which had nothing to do with the people of afghanistan today the news from afghanistan is how evil the taliban are not that u s president joe biden s theft of 7 billion of the country s bank reserves is causing widespread suffering recently national public radio in washington devoted two hours to afghanistan and 30 seconds to its starving people at its summit in madrid in june nato which is controlled by the united states adopted a strategy document that militarises the european continent and escalates the prospect of war with russia and china it proposes multi domain warfighting against nuclear armed peer competitor in other words nuclear war it says nato s enlargement has been an historic success i read that in disbelief the news from the war in ukraine is mostly not news but a one sided litany of jingoism distortion omission i have reported a number of wars and have never known such blanket propaganda in february russia invaded ukraine as a response to almost eight years of killing and criminal destruction in the russian speaking region of donbass on their border in 2014 the united states had sponsored a coup in kiev that got rid of ukraine s democratically elected russian friendly president and installed a successor whom the americans made clear was their man in recent years american defender missiles have been installed in eastern europe poland slovenia the czech republic almost certainly aimed at russia accompanied by false assurances all the way back to james baker s promise to soviet leader mikhail gorbachev in february 1990 that nato would never expand beyond germany nato on hitler s borderline ukraine is the frontline nato has effectively reached the very borderland through which hitler s army stormed in 1941 leaving more than 23 million dead in the soviet union last december russia proposed a far reaching security plan for europe this was dismissed derided or suppressed in the western media who read its step by step proposals on feb 24 president volodymyr zelensky threatened to develop nuclear weapons unless america armed and protected ukraine on the same day russia invaded an unprovoked act of congenital infamy according to the western media the history the lies the peace proposals the solemn agreements on donbass at minsk counted for nothing on april 25 u s defense secretary lloyd austin flew into kiev and confirmed that america s aim was to destroy the russian federation the word he used was weaken america had got the war it wanted waged by an american bankrolled and armed proxy and expendable pawn almost none of this was explained to western audiences it is a crime to invade a sovereign country there are no buts except one when did the present war in ukraine begin and who started it according to the united nations between 2014 and this year some 14 000 people have been killed in the kievregime s civil war on the donbass many of the attacks were carried out by neo nazis watch an itv news report from may 2014 by the veteran reporter james mates who is shelled along with civilians in the city of mariupol by ukraine s azov neo nazi battalion may 10 2014 may 10 2014 in the same month dozens of russian speaking people were burned alive or suffocated in a trade union building in odessa besieged by fascist thugs the followers of the nazi collaborator and anti semitic fanatic stepan bandera the new york times called the thugs nationalists the historic mission of our nation in this critical moment said andreiy biletsky founder of the azov battaltion is to lead the white races of the world in a final crusade for their survival a crusade against the semite led untermenschen since february a campaign of self appointed news monitors mostly funded by the americans and british with links to governments have sought to maintain the absurdity that ukraine s neo nazis don t exist airbrushing once associated with stalin s purges has become a tool of mainstream journalism in less than a decade a good china has been airbrushed and a bad china has replaced it from the world s workshop to a budding new satan much of this propaganda originates in the u s and is transmitted through proxies and think tanks such as the notorious australian strategic policy institute the voice of the arms industry and by journalists such as peter hartcher of the sydney morning herald who has labeled those spreading chinese influence as rats flies mosquitoes and sparrows and suggested these pests be eradicated news about china in the west is almost entirely about the threat from beijing airbrushed are the 400 american military bases that surround most of china an armed necklace that reaches from australia to the pacific and south east asia japan and korea the japanese island of okinawa and the korean island of jeju are like loaded guns aimed point blank at the industrial heart of china a pentagon official described this as a noose palestine has been misreported for as long as i can remember to the bbc there is the conflict of two narratives the longest most brutal lawless military occupation in modern times is unmentionable the stricken people of yemen barely exist they are media unpeople while the saudis rain down their american cluster bombs with british advisers working alongside the saudi targeting officers more than half a million children face starvation this brainwashing by omission is not new the slaughter of the first world war was suppressed by reporters who were given knighthoods for their compliance in 1917 the editor of the manchester guardian c p scott confided to prime minister lloyd george if people really knew the war would be stopped tomorrow but they don t know and can t know the refusal to see people and events as those in other countries see them is a media virus in the west as debilitating as covid it is as if we see the world through a one way mirror in which we are moral and benign and they are not it is a profoundly imperial view the history that is a living presence in china and russia is rarely explained and rarely understood vladimir putin is adolf hitler xi jinping is fu man chu epic achievements such as the eradication of abject poverty in china are barely known how perverse and squalid this is when will we allow ourselves to understand training journalists factory style is not the answer neither is the wondrous digital tool which is a means not an end like the one finger typewriter and the linotype machine in recent years some of the best journalists have been eased out of the mainstream defenestrated is the word used the spaces once open to mavericks to journalists who went against the grain truth tellers have closed the case of julian assange right is the most shocking when julian and wikileaks could win readers and prizes for the guardian the new york times and other self important papers of record he was celebrated when the dark state objected and demanded the destruction of hard drives and the assassination of julian s character he was made a public enemy vice president joe biden compared him to a hi tech terrorist hillary clinton asked can t we just drone this guy the ensuing campaign of abuse and vilification against julian assange the u n rapporteur on torture called it mobbing brought the liberal press to its lowest ebb we know who they are i think of them as collaborators as vichy journalists when will real journalists stand up an inspirational samizdat already exists on the internet

construction industry these include plasterboard insulation materials glass cement and bricks the company also has heavy exposure to aluminium by zach bristow csr shares have been traded down heavily in 2022 having slipped from 52 week highs of 6 22 in march to now trade at 4 52 apiece despite the downtrend the building supplies manufacturer came in with a solid set of numbers for its fy22 annual results published in may in particular net profit after tax npat climbed 20 year on year to 193 million the profitable 12 month period saw management declare a final dividend of 18 cents per share up

group ltd what it does super retail group is an australian retail company that operates a number of well known brands including rebel sport supercheap auto and bcf since its founding 50 years ago the company has built a significant presence across australia and new zealand now 716 stores strong by mitchell lawler the super retail group share price has been punished over the last year as profits shrunk amid inflationary cost pressures and supply chain issues however the company has remained profitable throughout an essential tenet for a dividend share while super retail group spans more than just automotive parts i believe it s this portion of the business that is the most attractive the average age of vehicles in australia has long been over 10 years and considering cost pressures stemming from inflation and rising interest rates are causing many people to tighten their belts i believe car owners could now be inclined to hold onto their vehicles even longer this could provide a boost for the company s supercheap auto division right now super retail group is parading a 7 1 dividend yield the defensive nature of this business gives me confidence in the prospects of future dividend returns for many years to follow motley fool contributor mitchell lawler does not own shares in super retail group ltd vanguard australian shares high yield etf what it does the vanguard australian shares high yield etf is an exchange traded fund etf that currently holds 72 listed dividend paying australian companies with a median market capitalisation of 52 9 billion by bernd struben income investors looking for instant diversification may want to investigate the vanguard australian shares high yield etf the etf aims to hold an average of 71 large cap dividend paying shares and it

australian shares high yield etf arb corporation limited what it does arb corporation is australia s largest manufacturer and distributor of four wheel drive accessories there are 74 branded arb stores scattered across australia and the company ships to more than 100 countries by brooke cooper the arb share price has dumped around 44 year to date to currently trade at 30 36 despite the company posting strong earnings last month arb corporation pushed past supply chain issues and high staff absenteeism last financial year to post an 11 5 year on year increase in sales and a 122 million after tax profit an 8 1 improvement on the prior corresponding period it also ended the financial year with 52 7 million of cash and no debt to top it off arb declared a 39 cent fully franked final dividend bringing its full year payout to 71 cents per share a 4 4 year on year increase that left the stock trading with a 2 3 dividend yield motley fool contributor brooke cooper does not own shares in arb corporation limited brickworks limited what it does brickworks may be best known as an australian building products business that manufactures products like bricks pavers roofing materials masonry and more it also has an american building products business that has a market leading position in the united states by tristan harrison in addition to its core business brickworks also has a large and growing asset base through its ownership of washington h soul pattinson and co ltd asx sol shares plus it owns half of an industrial property trust along with goodman group asx gmg which is seeing strong demand for its large well located warehouses excess land is sold into the industrial property trust and then properties are built on that land i m attracted to the growing cash flow that brickworks is receiving from its property trust and through soul pattinson those two segments are funding brickworks growing dividend which hasn t been cut for over four decades i really like the business for this reliability of its dividend income furthermore brickworks recently announced it was unlocking more value by selling some of its manufacturing properties into a new property trust in terms of the yield brickworks has a trailing grossed up dividend yield of around 4 27 i think that s a solid starting yield for a dividend investor motley fool contributor tristan harrison owns shares in brickworks limited coles group ltd what it does coles is a company that needs little introduction with its vast network of popular supermarkets across the country by sebastian bowen i believe it s hard to look past coles as a quality asx dividend share this supermarket operator was one of the only blue chip shares that was able to give investors a dividend increase across each of the covid affected 2020 2021 and 2022 years no mean feat today coles is offering a fully franked dividend yield of 3 7 due to coles consumer staples nature headwinds that might affect other s p asx 200 index asx xjo shares such as slow economic growth inflation and rising interest rates are arguably less of a concern when it comes to this company for me the final feather in this grocery giant s cap is that its current dividend yield easily tops those offered by rivals such as woolworths group ltd asx wow as such i believe investors could do a lot worse than coles when it comes to asx dividend shares in september motley fool contributor sebastian bowen does not own shares in coles group ltd rio tinto limited what it does rio tinto explores materials across four segments iron aluminium copper and minerals some of its projects include the jadar project and the rincon lithium project by matthew farley on 2 september broker goldman sachs confirmed its price target of 121 50 for rio tinto shares this followed news the mining giant had reached an agreement to enable its turquoise hill acquisition to move ahead based on the current rio tinto share price the target implies potential upside of around 29 besides this possible short term increase i believe the bigger picture is that the demand for iron ore will bounce back strongly to prop up china s massive infrastructure and real estate projects for some context here rio tinto s iron ore operating segment contributed 80 to its earnings in 2021 and china buys around 70 of the world s total iron ore production china s zero covid policy will undoubtedly cause a slowdown in construction over the short term but if the rest of the world s recovery from the virus can be used as a litmus test i believe this will gradually ease real estate holds around 70 of china s wealth according to the economic times with it being seen as a popular pathway to retirement this creates significant demand for new development projects as well as the iron ore required to complete them in short real estate is highly important to china for both cultural and economic reasons so i believe a sharp rebound in demand will be on the cards when china gets a grip on the virus and restrictions ease based on the current rio tonto share price the company has a trailing dividend yield of around 10 motley fool contributor matthew farley does not own shares in rio tinto limited macquarie group ltd what it does macquarie is a global financial powerhouse that provides banking financial advisory investment and fund management services by aaron teboneras since covid 19 hit macquarie has increased its dividends to near record levels in its fy20 first half results the board declared an interim dividend of 1 35 per share however this was bumped up to 2 72 in the following year h1 fy22 with the investment bank s half year earnings due out in november i believe this could be an opportune time to pick up some shares in its first quarter update macquarie said it remains well positioned to deliver superior performance in the medium term this is because of its expertise in major markets geographic diversity and the ability to adapt its portfolio mix to changing market conditions the macquarie share price is down by almost 16 in 2022 and could be trading at bargain levels according to one broker as reported by anz share investing the team at jefferies believes macquarie is undervalued and recently raised its price target by 4 1 to 202 per share this implies an upside of around 13 from where the macquarie

materially from those we project discovery or identification of new product candidates or development of new indications for existing products cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain consequently there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate or development of a new indication for an existing product will be successful and become a commercial product further preclinical results do not guarantee safe and effective performance of product candidates in humans the complexity of the human body cannot be perfectly or sometimes even adequately modeled by computer or cell culture systems or animal models the length of time that it takes for us to complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for product marketing has in the past varied and we expect similar variability in the future even when clinical trials are successful regulatory authorities may question the sufficiency for approval of the trial endpoints we have selected we develop product candidates internally and through licensing collaborations partnerships and joint ventures product candidates that are derived from relationships may be subject to disputes between the parties or may prove to be not as effective or as safe as we may have believed at the time of entering into such relationship also we or others could identify safety side effects or manufacturing problems with our products including our devices after they are on the market our results may be affected by our ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products sales growth of recently launched products competition from other products including biosimilars difficulties or delays in manufacturing our products and global economic conditions in addition sales of our products are affected by pricing pressure political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third

including in puerto rico and also depend on third parties for a portion of our manufacturing activities and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of our current products and product candidate development an outbreak of disease or similar public health threat such as covid 19 and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of such disease could have a significant adverse effect on the supply of materials for our manufacturing activities the distribution of our products the commercialization of our product candidates and our clinical trial operations and any such events may have a material adverse effect on our product development product sales business and results of operations we rely on collaborations with third parties for the

marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products further some raw materials medical devices and component parts for our products are supplied by sole third party

24 2022 dingdong purports to be a leading and the fastest growing on demand e commerce company in china dingdong conducted its ipo in new york and its ads are listed on the new york stock exchange nyse under the ticker symbol ddl in june 2021 as part of dingdong s ipo defendants issued approximately 4 07 million ads to the investing public at 23 50 per ads all pursuant to the registration statement according to the registration statement dingdong s mission is to make fresh groceries as available as running water to ever household to achieve this end dingdong has purportedly embraced a user centric philosophy that is committed to directly providing users and householders fresh produce mean and seafood and other daily necessities through a convenient and excellent shopping experience supported by an extensive self operated frontline fulfillment grid critically dingdong differentiates itself from its competitors by claiming to procure products primarily form direct upstream sources such as farms and cooperatives apply stringent quality control across entire supply chain to ensure product quality to users and rely on its frontline fulfillment grid and robust digitalized fulfillment capabilities deliver orders within 30 minutes unbeknownst to prospective investors however the registration statement misrepresented dingdong s commitment to ensuring the safety and quality of the food it distributes to the market in fact dingdong was actively flouting its food safety responsibilities selling for example dead fish to customers while marketing it as live fish and recycling vegetables that were past their sell by date in other words dingdong was no better at providing or assuring access to fresh groceries than the supermarkets traditional chinese wet markets or traditional e commerce platforms it repeatedly claimed to be displacing the foregoing conduct subjected dingdong to increased risk of regulatory and or governmental scrutiny and enforcement all of which once revealed were likely to and did negatively impact dingdong s business operations and reputation by omitting these facts ads purchasers were unable to adequately assess the value of the shares offered in connection with the ipo and thus purchased their ads without material information and to their detriment according to the complaint the company s public statements throughout the ipo period were false and materially misleading when the market learned the truth about dingdong investors suffered damages for more information on the dingdong class action go to stitch fix inc nasdaq sfix class period december 8 2020 march 8 2022 lead plaintiff deadline october 25 2022 stitch fix sells a range of apparel shoes and accessories through its website and mobile application traditionally stitch fix sold products as a fix through which the customer would receive a monthly box of items chosen by a personal stylist the customer would not know specifically which items they were receiving but would have the option to return whichever items it did not want the customer paid a 20 styling fee per fix and that fee would be applied to any of the items the customer chose to buy prior to the class period in 2019 stitch fix announced a new direct buy retail component eventually named freestyle the freestyle program allowed customers to shop the site for specific products giving the customer more control over what items they received but also removing the curation element that differentiated stitch fix from other e retailers the freestyle program was first made available to a subset of existing stitch fix customers in 2020 and incrementally rolled out to all existing customers in early 2021 in september 2021 the freestyle program was formally launched to new customers on december 7 2021 stitch fix announced a loss for its first quarter of 2022 cut its full year revenue projections and admitted for the first time that as a result of the expansion into freestyle the company may experience short term impacts of cannibalization as a result of these disclosures stitch fix s share price declined by 5 97 per share or 24 from a closing price of 24 97 per share on december 7 2021 to a closing price of 19 00 per share on december 8 2021 however stitch fix continued to assure investors that this was a short term problem then on march 8 2022 when stitch fix reported earnings for its second quarter of 2022 the company offered a weak outlook for its third quarter of 2022 and cut its guidance for the full year stitch fix attributed the guidance cut to friction between the freestyle and fix businesses as a result of this disclosure the price of stitch fix stock declined by 0 67 per share or 6 from 11 01 per share to 10 34 per share the complaint alleges that throughout the class period stitch fix made numerous false and misleading statements to investors concerning the synergy between the company s fix and freestyle programs and repeatedly denied claims that the freestyle program could cannibalize the company s legacy fix business specifically stitch fix repeatedly assured investors that the company s freestyle business was an additive experience and complimentary to the fix business that the combination of those two things will allow us to address many more types of clients and that we see solid growth in both sides of the business in truth throughout the class period stitch fix concealed the fact that these programs were not complementary or additive stitch fix knew that the freestyle program would be much preferred to the company s original fix model and that the freestyle program would inevitably cannibalize the company s legacy fix business as a result of these misrepresentations and omissions stitch fix s class a

bloomberg energy stocks and bonds are poised to get a fresh boost from investors positioning to benefit from the surging electricity prices and fuel shortages expected later this year two thirds of respondents to an mliv pulse survey which includes portfolio managers and retail investors plan to increase exposure to the sector over the next six months they see electricity and natural gas prices driving global inflation and expect that russia will choke off flows of natural gas to europe leading to shortages of key fuels this winter energy stocks are one of the rare bright spots in the world s equity markets with an index of energy companies in the s p 500 rallying more than 40 so far this year as profits surged along with oil and gas prices yet they remain significantly cheaper than their s p 500 peers based on their prices relative to the earnings they re expected to report in the year ahead while junk rated energy bonds are expensive when compared with the global index the us

definitely want to remain invested in energy stocks because of massive supply constraints chris wood global head of equity strategy at jefferies llc said in a bloomberg tv interview the other reason to own energy is quite simply that you need a hedge against the growing risk of escalation in ukraine energy markets have come under further strain as russia constricts deliveries of natural gas through its nord stream pipeline causing prices to almost triple in europe this year european union sanctions are set to squeeze russian oil supplies when they take effect in december europe s worst energy crisis in five decades is making rationing look all but inevitable this winter the eu has already created a voluntary 15 demand reduction target for gas with the option of making it obligatory if needed and warned of further drastic reductions if temperatures are especially low almost three quarters of 814 respondents expect electricity and natural gas prices to drive global inflation the most this winter a similar majority said that if there will be any shortages over the next six months it will be of key fuels including natural gas years of under investment during the attempt to transition away from the fossil fuels have left global supplies unable to satisfy the post pandemic rebound in demand it s ultimately the revenge of the old economy if you don t invest in the old economy it comes back to haunt you said jeff currie head of commodities research at goldman sachs group inc the only way you re solving the energy problem in the long run is through investment and oil companies are the conduit for the capex to solve the problem the surge in energy prices has hit major economies with a brutal wave of inflation which has reached record levels in the euro area and the hottest pace in almost four decades in the us goldman sachs has warned that inflation in the uk could top 22 next year if natural gas prices remain elevated economists increasingly predict a euro area recession in the coming quarters as the rising cost of living saps demand undermining the pandemic rebound it s not only commodities that will drive up inflation but also government reaction to high prices of commodities said anna mikulska a non resident fellow in energy at rice university s baker institute for public policy the negative effect of either pumping more money into the economy will be inflation and lowering artificially energy prices will lead to higher demand and higher prices vicious circle of sorts the european gas market is likely to remain tight throughout the 2020s said katja yafimava a senior research fellow at oxford institute for energy studies the global shortage of gas hesitancy about new investment in new gas production and the eu s political decision to phase out its dependence on russian gas altogether are driving the tightness nonetheless bullish investors may have their nerves tested in the months ahead as the inflationary wave batters the global economy demand in china the world s second biggest consumer remains overshadowed by the property crisis and virus restrictions in the oil market there are already signs of demand destruction taking

energy company equinor asa warned that margin calls of at least 1 5 trillion are straining energy trading and pushing governments to provide greater liquidity buffers yet energy bulls are unperturbed even if a global economic slowdown causes oil prices to falter they see another line of defense in the opec producers cartel led by saudi arabia the alliance demonstrated its readiness to intervene by announcing a symbolic production cutback earlier this month the kingdom and its partners are likely to either hold production steady or cut rather than increase it over the next six months according

karla hernandez mats a former educator and current president of the united teachers of dade utd union has been tapped as the running mate of democratic congressman and former governor of florida charlie crist in crist s bid to regain the governorship against the fascistic republican incumbent ron desantis charlie crist the democratic candidate for florida governor and his running mate karla hernandez mats during a political rally at hialeah middle community school on aug 27 2022 in hialeah florida cc by sa 4 0 photo by ladderstuff2 utd is the local union affiliated with the national education association and its state wide branch the florida education association fea which covers more than 30 000 educators in miami dade county miami dade has a population of over 450 000 charlie crist was a republican when he began his term as florida governor in 2007 became an independent in 2010 and switched to the democratic party in 2012 one year after the end of his tenure as governor in 2012 he ran unsuccessfully for the us senate from florida against marco rubio and then lost in his bid to regain the governor s office against rick scott in 2014 in the 2016 congressional elections crist defeated the republican incumbent us house member from florida s 13th congressional district david jolly crist defeated florida agricultural commissioner nikki fried in this year s democratic gubernatorial primary election by a margin of 59 percent to 35 3 percent an outcome driven largely by crist s three decade long history within the political establishment and fried s acceptance of substantial contributions from sugar and utility corporations hernandez mats was chosen from among 18 potential running rates whom crist had floated in his campaign crist began his lengthy political career as a republican official in the state beginning in the early 1990s he spearheaded brutal attacks against democratic rights through repressive law and order legislation and acquired the moniker chain gang charlie for restoring the infamous system of forced labor for convicts in florida s prison system he also sponsored an arduous law that required inmates to serve 85 percent of their sentence before being eligible for parole the republican turned democrat exemplifies the masquerading and cynicism one finds in the american two party system he has frequently flipped flopped on issues when it proved expedient to the furtherance of his political career crist s running mate hernandez mats running for lieutenant governor is by all accounts a political novice raised in miami as a first generation american of honduran descent she received a bachelor s degree from florida international university in emotionally handicapped education and worked for 10 years teaching special education before ascending the ranks of the utd bureaucracy to become the union s secretary treasurer from 2013 to 2016 she began her first term as union president in 2016 and won a second term in 2019 the promotion of hernandez mats has drawn speculation that crist and the democrats will make education the focal point in their campaign to oust desanits which is given little chance to succeed desantis has launched fascistic attacks against education this year with legislation targeting freedom of speech and democratic rights more generally from banning school textbooks and restricting historical teaching about struggles against inequality to ramming through a law prohibiting discussion of sexual orientation and gender identity in classrooms the democratic party aligned media has lauded her tenure as utd president for leading the miami dade school district s campaign to pass a tax referendum in 2018 in support of teacher pay advocating to keep health care premiums frozen and removing the union from debt the elevation of hernandez mats to the governor s race alongside crist however is not an expression of the growing popular opposition to the republicans rather it confirms the right wing character of the electoral strategy of florida democrats and the democratic party nationally in appointing hernandez mats the party is boosting a well heeled union bureaucrat who was entrusted with carrying out the demands of the biden administration the national education association nea and the american federation of teachers aft that schools be reopened at the height of the delta and omicron surges of covid 19 it is in line with biden s corporatist strategy of promoting the pro corporate trade unions as an industrial police force to suppress the mounting struggles of the working class against inflation austerity heightened exploitation and social inequality throughout the pandemic hernandez mats has operated as a faithful steward of the political establishment the national union bureaucracies and the corporations which prematurely imposed in person learning and then abandoned contact tracing quarantining isolation and other covid mitigation measures altogether all of the teachers unions staffed by bureaucrats with salaries well over six figures toe the line dictated by wall street that children be placed in classrooms so that parents can return to work to pump out profits for the ruling class and make society safe for the stock market regardless the cost in the health and lives of educators and students the contrast between the praise heaped on hernandez mats and what the former teacher has accomplished is striking a critical detail that was added to the 2018 referendum following its passage was that teachers would see a paltry 1 percent rise in their salaries each year a repeated promise during the referendum campaign was that the average salary of miami dade teachers would rise above the national average but about two thirds of miami dade s educators saw their salaries fall below that average many mid career teachers some with decades of experience have salaries that barely exceed those of entry level teachers the referendum was undermined in march of this year when florida s 3rd district court of appeals ruled that charter schools were eligible for a share of the referendum s proceeds charter schools would now receive roughly 65 million of the approximately 230 million the referendum generated according to district officials public school teachers would suffer a 6 percent or 3 900 cut to their supplemental pay both the district and the utd blamed the state s republican legislators for the measly sum but the union bureaucracy followed its long tradition of not waging any fight for better pay and organized no opposition the contract negotiated by hernandez mats bargaining team for the 2021 2022 school year did not even address the reopening of schools even as the delta variant of covid 19 was rapidly spreading across south florida and killing thousands the utd and district officials agreed to handle all policies related to the pandemic separately in a so called letter of understanding the same procedure had been agreed to the prior year but instead of temporarily moving to remote learning as in the fall 2020 the union agreed last year to reopen schools outright the betrayals of the utd and fea demonstrate the further integration of the unions into the democratic party with the unions pouring millions of dollars into the coffers of democratic politicians the ruling class is relying on the increasingly discredited corporatist unions to counter the growing wave of militant struggles and strikes from pacific northwest educators to nurses around the country and rail workers

a surprise counteroffensive over the weekend saw ukrainian troops push into areas around kharkiv in the country s northeast liberating villages and cities and catching russian troops flat footed the swift maneuvers threatened to encircle a portion of the russian army and led them to rapidly abandon positions and military hardware as ukrainian troops closed in the counteroffensive has recaptured around 1 160 square miles of territory since it began in earnest earlier this month commander in chief of the ukrainian armed forces gen valerii zaluzhnyy told the associated press sunday the eastward push caught russian forces off guard and forced several units to abandon their posts as ukrainian troops took control of the strategic cities of izyum balakliya and kupiansk critical areas for the russian supply and logistics lines in the donbas region it s the most significant blow to the russian military since ukraine pushed troops out of kyiv in march and frees ukraine s second largest city kharkiv which russian forces have devastated with near constant shelling for months russia for its part admitted to the losses with the russian defense ministry saying troops would regroup and head to donetsk a russian controlled area on ukraine s southeastern border russian president vladimir putin did not acknowledge the breakthrough on saturday opting instead to inaugurate a ferris wheel in moscow the lightning offensive comes as ukrainian troops are also trying to liberate territory in the south including the city of kherson and the area surrounding the zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant which has been reconnected to the ukrainian power grid in order to shut down its final working reactor the plant has been occupied by russian troops since march with ukrainian workers operating the facility fighting at zaporizhzhia which intensified last month increased the possibility of a nuclear crisis at europe s largest nuclear power plant as experts called for the facility to be shut down while russia still holds a vast portion of ukrainian territory in the south and east of the country saturday s push shows a ukrainian military on the offensive rather than the defensive it also shifts the battlefield landscape disrupting the grinding dynamic that characterized the war for the past several weeks importantly ukraine s well planned and organized push exposes further weaknesses in the russian formation and provides a crucial moral victory as the war stretches into its seventh month western weapons combined with intelligence and organization are working though this week s blitz took russia and much of the rest of the world by surprise it has been an operation months in the making ukrainian forces advanced on the southern city of kherson in recent weeks both working toward the liberation of the region and directing russian forces there while russian troops were tied up near kherson ukrainian forces mounted a stunning attack on kharkiv threatening to surround russian troops and forcing them to retreat hastily this is months of planning but also weeks and weeks of shaping operations by the ukrainian forces john spencer chair of urban warfare studies at the modern war institute at west point told vox in an interview sunday clearly there were other forces in the ukrainian campaign to liberate their lands ready to take advantage of any openings even leading up to the kherson and kharkiv offensives ukrainian troops had launched attacks on russian weapons depots and command centers which spencer said helped shift the dynamics and set the stage distracting russian troops and weakening their command and supply chains for ukrainian troops to take back towns and cities near kharkiv the ukrainian army has taken advantage of the relocation of the bulk of the russian forces to the south and is trying to direct the course of the war excelling in maneuver and showing great ingenuity mykola sunhurovskyi an expert with the kyiv based razumkov centre told the associated press the other major strength of the ukrainian military is its access to and use of information spencer said none of this is done without the ukrainians over matching the russians on intelligence whether that s satellite intelligence human intelligence to know where weaknesses were those advantages in intelligence organization and sheer will to continue the fight have been augmented by western weapons funding and training on september 8 the us department of defense committed an additional 675 million in weapons to ukraine including four howitzers and artillery as well as ammunition for the 16 high mobility artillery rocket systems himars systems in ukraine and more armored vehicles we are seeing real and measurable gains from ukraine in the use of these systems gen mark milley the chair of the us joint chiefs of staff told reporters at ramstein air base in germany on thursday for example the ukrainians have struck over 400 targets with the himars and they ve had devastating effect what does this mean for the future of the conflict the ukrainian military s ability to plan strategize and execute such a stunning offensive also speaks to the russian forces lack of preparation and strategy spencer told vox calling russian troops in the area un led organizationally it means they don t have the capability to even do a measured withdrawal he said comparing russia s orderly withdrawal from kyiv back in march to this weekend s retreat where troops simply up and left abandoning supplies weapons and vehicles it was very deliberate they used artillery to hold the position while they were withdrawing what we re seeing now is basically the opposite of that literally just somebody finding out that a large formation is headed their way and everybody just running leaving everything in position spencer said that means in my mind as a military vet they didn t have the commanders or the junior leaders at the lower level to do a rapid plan to withdraw from their positions while russian troops shambolic retreat from kharkiv doesn t and can t reflect on all russian units it does offer a glimpse behind the curtain at what russian troops capabilities are at this point in the war and though russia still holds swaths of territory in the south and east the challenge of holding that territory will be significant ukrainian troops formerly defending izyum and slovyansk its neighbor to the south are now freed up to join and reinforce the counteroffensive according to a situation report from the institute for the study of war isw it s also a moral victory for the ukrainian military after months of gradually ceding villages and cities in the south and east to russian control it s the first time the armed forces have been able to take the initiative and wage a strong offensive it s also evidence for western donors that with the appropriate supplies and training the armed forces can be incredibly effective even against an adversary with more weapons and troops ukrainian forces will also now have access to those russian weapons and supplies left behind since in their haste russians have not been mining areas they retreat from as they did when they pulled back from around kyiv according to the isw they are leaving behind large amounts of equipment and supplies that ukrainian forces can use those supplies are welcome as ukraine struggles to convince some western countries like germany to hand over needed supplies and as some us stocks like the 155mm ammunition used in howitzers are near depletion this is a battle over cities and logistical hubs more than simply territory spencer told vox and actually changes the entire battlefield calculus of the russian lines of communication or their support lines kupiansk to the north of izyum was the only railway hub supplying russia s front line troops in the region on saturday ukrainian troops hung the flag in front of kupiansk city hall reuters reported izyum was a critical logistics hub for russia s donbas campaign without that territory getting supplies from just over the border in belgorod will be impossible making it more difficult for russia to hold territory despite ukraine s major strategic gains this week russia is still in control of the donbas the region comprising the donetsk and luhansk oblasts and crimea a crucial staging ground and supply hub for the russian navy and territory in the south crimea is the only way to support the grouping of troops in the kherson and zaporizhzhia regions independent russian military analyst pavel luzin told the new york times otherwise this grouping of troops does not exist as of sunday evening local time russia has also reportedly begun to retaliate with ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy tweeting that an attack on kharkiv s power plant left the city without electricity donetsk regions zaporizhzhia dnipropetrovsk and sumy regions were completely cut off as well according to zelenskyy russian terrorists remain terrorists and attack critical infrastructure no military facilities only the goal of leaving people without light and heat reads an english translation of his tweet during a september 8 visit to kyiv us secretary of state antony blinken pledged continued support for ukraine and a further 2 2 billion in military aid for ukraine and for 18 other nations considered at risk of russian invasion though the us has been able to put real muscle behind its words of support the question of whether the west can maintain solidarity with ukraine in the face of crippling energy prices due to russian sanctions and the potential for severe hardship in poorer nations because of halted grain exports remains zelenskyy though left no doubt about the depth of ukrainian resolve in a speech posted to his telegram channel sunday night as darkness set in for kharkiv and surrounding areas due to attacks on critical infrastructure zelenskyy spoke defiantly to putin asking do you still think that you can scare us break us make us make concessions read my lips without gas or without you without you without light or without you without you without water or without you without you
the u s army s pacific commander general charles flynn said he is in no rush to withdraw rocket launchers and other equipment from a japanese army base at the edge of the east china sea even after the joint training they were used in ended some of the equipment we are just going to leave here until the next joint drills he told reuters on a visit on thursday to the japanese ground self defense force base on amami oshima part of an island chain stretching toward taiwan it s an opportunity for us to keep capabilities forward he added two more joint training exercises scheduled this year mean that equipment could remain in amami for several more months it includes two high mobility artillery rocket systems himars that can fire projectiles up to 500 km 310 miles and that washington has also given ukraine to help it fight russia using training exercises such as the annual orient shield drill that just ended may be an easy and quick way for washington to redeploy some forces in east asia even if only temporarily as tensions with china over taiwan grow opened in 2019 camp amami is one of a string of new bases japan is building on its southwest islands for anti ship and anti aircraft missile units that it hopes will deter any attack from neighbouring china flynn travelled to amami with general yoshihide yoshida the japanese army s chief of staff and his visit comes as tokyo prepares to beef up its military in response to what it sees as a growing threat posed by china and russia in the wake of moscow s attack on ukraine last month it unveiled a plan to field longer range missiles as part of a substantial defence spending increase that will also provide more money for joint drills with u s forces increasing the scale the complexity the size the duration of the training that our forces must do together is probably a worthy investment from both the u s and japanese forces flynn said at a media roundtable in tokyo on friday another urgent priority for japan say military experts is to increase munitions stockpiles what you are seeing in europe is a protracted fight so therefore sustainment is an incredibly important wartime function flynn said it would be in everyone s interest to look at their stocks and locations he added by tim kelly
at 1 year progression free survival was 25 for lumakras versus 10 for docetaxel lumakras met key secondary endpoint of objective response rate lumakras showed clinically meaningful improvements in patient reported outcomes compared to docetaxel thousand oaks calif sept 12 2022 prnewswire amgen nasdaq amgn today announced detailed results from the global phase 3 codebreak 200 trial which showed once daily oral lumakras lumykras sotorasib led to significantly superior progression free survival pfs primary endpoint and a significantly higher objective response rate orr a key secondary endpoint in patients with kras g12c mutated non small cell lung cancer nsclc compared with intravenous chemotherapy docetaxel notably patient reported outcomes pros a key secondary endpoint were improved with lumakras versus docetaxel these data were presented today monday sept 12 at 5 20 p m cest at the presidential symposium iii session as a late breaker oral presentation lba5812 during the european society for medical oncology esmo congress 2022 in paris the totality of evidence from this study supports lumakras as an important targeted treatment option for patients with non small cell lung cancer who harbor the kras g12c mutation and reinforces the critical need for comprehensive biomarker testing for all patients with advanced disease said david m reese m d executive vice president of research and development at amgen we plan to submit this data to health authorities around the world where lumakras lumykras is conditionally approved and we look forward to our discussions with regulators lumakras significantly improved pfs as determined by blinded independent central review bicr compared to docetaxel in heavily pre treated patients median pfs of 5 6 vs 4 5 months respectively hr 0 66 p 0 002 pfs favored lumakras across all clinically relevant subgroups including those with a history of brain metastases at baseline the proportion of patients with pfs at one year was 25 for lumakras versus 10 for docetaxel lumakras demonstrated a significantly higher orr than docetaxel with double the response rates in the lumakras arm 28 versus 13 respectively p 0 001 and showed consistent benefit across other efficacy secondary endpoints specifically improved disease control rate dcr 83 versus 60 respectively faster time to response ttr 1 4 versus 2 8 months respectively and longer duration of response dor 8 6 versus 6 8 months respectively overall survival os a key secondary endpoint was not significantly different between treatment arms 10 6 versus 11 3

protocol cross over 26 4 or as subsequent therapy 7 5 a clinically meaningful improvement in patient reported outcomes was also observed with lumakras versus docetaxel change over time improvement from baseline to week 12 in global health status physical functioning and dyspnea favored lumakras time to deterioration delaying symptoms from getting worse in global health status physical functioning and cancer related symptoms dyspnea and cough were delayed with lumakras compared to docetaxel there were fewer treatment related adverse events traes for lumakras versus docetaxel grade 3 traes 33 lumakras 40 docetaxel and serious traes 11 lumakras 23 docetaxel were lower with lumakras compared to docetaxel the most common traes reported by at least 15 of patients in either treatment

3 randomized clinical trial for a krasg12c inhibitor to show benefit in heavily pre treated patients who have limited treatment options said melissa l johnson m d director of lung cancer research sarah cannon research institute at tennessee oncology and presenting author it is encouraging that progression free survival benefits were consistent across all clinically relevant subgroups including those with a history of brain metastases and that sotorasib response rates were more than double compared to docetaxel response rates this data represents a major advance for the treatment of patients with kras g12c mutated non small cell lung cancer data from codebreak 200 will be submitted to global regulatory authorities where lumakras lumykras has accelerated approval or conditional marketing authorization lumakras is the only krasg12c inhibitor approved anywhere in the world with approval in 44 markets including the united states the european union the united kingdrom and japan codebreak

lumakras lumykras is also being studied in multiple other solid tumors 3 about non small cell lung cancer and the kras g12c mutation lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer related deaths worldwide and it accounts for more deaths worldwide than colon cancer breast cancer and prostate cancer combined 4 overall survival rates for nsclc are improving but remain poor for patients with advanced disease and 5 year survival is only 8 for those with metastatic disease 5 kras g12c is the most common kras mutation in nsclc 6 about 13 of patients with nsclc harbor the kras g12c mutation 7 unmet medical need remains high and treatment options are limited for nsclc patients with the kras g12c mutation whose first line treatment has failed to work or has stopped working the outcomes with other

spread this news by alastair ford deal making is still possible in zimbabwe if you know your way around for proof look no further than the transaction that s just completed around prospect resources arcadia lithium project situated around 38 kilometres east of the capital harare in working up arcadia prospect followed a path that s been tried and tested by countless junior miners over the decades it made a discovery it delineated a resource it ensured local stakeholder support as it developed an economic plan for development and then when the time was right it sold out for a tidy us 377mln what s more a chunky part of that sale price was returned to shareholders meaning investors got a real return rather than the standard recycling of hard won capital into new and more distant hopes and dreams so it is possible as an investor to make money in zimbabwe and given that prospect is listed on the australian exchange it s also demonstrably straightforward to get that money out a a 0 77 dividend per share was paid out in june with a further a 0 19 taking the total per share payout to a 0 96 of course prospect isn t the only mining company that s converting zimbabwe s in country resources into hard currency down south near bulawayo caledonia has been mining at the blanket gold mine for years and paying out regularly quarterly dividends for more than a decade caledonia has also just acquired the bilboes project zimbabwe s largest undeveloped gold asset from a consortium of investors a move which could propel it firmly into the ranks of the world s mid tier gold miners currently caledonia produces of the order of 80 000 ounces of gold per year from blanket but the addition of bilboes could take annual production comfortably over 200 000 ounces if not considerably higher and if caledonia was able to pay a dividend on gold production of that order it would be a substantial endorsement of the ability of investors to profit from putting money into and taking it out of zimbabwe the key question though is whether or not these two examples are the exceptions that prove the rule it s no secret that zimbabwe has been very much out of style as far as the western investment community has been concerned since the wave of land seizures and low level ethnic cleansing orchestrated by president mugabe in the early years of this century sequestration is always a strong deterrent to any investor and guaranteed to send sentiment off a cliff to have it done so publicly and so blatantly sent up so many red flags to the investment community that more than a decade later they haven t all yet come down new president ed mnangagwa has done something to reverse the effects of those land seizures and inside zimbabwe it s now possible to see those formerly evicted farmers now back and working the land they were once evicted from but crucially they are now working that same land as tenants rather than landowners so fundamentally the sequestrations of the mugabe regime remain unreversed on a more practical level of course as tenant farmers the former owners are far less likely to invest significantly in the land than they would have been had they retained title it seems that under the current dispensation zimbabwe s agriculture sector will never recover to the heights it reached in the 1980s and early 1990s when the country was referred to as the breadbasket of africa now it needs to import food from ukraine which as events in the wider world have shown offers only a limited amount of economic security the lingering effects of the land seizures remain present in other ways too inside the country for one thing the zimbabwean dollar plays second fiddle to the us dollar in terms of economic activity the zimbabwean dollar is only really good for allowing the government to manipulate certain activities such as trading on the two local stock exchanges harare and victoria falls by mandating the use of local currency in certain activities it s possible to control to a degree how local businessmen manage their funds but in truth the zimbabwean government lost control of monetary policy years ago and their current grip on the fiscal side of things is tenuous at best the us dollar rules all dollar notes that is if you want change from a single dollar expect it in kind in the form of a can of drink a bottle of mineral water or a chocolate bar there are no nickels and dimes here from a business perspective that s good and bad the predominance of the us dollar means that there s only so much currency manipulation that can be done by whatever dark forces operate inside zimbabwe s deep state but on the whole having two currencies instead of one is an added cost and leads to complexities at the admin level from payroll to managing cashflow currently the interest rate on zimbabwean dollar denominated debt is 200 as set by the central bank but of course you won t get that rate yourself if you try lending any zim dollars yourself so far chinese currency has yet to make any real inroads even though china is now zimbabwe s largest foreign investor by some margin it s chinese money that could end up blocking the upper reaches of the zambezi river in zimbabwe in the creation of a new hydro project and in opposition to the local tourist trade and it s chinese money that s offering the safest current exit route for investors who want to cash up prospect s us 377mln sale of arcadia may have been denominated in us dollars but the buyers were chinese and the trucks that rumble to and from arcadia down the main highway into harare are chinese made could the american s regain the initiative they could if they wanted and indeed have just spend megabucks on an extensive new embassy complex but are the stakes really high enough zimbabwe is rich agriculturally and has some attractive raw materials and commodities in the ground but at the moment its largest gold producer is caledonia with it s 80 000 ounces per year an output which doesn t even show up on the radars of most serious gold producing companies the arcadia project was significant regionally and lithium may yet become a major export earner for zimbabwe as prospect galileo resources and others continue to look for new deposits but as it stands zimbabwe s lithium endowment is nowhere near hitting the dial in the same way as the major regions of south america or australia do so at the moment there s an uneasy truce britain s influence though briefly revived during the lancaster house talks in the late 1970s was really ended by the smith regime in the 1960s since then the americans and chinese have played a lacklustre form of chess with the country s assets and it s notable from one of the more readable accounts of the events that led to mugabe s toppling that emerson mnangagwa and his army chief constantino chiwenga sought the permission of both the yanks and the chinese before moving their tanks into position worth noting though that the change at the top was achieved almost bloodlessly and that by african standards zimbabwe s history of violence isn t the worst still it remains a difficult place to navigate and requires a keen eye and certainly your full attention if you want to be sure of securing a return on any investment

from lagos to ogun the northern part of nigeria to the east and everywhere in between access bank under the leadership of herbert wigwe has not swayed or shirked in its avowed commitment to continually strive to deliver sustainable economic growth that is profitable environmentally responsible and socially relevant helping customers and humanity to access more and achieve their dreams at the core of the bank operation for the past couple of years is an apostolic devotion to corporate social responsibility activities an accretion of which has made it a primus inter pares in the banking industry and by extension corporate nigeria these csr activities span smes support women empowerment sports tourism education information and communications technology and creative arts and entertainment on wigwe s watch access bank has recorded remarkable leaps in operations and revenue from cutting edge and futuristic banking culture in the cutthroat terrain of nigerian banking herbert rides the tides of industry thus dictating the pace of change and influencing the thought of his time there is no gainsaying therefore that he would command the epochs that follow and impress his name on eternity by his dazzling strides herbert is cut of that proverbial rare stock that effortlessly attracts the patronage of leaders of men however like the very few great men and leaders of industry herbert did not attain his current height by sudden flight while most of his rivals and peers slept he toiled upwards day and night as head honcho of access bank herbert understands the need to abide by the company s corporate philosophy which is to become the world s most respected african bank thus his conscious quest to leave an indelible imprint in the sands of industry and time by shunning corruption and various unethical practices characteristic of contemporary cutthroat banking herbert would never engage in any act or association that would be inimical to the progress and good image of his organisation indeed genius is of no country but it is surely of a descent of men who reach such an acute unlimited excellence in their prime that every sterling exploit afterward savours of unprecedented brilliance few men are wrought of such transcendent capacity for genius as herbert wigwe the top banker pulsates exceptional intellect and that singular forthrightness that imbues philosophy with logic and sound theory through adversity and grace only a handful of youths in their prime could summon the courage to desert the comfort they know for the uncertainty of elusive luxuries but herbert was remarkably different while many of his contemporaries fixated on making money from the confusion characteristic of the business zone he held on to the bright rally flags of industry and hope a real man does not passionately believe in the perfection of humankind yet he must remain dedicated to the pursuit of perfection with intent to achieve near perfection the innate fear of failure he understood has been the result of a cowardly recline from knowledge and the manipulation of certain dangerous factors in the physical world for a man who challenged resolve with steely grit and exploited the arduous planes of ambition and toil till he encountered grandeur at the crossroads where wild contemplation and hard work morph into triumph wigwe despite being feted and idolised across the world will not be deified by anyone simply because he turns excellence and humaneness into an art form unlike the proverbial lazy bone who lived to see the sun rise before his eyes were closed while the chorus of dawn becomes his lullaby herbert worked through dusk and dawn to actualize his heartfelt dreams of grandeur he knew quite early in life that his average family background should inspire him to success rather than become a burden and impediment to his spirited strides to success he understood that to learn even the quarter of a breeze he must hold up a wet finger according to him when he was talking about how it all started in an interview i think one of the greatest opportunities we had and another thing that happened to us was to be blessed with great leaders we had very strong ethical leaders and mentors and they were mr fola adeola and mr tayo aderinokun as young as we were in our early 20s they gave us a plain piece of paper to run a bank and it was unheard of they empowered us and just let us do what we wanted to do it created the foundation for everything that we have done you are always a function of the people you meet the values you see and all of that they instilled in us most of the values we have had as adults in terms of running a bank and how we see our vision for whatever institution we had those 12 years in gtbank were great years under the leadership of two outstanding professionals and they truly helped us they gave us also at different points in time truly the mantle of leadership to run the bank in fairness and these where clear delegations where they did not call from oversees to question our actions so in a way it was a great thing but of course the downside is the fact that you are creating monsters who now know how to do it and that was what happened but we remain ever so grateful and privileged to have worked with them so the instincts were there in terms of the desire to run an institution but the confidence building process truly happened there gtbank and having been given the opportunity to do it it was clear to us that we could truly run a bank even as young as we were he said immortal bond between aig imoukhuede and herbert wigwe like a lightning shaft from eden wigwe proved bookmakers wrong as he painstakingly forged access bank s path to its esteemed height as one of the country s top three banks today when aig quit the saddle as manager of the bank it was believed that his successor herbert would act according to stereotype and commence a vicious plot to reduce and make irrelevant his friend and predecessor but herbert didn t do so this is because the bond between the two exceeds the common affiliation of colleagues and random business partners herbert remained loyal to aig imoukhuede and together they worked to improve the fortunes of their brainchild access bank and great thanks to the loyalty and vision of herbert the bank has grown remarkable leaps from the great height he inherited its saddle from imoukhuede unlike other bank chiefs who do not have a mind of their own herbert is remarkably different he is formidable in intellect wisdom experience and he is truly independent thus he stands tall little wonder the management and staff of the bank sing his praises to high heavens aig on his part has never grown jealous of herbert s success in the saddle rather he does his bit to encourage and assist him in running access bank and lifting it to greater heights you could be forgiven for thinking the threads of their friendship was woven in the colourful fabric of till death do us part but unlike most mortal friends aig imoukhuede and herbert wigwe neither rip apart nor plow through the great deep tightly woven fabric of loyalty that defines their friendship aig and herbert are truly friends like brothers they have come a long way as buddies and business partners it would be recalled that when they started access bank years ago pundits in the banking sector believed the bank would not thrive and survive the gruesome years but the smart focused men weathered the storms of contemporary banking and today they occupy enviable positions in the league of nigeria s most gifted and seasoned financial czars beyond the walls of commerce aig and herbert maintain very robust relations aig and herbert s friendship is undoubtedly wrought with great benefits however they cut a different portrait from the sordid and oft reviled imagery of contemporary friends with benefits they have certainly come a long way since that fateful day in 2002 when they saw a unique opportunity and grabbed it acquiring what was then a small commercial bank access bank at the time access bank was the 65th largest of 89 banks in the country it is one of the top three now stepping down before his time according to herbert wigwe in an interview i think for us sustainability is a very important part of our business issues that have to do with people planet and profits very very important so we together with the central bank of nigeria several years ago launched the nigerian sustainability banking principles and i think for several years we have been at the lead of it things that have to do with gender balance we started supporting female entrepreneurs we introduced things like the maternal healthcare scheme things which are not very normal in the context of the continent but apart from that i think the most recent aspect which gives us a lot of pride is the fact that we launched a green bond and that green bond is climate bond initiative certified it s the first in the continent and the more we do these things the more we think other corporates will take a lead and therefore lift up the continent as far as sustainability is concerned and i think if you keep us side by side most institutions in the continent and world over i think we re exactly where we want to be it is also worthy to note that wigwe decided to step down as the ceo of the bank two years ahead of the expiration of his tenure a rarity in this clime analysts pointed out that the move is the hallmark of a leader with eyes on the goal indeed herbert is a miracle working banker unlike the middling marabou his miracles aren t deceptive in nature rather each one is an event that creates faith in his abilities as fiscal guru and bank chief the access bank chief is not just administrative managing director md but a seasoned leader administrators are always cheap and easy to find and even cheaper to keep but leaders are worth their weight in gold leaders are risk takers and they are often in very short supply ones with enduring vision however like herbert are pure gold this is why he is continually revered and celebrated among his clan and league of extraordinary men in the world he understands the rudiments of the business landscape enough to tame the odds and he has done just that he also understands that to be a man of honour and substance requires indeterminate exploits at dawn through dusk in honest industry wigwe knows that honour and longevity like celery flourishes in the dark shade far from the blaze of disconcerting neon lights as the new chief executive of access holdings plc particularly one dealing with intense pressures wigwe relies on many things perspective and context and strategic counsel and courage of conviction however chief among them is loyalty and in a word that strengthens wigwe s relationship with peer and his underlings a strong and dedicated leader he brings clarity of thought and purpose to his work he is a good listener who comes to the table not with some preset notion of distrust but rather an open mind he asks tough questions and tries to find solutions in today s climate where people spend capital avoiding blame instead of finding common ground the qualities wigwe brings to his job are rare that only makes leadership like his more valuable despite the tempestuous tides of the global business world wigwe continues to navigate the storms with a sturdy and solemn resolve to remain atop and afloat an alumnus of the harvard business school executive management programme cambridge massachusetts united states of america wigwe has a degree in accountancy from the university of nigeria nsukka enugu state an ma in banking and finance from the university college of north wales now bangor and an m sc in financial economics from the university of london the united kingdom access diamond bank merger greatest merger ever when the board of access bank plc announced it had signed a memorandum of agreement moa with diamond bank plc diamond regarding a potential merger of the two banks that would create nigeria and africa s largest retail bank by customers not a few must have expressed doubts about the likelihood of its success in fact the announcement was trailed with panic withdrawals from both banks as many did not get the message being passed the confidence of many was won over when the central bank of nigeria cbn gave approval having expressed satisfaction with the books of the banks and their operations devoid of any underhand dealings and shareholders approvals and other regulatory approvals had been obtained by the time the merger was officially perfected on april 1 2019 every doubting thomas who thought it was some sort of april fool prank embraced the new reality access bank plc is the largest bank in on the african continent also access bank nigeria now owns all its banking subsidiaries 15 in total and all its three representative offices in india china and lebanon since the biggest and most seamless merger saw the light of day it has been good news galore for the bank as its leadership under herbert wigwe has been more than sterling in performance and results that he has earned the sobriquet of an icon in nigerian banking industry should not be a matter of any intense debate for he has earned his stripes in the country s financial sector for pulling such a feat in the history of merger and acquisition wigwe has continued to show from time to time that his rise to the pinnacle of his banking career is not by accident or a stroke of luck his embrace of creative leadership strategy has not only earned the bank a strong performance in the first half of the financial year despite the slow and untenable macro environment the first post merger results show a sustainable business model coupled with effective execution as the group make solid gains towards of the achievement of its strategic goals the seamless merger formed a leading tier 1 nigerian bank and the largest bank in africa by number of customers spanning three continents 12 countries and over 31 million customers including more than 13 million mobile customers the flipside of herbert wigwe how he became an idol to his wife yes herbert wigwe was made for chizoba to chizoba it probably feels like she had him ordered and delivered to her to be worshipped and revered on this note it may be said that herbert is chizoba s idol and this is where it gets interesting herbert also considers chizoba a boon from god he treasures her like a priceless heirloom this explains his predilection to flaunt her like a sapphire studded wristwatch or button hole bouquet to the world herbert adorns the cloak of fatherhood with unprecedented pride hence he never shies from performing his fatherly roles to his wards herbert effortlessly proves that affluence and child rearing often go hand in hand under the watchful and compassionate guardianship of a model father he creates quality time to be with his children the top bank md has successfully raised his children to be his source of joy and abiding peace and to guarantee their evolution into full fledged adults he creates time to celebrate every aspect of his children s lives he is part of their progress every step of the way thus he spends vacations with them in exotic locations across the world and he is there to celebrate their graduations birthdays and other success stories neither cord nor cable can so forcibly draw or hold so fast as love has done in the family of the md of access bank to the stylish banker love and marriage so gladly combine like siamese twins born in the same clime herbert is head over heels in love with chizoba years after his heart skipped to the sweet soft drift of her smile the portrait they present is arresting and regularly breathtaking the pomp and circumstance pageantry and elegance so clearly defined and characteristic of solemnities perpetuated by historic monarchies but with a contemporary difference that s hip and humanizing their story reads like a fable a rousing tale of a charming prince and princess caught in irreducible splendor of love hewed in honesty and a royal palace it was the stuff of which fairy tales are made it is even now hence the stirring manifestations of the bond and passion sustaining the miracle working banker and his queen chizoba if theirs was a false love or the pedestrian passion characteristic of lust aping love like all parties caught in the deceptive throes of such love they would be separated by now but the love that unites them defies the strains and bounds of common love it is what it is peerless according to an insider the couple attributed their marital success to an enduring love and friendship and the ability to look every issue in the eye and tackle it with tact and an overwhelming bid to resolve it perhaps many more celebrity couples will look to the wigwes for tips on how to be in a marriage they are blessed with two boys and two girls wigwe s secret fetish were the daode jing written in contemporary times the medieval taoist would understand that the five colours do not necessarily make a man s eyes blind sometimes it awakens the soul and opens the eyes to life s little beauties like the beauty in a painter s strokes and the poetry in his flurry there is no gainsaying nigeria parades such men many of them are connoisseurs of high art and ardent patrons of the most gifted talents their love for contemporary art is only equaled by their lust for life little wonder they spend great fortune on artworks and craft these exclusive band of art enthusiasts invest heavily in modern art knowing artworks appreciate over time they know that a painting valued at n6million today could appreciate and command a price tag of n600 million in a few years yes herbert wigwe is one of the biggest collectors of most enthralling and pricey artworks in nigeria nay africa the best works of foremost artists including negritude enwonwu mufu onifade bruce onabrapkeya to mention a few excite his fancies the good deeds of how the herbert onyewumbu wigwe foundation how is an nigerian non profit organization founded in 2016 by wigwe and headquartered in lagos it focuses on youth empowerment through leadership and mentorship and on health specifically malaria and prostate cancer thus philanthropy flowers in his heart indescribable peace it is like a very personal culture of meditation peculiar to him a process by which he to puts his primal impulses to rest and let conscious thought compassion and morality guide his being through consummate humaneness and balancing acts he turns to philanthropy in times of great joy and in times of strife to celebrate a good day to dull the severe blow of disappointments social failures and other minor tragedies in a conscious and deliberate quest to institutionalise that culture of philanthropy that spurs him to do good deeds he would rather spend his fortune on improving the lives of the needy around him rather than squander it on guilty pleasures that defies reason and morality more often than not herbert believes that for philanthropy to be meaningful it has to come totally without strings or expectations having grown through a tradition of giving and service in his family he believes that when one has been blessed with so much as he has in great health intelligence and fortune much is expected of such person in terms of helping the less fortunate and giving back to the society in general his catalogues of awards unlike the proverbial prophet who has no honour among his kith and kin herbert wigwe has emerged a serial awards winner as he is constantly honoured by home grown and international media organisations very few bankers in their prime could command such attention from the public and mainstream media but he is remarkably different as it is often said that comments are free but facts are sacred every newsbyte about him commands the flurry of attention and the enduring tribute of interminable cheers the awards exemplify the tone and tenor of appreciation accorded him by local and international media without much ado the preeminent banker has personified the famous quote of vince lombardi that winning is not a sometime thing it s an all the time thing you don t win once in a while you don t do things right once in a while you do them right all of the time winning is a habit
in many advanced economies real estate investment trusts otherwise known as reits are offering investors the opportunity to put their money in real estates through mutual funding however since its official takeoff in nigeria 15 years ago reits have not exactly made the same impact as it has done in other countries edidiong ikpoto takes a look at what reit entails and why it has flopped in nigeria s real estate market for many centuries investors could only put their money in real estate either by out rightly buying already built houses or by building one from scratch for all intents and purposes real estate was a capital intensive venture and anyone without adequate funds to pump into property acquisition could not reap dividends from the industry however over the years many models began to appear in the investment climate many of these models were primarily geared towards facilitating investment in real estate without necessarily pumping a huge sum of money for the purpose of property acquisition it was this experimental alternative to investing in real estate that ultimately birthed what came to be known as real estate investment trusts historically reits started in the united states during the mid 20th century shortly after world war ii the united states congress formally established reits in 1960 as an amendment to the cigar excise tax extension this provision for the first time allowed investors to buy shares in commercial real estate portfolios something that was previously available only to wealthy individuals and through large financial intermediaries reits for the first time brought the benefits of commercial real estate investment to regular people benefits that could only be accessed via large financial intermediaries and to wealthy individuals the groundwork for the modern reit era followed with the tax reform act of 1986 when reits were given the ability to operate and manage real estate rather than simply owning or financing it according to investopedia an online investment dictionary a real estate investment trust is a company that owns operates or finances income generating real estate reits are modelled after mutual funds and the idea is to pool the capital of numerous investors this makes it possible for individual investors to earn dividends from real estate investments without having to buy manage or finance any properties themselves characteristically properties in a reit portfolio may include apartment complexes data centres healthcare facilities hotels infrastructure in the form of fibre cables cell towers and energy pipelines office buildings retail centres self storage timberland and warehouses most reits have a straightforward business model the reit leases space and collects rents on the properties then distributes that income as dividends to shareholders mortgage reits don t own real estates but they finance real estate instead these reits earn income from the interest on their investments to qualify as a reit a company must comply with certain provisions in the internal revenue code these requirements include primarily owning income generating real estate for the long term and distributing income to shareholders the investment and securities act isa 2007 and the securities and exchange commission rules 2013 regulate reit in nigeria section 154 of the act empowers the securities and nigerian exchange commission sec to approve register and regulate collective investment schemes in nigeria including those that are administered as a real estate investment trust by the provision of rule 509 1 of the sec rules a real estate investment trust can and shall wholly acquire and hold legal title to property or choose to hold equitable and beneficial title to such property vide a trust deed or such other structure as may be acceptable to sec sec permits the real estate investment trusts to hold or acquire assets through the use of a declaration of trust whereby the legal interests in the real estate reside in the vendor and all beneficial interests are transferred to the real estate investment trust the first reit in nigeria skye shelter fund was introduced in 2007 with a capitalisation of about 6 5m it was officially listed on the nigerian stock exchange nse on 28 february 2008 the second reit union homes reit was introduced in 2008 with a market capitalisation of about 40 8m the fund is primarily involved in acquiring investment properties which are held for capital appreciation by net asset value updc reit is nigeria s largest and has a diversified portfolio of real estate assets in lagos and abuja however reit which first surfaced in the nigerian real estate ecosystem 15 years ago has struggled to yield the magnitude of impact recorded in other advanced economies in explaining the downsides of the initiative experts have cited structural inadequacies as primary reasons reit has been unable to move forward in nigeria during its 15 year experimental haul one of the criticisms against reit is that it does not offer much in terms of capital appreciation as part of their structure they must pay 90 per cent of income back to investors as a result only 10 per cent of taxable income can be reinvested back into the reit to buy new holdings other negatives are that reit dividends are taxed as regular income and some reits have high management and transaction fees another downside commonly attributed to this form of investment is reit fraud the sec recommends that investors should be wary of anyone who tries to sell reits that aren t registered with the sec real estate investment trust fraud is not uncommon companies stock brokers financial advisors and fraudsters often manipulate individuals into investing in risky reits with the promise of low risks and high returns it s also a good idea to check out the broker or investment advisor who recommends the reit the sec has a free search tool that allows anyone to look up if an investment professional is licensed and registered while speaking recently at a real estate symposium titled real estate as a tool for economic development the chief executive of landmark africa paul onwuanibe said reit had failed to make the desired impact on the nigerian real estate ecosystem due to certain tax related deficiencies he said the problem with reit is that unless you propose a proper tax incentive for it and make sure it is easily accessible it won t work the chief executive officer of afriland properties uzor oshogwe said that while reit had recorded significant successes in other parts of the world nigeria did not have the legal platform to handle some of the intricacies found in it according to her many of the finer details about reit in nigeria particularly the issue of double taxation was yet to be ironed out this she said had made most real estate practitioners wary about plunging their assets into the trust she said there s a lot we need to address how well are reits doing in the economy we all know that we have three main reits in the country there is union homes there was the updc that came on board in 2013 and we are in 2022 are you wondering why it hasn t really taken off when you think of it what are the tax rebates you get as it stands we are looking at double taxation because when they pay rent you tax them when you get dividends they tax you this is what it is people coming together to do real estate as an individual i don t have the resources to maybe build a hotel but through real estate investment trust i can actually buy stock shares in real estate if i buy shares of updc reit i get dividends because i ve paid into that pocket of property as an investment opportunity reit has often been criticised for its lack of capital appreciation potential and the afriland boss equally believes that putting one s income generating assets in a public pool could end up producing this undesired outcome she added it says that 90 per cent of your income should be shared i think there is a rule that says you should distribute that income it s complicated and i think that s the reason why a lot of companies have not bought in is that the properties you put into that pocket must be active properties these are properties that i get my revenue from and you want me to put it in a bucket and share with a million other people what are the incentives i didn t see it so i stepped away in the same vein the chief executive officer of real estate research company estate intel dolapo omidire said reits like other investment schemes which leverages on mutual funds had perennially been plagued by structural problems omidire said after updc listed it s not that there has been any inactivity people have tried reit and failed it means there s a lot that needs to be fixed from the regulatory angle similar to reit tokenisation is a more tech driven approach to try and make real estate more accessible people are pooled together to own a portion of real estate with unscrupulous individuals on the prowl for prey the estate intel boss believes much work needs to be done vis a vis dousing the doubts of potential investors who are wary of losing their hard earned funds to quacks and charlatans

continued rally for the stock market looks reasonably healthy in the short term but it is probably too early to call for the all clear according to jeff mills of bryn mawr trust that 3 900 level on the s p 500 is important technically and the move that we saw off of it has been fairly strong at this point i don t know if it is strong enough to call it a very clear reversal but in terms of the breadth and strength of the bounce it has been reasonably encouraging mills said investor positioning and economic data may have also helped the recent rally mills said but the stubbornly high yields in the treasury market are a cause for skepticism the 10 year treasury yield is up about 4 basis points on monday afternoon trading near 3 364 you saw this in the june rally as well where the market kind of bought into this possibility of a fed pivot or a less difficult outcome for the economy but the bond market never really did and by and large that s what you saw last week as well mills said

of a dovish federal reserve has recently taken a significant hit according to principal global investors chief global strategist seema shah in mid june as oil prices started to decline many investors began to believe that the oncoming peak in inflation would permit the fed to wrap up its rate hiking cycle said shah markets also reasoned that an economic slowdown could prompt the fed to stop monetary tightening early at the jackson hole symposium and since however the fed has been firm in its stance that it will do what it takes to combat high inflation and keep with tightening policy until the job is done the fed s stance is quite clear said shah due to the enormity of the inflation task ahead a weakening economy cannot stand in the way of further monetary tightening and rates will need to remain at a restrictive setting for a prolonged period this means investors need to be prepared for more rate hikes and higher interest rates ahead for investors position portfolios for a more sustained monetary tightening campaign said shah carmen reinicke new york fed survey shows cooling inflation expectations amid falling gas prices a decline in gas prices is adding to hopes that

by paul r la monica cnn business cnn is inflation really peaking are consumers growing more confident we ll get those answers this week when the latest consumer and producer price indexes as well as retail sales figures for august all come out the numbers could change the calculus for the federal reserve which is guaranteed to raise interest rates again at its next policy meeting on september 21 the question is by how much traders are still predicting another three quarters of a percentage point or 75 basis point hike the third straight move of that size and fed chair jerome powell said last week that the fed has and accepts responsibility for price stability we need to act right now but could the odds of another huge rate hike edge lower if inflation data continues to suggest that price stability might finally be closer to reality the consumer price index cpi numbers come out tuesday morning while producer price index ppi figures will be released wednesday keep in mind that at the end of july the market was pricing in just a 28 probability of a 75 basis point hike in september investors now think there s an 88 chance of another super sized hike according to fed funds futures trading on the cme economists are currently forecasting that consumer prices for august will fall slightly from july and that prices were up 8 1 over the past 12 months of course 8 1 is still incredibly high by historical standards but it would be a notable slowdown from the june s 9 1 year over year spike in prices we probably have seen the peak on inflation food and energy prices are coming down there is more room to the downside said joe kalish chief global macro strategist with ned davis research investors seem to begrudgingly accept the likelihood that the fed will raise rates by 75 basis points again in a few weeks regardless of what the august inflation data indicates but traders are hoping that the september rate hike is the last one of such magnitude assuming the fed boosts rates by three quarters of a point on september 21 that would bring interest rates to a target range of 3 to 3 25 look at fed funds futures on the cme for november as of midday friday investors were pricing in 70 odds of a half point hike at the fed s november 2 meeting to a range of 3 5 to 3 75 there was just a 10 probability of a fourth straight 75 basis point increase however which could be one reason why stocks have rebounded so far in september following their august tumble price increases slowing and consumers still spending wall street is clearly betting that inflation trends will continue to head in the right direction economists also expect producer prices the cost of goods at the wholesale level to fall slightly in august forecasts are for a drop of 0 1 from july to august following a 0 5 decrease from june to july producer prices surged 9 8 year over year in july but that s down from june s high water mark of 11 3 any further slowdown would likely be welcomed by the market the fed and consumers that brings us to retail sales consumer spending figures for august are due out thursday morning the government reported last month that retail sales were up 10 3 year over year in july it will be interesting to see if that rate of sales picked up in august or slowed down the fed is in a tough spot it wants to put inflation pressures to rest and the way to do that is with big interest rate hikes but the fed would also like to avoid a recession if it can which is why some are still hoping for a soft or a softish landing for the economy as powell said in may powell also talked about rate hikes and inflation causing some pain for the economy at his jackson hole speech last month that could be an argument for the fed to do smaller rate hikes as long as inflation continues to cool and that is the key point investors have to pay closer attention to the inflation data than whatever powell or other fed members are saying the fed remains data dependent which is why rate hike odds are constantly in flux there must be a convincing downward trend in inflation we are not there yet said david donabedian chief investment officer of cibc private wealth us in a report friday big techs on tap the economy isn t the only thing in focus next week two software giants oracle and adobe will report their latest earnings investors will be watching for clues about the state of tech spending among big businesses shares of both companies have fallen this year along with rest of the tech sector and broader market oracle is down nearly 15 while adobe has plunged more than 30 but analysts expect solid sales growth from both companies nearly 15 for adobe from a year ago and an almost 20 increase from oracle one investment strategist said that big tech firms like oracle and adobe make sense for investors we do own big techs that are much more mature and established said suzanne hutchins head of the real returns strategy and senior portfolio manager with newton investment management the results from oracle and adobe will also serve as a preview for the deluge of tech third quarter earnings that will come later in october solid results from these two could be a good sign for microsoft sap ibm and other cloud software firms still the recent earnings from salesforce which was cautious about its guidance could be a warning sign for both companies according to daniel morgan senior portfolio manager with synovus trust company oracle and adobe also could get hit by the surging dollar since that will eat into profits from their international operations both companies generate more than 40 of sales outside the us morgan noted in a report up next monday china markets closed earnings from oracle tuesday us cpi starbucks investor day twitter

home news being a patriotic american doesn t make you a christian nationalist dr richard land weighs in on the debate when it comes to history and american history in particular definitions matter in 2006 before becoming the leader of the free world former president barack obama famously said whatever we once were we are no longer a christian nation at least not just we are also a jewish nation a muslim nation a buddhist nation and a hindu nation and a nation of nonbelievers it wouldn t be the last time the 44th president would suggest america once held to an exclusivist christian identity but the claim begged a larger question did it ever get our latest news for free subscribe to get daily weekly email with the top stories plus special offers from the christian post be the first to know subscribe by the end of obama s first term most evangelical leaders seemed to say no a 2012 survey conducted by the national association of evangelicals found less than a third of american evangelicals believed the u s is a christian nation though there was considerable debate over exactly what that looks like a decade later not much has changed in a wide ranging interview dr richard land executive editor of the christian post urged american christians regardless of their political persuasion not to allow the left to define how they see the united states according to land the left leaning american media invented the hot button phrase christian nationalism as a pejorative term that serves to undermine the fundamental relationship between christians and this nation as defined in the u s constitution i m not a christian nationalist land said i ve read about some but i don t know any i think it is a tactic by the left and their toadies in the media to suppress patriotic beliefs and to suppress the idea that america is a unique country added land they hate that they don t believe it themselves the notion of christian nationalism has a contentious history one that some commentators say stretches back at least as far as the dawn of the new deal when christian leaders rallied around the cross of christ in response to what they saw as government encroachment for others the phrase conjures up images of jerry falwell sr and the religious right of the 1970s and early 1980s or former president donald trump and his make america great again movement and for some its alleged corollary the riot at the u s capitol on jan 6 2021 which the washington post headlined as a kind of christian revolt andrew whitehead and samuel perry authors of the book taking america back for god christian nationalism in the united states defined the term as the belief that the united states is and should be a christian nation whitehead and perry wrote christian nationalism merely uses the bible to impose its conservative political agenda by asserting that they are true followers of christ in a country that is founded on christian principles adherents of christian nationalism can brand their political opponents as both ungodly and un american but land who also serves as president emeritus and adjunct professor of theology and ethics at southern evangelical seminary rejects the term to be a patriotic american does not make you a christian nationalist he said to believe god has played a unique role in our history or that america is a unique nation does not make us christian nationalists pejoratively they want to tie christian nationalism to racism and to prejudice and i reject those labels in celebration of the nation s independence back in july robert jeffress senior pastor of first baptist dallas told his congregation that while he doesn t consider himself a christian nationalist he does believe the united states was founded as a christian nation in his message jeffress said that anyone listening to left wing organizations like the american civil liberties union or the freedom from religion foundation will come to believe that america was founded by men with a wide diversity of religious beliefs that couldn t be further from the truth according to jeffress who added that version of american history belongs in the same category as the story of george washington and the cherry tree it is a complete myth while land conceded that jeffress was making a valid point he said he disagrees with him when it comes to the question of whether we were founded as a christian nation instead land believes america is an experiment combining judeo christian values with enlightenment ideas but warned that it doesn t work unless the majority of the people are aware of being subject to a higher authority land said jeffress and i because we re both baptists believe in separation of both church and state and thus believe the freedoms guaranteed to us in the declaration of independence and the constitution belong to everyone regardless of their faith he further noted that the declaration of independence makes reference to god numerous times perhaps most famously in its conclusion in which the founders wrote for the support of this declaration with a firm reliance on the protection of divine providence we mutually pledge to each other our lives our fortunes and our sacred honor still land said that s a far cry from declaring america to be a christian nation i don t believe we were founded as a christian nation he said i believe we were founded by people who were christians or were operating out of a christian worldview in the declaration of independence they do not declare their independence from god they re just declaring their independence from great britain twelve of the 56 signers of the declaration of independence for instance were presbyterian including the sole clergyman signer john witherspoon for which reason many presbyterians today claim loyalists to king george iii saw the american revolution as a largely presbyterian rebellion witherspoon himself went on to help formalize the articles of confederation and the u s constitution paving the way for the birth of the u s federal government the establishment clause of the first amendment to the u s constitution prohibits the government from making any law respecting an establishment of religion and government actions that unduly favor one religion over another it also prohibits the government from unduly preferring religion over non religion or non religion over religion more than two centuries after an 1802 letter from president thomas jefferson to the danbury baptist association in connecticut in which jefferson famously described the first amendment as a wall of separation between church and state land and others contend that all the limitations in the first amendment are on the state not the people the amendment was intended land added to protect the church from the state two days after he sent the letter jefferson attended a church service conducted in the house of representatives five years before the first congress convened the capitol building was used as a church according to the library of congress the first services were held in the fall of 1800 in the north wing of the house within a year of his inauguration jefferson himself began attending church services at the capitol before he later famously created his own version of scripture to omit fundamental tenets of the faith including the resurrection of jesus christ in what might be the judiciary s most overt reference to america as a christian nation u s supreme court justice david brewer writing the majority decision in the 1892 casechurch of the holy trinity v united states noted the observance of the sabbath and other traditions as a clear recognition of faith in civic life these and many other matters which might be noticed add a volume of unofficial declarations to the mass of organic utterances that this is a christian nation wrote brewer it s that extensive confluence of christian faith and american history that according to land raises the question of defining exactly what is meant by phrases such as christian nationalist when people who are liberal try to label a christian nationalist as anybody who believes america has anything to do with god or that god has anything to do with america they re denying most of american history he said many of the founding fathers added land believed that god for some reason had a special interest in the united states of america john adams the country s second president who according to land had more to do with the constitution than anybody except james madison said in 1798 we have a government designed only for a moral and religious people it is insufficient for any other what he meant by that was if you re going to have limited government you ve got to have a majority of the population who are voluntarily obeying the law when nobody else is around because they are aware that they are accountable to a higher authority land said he pointed to puritan founder john winthrop who spoke about america as a city upon a hill a phrase echoed over 300 years later by president ronald reagan was a christian nationalist land asked abraham lincoln once called america the last best hope of earth one that the world will forever applaud and god must forever bless was he a christian nationalist again asked land as the u s lurched toward world war i woodrow wilson the son of a presbyterian minister spoke about fighting the war to end all wars was he a christian nationalist land asked rhetorically pointing to john f kennedy s inaugural address land said while the speech became well known for a number of reasons many overlook what kennedy said was the driving force behind our nation for man holds in his mortal hands the power to abolish all forms of human poverty and all forms of human life and yet the same revolutionary beliefs for which our forebears fought are still at issue around the globe the belief that the rights of man come not from the generosity of the state but from the hand of god that s pretty clear said land in fact with a handful of exceptions nearly every president in american history has been identified with protestant christianity yet with the exception of trump none of them have been historically accused of appealing to christian nationalist ideology 2016 presidential election when it comes to global use the term christian nationalism was relatively though not completely nonexistent for the first two decades of this millennium seeing only slight bumps during the george w bush administration part of that according to google is due to a lack of search engine data around the time of trump s election in november 2016 the term white nationalism a much more pejorative precursor to the more narrow christian nationalism saw a sharp rise in searches fueled in part by allegations of trump s support from white nationalist figures like david duke and william johnson the first significant spike in searches for christian nationalism came in august 2019 following a pair of mass shootings in el paso texas and dayton ohio but it wasn t until the u s capitol riot on jan 6 2021 that both search terms were seemingly conflated and the contemporary notion of christian nationalism seeped into the national consciousness outlets like huffpost ran articles suggesting the events of jan 6 which it described as an episode that was permeated with the symbols of christian nationalism were directly tied to the government allowing and even funding conservative christian education in the united states even more left leaning media sites such as vice reported hearing from christians around the country who said they ve witnessed their congregations lose focus and slide into christian nationalism even as churches grow older and whiter than before during a 2021 webinar hosted by christians against christian nationalism a coalition of faith leaders and organizations the progressive rev michael curry presiding bishop of the episcopal church said while he believes that there are innocent forms of christian nationalism he warned of a more virulent or dangerous kind that involves people viewing their country as god s favorite that borders on blasphemy idolatry argued curry that kind of nationalism is dangerous it is dangerous to civic health it is dangerous to the health of a christian progressive christian activist and author shane claiborne who is listed as one of the endorsers of christians against christian nationalism called on churches to remove the u s flag from their altars or consider adding the banners of other nations following the jan 6 violence to be part of the body of christ is to transcend nationality the red letter christians co founder and leading figure in the new monasticism movement argued that s part of what it means to be born again but land said while he s personally faced criticism for churches he s attended where both the american and christian flags were displayed there s never been any doubt about which one comes first every church i ve been in we understand the pecking order the ultimate flag is the christian flag he said land recalled memories of being a young boy in houston texas and being led to recite a pledge of allegiance to the u s flag the christian flag and the bible so why then do we have the american flag in church when there are so many people who come from other countries to our churches the reason is the american flag has never tried to persecute christians land said almost all of the other countries in the world at some point in time they have persecuted some kind of christians but in america the american flag has been the symbol of the first amendment which is about religious freedom and it s the first amendment for a reason all the other freedoms protect the first freedom which is the right to worship god as we please or not to worship him at all so i have no problem with the american flag being in churches the american flag is a symbol of soul freedom the corporate press since the events of jan 6 some of america s best known media outlets have published a number of stories referring to christian nationalism in relatively stark headlines including the far right christian quest for power the new york times christian nationalism is surging it wasn t inevitable the washington post christian nationalism is a threat and not just from capitol attackers invoking jesus usa today lynchburg revival activists warn of rising christian nationalism npr white christian nationalism is the most dangerous weapon in america newsweek trump s army of god doug mastriano and the christian nationalist attack on democracy salon while by no means a comprehensive list even such a relatively small sample of headlines underscore what land described as a southern poverty law center kind of attitude among the american media establishment toward patriotic christians land said the use of christian nationalist and nationalism is merely another attempt by the political left to label christians with what they see as a negative label the same way they tried to make cisgender a negative label basically if you believe in any sense that america has a unique role to play in the world and that god in his providence has had something to do with the united states then you re a christian nationalist then they start saying this is just for white people for land such a view both secular and otherwise is incompatible with american history he recalled one episode where our first president george washington wrote a letter to a jewish congregation in rhode island welcoming them not as guests but as fellow americans may the children of the stock of abraham who dwell in this land continue to merit and enjoy the good will of the other inhabitants washington wrote land said that sentiment is intrinsic to the fabric of our country we believe in religious freedom land said you re free to have your mosque you re free to have your shinto temple you re free to have your synagogue he pointed to a 2015 poll that found 62 of american adults believe in the notion of american exceptionalism that god has granted america a special role on the world stage we are not chosen nation but america is exceptional and god has blessed us in unique ways he said we are the recipients of divine providence divine blessing and blessing by definition is undeserved otherwise it would be called a reward no nation has been blessed by god more than the united states of america and that incurs certain obligations for land understanding christian nationalism or any other intended pejorative involving patriotism and faith should be viewed not through the lens of social media tribalism but in its historical context on the whole and it is on the whole that such questions must be answered american influence in the world has been a positive influence and not a negative influence wherever america s gone there s been more freedom been more respect for minorities more respect for women that s why so many people want to come here in fact land said it s the continued desire of people from all over the world trying to make their way to the u s that speaks to america s decidedly remarkable place in history i don t think it s christian nationalism to say america is a unique country he said every other country in the world is founded on blood and soil people of certain ethnicities people of a certain geographic location not the united states the united states is based upon an idea anybody can become an american facing opposition from ideological movements like critical race theory crt which according to land seeks to deconstruct american history and make america out to be an awful place land said now more than ever it s important for christians to push back against blanket descriptors like christian nationalism they should reject the term and replace it with things like patriotic american or someone who understands how unique the declaration of independence is he said it s not racist anybody can become an american and we ve demonstrated that by our history

washington afp western governments are mobilizing their arms manufacturers to ramp up production and replenish stockpiles heavily diminished by supplying ukraine s six month old battle against russia s invasion advertising read more us defense secretary lloyd austin announced this week a meeting of senior national armaments directors from allied countries to make long term plans for supplying ukraine and rebuilding their own arms reserves they will discuss how our defense industrial bases can best equip ukraine s future forces with the capabilities that they need he said at a meeting at ramstein air force base in germany of the ukraine contact group 50 countries currently supporting the war effort on friday the pentagon s arms acquisition chief bill laplante said the meeting would take place in brussels on september 28 the goal is to determine how we can continue to work together to ramp up production of key capabilities and resolve supply chain issues and increase interoperability and interchangeability of our systems laplante told reporters at the pentagon billions more for arms nato countries do not all have the same weapons but their arms are compatible so ammunition manufactured in one country in the atlantic alliance can be used by another at the start of the war ukraine s military mostly used weapons and munitions that matched russian standards but within a few months those were exhausted especially in crucial artillery and missile systems and it has grown to depend on western allies with nato standard arms but that in turn has drawn down large amounts of munitions the allies had kept for their own defense rebuilding those supplies is now crucial in july the european union announced 500 million euros for joint purchases over the next two years to replenish arms provided to kyiv the priority is more anti armor and anti aircraft missile systems and 155mm artillery pieces and ammunition eu countries have drawn on their stocks of ammunition light and heavy artillery anti aircraft and anti tank defense systems and even armored vehicles and tanks european commissioner thierry breton said at the time this has created a de facto vulnerability that now needs to be addressed urgently he warned the united states the primary defense supplier of ukraine since the war began has pledged 15 2 billion worth of weaponry including javelin anti tank missiles artillery and ammunition compatible with nato weaponry boosting production the pentagon has furnished some 800 000 155mm artillery rounds to ukraine while united states has just one factory making them the general dynamics plant in scranton pennsylvania that produces only 14 000 rounds a month we have plans to get that in increments ultimately up to 36 000 a month in about three years said laplante but that would take annual production to just over half of what washington has given the ukrainians in less than six months the pentagon wants allies to ramp up their own production lines to help replenish stockpiles the us military has recently announced a slew of new contracts with arms manufacturers inside and outside the united states to do this it includes 364 million for 250 000 rounds of 155mm artillery ammunition from multiple makers 624 million for stinger anti aircraft missiles 324 million for javelin anti tank missiles and millions more for other weapons systems ammunition and defense supplies dave butler spokesman for the pentagon s joint chiefs of staff said the decision is guided by but not determined specifically by us manufacturing capacities ukraine s needs for a given weapon are the ultimate driving factor he said 2022 afp

advocates of the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb give the impression that there would be no consumer protection without the cfpb yet congress established a viable consumer protection framework layered on top of similar state laws long before the 2010 dodd frank act created the cfpb in fact the bureau derived many of its powers from earlier laws federal agencies had regularly prosecuted crimes that violated consumer financial protections for years dodd frank simply took authority from approximately 50 existing rules and orders stemming from almost 20 federal consumer protection statutes and transferred it to the new bureau there was really no need to start up a brand new bureaucracy and the recent wells fargo case demonstrates how completely unnecessary the cfpb remains the case against the bank had already been made by other regulators the bureau was late to the party and simply piled on one could certainly argue that the pre dodd frank regulatory framework which spread financial regulatory responsibilities among many different agencies was suboptimal but there is overlapping regulatory authority throughout u s financial markets and it does not follow that creating yet another federal agency is the best solution and if consolidation in one agency is the answer why not transfer everything over to the federal trade commission the agency whose motto is protecting america s consumers regardless dodd frank did not consolidate everything the cfpb still shares consumer financial protection functions with several federal regulators including the ftc but dodd frank did more than merely transfer existing authority to the cfpb the pre dodd frank regime focused on protecting consumers from deceptive or unfair business practices congress went further by giving the cfpb authority to develop a new ill defined consumer protection concept abusive practices this construct runs counter to the american system of limited government the term is completely undefined in the u s code this policy allows the cfpb an unelected arm of the federal government to make up laws as it goes along the cfpb is not alone in this regard it is yet one more example of a disturbing trend that of congress creating regulatory agencies that are unaccountable to the public in any meaningful way yet empowered to essentially create laws by way of regulatory dictate to protect the american system of limited government all such federal agencies should be eliminated independent agencies able to create and enforce laws erode the constitutional protections of u s citizens fundamental liberties they also shield elected officials the legislators who are supposed to be responsible for making laws from accountability these problems are bad enough but the cfpb runs counter to limited government principles in other ways the bureau has independent litigation authority a single director removable only for cause a budget completely immune to the regular appropriations process broad judicial deference and an exemption from office of management and budget review of major rules no other federal regulator has that combination of characteristics and no federal agency should the cfpb approach also directly contradicts the basic principle of the free enterprise system that transactions entered into voluntarily create benefits for all those involved the cfpb simply is not designed to make rules for an economic system based on voluntary trade agreements rather it is designed to make rules for a coercive exploitative financial system the cfpb approach assumes that lenders regularly prey on helpless consumers tricking them into accepting ruinous financial contracts that they cannot possibly repay the idea that financial markets generally work in this manner defies logic the overwhelming majority of financial firms successfully find customers who can pay them back because it is the only way to make customers happy and stay in business for free enterprise to work government imposed rules have to start from this point of view as constructed the cfpb poses a danger to americans economic freedom

western arms production ramp ukraine burns stockpiles western governments are mobilizing their arms manufacturers to ramp up production and replenish stockpiles heavily diminished by supplying ukraine s six month old battle against russia s invasion us defense secretary lloyd austin announced this week a meeting of senior national armaments directors from allied countries to make long term plans for supplying ukraine and rebuilding their own arms reserves they will discuss how our defense industrial bases can best equip ukraine s future forces with the capabilities that they need he said at a meeting at ramstein air force base in germany of the ukraine contact group 50 countries currently supporting the war effort on friday the pentagon s arms acquisition chief bill laplante said the meeting would take place in brussels on september 28 the goal is to determine how we can continue to work together to ramp up production of key capabilities and resolve supply chain issues and increase interoperability and interchangeability of our systems laplante told reporters at the pentagon billions more for arms nato countries do not all have the same weapons but their arms are compatible so ammunition manufactured in one country in the atlantic alliance can be used by another at the start of the war ukraine s military mostly used weapons and munitions that matched russian standards but within a few months those were exhausted especially in crucial artillery and missile systems and it has grown to depend on western allies with nato standard arms but that in turn has drawn down large amounts of munitions the allies had kept for their own defense rebuilding those supplies is now crucial in july the european union announced 500 million euros for joint purchases over the next two years to replenish arms provided to kyiv the priority is more anti armor and anti aircraft missile systems and 155mm artillery pieces and ammunition eu countries have drawn on their stocks of ammunition light and heavy artillery anti aircraft and anti tank defense systems and even armored vehicles and tanks european commissioner thierry breton said at the time this has created a de facto vulnerability that now needs to be addressed urgently he warned the united states the primary defense supplier of ukraine since the war began has pledged 15 2 billion worth of weaponry including javelin anti tank missiles artillery and ammunition compatible with nato weaponry boosting production the pentagon has furnished some 800 000 155mm artillery rounds to ukraine while united states has just one factory making them the general dynamics plant in scranton pennsylvania that produces only 14 000 rounds a month we have plans to get that in increments ultimately up to 36 000 a month in about three years said laplante but that would take annual production to just over half of what washington has given the ukrainians in less than six months the pentagon wants allies to ramp up their own production lines to help replenish stockpiles the us military has recently announced a slew of new contracts with arms manufacturers inside and outside the united states to do this it includes 364 million for 250 000 rounds of 155mm artillery ammunition from multiple makers 624 million for stinger anti aircraft missiles 324 million for javelin anti tank missiles and millions more for other weapons systems ammunition and defense supplies dave butler spokesman for the pentagon s joint chiefs of staff said the decision is guided by but not determined specifically by us manufacturing capacities

congress has spoken when it comes to next year s pentagon budget and the results if they weren t so in line with past practices should astonish us all the house of representatives voted to add 37 billion and the senate 45 billion to the administration s already humongous request for national defense a staggering figure that includes both the pentagon budget and work on nuclear weapons at the department of energy if enacted the senate s sum would push spending on the military to at least 850 billion annually far more adjusted for inflation than at the height of the korean or vietnam wars or the peak years of the cold war u s military spending is of course astronomically high more than that of the next nine countries combined here s the kicker though the pentagon an institution that has never passed a comprehensive financial audit doesn t even ask for all those yearly spending increases in its budget requests to congress instead the house and senate continue to give it extra tens of billions of dollars annually no matter that secretary of defense lloyd austin has publicly stated the pentagon has all it needs to get the capabilities to support our operational concepts without such sums it would be one thing if such added funding were at least crafted in line with a carefully considered defense strategy more often than not though much of it goes to multibillion dollar weapons projects being built in the districts or states of key lawmakers or for items on pentagon wish lists formally known as unfunded priorities lists it s unclear how such items can be priorities when they haven t even made it into the pentagon s already enormous official budget request in addition throwing yet more money at a department incapable of managing its current budget only further strains its ability to meet program goals and delivery dates in other words it actually impairs military readiness whatever limited fiscal discipline the pentagon has dissipates further when lawmakers arbitrarily increase its budget despite rampant mismanagement leading to persistent cost overruns and delivery delays on the military s most expensive and sometimes least well conceived weapons programs in short parochial concerns and special interest politics regularly trump anything that might pass as in the national interest while doing no favors to the safety and security of the united states in the end most of those extra funds simply pad the bottom lines of major weapons contractors like lockheed martin and raytheon technologies they certainly don t help our servicemembers as congressional supporters of higher pentagon budgets routinely claim a captured congress the leading advocates of more pentagon spending democrats and republicans alike generally act to support major contractors in their jurisdictions representative jared golden d me a co sponsor of the house armed services committee proposal to add 37 billion to the pentagon budget typically made sure it included funds for a 2 billion guided missile destroyer to be built at general dynamics shipyard in bath maine similarly his co sponsor representative elaine luria d va whose district abuts huntington ingalls industries newport news shipyard successfully advocated for the inclusion of ample funding to produce aircraft carriers and attack submarines at that complex or consider representative mike rogers r al the ranking republican on the house armed services committee and a dogged advocate of annually increasing the pentagon budget by at least 3 to 5 above inflation he serves a district south of huntsville alabama dubbed rocket city because it s the home to so many firms that work on missile defense and related projects there are even special congressional caucuses devoted solely to increasing pentagon spending while fending off challenges to specific weapons systems these range from the house shipbuilding and f 35 caucuses to the senate icbm coalition that coalition has been especially effective at keeping spending on a future land based intercontinental ballistic missile dubbed the sentinel on track while defeating efforts to significantly reduce the number of icbms in the u s arsenal such success has come thanks to the stalwart support of senators from montana north dakota utah and wyoming all states with icbm bases or involved in major icbm development and maintenance the jobs card is the strongest tool of influence available to the arms industry in its efforts to keep congress eternally boosting pentagon spending but far from the only one after all the industrial part of the military industrial congressional complex gave more than 35 million in campaign contributions to members of congress in 2020 the bulk of it going to those on the armed services and defense appropriations committees who have the most sway over the pentagon budget and what it will be spent on so far in the 2022 election cycle weapons firms have already donated 3 4 million to members of the house armed services committee according to an analysis by open secrets org an organization that tracks campaign spending and political influence weapons making corporations also currently employ nearly 700 lobbyists more than one for every member of congress while spending additional millions to support industry friendly think tanks that regularly push higher pentagon spending and a more hawkish foreign policy the arms industry has another lever to pull as well when it comes to the personal finances of lawmakers there are scant if any restrictions against members of congress owning or trading defense company stocks even those who sit on influential national security related committees in other words it s completely legal for them to marry their personal financial interests to those of defense contractors the cost of coddling contractors legislators arbitrarily inflate pentagon spending despite clear evidence of corporate greed and repeated failures when it comes to the development of new weapons systems under the circumstances it should be no surprise that weapons acquisitions are on the government accountability office s high risk list given their enduring vulnerability to waste and mismanagement in fact overfunding an already struggling department only contributes to the development of shoddy products it allows the pentagon to fund programs before they ve been thoroughly tested and evaluated far from strengthening national defense such lawmakers only reinforce the unbridled greed of weapons contractors in the process they ensure future acquisition disasters in fact much of the funding congress adds to the pentagon budget will be wasted on price gouging cost overruns and outright fraud the most notorious recent case is that of the transdigm group which overcharged the government up to 3 850 for a spare part for one weapons system and 10 to 100 times too much for others the total lost at least 20 8 million and those figures were based on just a sampling of two and a half years of that company s sales to the government nor was it the first time transdigm had been caught price gouging the pentagon such practices are in fact believed to be typical of many defense contractors a full accounting of such overcharges would undoubtedly amount to billions of dollars annually then there are weapons systems like lockheed martin s f 35 fighter aircraft and that same company s littoral combat ship lcs both are costly programs that have proven incapable of carrying out their assigned missions the f 35 is slated to cost the american taxpayer a staggering 1 7 trillion over its life cycle making it the most expensive single weapons program ever despite problems with its engine performance maintenance and basic combat capabilities both the house and the senate added even more of them than the pentagon requested to their latest budget plans house armed services committee chair adam smith d wa famously remarked that he was tired of throwing money down that particular rat hole but then argued that the f 35 program was too far along to cancel its endurance has in fact forced the pentagon to restart older jet fighter production lines like the f 15 developed in the 1970s to pick up the slack if the u s is going to be forced to buy older fighters anyway cutting the f 35 could instantly save 200 billion in procurement funding meanwhile the lcs a ship without a mission that can t even defend itself in combat nonetheless continues to be protected by advocates like representative joe courtney d ct co chair of the house shipbuilding caucus the final house and senate authorization bills prevented the navy from retiring five of the nine lcs s that the service had hoped to decommission on the grounds that they would be useless in a potential military faceoff with china a conflict that should be avoided in any case given the potentially devastating consequences of a war between two nuclear armed powers no surprise then that a substantial part of the tens of billions of dollars congress is adding to the latest pentagon budget will directly benefit major weapons contractors at the expense of military personnel in the house version of the military spending bill 25 billion more than two thirds of its additional funding is earmarked for weapons procurement and research that will primarily benefit arms contractors only 1 billion of the added funds will be devoted to helping military personnel and their families even as many of them struggle to find affordable housing or maintain an adequate standard of living in fact one in six military families is now food insecure a devastating reflection of the pentagon s true priorities in all the top five weapons contractors lockheed martin raytheon boeing general dynamics and northrop grumman split more than 200 billion in defense revenue in the last fiscal year mostly from the pentagon but also from lucrative foreign arms sales the new budget proposals will only boost those already astounding figures pushing back on contractor greed congress has shown little intent to decouple itself in any way from what s still known as the defense industry there is however a clear path to do so if the people s representatives were to band together and start pushing back against the greed of weapons contractors some lawmakers have begun making moves to prevent price gouging while improving weapons buying practices the senate armed services committee for instance included in its version of the defense budget a provision to establish a program that would improve contractor performance through financial incentives its goal is to make the pentagon a smarter buyer by addressing two main issues delivery delays and cost overruns especially by companies that charge it above market prices to pad their bottom lines it would also curb the ability of contractors to overcharge on replacement parts and materials the program to prevent further price gouging has a couple of possible paths to president biden s desk senator elizabeth warren d ma and representative john garamendi d ca also included it in the bicameral stop price gouging the military act an ambitious proposal to protect the pentagon from outrageous contractor overcharges the bill would close loopholes in existing law that allow companies to eternally rip off the defense department there are obviously all too many obstacles in the path of eliminating moneyed interests from defense policy but creating an incentive structure to improve contractor performance and transparency would at least be a necessary first step it might also spur greater public input into such policy making secrecy inc here s the sad reality of the national security state we taxpayers will fork over nearly a trillion and a half dollars this year in national security spending and yet the policy making process behind such outlays will essentially remain out of our control the senate armed services committee typically debates and discusses its version of the national defense authorization act ndaa behind closed doors the subcommittee hearings open to the public rarely last and yes this is not a mistake more than 15 minutes naturally the house and senate will reconcile any differences between their versions in secret too in other words there s little transparency when it comes to the seemingly blank check our representatives write for our defense every year sadly such a system allows lawmakers too many of whom maintain financial stakes in the defense industry to deliberate over pentagon spending and other national security matters without real public input at the pentagon in fact crucial information isn t just kept private it s actively suppressed and the situation has only gotten worse over the years here s just one example of that process in january 2022 its office of the director of operational test evaluation issued an annual report on weapons costs and performance for the first time in more than 30 years however it excluded nearly all the basic information needed to assess the pentagon s weapons buying process redacting information about 22 major acquisition programs the director treated data once routinely shared as if it were classified given the pentagon s rocky track record when it comes to overfunding and under testing weapons it s easy enough to imagine why its officials would work so hard to keep unclassified information private scamming the taxpayer has become a way of life for the national security state we deserve a more transparent democratic policy making process our elected officials owe us their allegiance not the defense industry giants that make such hefty campaign contributions while beefing up lawmakers stock

in the 1970s i met one of hitler s leading propagandists leni riefenstahl whose epic films glorified the nazis we happened to be staying at the same lodge in kenya where she was on a photography assignment having escaped the fate of other friends of the fuhrer she told me that the patriotic messages of her films were dependent not on orders from above but on what she called the submissive void of the german public did that include the liberal educated bourgeoisie i asked yes especially them she said i think of this as i look around at the propaganda now consuming western societies of course we are very different from germany in the 1930s we live in information societies we are globalists we have never been more aware more in touch better connected are we or do we live in a media society where brainwashing is insidious and relentless and perception is filtered according to the needs and lies of state and corporate power the united states dominates the western world s media all but one of the top ten media companies are based in north america the internet and social media google twitter facebook are mostly american owned and controlled in my lifetime the us has overthrown or attempted to overthrow more than 50 governments mostly democracies it has interfered in democratic elections in 30 countries it has dropped bombs on the people of 30 countries most of them poor and defenceless it has attempted to murder the leaders of 50 countries it has fought to suppress liberation movements in 20 countries the extent and scale of this carnage is largely unreported unrecognised and those responsible continue to dominate anglo american political life in the years before he died in 2008 the playwright harold pinter made two extraordinary speeches which broke a silence us foreign policy he said is best defined as follows kiss my arse or i ll kick your head in it is as simple and as crude as that what is interesting about it is that it s so incredibly successful it possesses the structures of disinformation use of rhetoric distortion of language which are very persuasive but are actually a pack of lies it is very successful propaganda they have the money they have the technology they have all the means to get away with it and they do in accepting the nobel prize for literature pinter said this the crimes of the united states have been systematic constant vicious remorseless but very few people have actually talked about them you have to hand it to america it has exercised a quite clinical manipulation of power worldwide while masquerading as a force for universal good it s a brilliant even witty highly successful act of hypnosis pinter was a friend of mine and possibly the last great political sage that is before dissenting politics were gentrified i asked him if the hypnosis he referred to was the submissive void described by leni riefenstahl it s the same he replied it means the brainwashing is so thorough we are programmed to swallow a pack of lies if we don t recognise propaganda we may accept it as normal and believe it that s the submissive void in our systems of corporate democracy war is an economic necessity the perfect marriage of public subsidy and private profit socialism for the rich capitalism for the poor the day after 9 11 the stock prices of the war industry soared more bloodshed was coming which is great for business today the most profitable wars have their own brand they are called forever wars afghanistan palestine iraq libya yemen and now ukraine all are based on a pack of lies iraq is the most infamous with its weapons of mass destruction that didn t exist nato s destruction of libya in 2011 was justified by a massacre in benghazi that didn t happen afghanistan was a convenient revenge war for 9 11 which had nothing to do with the people of afghanistan today the news from afghanistan is how evil the taliban are not that joe biden s theft of 7billion of the country s bank reserves is causing widespread suffering recently national public radio in washington devoted two hours to afghanistan and 30 seconds to its starving people at its summit in madrid in june nato which is controlled by the us adopted a strategy document that militarises the european continent and escalates the prospect of war with russia and china it proposes multi domain warfighting against nuclear armed peer competitor in other words nuclear war it says nato s enlargement has been an historic success i read that in disbelief a measure of this historic success is the war in ukraine news of which is mostly not news but a one sided litany of jingoism distortion omission i have reported a number of wars and have never known such blanket propaganda in february russia invaded ukraine as a response to almost eight years of killing and criminal destruction in the russian speaking region of donbass on their border in 2014 the us had sponsored a coup in kyiv that got rid of ukraine s democratically elected russian friendly president and installed a successor whom the americans made clear was their man in recent years american defender missiles have been installed in eastern europe poland slovenia the czech republic almost certainly aimed at russia accompanied by false assurances all the way back to james baker s promise to gorbachev in february 1990 that nato would never expand beyond germany ukraine is the frontline nato has effectively reached the very borderland through which hitler s army stormed in 1941 leaving more than 23 million dead in the soviet union last december russia proposed a far reaching security plan for europe this was dismissed derided or suppressed in the western media who read its step by step proposals on february 24 ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy threatened to develop nuclear weapons unless america armed and protected ukraine this was the final straw on the same day russia invaded according to the western media an unprovoked act of congenital infamy the history the lies the peace proposals the solemn agreements on donbass at minsk counted for nothing on april 25 the us defence secretary general lloyd austin flew into kyiv and confirmed that america s aim was to destroy the russian federation the word he used was weaken america had got the war it wanted waged by an american bankrolled and armed proxy and expendable pawn almost none of this was explained to western audiences russia s invasion of ukraine is wanton and inexcusable it is a crime to invade a sovereign country there are no buts except one when did the present war in ukraine begin and who started it according to the united nations between 2014 and this year some 14 000 people have been killed in the kyiv regime s civil war on the donbass many of the attacks were carried out by neo nazis watch an itv news report from may 2014 by the veteran reporter james mates who is shelled along with civilians in the city of mariupol by ukraine s azov neo nazi battalion in the same month dozens of russian speaking people were burned alive or suffocated in a trade union building in odessa besieged by fascist thugs the followers of the nazi collaborator and anti semitic fanatic stephen bandera the new york times called the thugs nationalists the historic mission of our nation in this critical moment said andreiy biletsky founder of the azov battaltion is to lead the white races of the world in a final crusade for their survival a crusade against the semite led untermenschen since february a campaign of self appointed news monitors mostly funded by the americans and british with links to governments have sought to maintain the absurdity that ukraine s neo nazis don t exist airbrushing a term once associated with stalin s purges has become a tool of mainstream journalism in less than a decade a good china has been airbrushed and a bad china has replaced it from the world s workshop to a budding new satan much of this propaganda originates in the us and is transmitted through proxies and think tanks such as the notorious australian strategic policy institute the voice of the arms industry and by zealous journalists such as peter hartcher of the sydney morning herald who labeled those spreading chinese influence as rats flies mosquitoes and sparrows and called for these pests to be eradicated news about china in the west is almost entirely about the threat from beijing airbrushed are the 400 american military bases that surround most of china an armed necklace that reaches from australia to the pacific and south east asia japan and korea the japanese island of okinawa and the korean island of jeju are loaded guns aimed point blank at the industrial heart of china a pentagon official described this as a noose palestine has been misreported for as long as i can remember to the bbc there is the conflict of two narratives the longest most brutal lawless military occupation in modern times is unmentionable the stricken people of yemen barely exist they are media unpeople while the saudis rain down their american cluster bombs with british advisors working alongside the saudi targeting officers more than half a million children face starvation this brainwashing by omission has a long history the slaughter of the first world war was suppressed by reporters who were knighted for their compliance and confessed in their memoirs in 1917 the editor of the manchester guardian c p scott confided to prime minister lloyd george if people really knew the war would be stopped tomorrow but they don t know and can t know the refusal to see people and events as those in other countries see them is a media virus in the west as debilitating as covid 19 it is as if we see the world through a one way mirror in which we are moral and benign and they are not it is a profoundly imperial view the history that is a living presence in china and russia is rarely explained and rarely understood vladimir putin is adolf hitler xi jinping is fu man chu epic achievements such as the eradication of abject poverty in china are barely known how perverse and squalid this is when will we allow ourselves to understand training journalists factory style is not the answer neither is the wondrous digital tool which is a means not an end like the one finger typewriter and the linotype machine in recent years some of the best journalists have been eased out of the mainstream defenestrated is the word used the spaces once open to mavericks to journalists who went against the grain truth tellers have closed the case of julian assange is the most shocking when julian and wikileaks could win readers and prizes for the guardian the new york times and other self important papers of record he was celebrated when the dark state objected and demanded the destruction of hard drives and the assassination of julian s character he was made a public enemy vice president biden called him a hi tech terrorist hillary clinton asked can t we just drone this guy the ensuing campaign of abuse and vilification against julian assange the united nations rapporteur on torture called it mobbing brought the liberal press to its lowest ebb we know who they are i think of them as collaborators as vichy journalists when will real journalists stand up an inspirational samizdat already exists on the internet consortium news

soaked for 82 years in a deep bath of righteousness that is the official version of the last world war isn t it time those who are meant to keep the record straight declared their independence and decoded the propaganda the urgency is greater than ever
