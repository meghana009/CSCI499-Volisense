company settles sec charges for failure to register crypto lending product a company settled with the sec and the north american securities administrators association nasaa for failing to register the offers and sales of its retail crypto lending product in its order the sec found that the company had offered and sold certain interest bearing accounts to investors through the accounts the investors loaned crypto assets to the company in exchange for the company s promise to provide a variable monthly interest payment the sec found that the accounts were securities that were subject to registration under the securities act of 1933 and did not benefit from any sec registration exemption additionally the sec found that the company operated as an unregistered investment company and made materially false and misleading statements concerning the risks associated with its lending activity the sec determined that the the company violated sections 5 a sale or delivery after sale of unregistered securities 5 c necessity of filing registration statement 17 a 2 and 17 a 3 use of interstate commerce for purpose of fraud or deceit of the securities act and sections 3 a 2 definitions of investment securities and 7 a prohibition of transactions in interstate commerce of the investment company act the company agreed to i cease its unregistered offers and sales and attempt to bring its business within the provisions of the investment company act and the securities act ii pay a 50 million penalty and iii comply with the undertakings detailed in the order the company also agreed to pay an additional 50 million penalty to 32 states for the same conduct according to the nasaa press release discussing the charges the company is alleged to have failed to comply with state registration requirements and as a result investors were sold unregistered securities in violation of state law the 50 million penalty will be evenly divided amongst the members of nasaa commissioner hester peirce dissented from the sec s enforcement action stating that she does not believe the approach the sec is taking with respect to crypto lending is the best way to protect crypto lending customers ms peirce stated that the 100 million penalty for the company seems disproportionate in light of the absence of any allegations from the sec that the company failed to pay its customers the money due them or to return the crypto assets that were lent she argued that while the portion of the settlement aimed at getting important information to customers is more understandable from a retail protection standpoint it is worth questioning whether a framework other than the securities regulatory framework might be better suited to getting customers transparency around the terms and risks of crypto lending products ms peirce concluded that the settlement may have unfortunate consequences including preventing retail crypto lending products from being offered to customers in the united states she emphasized that registration is often a months long iterative process and that the sec should work with crypto lending companies to craft sensible timely and achievable regulatory paths to compliance with the securities laws commentary by steven lofchie the sec should reconsider its regulation of digital assets see cabinet commentary the securities law treatment of utility tokens as in the coinbase case the sec found that the offering here was clearly a security under reves v ernst young if the sec takes other firms offering similar products to court the sec is going to win that said the sec should be more willing to engage on the application of the securities laws to digital assets until it does so market participants have a limited number of strategies available to them i fully comply with the securities laws acknowledging that they were not written for digital assets ii have a more reasonable position that the product is not a security or iii fly under the radar and hope for the best an issuer that does not meet either of the first two tests and becomes big and successful is going to be in the sec s crosshairs court affirms occ and fdic authority on valid when made rules the u s district court of the northern district of california granted summary judgment in favor of the occ and fdic respectively the agencies affirming their rulemaking authority and the agencies valid when made rules the court affirmed the agencies interpretation of federal banking law to allow for the valid when made doctrine which posits that the interest on a loan permissible before transfer continues to be permissible afterward the court rulings also clarified that a loan s interest rate remains legally intact if the loan is sold by so holding the court affirmed the valid when made doctrine and satisfied due deference to agency authority under chevron u s a inc v natural resources defense inc the agencies had issued the rules in response to the madden v midland funding llc decision from the u s court of appeals for the second circuit which cast doubt on the interest rate allowed on loans sold by national banks and fdic insured state banks

also more importantly for consumers who would ultimately bear the brunt of continued threats to the secondary market investment firm seeks to list double leveraged etfs based on single stocks in a registration filing with the sec an investment firm is seeking approval of a series of double leveraged bullish and bearish exchange traded funds etfs that each track the performance of a single u s listed equity security according to the filing the funds intend to provide daily returns that are two times the daily return or two times the inverse daily return of a single underlying u s equity

global financial institutions and may invest between 40 and 80 of a fund s portfolio in collateral investments e g u s government securities and money market funds axs is seeking sec approval to list these etfs on an exchange to be determined commentary by nick allen though 2x and 3x daily and daily inverse leveraged etfs are common these would be the first u s listed etfs to track a single equity security rather than a more broad based market or market segment if the popularity of existing daily leveraged etfs among retail investors and continued growth of retail options activity are any indication then demand for products like the funds could be high nevertheless despite daily leveraged etfs popularity the sec and finra have raised concerns about such products and the concentration risk implicit in these funds and generally higher volatility of single stocks as compared to broader benchmarks could magnify those concerns compliance officer settles finra charges for aml failures a registered representative and compliance supervisor respondent settled finra charges for improper supervision of his firm s aml program in a finra letter of acceptance waiver and consent finra found that the respondent failed to i implement and monitor the firm s aml program ii supervise aml staff iii perform required reviews of surveillance reports iv file suspicious activity reports and v

sec office of investor education and advocacy and the division of enforcement retail strategy task force warned investors about the risks associated with accounts that pay interest on crypto asset deposits in an investor bulletin the sec explained the difference between the protections that are afforded to investors in interest bearing accounts with bank or credit unions and interest bearing accounts for crypto assets the sec warned to not expect the same level of security safety and soundness with crypto asset interest bearing accounts the bulletin identified some of the risks to which investors may be exposed volatility and illiquidity in the crypto asset markets potential failure or bankruptcy of the company holding investor crypto assets unpredictability including that the market for a particular crypto asset may disappear altogether or that the crypto asset may no longer be tradable anywhere changes in regulation by federal state or foreign governments that may restrict the

recurring items when used as a supplement to financial performance measures that are prepared in accordance with gaap these items result from facts and circumstances that vary in frequency and impact on continuing operations management uses these non gaap financial measures in order to evaluate the operating performance of the company and compare it against past periods make operating decisions and serve as a basis for strategic planning these non gaap financial measures provide management with additional means to understand and evaluate the operating results and trends in our ongoing business by eliminating certain non cash expenses and other items that management believes might otherwise make comparisons of our ongoing business with prior periods more difficult obscure trends in ongoing operations or reduce management s ability to make useful forecasts in addition management understands that some investors and financial analysts find these non gaap financial measures helpful

financial performance in addition management may use adjusted ebitda non gaap net income and or non gaap eps to measure the achievement of performance objectives under the company s stock and cash incentive programs note however that these non gaap financial measures are performance measures only and they do not provide any measure of cash flow or liquidity non gaap financial measures are not alternatives for measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap and may be different from similarly titled non gaap measures presented by other companies limiting their usefulness as comparative measures non gaap financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with gaap

company records of 2 17 billion both company records repurchased approximately 7 5 million shares for 490 million during the fourth quarter effectively completing the 1 billion share repurchase authorization that expired december 31 2021 the u s department of commerce commerce made preliminary determinations in january 2022 that russian urea ammonium nitrate uan imports are dumped into the u s at margins ranging from 9 15 to 127 19 and that trinidadian uan imports are dumped into the u s at a margin of 63 08 the cf industries team delivered outstanding results in 2021 as strong global nitrogen demand lower global operating rates and favorable energy spreads drove company record free cash generation said tony will president and chief executive officer cf industries holdings inc we expect global nitrogen fundamentals to remain positive underpinned by the need to replenish global grains stocks increased economic activity and global energy dynamics we are well positioned to continue to drive strong cash generation enabling us to invest in our clean energy initiatives return substantial capital to shareholders and achieve our goal of 3 billion of gross debt by 2023 nitrogen market outlook management expects the global nitrogen supply and demand balance to remain tight for the foreseeable future and for the commercial environment to be highly favorable for producers in low cost regions global nitrogen inventory entering 2022 is believed to be low following a year of strong demand and lower production due to the impact of energy related production curtailments and shutdowns in europe weather related disruptions in north america and stagnant production levels in countries such as india high energy prices in europe and asia along with ongoing restrictions on exports of certain nitrogen products from russia egypt turkey and china suggest global nitrogen supply will continue to be challenged at the same time management expects global demand for nitrogen to remain robust the need to replenish global grains stocks continues to support high front month and forward prices for nitrogen consuming crops these crop prices support high levels of planting and incentivize fertilizer application additionally increased economic activity continues to drive strong demand for diesel exhaust fluid for emissions abatement as well as ammonia urea and nitric acid for industrial uses energy differentials between europe and asia versus low cost regions remain significant this has steepened the global nitrogen cost curve and increased margin opportunities for low cost north american producers forward curves suggest that these favorable energy spreads will persist throughout 2022 and into 2023 north america management projects corn plantings in the united states will be 91 to 93 million acres in 2022 based on positive economic returns for farmers and a robust fall ammonia application season the company believes that other nitrogen consuming crops wheat cotton and canola will be planted at high levels in 2022 as well industrial activity in the region continues to increase in line with economic activity supporting further demand for nitrogen products india urea imports to india from april december 2021 were approximately 2 million metric tons lower and domestic urea production was flat compared to the same time period in 2020 published reports indicate that this lower than expected level of imports and domestic production has resulted in low urea inventory levels in india a new urea tender for india was issued in january and management expects india will tender regularly in the coming months to meet urea demand in the country which is projected to remain strong brazil south america strong global corn prices coupled with drought conditions in southern brazil and argentina which has reduced production forecasts for the current first crop corn support higher planted corn acres in 2022 and continued strong demand for nitrogen and urea imports europe a substantial supply of liquefied natural gas cargoes rerouted to europe in january 2022 allowed energy prices in the region to moderate from record highs though they remain elevated compared to the prior year forward curves for natural gas in europe remain above historical norms challenging producer profitability and likely resulting in continued lower operating rates in the region china urea exports from china are expected to be limited through at least the first half of 2022 as the chinese government has implemented measures to discourage urea exports and promote the availability and affordability of fertilizers domestically additionally published reports indicate that the chinese government has issued supply contracts to build temporary reserves for summer application it is estimated that over 1 million metric tons of urea could be accumulated for the country s first ever summer fertilizer reserve plan operations overview

full year 2021 were 6 5 billion compared to 4 1 billion for 2020 average selling prices for 2021 were higher than 2020 across all segments due to strong global demand as well as decreased global supply availability as higher global energy costs drove lower global operating rates sales volumes for 2021 were lower than 2020 due to lower supply availability from higher than typical maintenance activity two significant weather related production outages and production curtailments at the company s u k plants due to high natural gas costs cost of sales for 2021 was higher compared to 2020 due to higher natural gas costs and higher maintenance costs partially offset by the impact of lower sales volumes and the gain the company recognized from the net settlement of certain natural gas contracts with suppliers during february 2021 the average cost of natural gas reflected in the company s cost of sales was 4 21 per mmbtu 4 compared to 2 24 per mmbtu for 2020 fourth quarter 2021

our future results of operations and financial condition include but are not limited to unanticipated developments in any one or more of the following areas as well as other factors which may be detailed from time to time in our securities and exchange commission filings general economic conditions such as customer inventory levels interest rates borrowing ability and economic conditions in the manufacturing and or distribution industries generally as well as government spending levels will continue to impact our business the temporary closing of many businesses and reduced business activity during the coronavirus pandemic has negatively impacted the general economy and decreased customer purchasing volume generally which negatively affected our business and may do so in future quarters until general business activity reaches pre pandemic levels additionally governmental mandated shutdowns of or restrictions on entities deemed to be non essential businesses has negatively impacted sales of our products to those businesses and will continue to impact our sales as long as these restrictions are in place the extent to which the coronavirus pandemic continues to impact our operations and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors including the duration of the pandemic our ability to keep our distribution centers operating productively and with minimal down time for coronavirus safety and remediation efforts governmental actions such as stay at home or shelter in place regulations or guidelines that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic the impact duration and severity of the pandemic on economic activity how long it will take to return to more historic levels of economic growth and the effect of the economic downturn on our customers and customer demand for our products factors affecting the global supply chain and the shipping and distribution of products imported to the united states by us or our domestic vendors such as extreme weather conditions global availability of shipping containers port congestion and freight and fuel costs have adversely impacted our results and could continue to do so these increases in freight and shipping costs have from time to time impacted our margins to the extent the increases could not be passed along to customers in a timely manner and may impact our margins again in the future our reliance on common carrier delivery services for shipping inventoried merchandise to customers and our reliance on drop ship deliveries directly to customers by our product vendors for products we do not hold in inventory has also been adversely affected by these supply chain challenges delays in the timely availability of products from our suppliers could delay receipt of needed product and result in lost sales in this regard global supply chains and the timely availability of products particularly products or product components used in domestic manufacturing imported from china and other asian nations as well as from other countries have been and in the future could continue to be adversely affected by allocation restrictions of difficult to source products by our vendors the imposition of tariffs and other trade barriers as well as retaliatory trade measures have caused us to raise the prices on certain of our products and seek alternate sources of supply which could negatively impact our sales or disrupt our operations in the future if we are not able to mitigate these measures our use of alternate sources of supply such as utilizing new vendors in additional countries entails various risks such as identifying vetting and managing new business relationships reliance on new vendors and maintaining quality control over their products and protecting our intellectual property rights quarantines factory slowdowns or shutdowns border closings and travel restrictions resulting from the coronavirus pandemic have in the past and could in the future adversely affect the timely availability of products resulting in delayed or lost sales liquidity constraints on our vendors or customers our ability to maintain available capacity in our distribution operations for stocked inventory and to enable on time shipment and deliveries such as by timely implementing additional temporary or permanent distribution resources whether in the form of additional facilities we operate or by outsourcing certain functions to third party distribution and logistics partners we compete with other companies for recruiting training integrating and retaining talented and experienced employees particularly in markets where we and they have central distribution facilities this aspect of competition is aggravated by the current tight labor market in the u s which is also undergoing competitive changes due to the coronavirus pandemic risks involved with e commerce including possible loss of business and customer dissatisfaction if outages or other computer related problems should preclude customer access to our products and services our information systems and other technology platforms supporting our sales procurement and other operations are critical to our operations and disruptions or delays have occurred and could occur in the future and if not timely addressed could have a material adverse effect on us a data security breach due to our e commerce data storage or other information systems being hacked by those seeking to steal company vendor employee or customer information or due to employee error resulting in disruption to our operations litigation and or loss of reputation or business managing various inventory risks such as being unable to profitably resell excess or obsolete inventory and or the loss of product return rights from our vendors meeting credit card industry compliance standards in order to maintain our ability to accept credit cards rising interest rates increased borrowing costs or limited credit availability including our own ability to maintain satisfactory credit agreements and to renew credit facilities could impact both our and our customers ability to fund purchases and conduct operations in the ordinary course pending or threatened litigation and investigations and other government actions such as anti dumping unclaimed property or trade and customs actions have occurred in the past and although had no material impact to our business could adversely affect our business and results of operation in the future and extreme weather conditions could disrupt our product supply chain and our ability to ship or receive products which would adversely impact sales investor media contacts mike smargiassi the plunkett group 212 739 6729 mike theplunkettgroup com

president joe biden on tuesday said the u s has not yet verified russia s claim that some of its forces have withdrawn from the ukraine border and said an invasion of ukraine remains a distinct possibility by associated press cbs news president joe biden on tuesday said the u s has not yet verified russia s claim that some of its forces have withdrawn from the ukraine border and said an invasion of ukraine remains a distinct possibility biden made the remarks at the white house hours after russia announced that some units participating in military exercises near ukraine s borders would begin returning to their bases russian president vladimir putin earlier tuesday said russia was ready for talks with the united states and nato on military transparency missile deployment limits and other security issues but biden continued to express skepticism about russia s intentions biden warned again that if russia invades ukraine the u s will rally the world to oppose its aggression this is a breaking news update ap s earlier story follows below russia said tuesday that some units participating in military exercises would begin returning to their bases adding to glimmers of hope that the kremlin may not be planning to invade ukraine imminently but it gave no details on where the troops were pulling back from or how many that muddied efforts to determine the significance of the announcement which buoyed world financial markets and the long suffering ruble after weeks of escalation in europe s worst east west standoff in decades it came a day after russia s foreign minister indicated the country was ready to keep talking about the security grievances that led to the ukraine crisis a gesture that changed the tenor after weeks of tensions yet hours before the russian defense ministry statement about the troops a u s defense official said russian units were moving closer to the ukrainian border not away from it and western officials continued to warn tuesday that the russian military could attack at any time with some floating wednesday as a possible invasion day the fears of an invasion grew from the fact that russia has massed more than 130 000 troops near ukraine russia denies it has any such plans despite placing troops on ukraine s borders to the north south and east and launching massive military drills nearby u s and other nato allies meanwhile have moved troops and military supplies toward ukraine s western flank and promised more financial aid to the ex soviet nation in announcing the pullback the russian defense ministry did not indicate where the troops had been deployed or how many were leaving asked about the announcement foreign minister sergey lavrov stressed that russia holds military drills on its own territory and according to its own plans they start go on and end as planned the minister said such drills always adhered to a schedule regardless of who thinks what and who gets hysterical about it who is deploying real informational terrorism ukraine s leaders expressed skepticism about the pullback russia constantly makes various statements ukrainian foreign minister dmytro kuleba said that s why we have the rule we won t believe when we hear we ll believe when we see when we see troops pulling out we ll believe in de escalation european leaders have been scrambling to try to head off a new war on their continent after several tense weeks that have left europeans feeling caught between russia and the u s and further pushed up household energy prices because of europe s dependence on russian gas german chancellor olaf scholz met tuesday with russian president vladimir putin in moscow a day after sitting down with ukraine s leader in kyiv in his opening remarks in the kremlin scholz addressed the ukraine tensions but also noted germany s economic ties with russia which complicate western efforts to agree on how to punish russia in case of an invasion foreign minister zbigniew rau of poland one of russia s most strident european critics met in moscow on tuesday with lavrov and they discussed ways to use the organization for security and cooperation in europe for more talks aimed at easing tensions around ukraine the day before lavrov suggested more efforts at diplomacy in a made for tv meeting with putin that seemed designed to send a message to the world about the russian leader s position the foreign minister argued that moscow should hold more talks despite the west s refusal to consider russia s main demands moscow wants guarantees that nato will not allow ukraine and other former soviet countries to join as members it also wants the alliance to halt weapons deployments to ukraine and roll back its forces from eastern europe lavrov said possibilities for talks are far from being exhausted the u s reacted coolly the path for diplomacy remains available if russia chooses to engage constructively white house principal deputy press secretary karine jean pierre said however we are clear eyed about the prospects of that given the steps russia is taking on the ground in plain sight ukraine s foreign minister meanwhile claimed credit for keeping the diplomatic path open at least for now we managed with our partners to restrain the russian federation from any further escalation today is already the middle of february and you can see that diplomacy continues to work kuleba said as if to show defiance ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy declared wednesday would be a day of national unity calling on the country to display the blue and yellow flag and sing the national anthem even amid the hopeful signs the u s and european countries kept up their warnings british foreign secretary liz truss reiterated tuesday that the danger of an invasion still exists telling sky news that it could be imminent norwegian foreign minister anniken huitfeldt issued a similar warning u s officials have said the russian military continued apparent attack preparations along ukraine s borders a u s defense official said small numbers of russian ground units have been moving out of larger assembly areas for several days taking up positions closer to the ukrainian border at what would be departure points if putin launched an invasion the official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss information not publicly released maxar technologies a commercial satellite imagery company that has been monitoring the russian buildup reported increased russian military activity in belarus crimea and western russia including the arrival of helicopters ground attack aircraft and fighter bomber jets at forward locations the photos taken over a 48 hour period also show ground forces leaving their garrisons and combat units moving into convoy formation meanwhile russian lawmakers called on putin on tuesday to recognize rebel held areas in eastern ukraine as independent states the state duma russia s lower house of parliament voted to submit an appeal to putin to that effect kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov said the issue of recognizing the self proclaimed republics is very very relevant to the public but it was unclear how he would respond or how this could influence russia s actions in ukraine while the u s warns that russia could invade ukraine any day and kyiv is alerting residents to locate their nearest bomb shelters the drumbeat of war is all but unheard in russia itself the kremlin has cast the u s warnings of an imminent attack as hysteria and absurdity and many russians believe that washington is deliberately stoking panic and fomenting tensions to trigger a conflict for domestic reasons few expect a war in russia s belgorod region about 30 kilometers 18 miles from ukraine s border residents carry on with life as usual even as more military personnel have been passing through village streets planes helicopters just started flying i guess to patrol the border said vladimir konovalenko villager lyudmila nechvolod says she s not worried we are friends with ukraine and we are not sure that ukraine wants war with us we are really on the border we really have relatives here and there everyone has somebody there on the ukrainian side she said no one wants war ___ karmanau reported from kyiv ukraine angela charlton in paris vladimir isachenkov in moscow geir moulson in berlin jill lawless in london jan m olsen in

opinion with russia poised to invade ukraine china ramping up aggression in the south china sea and iran inching closer toward the nuclear bomb terrorist rocket attacks on israel are no longer front page news that doesn t mean they ve stopped what has stopped at least for now is congressional action to pass funding to replenish the iron dome a missile defense system co developed with the united states that intercepts rockets fired at israel s populated areas last september the house of representatives despite pushback from house progressives passed a bill that would provide the needed funds yet believe it or not four months later the senate has yet to take up this legislation and israel s stock of iron dome interceptors still needs replenishment since the iron dome was first deployed to israel in 2011 it has a played critical role in protecting israeli citizens from the persistent rocket attacks launched over the years by hamas a palestinian terrorist organization indeed during the latest round of fighting in may 2021 terrorists in gaza indiscriminately fired over 4 400 rockets at israel with greater range than ever before some of these rockets flew toward some of israel s most densely populated areas including tel aviv and jerusalem the rockets were also fired in greater numbers than ever before the total number of rockets launched in this 11 day conflict equaled the number fired during the 50 days of fighting that took place in 2014 iron dome intercepted over 90 of the rockets that were going to hit populated areas 1 477 in total this not only saved countless israeli lives although 12 civilians were still killed but also those of palestinian civilians the protection provided by iron dome gave israeli military leaders time to respond to hamas attacks with carefully targeted and precise airstrikes that involved complex procedures including advance notice texts and phone calls to mitigate risks to gazan civilians without iron dome israel would have been forced to launch a ground offensive to shut down the rocket fire more rapidly as it has done in the past such an offensive would have surely caused greater destruction in addition to saving thousands of lives when deterrence fails missile defense systems such as the iron dome contribute to deterring attack in the first place faced with the obstacle of missile defense actors might think twice before pushing the launch button if they become convinced their attack will fail or that the costs of overcoming missile defense systems would outweigh the benefits of success crucially iron dome s capability to protect israel is a part of its deterrence and defense against a much greater threat than hamas indeed hezbollah the iranian backed lebanese terrorist group to israel s north has amassed over 130 000 rockets it is to afford israel this protection and help reduce the destruction caused by regional conflicts that then president barack obama asked congress to help fund the development of iron dome israel already invests almost 6 of its gdp into defense but congress has provided additional support given the uniquely threatening environment it must protect against to ensure the continuity of that protection president biden pledged to replenish the interceptor missiles that israel used up during the may conflict to extend that protection to other regional u s partners sen jack reed rhode island democrat recently suggested providing the united arab emirates with iron dome to defend against ongoing drone and rocket attacks from the houthi terrorists in yemen now as israel waits on congress to act the protection afforded by iron dome has been diminished and malign actors may not be so deterred from launching new attacks indeed if hamas or other iranian proxies believe the efficacy of iron dome is compromised they may see an advantage in trying to overwhelm the system which would dramatically jeopardize the lives of israeli and palestinian civilians before it s too late congress should act to restock the interceptors for iron dome to ensure israel has this vital tool at its disposal to combat the ongoing threats it faces on a daily basis congress is divided on many issues for which it will need to find legislative solutions funding iron dome a system that saves countless israeli lives should not be one of them blaise misztal is the vice president for policy at the jewish institute for national security of america patty jane geller is a policy analyst specializing in nuclear deterrence and missile defense at the heritage foundation s center for national defense
president joe biden said the united states was prepared to defend nato members as the crisis on ukraine s border with russia intensifies make no mistake the united states will defend every inch of nato territory with the full force of american power an attack against one nato country is an attack against all of us biden said he reiterated the u s commitment to ukraine s sovereignty and territorial integrity and issue fresh warnings to russian president vladimir putin over the weekend biden spoke to ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy and putin in separate phone calls washington president joe biden said tuesday afternoon the united states was prepared to defend nato members as the crisis on ukraine s border with russia intensifies make no mistake the united states will defend every inch of nato territory with the full force of american power an attack against one nato country is an attack against all of us biden said evoking the alliance s collective defense rule known as article 5 get dfw local news weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc dfw newsletters if russia proceeds we will rally the world biden said adding that washington s allies were ready to impose powerful sanctions that will undermine russia s ability to compete economically and strategically speaking from the east room of the white house biden reiterated u s commitment to ukraine s sovereignty and territorial integrity the president said he will not deploy american service members to ukraine but instead to nato member countries biden s address comes as secretary of defense lloyd austin traveled to brussels to meet with nato defense ministers austin will meet with his counterparts for two days before traveling to alliance s eastern flank biden also said his administration is still open to high level diplomacy should russian president vladimir putin elect to de escalate tensions we re not seeking direct confrontation with russia though i ve been clear that if russia targets americans in ukraine we will respond forcefully biden said if russia attacks the united states or allies through asymmetric means like disruptive cyberattacks against our companies or critical infrastructure we re also prepared to respond he added biden reiterated several other costs the u s would impose on russia in the event that it moved on ukraine including his pledge to halt a major new russian german gas pipeline the nord stream 2 natural gas pipeline between russia and germany was finished in september of last year but it has yet to transport any actual gas german officials have been strategically vague about the fate of nord stream 2 in the event of an invasion but biden has been unequivocal for months the u s and its western allies have watched a steady buildup of kremlin forces along ukraine s border with russia and belarus the increased military presence mimics russia s playbook ahead of its 2014 illegal annexation of crimea a peninsula on the black sea which sparked international uproar and triggered sanctions against moscow the kremlin has denied that the extraordinary deployment of russian troops outfitted with advanced military equipment along ukraine s borders are preparing for an invasion earlier on tuesday russia s ministry of defense said that some of its forces previously deployed to its borders are in the process of leaving the news prompted the stock market to jump and snap a three day losing streak but biden and his ambassador to nato downplayed the kremlin s claim on tuesday we have not yet verified the russian military units are returning to their home bases indeed our analysts indicate that they remain very much in a threatening position biden said adding that there are more than 150 000 troops on the border similarly ambassador julianne smith told reporters on a call tuesday that the u s and its allies were working to verify moscow s claims in late december there were some similar claims that came out of moscow that they were de escalating and in fact facts on the ground did not support that claim smith said this is something that we ll have to look at closely and verify in the days ahead she added biden spoke to putin on saturday from camp david and warned his russian counterpart that if there is a further invasion of ukraine washington and its allies will impose swift and severe costs biden said that while the u s remains prepared to engage in diplomacy we are equally prepared for other scenarios the president s call with putin which lasted about an hour was followed up on sunday with a separate phone call to ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy the two leaders also spoke for an hour over the weekend biden s national security advisor jake sullivan gave a grim description of what a russian invasion of ukraine might look like and urged americans to depart the country immediately if there is a military invasion of ukraine by russia it s likely to begin with a significant barrage of missiles and bomb attacks sullivan said sunday ukrainian armed forces press service via reuters it would then be followed by an onslaught of a ground force moving across the ukrainian frontier he said adding that there would be a substantial number of civilians caught in the crossfire sullivan said that in the past 10 days the kremlin has accelerated its extraordinary military buildup russia s current force posture in the region could launch a military action very very rapidly he said on monday secretary of state antony blinken closed the u s embassy in kyiv and directed diplomatic staff to relocate to the western city of lviv the closure of the embassy compound in kyiv follows repeated warnings for u s citizens to immediately leave ukraine a senior state department official told reporters on a call saturday that it was past time for private citizens to leave ukraine american citizens should not expect that the u s military is going to rescue them in ukraine at the last minute that s not going to be happening in this scenario and that s why it is past time for them to leave ukraine the official said adding there are real limits to what we are able to do in a war zone over the weekend austin ordered u s troops who deployed to ukraine last year to leave the country and reposition elsewhere in europe in november 160 members of the florida national guard assigned to the 53rd infantry brigade combat team deployed to ukraine to train with local forces this repositioning does not signify a change in our determination to support ukraine s armed forces but will provide flexibility in assuring allies and deterring aggression pentagon spokesman john kirby wrote in a statement saturday announcing the new marching orders cnbc s christina wilkie

otherwise specified during the quarter field trip progressed its strategy of building the leading psychedelic therapy company through its field trip health division and continued to invest in its lead drug development program through its field trip discovery division with ft 104 and its pipeline expansion currently under the heading of ft 200 group field trip discovery while conducting activities associated with the strategic review field trip discovery ft 104 in january 2022 field trip received a notice of allowance for its patent application no 17 364 047 the allowed patent from the u s patent and trademark office uspto for claims related to ft 104 informally known as isoprocin glutarate the company s first novel psychedelic molecule in development ft 104 demonstrates improved stability and more importantly improved solubility relative to 4 ho dipt as a prodrug ft 104 converts rapidly and completely to 4 ho dipt after administration combined these properties result in improved drug absorption more reproducible pharmacokinetic profiles and improved bioavailability relative to 4 ho dipt making it a superior drug candidate subsequent to quarter end the company was made aware of possible prior art claim and is seeking advice of external counsel regarding strategy based on a prima facie review this process is not expected to delay the expected q2 issuance date for the patent during the quarter the company expanded consideration for the phase 1 trial site to include australia in addition to the netherlands to mitigate against possible delays related to regional differences in reactions to the latest covid surge as of january the company finalized agreements with interested parties in australia to pursue phase 1 studies and site selection is nearly finalized ft 200 group in november the company announced it is expanding the scope of its development pipeline to focus on a new group of molecules termed the ft 200 group with the discovery of a novel molecule that has the structure of classical psychedelics and has demonstrated improved selectivity for the target serotonin 2a receptor 5ht2a relative to ft 104 and psilocybin versus off target serotonin 5ht1a 5ht2b and 5ht2c receptors in in vitro assays the aim of this research is to reduce or eliminate specifically 5ht2b agonist activity which has been associated with increased risk of cardiovascular toxicity by reducing cardiovascular risk the molecules in the ft 200 could be safer to administer more frequently such as in chronic intermittent repeat administration or microdosing strategies during the quarter field trip filed a provisional patent application in the united states to protect the composition as well as potential formulations and uses of the first molecule in the ft 200 group joseph del moral field trip s co founder and ceo commented the important work we are undertaking through field trip discovery is advancing us closer to the development of ft 104 as a more convenient consistent and practical psychedelic treatment that has the potential to change the lives of those suffering from treatment resistant depression and postpartum depression we have also progressed clinical research to identify a lead candidate in the ft 200 group improving on the safety of this class of molecules could allow more practical wide spread usage in clinical practice we are working to strengthen the ip portfolio around the ft 200 group while seeking the optimal lead candidate for preclinical development field trip health centres during the quarter field trip ramped

chairman of the board micky arison provided an update to carnival corporations operational status today in a letter addressed to shareholders the former president and ceo of the company provided insight into the company s operating and financial status amongst other things micky arison discusses the success carnival corporation has seen in the past period although there have been challenges with 65 000 crew members back to work and 1 2 million guests having sailed already there is no denying a successful restart restoring confidence one crucial part of the duties of the chairman of the board is to ensure the confidence for investors to look at carnival as an investment opportunity and indeed over the last two years many people have been turning away from the cruise industry due to the effects of covid 19 in his letter to shareholders micky arison is quick to bring out the many positives that have come out of the last two years not in the least a leaner and younger fleet our decision to accelerate the exit of 19 ships as part of our fleet optimization strategy resulted in a more efficient fleet overall and lowered our planned capacity growth to approximately 2 5 compounded annually from 2019 through 2025 down from 4 5 annually pre covid 19 we achieved a unit cost benefit from the removal of these less efficient ships from our fleet which will grow from the delivery of the larger and more efficient ships carnival cruise line miami headquarters photo credit felix mizioznikov shutterstock upon returning to full operations nearly 15 of our capacity will consist of these recently delivered larger and more efficient ships which we believe will expedite our return to profitability and improve our return on invested capital read also what cruise lines does carnival own currently eight out of the nine brands in carnival s portfolio are operational the only one not operating is p o australia by the end of 2021 the company had 50 ships back in operation representing 67 of total capacity returned 65 000 crew members to work and carried 1 2 million guests by the summer when the company traditionally makes the most money carnival corporation hopes to have all ships in the fleet operational carnival corporation also re opened all of its eight owned and operated private destinations and port facilities carnival corporation s community role more important as the only company currently operating the far more environmentally friendly lng powered cruise ships there is no denying that carnival corporation is placing far more significant importance on its role in the community of course with incidents involving environmental compliance on several of its ships in recent years the cruise company had to take action micky arison as of january 13 2022 we are operating the only six cruise ships in the world currently powered by liquefied natural gas lng which are 20 more carbon efficient upon returning to full cruise operations our lng efforts our fleet optimization strategy and other innovative efforts to drive energy efficiency are forecasted to deliver a 10 reduction in unit fuel consumption on an annualized basis compared to 2019 a significant achievement on our path to decarbonization photo credit jjava designs shutterstock com carnival corporation is also placing importance on other areas of sustainability such as circular economy good health and well being sustainable tourism biodiversity and conservation and diversity equity and inclusion one area of concern is of course climate action carnival corporation carbon neutral by 2050 carnival corporation has set the goal to be fully carbon neutral by 2050 while minimizing the use of carbon offsets although it is hard to see the cruise industry achieving these goals much can be said about carnival corporation s efforts while there is currently no clear path to zero carbon emissions in our industry we are working to be part of the solution to achieve the aspiration of net zero carbon emissions we are partnering with key organizations to help identify and scale new technologies we have and expect to continue to demonstrate leadership in executing carbon reduction strategies we believe our scale will support our effort to lead the industry in climate action our carbon emissions reduction efforts include improvements in energy efficiency integrating alternative fuels and investing in new technologies such as batteries and fuel cells carnival corporation s stock went from 71 65 in 2018 to an all time low of 8 49 in april 2020 since then the company has been slowly working itself up yet a lot of work remains to be done if carnival corporation is to come back on top once again as shown by micky arison in his letter to shareholders the prospects will undoubtedly prove to be an incentive however carnival corporation will need to show that its intentions towards sustainability are not just words but backed by actions all the way to 2050
berkeley it has become abundantly clear that the united states has an inflation problem what is not yet clear is how big the problem will turn out to be and how long it will last alarmed observers point to parallels with the 1970s when commodity prices shot up the us federal reserve fell behind the curve and inflation expectations became unmoored consumers producers and workers all expected prices to keep rising at the same or even an accelerating pace accordingly households adjusted their spending unions their wage demands and businesses their prices triggering an inflationary spiral today in contrast inflation expectations remain firmly anchored the michigan survey of consumers shows that respondents expect inflation to approach 5 per cent over the coming year before falling back to just above 2 per cent in the subsequent four years the inflation rate implicit in the price of five year inflation indexed treasury securities shows basically the same thing inflation averaging 2 8 per cent over the next five years we can infer that expected inflation for the years 2023 to 2026 is below this five year average given the expectation of 5 per cent for 2022 there is no sign of the ship dragging anchor in other words things can always change of course the question is whether inflation expectations however stable they might be for the moment will remain equally well anchored in the future or whether they will become unmoored as they did in the 1970s answering that question requires ascertaining whether the conditions leading to the 1970s great inflation have really been consigned to the dustbin of history importantly in 1973 when consumer price inflation reached 6 per cent it was entirely rational for consumers producers and workers to extrapolate that rate into the future they were justified in thinking that inflation would persist because there were absolutely no grounds for believing that the federal reserve would tamp it down the fed or at least those responsible for its policies did not even possess a model of the connections between central bank policy and inflation the closest thing to an anchor for policy in the 1950s and early 1960s was the bretton woods international monetary system under bretton woods the us pegged the dollar to gold at 35 an ounce and foreign central banks and governments could redeem their dollars for gold on demand excessive inflation and lax central bank policy might jeopardise this commitment if us interest rates were too low capital would flee the country gold would be lost and the fed would be forced to raise rates in response if spending was too strong imports would surge gold would again be lost and the fed would have to rein in demand the fed was not targeting inflation and it was not seeking to minimise unemployment its mission was to conserve us gold reserves and defend the dollar s bretton woods peg it is commonplace to attribute the great inflation to the collapse of bretton woods in 1971 73 in fact bretton woods had already lost its bite and inflation had begun to accelerate in the second half of the 1960s the us adopted policies such as an interest equalisation tax on american foreign financial investments that loosened the link between inflation and gold losses the treasury department asserted its responsibility for managing the foreign exchange market allowing the fed to dismiss gold losses and dollar weakness as someone else s problem as a result us inflation was approaching 6 per cent already in 1970 even before the collapse of bretton woods the demise of bretton woods would not have mattered had the fed possessed a coherent theory connecting monetary policy with inflation in lieu of that was chairman arthur burns s view that monetary policy didn t matter burns believed that inflation was caused by unions excessive wage demands price increases by firms with market power poor harvests high oil prices and excessive government spending his successor g william miller lacked burns s academic credentials and was not inclined to question the views of his illustrious predecessor volcker eventually would have something to say about this but not until after he became fed chair in 1979 today s circumstances could not be more different fed officials understand that in all but the most exceptional circumstances monetary policy and inflation are intertwined they have a coherent policy framework average inflation targeting to which they are committed financial market participants and survey respondents alike show every sign of believing them nonetheless the fed has a rocky road ahead interest rate hikes can roil financial markets and provoke capital outflows and debt difficulties in emerging economies such are the consequences of falling behind the curve but in contrast to the 1970s the fed knows what is at stake having fallen behind it is now firmly committed to catching up barry eichengreen is professor of economics at the

which leaves the focus on yesterday s local events the minutes of the february rba meeting revealed little beyond what philip lowe has already put forward in a speech and testimony to parliament in the interim patience remains the buzz word and the board would like to see two more cpi prints ie march and june quarters before deciding to move on rates this suggests the first hike would not come before august although cba economists yesterday brought their expectation forward to june expecting a big jump in march quarter cpi except that the data will not be out before early june so go figure on the stock market the energy sector led the market up on monday with a 3 gain and yesterday led it down with a 3 fall despite another rise in oil prices the sector followed its s p500 counterpart on monday night beach energy bpt which topped the boards post result on monday topped the other board yesterday in falling 10 5 materials was one bright spot on monday but turned tail yesterday by 1 0 as

excited about a clear downward trend in omicron cases which might bode a little better for plasma collection ahead healthcare fell 0 6 wall street was also excited about news russia has pulled some troops back from the border the mood may be a little more positive on the asx today as the day s list of reporting companies makes a step jump in size a glimmer spirits lifted ahead of the open on wall street last night after putin said moscow is ready for talks with nato on limits to missile deployments in europe following a claim that russia is withdrawing some troops in the area having completed military exercises the pullback has not been verified yet it was enough to bring back the buyers albeit if you weren t quick you would have missed out the dow opened up around 400 points and closed up around 400 points there was a slight wobble with half an hour to go as president biden delivered a rousing speech that emphasised the non verification of troop movements and warned that an attack may still yet be on the cards the dow slipped back 100 points briefly but late buying righted the ship safe haven markets all went into reverse as well the us yen year yield rose 5 points to 2 04 the us dollar fell back 0 4 and gold dropped twenty dollars the biggest move was reserved for oil prices which fell 3 the move in yields occurred ahead of the release of us january wholesale

black no more a new off broadway musical created by some showbiz heavyweights uses the title of its source material the classic 1931 novel by george s schuyler about black people passing as white but it might be more aptly titled white like me since it seems to borrow more heavily from john howard griffin s now forgotten 1961 bestseller black like me which detailed the white journalist s account of traveling through the south for six weeks in blackface the extremely popular book was made into an even more terrible movie in 1964 starring james whitmore in blackface the new group s production of black no more which opened tuesday at the pershing square signature center repeats a lot of the racial platitudes and bromides in black like me what does not get repeated is much of anything from schuyler s viciously satirical black no more the little bit that s left involves an enterprise known as black no more a breakthrough scientific procedure that lightens the skin rendering people of african descent identical to caucasians the first man to undergo the process is max brandon victor dixon loaded with relaxed charm who has just been rebuffed by a white woman helen jennifer damiano after she has flirted with him in a harlem nightclub in its opening moments black no more recalls the 1999 2000 theater season in new york city when there were dueling musicals named the wild party both shows based on joseph moncure march s 1928 poem those harlem speakeasies were a mixing ground for all races and all sexual orientations in black no more bill t jones strenuous choreography emphasizes this diversity and adds another he partners professional dancers with some who are not so professional to be kind they dance to the boisterous showstopper this is harlem and we re back in 1929 or is it 1999 it s hard to say where director scott elliott s work ends and jones choreography begins there s an easy fluidity on display here except when the dancers appear to be in pain doing some of the more awkward contortions required of them the black no more score runs the gamut from blues to hip hop to torch songs to bad parodies of rodgers hammerstein for the white characters to sing no fewer than four composers are credited tariq trotter anthony tidd james poyser and daryl waters with trotter aka black thought providing the lyrics which are clever until they veer into climb every mountain bombast before the whole cast goes completely over the r h cliff singing victory for love at the final curtain trotter makes only one slip when helen demands transparency from max whom she has now married while believing he is a white man before you can say mandingo she s going to have a baby the musical s book by john ridley 12 years a slave abandons schuyler s novel sometime before the kid arrives and it completely mangles helen who should be renamed sybil the whiplash from racist to belle to feminist to victim to the inevitable karen is so extreme that the role should come with a chiropractor for poor damiano there is a scene set in a harlem beauty salon taken from the novel where women go to get their hair straightened in the novel schuyler makes it clear he doesn t care what these characters are thinking he just ridicules them for trying to look a little bit white in ridley s book the women are guilt ridden to the point of shaving their heads as the owner of the salon lillias white does an amazing job of singing from both sides of madame sisseretta s mouth and that s the big difference between the novel and the musical black no more the latter wants us to sympathize schyuler s book on the other hand takes no prisoners he describes characters of all races in terms of reptiles rodents and swine to quote sondheim there s a hole in the world like a great black pit and it s filled with people who are filled with the novel black no more doesn t want us to like or admire anybody rather schuyler s clear contempt for humanity makes it unlikely source material for a musical in the right hands the story could be another rise and fall of the city of mahagonny bertolt brecht and kurt weill s opera and schuyler s novel are devastating indictments of capitalism in the new musical though ridley s book delivers a really nice good and conscientious character named buni tamika lawrence in strong voice she is also a predictable moral compass and replaces a far more intriguing character from the novel bunny who is every bit as mercenary as his pal max what ridley and buni don t tell us but schuyler and bunny do is that after the popularity of the black no more treatment harlem has emptied out because its citizens can now live anywhere and not be jammed into a ghetto where they pay exorbitant rents for small substandard apartments in schuyler s novel the united states of america almost grinds to a halt because there is no underclass of people left to work as porters maids laborers and caregivers in schuyler s novel churches and civil rights organizations turn race into a commodity for their own profit and in schuyler s novel with almost everybody now passing as caucasian the democrats and republicans go to extremes to come up with absurd genealogy tests to re establish a ruling class black no more the musical does keep schuyler s parody of the ku klux klan do writers for the theater really think they re being courageous or adventurous by lampooning the kkk even retrograde republicans could applaud what gets left out of this musical is schuyler s parody of the naacp and his caricatures of w e b du bois and marcus garvey among others as the entrepreneur behind black no more dr junius crookman tariq trotter being a wizard of dross emerges as little more than a stock musical comedy villain schuyler was a prickly one for any group to embrace he wrote black no more during his socialist period but later in life he pulled a real clarence thomas the writer lobbied against the civil rights bill of 1964 voted for barry goldwater for president and he firmly believed that apartheid was best left up to the south african government to sort out that history aside schuyler s novel remains savagely funny
african electricity data transparency is rather limited and low quality while data on africa s electricity systems is improving as new or updated national data sources are developed ember s african electricity data transparency report shows current data is limited the independent climate and energy think tank put together the transparency report as a reference guide of national sources of electricity data on the continent the report looks at where national electricity data can be found and evaluates the quality and usability of available data as ember puts it timely reliable and publicly available data will be critical to inform and track africa s electricity transition robust data can support efforts to ensure that project demand growth is met by clean generation as the reliance on fossil fuels is lessened thus the current situation needs to change to foster transparent decision making accountability by african electricity planners the think tank found that while national electricity data is available in many countries in africa the quality is generally low with long lag times and inconsistent public frequency being an unfortunate hallmark of the 54 countries evaluated 23 42 had only very old national data available or nothing at all source esi africa africa airlines risk hefty fines for delays in returning lost baggage withholding refunds airlines operating scheduled passenger flights within the east and central africa region risk paying up to 10 of their turnover generated within the bloc in fines if found culpable for breaching customers rights the competition watchdog of the common market for eastern and southern africa comesa said initial investigations have found some airlines in the region are culpable of engaging in anti competitive practices the comesa competition commission began the probe early this month after it established that some airlines were refusing to reschedule passenger tickets at no additional charges

what a rebuke to the covid doomsters britain s workforce has rebounded in spectacular fashion from the slump caused by the pandemic in early 2020 voices on the left and elsewhere predicted million strong dole queues economic collapse widespread misery and despair instead the country is in the midst of a jobs miracle the latest data released yesterday shows unemployment has now fallen below the level before the pandemic in january a hefty 108 000 people were added to the uk s payrolls lifting the number in employment to 29 5 million stock photo used job vacancies meanwhile have hit record highs and wage growth is rising all this helps to allay some fears at least that surging inflation will deliver a cost of living shock in january a hefty 108 000 people were added to the uk s payrolls lifting the number in employment to 29 5 million remarkable the previous month unemployment fell to just 3 9 per cent of the workforce remember that the bank of england projected joblessness to soar to an alarming 9 per cent when pandemic support measures were withdrawn what a risible forecast that has turned out to be even more remarkable never have there been so many vacancies at the start of the pandemic about 800 000 job vacancies stood around the country this fell to below 400 000 in the immediate aftermath of covid s arrival and now it stands at an astonishing 1 3 million posts for anyone willing to look for work as the director of one job agency told the financial times this week we are rejoicing at the number of job opportunities while wailing at our desks over the lack of candidates and as ministers like to keep reminding us in 2021 britain was the fastest growing economy in the g7 club of rich countries the 7 5 per cent jump in the uk s economy last year was the highest since 1948 though it must be said that it came in large part thanks to the record slump the previous year it s now back above pre pandemic levels in contrast germany still has to make up the ground it lost during its own covid catastrophe the latest data released yesterday shows unemployment has now fallen below the level before the pandemic stock image used overall the uk s performance is even more remarkable given it came in spite of our trade with the eu stuttering amid disputes over the northern ireland protocol and the sluggish customs bureaucracy of some european countries germany for example is mired in stagflation a toxic combination of low or zero growth and inflation the growth projections for this powerhouse of the eurozone have been slashed from 5 1 per cent in 2022 to 3 7 per cent but britain s impressive economic news of course did not happen by accident instead it demonstrates how effective the measures put in place by the government at the start of the pandemic to support workers and businesses were it also shows the prime minister was right to disregard all the naysayers at sage on the opposition benches and in the left wing establishment media who called for the government to lock down the country all over again when the omicron wave crashed on to our shores at the end of last year by holding its nerve the government has been able to deliver economically helping to bring about more or less full employment and a boosterish output this surely is the record on which boris johnson should be judged and not just on whether he attended a birthday party in downing street prosecco fuelled or otherwise as bill clinton s de facto campaign slogan put it back in 1992 it s the economy stupid to protect that and let it flourish as well as to safeguard a nation s security is what governments are for chancellor rishi sunak understands this when covid first arrived he said he would do whatever it took to prevent long term scarring to jobs companies and prosperity belatedly the bank s governor andrew bailey pictured is acting partly making up for earlier remarks in which he described inflation as transitory alex brummer writes and he along with his boss has been vindicated as sunak said yesterday our 400 billion economic plan has protected our jobs market through the pandemic and is now healthier than most could have hoped for of course the government was not working in a vacuum over in the city the bank of england also responded quickly to the covid threat slashing interest rates to their lowest levels in more than 300 years to just 0 1 per cent the bank poured an extra 450 billion into the system by buying up uk government bonds and it also established an unprecedented scheme under which the biggest british and overseas companies operating in the uk could borrow directly from threadneedle street the furlough scheme too may have rescued millions of jobs and thousands of firms surging yes it also resulted in a surge in fraud cases from crooks who have cost the taxpayer dearly but there is little doubt those dole queues would be far longer and many more firms would have gone under without it in america for example some 20 per cent of small businesses closed during the pandemic of course boris and sunak still face considerable economic challenges energy prices are surging inflation is on the march eroding people s savings and what labour invariably calls the cost of living crisis is hitting even middle earning families hard the bank is forecasting a 2 per cent squeeze on real incomes which would be the biggest such shock for more than 30 years belatedly the bank s governor andrew bailey is acting partly making up for earlier remarks in which he described inflation as transitory most experts expect further hikes to the base rate hsbc predicts it could hit 1 25 per cent as early as this summer while at least one leading economist anticipates rates of 2 per cent by 2023 it currently stands at 0 5 per cent increasing the interest rate might de fang the inflation dragon but it won t help britons energy bills which are expected to jump by an average of 700 in april fracking offers a real solution but the government s lamentable capture by the green lobby means it is unlikely to happen for now at least so given the headwinds that still persist what should the chancellor be doing next improved the first step he should immediately take is to scrap the swingeing national insurance hike planned for april the public finances are on a far better footing than most analysts expected when covid struck britain s economy has bounced back like a coiled spring and tax receipts have improved dramatically rishi sunak said yesterday our 400 billion economic plan has protected our jobs market through the pandemic and is now healthier than most could have hoped for there is no justification when families are facing unimaginable bills and inflation to batter them further with tax hikes if sunak pursues his plans to claw even more money from workers in taxes the treasury s overall tax take would soar from 33 5 per cent of national income before the pandemic to 36 2 per cent by the mid 2020s this would be the highest share taken by the state since the early 1950s and is utterly unbecoming of a tory government decades if not centuries of economic history tell us growth and prosperity come from lower taxes which allow people to choose where and how to spend their money tightening monetary policy too dramatically could kill the expansion and job creation nurtured by boris s willingness to see off the omicron gloomsters britain s ability to withstand recent economic shocks has been built around a flexible labour market and relatively low tax economy now the government must urgently rediscover its low tax mojo or that good news on jobs might be all too short lived

results from the 2021 reverse circulation rc drill program at the goldstrike oxide gold project in southwestern utah goldstrike results continue to demonstrate the continuity predictability and strong mineralized thicknesses of the goldstrike deposit drilling will resume with one rc rig and one core rig in march 2022 liberty gold completed 15 574 metres m of rc drilling in 108 holes at goldstrike in 2021 primarily to upgrade portions of the resource from inferred to indicated for use in future economic and engineering studies a second objective was to test gaps in the main zone mineralization and down dip extension around the margins of the deposit all assay data have been received and are being incorporated into an updated mineralization model and de risking activities around land water engineering and baseline studies are underway drill results in this release include the area around the south west and north side of the basin pit portion of the main zone where a large gap in the drill pattern was tested for the first time these results indicate the presence of a new zone of oxide gold mineralization along the projection of the eocene unconformity which hosts most of the gold mineralization at goldstrike drilling in the historic hassayampa pit area followed up on previous drill intercepts which revealed the presence of unconsolidated surficial material with high oxide gold

mineral resource indicated mineral resource and inferred mineral resource are canadian mining terms as defined in and required to be disclosed in accordance with national instrument 43 101 standards of disclosure for mineral projects ni 43 101 which references the guidelines set out in the canadian institute of mining metallurgy and petroleum the cim cim definition standards on mineral resources and mineral reserves cim definition standards adopted by the cim council as amended however these terms are not defined terms under sec industry guide 7 sec industry guide 7 under the united states securities act of 1933 as amended and normally are not permitted to be used in reports and registration statements filed with united states securities and exchange commission the sec the sec has adopted amendments to its disclosure rules to modernize the mineral property disclosure requirements for issuers whose securities are registered with the sec under the united states securities exchange act of 1934 as amended these amendments became effective february 25 2019 the sec modernization rules with compliance required for the first fiscal year beginning on or after january 1 2021 the sec modernization rules replace the historical disclosure requirements for mining registrants that were included in sec industry guide 7 the company does not file reports with the sec and is not required to provide disclosure on its mineral properties under the sec modernization rules and will continue to provide disclosure under ni 43 101 and the cim definition standards united states investors are cautioned that there are differences in the definitions under the sec modernization rules and the cim definition standards there is no assurance any mineral resources that the company may report as measured mineral resources indicated mineral resources and inferred mineral resources under ni 43 101 would be the same had the company prepared the resource estimates under the standards adopted under the sec modernization rules united states investors are also cautioned that while the sec will now recognize measured mineral resources indicated mineral resources and inferred mineral resources investors should not assume that any part or all of the mineralization in these categories will ever be converted into a higher category of mineral resources or into mineral reserves mineralization described using these terms has a greater amount of uncertainty as to their existence and feasibility than mineralization that has been characterized as reserves accordingly investors are cautioned not to assume that any measured mineral resources indicated mineral resources or inferred mineral resources that the company reports are or will be economically or legally mineable further inferred mineral resources have a greater amount of uncertainty as to their existence and as to whether they can be mined legally or economically therefore united states investors are also cautioned not to assume that all or any part of the inferred mineral resources exist in accordance with canadian securities laws estimates of inferred mineral resources cannot form the basis of feasibility or other economic studies except in limited circumstances where permitted under ni 43 101 in addition the sec has amended its definitions of proven mineral reserves and probable mineral reserves to be substantially similar to the corresponding cim definitions united states investors are cautioned that a preliminary economic assessment cannot support an estimate of either proven mineral reserves or probable mineral reserves and that no feasibility studies have been completed on the company s mineral properties accordingly information contained herein describing the company s mineral deposits may not be comparable to similar information made public by u s companies subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements under the united states federal securities laws and the

over the past few months of 2021 brazilian news were almost all about the new sculpture at são paulo s downtown a metallic bull made by a partnership of plastic artist rafael brancatelli and the economist and digital influencer pablo spyer founder of the brazilian company vai tourinho go little bull with the financial support of brazilian stock exchange b3 after only one week in exhibition the sculpture was taken from the street by são paulo s city council under the argument that the monument violated the city laws regarding publicity on the streets since the bull reminds the logo of spyer s company and could lead the public to think that the art was publicity aimed to promote the company s business nevertheless before further explaining this matter two additional issues have emerged with the bull i the bull copyrights which is extremely like the one on wall street in new york and ii the protests organized by brazilian activists that tried to call out on several social issues such as the high prices on food and basic hygiene products due to the economic crisis facing the country regarding the bull copyrights it is important to contextualize the situation the bull sculpture and its connection to the financial market made its first appearance in new york in 1897 after the market crash the charging bull which was how the sculpture was named after was illegally put in front of new york stock exchange by its creator italian artist arturo di modica di modica s main purpose was to represent the strength and power of the people more than a century later the sculpture still stands in front of the stock exchange building and has become a symbol of strength and optimism for investors this metaphor arose from the term bull market which translates to the rise of the financial market based on the above several debates emerged that the sculpture placed in front of b3 was a copy of the sculpture in new york according to the brazilian stock exchange the sculpture was a gift from rafael the artist behind the work and his idea was not conceived in relation to the american bull as claimed by the artist and the directors of b3 it is a way to honor the development of the brazilian capital market and the animal represents strength and resilience thus what could be just a re reading of the work may in fact be a copyright violation the reason is that according to bbc news1 the family of the italian artist was not consulted on the matter american bull brazilian bull besides the copyright issue right after the sculpture s debut in the streets of são paulo several activists from brazilian organizations visited the sculpture in order to make interventions and protests as stated there is a concentration of wealth in brazil while workers from the lower social strata of society have their work made precarious besides being struggling with fundamental issues such as the price of food and basic hygiene products2 following these two topics the reason why the bull was removed was the violation of são paulo s law no 14 223 dated september 26 2006 at the time the law was created to ban billboards that advertised companies and their products ads identifying the activities developed in the buildings also started to have stricter approval rules nowadays the scope of the law covers in general the permanence of advertisements and publicity in the urban landscape in the most diverse types of buildings thus when there is an intention to promote or install an advertisement of this kind approval by the são paulo urban landscape protection commission is required in this sense it was held by competent authorities that the b3 bull would endow it with an advertising character and would be intended to promote and associate with pablo spyer s company vai tourinho who is also a radio host of a program called minuto touro de ouro golden bull minute according to the brazilian exchange the sculpture would have obtained all the necessary permits from the municipal bodies for the installation to remain for a period of three months in the streets in addition there was an authorization from the department of historical heritage of são paulo secretariat of culture as a temporary event thus the central debate surrounding the issue is whether the piece is in fact advertising or whether it can be understood as a mere cultural manifestation the criteria for this are tenuous and so are the legal limits finally unlike the concept of the sculpture the exhibition was not so outstanding and ended on november 23 only a week after it was considered an irregular advertisement by the authorities footnotes 1 available at portuguese version only 2 available at portuguese version only the content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter specialist advice should be sought about your specific circumstances

kyiv feb 16 kyiv appeared to blame russia for a cyber attack yesterday as us president joe biden warned that more than 150 000 russian troops were still amassed near ukraine s borders after moscow s announcement of a partial pullback was met with scepticism world powers are engaged in one of the deepest crises in east west relations for decades jostling over post cold war influence and energy supplies as moscow wants to stop the former soviet neighbour ever joining the nato military alliance western nations have suggested arms control and confidence building steps to defuse the standoff which has prompted them to urge their citizens to leave ukraine because an attack could come at any time russia denies it has any plans to invade yesterday the russian defence ministry published footage to demonstrate it was returning some troops to base after exercises biden said the united states had not verified the move our analysts indicate that they remain very much in a threatening position advertisement hours after moscow s announcement ukraine said the online networks of its defence ministry and two banks were overwhelmed in what is called a distributed denial of service the manoeuvre works when hackers flood a network with unusually high volumes of data traffic to paralyse it although kyiv did not name who was behind the incident a statement suggested it was pointing the finger at russia it is not ruled out that the aggressor used tactics of dirty little tricks because its aggressive plans are not working out on a large scale said the ukrainian centre for strategic communications and information security which is part of the culture ministry advertisement ukrainian bank privatbank users reported problems with payments and a banking app while oshadbank said its systems had slowed down russia s federal security service did not immediately reply to a request for comment from reuters if russia attacks the united states or our allies through asymmetric means like disruptive cyber attacks against our companies or critical infrastructure we re prepared to respond biden said in televised remarks from the white house one european diplomat said the hacking was concerning because a full military attack on ukraine would likely be preceded by a cyber attack it could mean a physical attack is imminent or it could mean russia is continuing to mess with ukraine the diplomat said on condition of anonymity while such attacks are difficult to attribute the diplomat said there was no doubt that russia was behind them meaningful de escalation the white house said energy prices could be hit if sanctions are imposed on moscow following an invasion as diplomatic efforts continued yesterday to resolve the crisis secretary of state antony blinken told russian counterpart sergei lavrov on a call that there needed to be verifiable credible meaningful de escalation by moscow biden and french president emmanuel macron discussed their readiness to hit russia with severe consequences over the crisis nato secretary general jens stoltenberg said there are signs from moscow that diplomacy should continue but also that russia often left military equipment behind after exercises creating the potential for forces to regroup at a joint news conference with german chancellor olaf scholz russian president vladimir putin referred only briefly to the troop moves putin told reporters russia would not be satisfied with talk that ukraine was not ready to join nato any time soon and was demanding that the issue be resolved now as for war in europe about whether we want it or not of course not that is why we put forward proposals for a negotiation process the result of which should be an agreement on ensuring equal security for everyone including our country he said russia has been pressing for a set of security guarantees from the west and says it can exercise troops on its own territory as it sees fit russia s show of force near ukraine s borders has prompted months of frantic western diplomacy and drawn threats of severe sanctions if it invades the kremlin sought to portray its moves as proof that western talk of war had been both false and hysterical february 15 2022 will go down in history as the day western war propaganda failed humiliated and destroyed without a single shot fired foreign ministry spokeswoman maria zakharova said the defence ministry published footage showing tanks and other armoured vehicles being loaded onto railway flatcars western military analysts said they needed more information to judge the significance of the latest troop movements commercial satellite images taken on sunday and monday showed a flurry of russian military activity at several locations near ukraine russian shares

date on may 6 2022 outlook following an outstanding 2021 during which ternium achieved record profitability and successfully completed its capacity expansion program the company expects to deliver solid performance in 2022 despite a business environment with gradually normalizing steel prices and margins supported by the ongoing ramp up of the new hot rolling mill in its pesquería facility in

decrease in steel imports should cause declining steel prices to stabilize during the first half of the year in argentina shipments remained at relatively stable levels during 2021 and the company expects this to continue in the first quarter driven by healthy activity in the construction agribusiness and automotive industries the outlook for the argentine market in 2022 however remains

such as customer inventory levels interest rates borrowing ability and economic conditions in the manufacturing and or distribution industries generally as well as government spending levels will continue to impact our business the temporary closing of many businesses and reduced business activity during the coronavirus pandemic has negatively impacted the general economy and decreased customer purchasing volume generally which negatively affected our business and may do so in future quarters until general business activity reaches pre pandemic levels additionally governmental mandated shutdowns of or restrictions on entities deemed to be non essential businesses has negatively impacted sales of our products to those businesses and will continue to impact our sales as long as these restrictions are in place the extent to which the coronavirus pandemic continues to impact our operations and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors including the duration of the pandemic our ability to keep our distribution centers operating productively and with minimal down time for coronavirus safety and remediation efforts governmental actions such as stay at home or shelter in place regulations or guidelines that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic the impact duration and severity of the pandemic on economic activity how long it will

increases could not be passed along to customers in a timely manner and may impact our margins again in the future our reliance on common carrier delivery services for shipping inventoried merchandise to customers and our reliance on drop ship deliveries directly to customers by our product vendors for products we do not hold in inventory has also been adversely affected by these supply chain challenges delays in the timely availability of products from our suppliers could delay receipt of needed product and result in lost sales in this regard global supply chains and the timely availability of products particularly products or product components used in domestic manufacturing imported from china and other asian nations as well as from other countries have been and in the future could continue to be adversely affected by allocation restrictions of difficult to source products by our vendors the imposition of tariffs and other trade barriers as well as retaliatory trade measures have caused us to raise the prices on certain of our products and seek alternate sources of supply which could negatively impact our sales or disrupt our operations in the future if we are not able to mitigate these measures our use of alternate sources of supply such as utilizing new vendors in additional countries entails various risks such as identifying vetting and managing new business relationships reliance on new vendors and maintaining quality control over their products and protecting our intellectual property rights quarantines factory slowdowns or shutdowns border closings and travel restrictions resulting from the coronavirus pandemic have in the past and could in the future adversely affect the timely availability of products resulting in delayed or lost sales liquidity constraints on our vendors or customers our ability to maintain available capacity in our distribution operations for stocked inventory and to enable on time shipment and deliveries such as by timely implementing additional temporary or permanent distribution resources whether in the form of additional facilities we operate or by outsourcing certain functions to third party distribution and logistics partners we compete with other companies for recruiting training integrating and retaining talented and experienced employees particularly in markets where we and they have central distribution facilities this aspect of competition is aggravated by the current tight labor market in the u s which is also undergoing competitive changes due to the coronavirus pandemic risks involved with e commerce including possible loss of business and customer dissatisfaction if outages or other computer related problems should preclude customer access to our products and services our information systems and other technology platforms supporting our sales procurement and other operations are critical to our operations and disruptions or delays have occurred and could occur in the future and if not timely addressed could have a material adverse effect on us a data security breach due to our e commerce data storage or other information systems being hacked by those seeking to steal company vendor employee or customer information or due to employee error resulting in disruption to our operations litigation and or loss of reputation or business managing various inventory risks such as being unable to profitably resell excess or obsolete inventory and or the loss of product return rights from our vendors meeting credit card industry compliance standards in order to maintain our ability to accept credit cards rising interest rates increased borrowing costs or limited credit availability including our own ability to maintain satisfactory credit agreements and to renew credit facilities could impact both our and our customers ability to fund purchases and conduct operations in the ordinary course pending or threatened litigation and investigations and other government actions such as anti dumping unclaimed property or trade and customs actions have occurred in the past and although had no material impact to our business could adversely affect our business and results of operation in the future and extreme weather conditions could disrupt our product supply chain and our ability to ship or receive products which would adversely impact sales

moderate wealth for all rather than just a few emerged over the summer as the theme for beijing s regulatory changes while the policy remains the big unknown garthwaite noted official remarks such as xi s speech at the world economic forum in january indicate an easier stance going forward the common prosperity we desire is not egalitarianism we will first make the pie bigger and then divide it

kyiv appeared to blame russia for a cyber attack on tuesday as us president joe biden warned that more than 150 000 russian troops were still amassed near ukraine s borders after moscow s announcement of a partial pullback was met with scepticism photo afp world powers are engaged in one of the deepest crises in east west relations for decades jostling over post cold war influence and energy supplies as moscow wants to stop its former soviet neighbour ever joining the nato military alliance western nations have suggested arms control and confidence building steps to defuse the standoff which has prompted them to urge their citizens to leave ukraine because an attack could come at any time russia denies it has any plans to invade on tuesday the russian defence ministry published footage to demonstrate it was returning some troops to base after exercises biden said the united states had not verified the move our analysts indicate that they remain very much in a threatening position hours after moscow s announcement ukraine said the online networks of its defence ministry and two banks were overwhelmed in what is called a distributed denial of service the manoeuvre works when hackers flood a network with unusually high volumes of data traffic to paralyse it although kyiv did not name who was behind the incident a statement suggested it was pointing the finger at russia it is not ruled out that the aggressor used tactics of dirty little tricks because its aggressive plans are not working out on a large scale said the ukrainian centre for strategic communications and information security which is part of the culture ministry ukrainian bank privatbank users reported problems with payments and a banking app while oshadbank said its systems had slowed down russia s federal security service did not immediately reply to a request for comment from reuters if russia attacks the united states or our allies through asymmetric means like disruptive cyber attacks against our companies or critical infrastructure we re prepared to respond biden said in televised remarks from the white house one european diplomat said the hacking was concerning because a full military attack on ukraine would likely be preceded by a cyber attack it could mean a physical attack is imminent or it could mean russia is continuing to mess with ukraine the diplomat said on condition of anonymity while such attacks are difficult to attribute the diplomat said there was no doubt that russia was behind them photo afp eyepress news meaningful de escalation the white house said energy prices could be hit if sanctions are imposed on moscow following an invasion as diplomatic efforts continued on tuesday to resolve the crisis secretary of state antony blinken told russian counterpart sergei lavrov on a call that there needed to be verifiable credible meaningful de escalation by moscow biden and french president emmanuel macron discussed their readiness to hit russia with severe consequences over the crisis nato secretary general jens stoltenberg said there are signs from moscow that diplomacy should continue but also that russia often left military equipment behind after exercises creating the potential for forces to regroup at a joint news conference with german chancellor olaf scholz russian president vladimir putin referred only briefly to the troop moves putin told reporters russia would not be satisfied with talk that ukraine was not ready to join nato any time soon and was demanding that the issue be resolved now as for war in europe about whether we want it or not of course not that is why we put forward proposals for a negotiation process the result of which should be an agreement on ensuring equal security for everyone including our country he said photo afp russia has been pressing for a set of security guarantees from the west and says it can exercise troops on its own territory as it sees fit russia s show of force near ukraine s borders has prompted months of frantic western diplomacy and drawn threats of severe sanctions if it invades the kremlin sought to portray its moves as proof that western talk of war had been both false and hysterical february 15 2022 will go down in history as the day western war propaganda failed humiliated and destroyed without a single shot fired foreign ministry spokeswoman maria zakharova said the defence ministry published footage showing tanks and other armoured vehicles being loaded onto railway flatcars western military analysts said they needed more information to judge the significance of the latest troop movements commercial satellite images taken on sunday and monday showed a flurry of russian military activity at several locations near ukraine russian shares government bonds and the rouble rose sharply on hopes the situation was easing and ukrainian government bonds rallied major stock indices rose in the united states and europe

this article is more than 2 years old sspl via getty images there is signifant evidence that postage stamps are not just a good investment but also an investment with positive features found in securities or other better known instruments for the growth and preservation of wealth as far back as 1992 my database began accumulating cost information on what we considered investment quality stamps with a goal of finding attributes and patterns among those stamps which demonstrated a clear history of price appreciation the goal of course was to identify those stamps showing the greatest appreciation in the past while likely to also have the highest appreciation in the future to achieve this however a number of other factors were considered such as the composition of the stamp market for specific countries as well as currency fluctuations demographic considerations and the politics size and economic strength of the country of issue forbes magazine took note of our efforts in this new investment opportunity in an article published december 21 1992 titled the stamp arbs we were asked to give some recommendations of stamps to buy and supplied 7 recommendations we went back recently and found that over 27 years those stamps had appreciated 301 or 11 1 per year on a 1920 investment how many other things fared as well the irony is that many stamp investors aren t even that interested in stamp appreciation they often have more money than midas and just want to preserve what they have or they want to hide their wealth or they live in an unstable country where a very portable item that is not easily recognizable is an important resource when one needs to flee the country on short notice some additional factors argue for diversifying into investment grade stamps the supply is fixed and does not respond to demand supply is more a function of death of a collector or investor than demand an exception was the early 1980s inflation which ran up the price of gold and silver as well as stamps due to sheer speculation in which the holding period by speculators was measured in days rather than years many dealers got caught up in this speculative wave and took losses so today they will still tell you how stamps are a bad investment the price appreciation of stamps is very stable precisely because the available supply of any given item is so low most of the price fluctuations we see in stocks is not in stamps because the three elements that cause most price fluctuations interest rates economic performance and political stability are not part of the buy sell equation and often are counter indicators on the upside much like gold investment caliber stamps share a superior demand profile from run of the mill items hence when an investor wants a specific stamp he wants multiple copies stamp collectors on the other hand are looking for only one copy and resents having to pay full price since bargain hunting is a great part of the hobby they resent having to bid against an investor who is willing to pay full price at an auction dealers hate them even more since they need to have sufficient margin over resale at retail to collectors we also note that in general the higher the price of a given stamp the more rapidly it will appreciate in the securities market there is no such relationship between the price of a security and its potential appreciation except possibly in the reverse stamps serve as an alternative currency in countries with taxes on money transfers and a need for secrecy from government in the transaction for example individuals sending money from the usa to relatives in iran do not want the government there to know their address in the usa it is a terrorist state and can compel the usa relative to shelter a visiting terrorist to avoid their relatives being imprisoned better to send the relative a valuable stamp which they can sell to a local money changer who sells it to someone wanting to hide or get money out of the country the stamp market is considered a hobby market and thus has none of the legal constraints of the securities markets they are also traded worldwide on the internet or at international and local auctions however the quality of any given stamp is a huge factor in its pricing so misrepresentations are extensive especially as prices rise it s no place for amateurs so get to know the pitfalls and how to avoid them before you buy we discuss each of these issues in an analysis of the stamp market in my book moneystamps the safe haven investment in an unsafe world since publication of this book in 2020 we have refined the analysis of individual stamps to make them easier to evaluate as only about 60 000 stamps qualify under our definition of investment grade but within these 60 000 items there are radically different potentials just as in securities which are ranked by credit agencies from aaa to c we rate stamps from a moneystamp rating of msr1 to about msr12 with a rating of msr4 to msr6 being the most frequent our ratings can be found on the stampfinder com website investors will find through using these ratings they can buy stamps with a msr8 or msr10 rating for the same discount from catalog as a lower rated stamp since most dealers are unaware of the appreciation rate of specific stamps thus pricing them by a rule of thumb as the moneystamps methodology becomes better understood we expect dealers to become more astute in their pricing but for now you can be the man with sight in a world of the blind

portfolio of projects and actively assessing opportunities in the market 4q21 highlights operational and financial consolidated net revenue reached us 678 million in the fourth quarter compared with us 635 million a year ago and us 655 million in 3q21 mainly driven by higher metal prices zinc production of 81kt in the quarter decreased by 12 compared to 4q20 primarily explained by lower zinc

when he was 60 years old ezra goldstein never expected to start a new career running a bookstore but that s exactly what happened when he took over park slope s community bookstore the oldest independent bookstore in brooklyn in 2009 the unexpected turn of events turned out to be a surprisingly rewarding path he brought the bookstore out of debt became a fixture of park slope and has been called the oracle of brooklyn s literary community now at 73 goldstein is ready to shelve his last book on friday goldstein will retire leaving the reins in the hands of the community bookstore s co owner stephanie valdez who is 35 years his junior i am retiring because i m old enough to do so wise enough to get out while i have my wits about me still fit enough to keep up with my hyper active outdoorsy wife and offspring he wrote in a letter that was posted on the store s social media pages and on park slope community forums as well as sent in an email to customers prior to running the store goldstein had spent the previous 40 years of his career as a writer for local newspapers including the long island jewish world in the 2000s he was a freelance editor and writer and helped ghostwrite memoirs for some local holocaust survivors the display at community bookstore in brooklyn window offers a gauge of how the neighborhood is thinking and feeling at any given moment said writer and patron tim mohr credit julia gergely jta it was working on a story in 2009 for the park slope civic council s newsletter that changed the course of his life he was interviewing his friend catherine bohne who had owned community bookstore since 2001 by the end of the third bottle of wine bohne confessed that she was ready to abandon the bookstore and move to albania a lifelong dream of hers if only she could find someone to take it off her hands she joked she had felt extreme pressure from amazon as well as barnes noble which had arrived in 1997 and was only six blocks away bohne was eager to get out from underneath the stress goldstein went home to tell his wife annette whom he met while volunteering with the progressive group new jewish agenda but instead of the laugh he expected she took bohne s threat seriously she said well why don t you do it it ll get you out of the house goldstein recalled soon enough bohne had booked a flight across the atlantic and was handing goldstein the keys for a trial run if you like it we can work something out she said twelve years later it s clear that the friends gamble paid off goldstein transformed the struggling store into a thriving community hub even acquiring a second bookstore terrace books in neighboring windsor terrace in 2013 bohne meanwhile never returned stateside and has spent the last decade working in various grassroots organizations to promote sustainable tourism and conservation efforts in the albanian alps still the first few months weren t easy he turned to valdez an especially competent and passionate member of the team goldstein may have made a late life change in his career but at 25 valdez was just beginning hers it was a perfect match within a fairly short time it was thriving goldstein told the new york jewish week once we got books back on the shelves and showed the neighborhood that we were serious about this everyone got behind us and we just kept going from there ezra really turned things around by through a combination of discipline care and diligence valdez said when ezra and stephanie took over the store they were simultaneously able to nurture the cozy personal neighborhood feel of the place and transform community into one of the country s leading independent bookshops said tim mohr a literary translator and the author of burning down the haus a history of german punk rock who lived nearby for 15 years thanks to ezra and stephanie s leadership it became not only a beacon for the brooklyn literary scene but a national tastemaker the day to day running of the bookstore mostly includes ordering and stocking all the books that park slopers could ever want bestsellers books from local authors cookbooks coffee table books and more a lot of what we do is shaped by the neighborhood we are in he said it s a very intelligent readership and a very sophisticated audience so we were very lucky because we never had to stock a lot of schlock we could always have good books more so than any other local business checking out the display window at community offers a gauge of how the neighborhood is thinking and feeling at any given moment said mohr who would often start his days drinking coffee and chatting with ezra as he opened the store items in the display window are also available to view on the bookstore s website for those who have moved out of the neighborhood originally from zainesville ohio goldstein moved to park slope in 1986 when the neighborhood looked and felt very different there were drug deals going down two blocks down the street in a bodega you know openly in the daylight he said in a 2015 interview for the urban memory project you know for an ohio kid who didn t know what was going on it was very scary of course these days park slope is a destination neighborhood in uber cool brooklyn and one of the most expensive neighborhoods in new york park slope is probably best known for its quality public schools and the young families that populate the neighborhood as well as its cadre of a list writers including paul auster siri hustvedt and jonathan safran foer supporting local authors goldstein said is one of his favorite parts of the job he has also gotten to know hundreds of customers who have come and gone over the last 12 years there s great continuity in a small shop in a tight community he said i have watched children grow up in turn the loyalty of many park slopers was critical when the pandemic first hit and the shop like nearly everything else in the city was forced to close its doors he was relieved and honored when floods of online orders started coming in not just from brooklyn but from all over the country these days the bookstore is still able to hold the community together through virtual events that bring together writers and readers from across the globe for example gal beckerman will present his newest book the quiet before a study of radical social movements on feb 16 and nobel prize winner olga tokarczuk will present her newly translated novel the books of jacob on feb 19 community bookstore is such a fixture in park slope as much a community center as a place to buy books said beckerman who is senior editor for books at the atlantic and a park sloper for nearly two decades beckerman is also the spouse of deborah kolben who is the chief content officer of the new york jewish week s parent company 70 faces media and ezra made that happen he cares deeply about books and literary culture and it was always a pleasure to walk in there and chat about what he was reading goldstein s love of books runs deep he grew up in a household filled with books something that he said helped shape his jewish identity you don t have to be jewish to be a successful bookstore owner goldstein who has served as vice president of the park slope jewish center but it is very fulfilling i love reading i m passionate about books and i m sure that my jewish roots have a great deal to do with that in retirement goldstein plans to spend time with his new grandson and tiny the cat the bookstore s unofficial mascot who was a kitten when goldstein first took over the store he also

25 83 billion total liabilities 11 22 billion net worth 14 61 billion net worth is just one way of looking at a company s value here are some key valuation measures to consider as well valuation measures market cap 32 224 billion diluted eps 7 28 p e ratio 17 81 forward p e 5 74 price to sales 98 price to book value 2 36 dividend yield 1 64 data is accurate as of feb 10 2022 is nucor a good buy right now nucor is the largest steel manufacturing company in north america and has a long track record of success but does that mean now is a good time to buy nucor stock here are two reasons why purchasing the stock might be a good idea and one reason to consider waiting consistent dividends nucor has consistently increased its base dividend for almost 50 years this consistency is a sign of a strong company with solid financials investors like dividend stocks because they generate income along with potential share price gains some investors also believe they are good defensive stocks as they generally hold their value better when the market sees a correction nucor s track record with dividends is a good reason to like the stock new share repurchase program on may 13 2021 nucor announced that the board of directors had approved an adjustment to their share repurchase program this amended the 2 billion repurchase program the board had authorized in 2018 increasing the amount to 3 billion in december 2021 the board terminated prior programs and authorized a new stock buyback program that allows nucor to repurchase up to 4 billion in common stock nucor repurchased about 13 5 million shares in the fourth quarter of 2021 buybacks and dividend payments together returned about 3 76 billion to nucor shareholders last year when companies buy back shares of their stock it reduces the total number of outstanding shares on the market generally this raises the value of the stock and shows investors that management believes the current share price is a value compared to future growth potential share buyback programs seem to be in vogue right now with many companies announcing new buyback programs across the broader market this trend could be a boost for the stock market as a whole including companies like nucor steel is a cyclical business the steel business and other cyclical sectors like construction travel and luxury goods usually perform well during economic expansion however during times of economic contraction these types of companies often don t perform as well the covid 19 pandemic in 2020 affected many industries and steel was one of them the challenges showed in its earnings 1 30 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to 7 97 for the first quarter of 2021 nucor s consolidated net sales increased 81 in 2021 compared to 2020 tons shipped to outside customers increased 11 and average sales per ton increased 64 that said the u s economy hasn t fully recovered from the effects of the pandemic and nucor s recent performance isn t necessarily indicative of what you can expect in the future final take many signs are positive for nucor its base dividends have consistently increased for decades and its new share repurchase suggests that nucor expects its value to rise in addition nucor is expanding the company recently acquired a majority stake in california steel industries inc according to a feb 4 press release but if you do choose to invest remember that the strength of the steel industry will depend strongly on the state of the economy will 2022 see new economic expansion that remains to be seen with shares off their all time high but still trading well above pre pandemic prices investors do seem to be pricing in good news for nucor time will tell daria uhlig contributed to the reporting for

more and more black people are investing in the stock market and with data that indicates 34 of black households own equity investments this is good news right well not exactly it is vital for black households to consider how lifestyle marketers and social media might trigger financial trauma on the road to building wealth as the culture shifts to embrace ideas around ownership including equity investing intellectual property land real estate and even cryptocurrency it s clear that ownership and public displays of ownership is the new cool but are we doing it to build wealth or are we doing it for the gram lifestyle marketing via social media has many people questioning whether or not the race they are running and the pace they are running it is appropriate for where they are in their lives screenshots of financial gains credit line increases and account balances meant to motivate and inspire might have the opposite effect people may learn to covet the results that come as a result of years of study trial and error and a moment in time without taking into account the many failures that may have led up to that point and that may follow and compare those successes to their learning and building phase this becomes a slippery slope as an original desire to build wealth can rapidly morph into greed and ego driven attempts to flex for social media likes follows and even sales a recipe for disaster for all involved when did keeping up with the jones s start to look like financial education unfortunately this is not new or unique to our community as is the case for many other things social media simply amplifies it lifestyle marketing i aspired to be poor was one of the opening lines of my 2019 ted talk where i describe growing up on section 8 and deciding that when i was old enough to live on my own that i would get an apartment on section 8 when i realized that homeownership was not only possible for me but probable after reading the book rich dad poor dad i decided to do everything i could to put myself in a position to own before 25 i was disciplined and determined and saved a down payment of about 12 000 before i stumbled upon a real estate investing seminar with the rich dad name for the entire three days the audience was sold on lifestyle being able to provide for your family taking action etc i spent my entire down payment on the base plan that covered topics strategies and information i would later learn i could find for much cheaper or free via google lifestyle marketing taps into the traumas you already have around money by making a connection between where you are and where you would like to be if you buy this program course etc many people learn the hard way that it takes a bit more than that high ticket course or program to realize the success needed to change their lifestyle some even recognize that the marketed lifestyle isn t even one that the marketer lives regularly further exacerbating that financial trauma with mistrust toward financial professionals educators and coaches meme stocks nfts and cryptocurrencies suppose you re like me and have been burnt by a well marketed product or program in that case you have two options you put yourself out there again wiser and more informed about the triggers you have in making a decision or you reject any attempts made to market to you and try to figure it out for yourself unfortunately companies invest in marketing to both robinhood uses gamification to entice inexperienced investors and has been accused of manipulating customers via that gamification by massachusetts regulators at the height of the pandemic we saw an increased interest in stocks from companies like gamestop and amc and cryptocurrency meme coins like doge and shiba inu because of viral social media even celebrities like elon musk mark cuban and meek mill got in on the action prompting inexperienced investors to buy not because of explicit direction but because of articulated interest that s not to say that money can t be made investing in the asset classes mentioned still it is important to consider the risks associated with investing as a whole and that s not a message echoed loud enough amid the screenshots and celebratory praises of massive overnight increases in value nft s or non fungible tokens are now the asset class of focus with status attached to exclusive access and unique designs displayed across social media from celebrities to your next door neighbor it can be easy to throw money at social media trends when your favorite stars are indirectly endorsing it even if that money is needed for bills which furthers the case for education and due diligence to be clear just because you participate in the purchase and sale of asset classes doesn t make you an investor and just because you are an investor doesn t mean you re financially literate when we think about the need for more ownership and financial literacy in our communities we also have to think about how to defend against the manipulation of our financial traumas doubts and desperation when being marketed to under the guise of generational wealth and financial literacy rahkim

a surfer walks along a sea wall in malé in front of the chinese funded sinamalé bridge constructed in 2018 connecting malé to hulhulé and hulhumalé a wildly popular sport and one of the few activities possible on crowded malé many complain the construction has worsened the surf conditions as you descend into the maldives the aerial view is spectacular in two rows 1 200 turquoise rings dot the seascape in the middle of the indian ocean along the chagos laccadive ridge the constellation of coral islands connects the lowest lying country in the world like a fragile necklace just after landing the country s rapid transformation is apparent in the many newly built high rises and construction sites in the background malé is just a stone s throw away sitting right in the center of the more than two dozen coral atolls the jam packed capital sits a mere meter above sea level without an inch wasted its urban mayhem makes it one of the most densely populated places on the planet where 200 000 people jostle daily for space and pay a premium for it the remainder of the country s population is scattered throughout the rest of its 200 inhabited islands and lives in a vastly different reality unsurprisingly the maritime nation has staked its economic livelihood on its coastal riches for generations on fishing and today overwhelmingly on tourism with 80 percent of its expansive territory lying less than a meter above sea level the population of 500 000 is well aware of the wrath of the sea this means the country s cash cows highly fragile ecosystems are at the mercy of future climate volatility in 2004 the boxing day tsunami became a crisis for the country within an hour of a massive earthquake in the indian ocean and without warning much of the maldives was submerged the resulting tsunami inundating the capital and causing widespread infrastructural damage throughout the country the financial toll ran beyond half a billion dollars with almost half of the country s gdp erased entire islands were rendered uninhabitable and abandoned droves of people relocated to malé in search of a better more stable life external pressure after the tsunami led to constitutional reform and eventually a new constitution in 2007 in 2008 the country had its first democratically elected leader mohammed nasheed who advocated for more urgent climate action particularly on behalf of small vulnerable states with a renewed sense of urgency in addressing the climate threat climate issues became more prominent in political discourse and slowly started to resonate with more maldivians still in a deeply religious country explaining climate impacts to the local population has been a hard sell at the beginning of his presidency nasheed told the new york times for your average fisherman who feels very insignificant in front of god they are finding it difficult to understand the connection between climate change and human activity after nasheed s famous underwater cabinet meeting ahead of the 2009 copenhagen climate change conference cop15 he told reporters while still wearing full scuba gear we are trying to send our message let the world know what will happen to the maldives if climate change is not checked this is a challenging situation and we would like to see that people actually do something about it after cop15 sizing up the gravity of the situation he said we worked really hard for a deal in copenhagen but in hindsight coming back to the maldives you realize how impossible the whole thing is you re having to spend less on health care less on education and then use that money on concrete and sea walls enormous changes over the last three decades maldivians have flocked to malé from the outer atolls seeking better services employment opportunities and access to schools predictably space soon ran out malé s booming urban population constantly tested the island s capacities to provide water electricity and other basic services to its citizens motivating the government to try and alleviate the situation back in 1997 hulhulé island just across from malé was a mere airstrip tasked with quickly shuttling arriving tourists onto private boats or small seaplanes that took them to faraway resorts a quarter of a century later the landscape could not be more different two separate lagoons have been transformed into a new connected island attaching artificial hulhumalé to hulhulé by road started by then president maumoon gayoom to primarily ease congestion for malé residents and spur economic development the country went all in on population relocation to hulhumalé planned in two phases the intention of the city of hope in divehi was to be the antithesis of malé spacious higher orderly and more livable millions of tons of sand were dredged from the sea to create the new artificial island purposely built higher at two meters above sea level to protect the new island from future sea inundation with the completion of the first phase tens of thousands relocated from outer islands and from malé to hulhuhmalé in 2018 malé hulhulé and hulhumalé were connected with a 2 kilometer bridge which cost 200 million and was financed by chinese loans substantial sums were borrowed for an airport expansion too the country is still sorting out the debt mess accrued under then president yameen whose spending spree is estimated to equal about a third of the maldives entire gdp corruption had become normalized mariyam shiuna executive director of transparency maldives told the financial times in 2019 allegations of corruption were widespread in president yameen s time and whenever people questioned it the response was that you don t need to know much is still unknown about the maldives debt situation concerning china the bill was 3 1 billion nasheed now speaker of parliament told the bbc in 2020 the chinese ambassador to male zhang lizhong replied china never imposes additional requirements to the maldivian side or any other developing country which they do not want to accept or against their will despite the rapid expansion of hulhumalé it is not yet a viable economic alternative to malé for most maldivians but that is expected to change as phase 2 of construction continues targeting 100 000 more people to move there in the next few years hulhumalé could house up to a quarter of a million people three times more than currently live in malé in different types of housing social housing has been set aside for those coming from the outer atolls and the capital along with more expensive housing options it is widely expected that more than half of the population could live there within a decade large spatial inequalities complicate the government s work as it is increasingly expensive to provide logistical support and services across the country over 90 percent of poor maldivians live in the outer atolls those who stay on the outer inhabited islands face crowded conditions so reclamation is an extremely popular policy but it is not without controversy though as much of the construction is done haphazardly and destroys natural coral and beaches said paul roberts an advisor to nasheed according to the asian development bank the government has finalized a national spatial plan nsp which focuses on a 20 year roadmap for infrastructure spatial development and decentralization therefore the nsp s focus is on development across all the islands and to reduce the overcrowding and congestion in the capital where approximately 300 000 live in an area of 8 3 square kilometers sometimes five people sleep in a single bedroom 10 in one flat there are still a lot of people who are choosing to relocate to malé roberts said the country has moved from a coercive approach to relocation under the former administration to giving people an option whether they want to relocate to hulhumalé or not the whole election 2018 slogan was centered around that issue relocation was completely scrapped and people could remain on their local islands roberts said a heavy burden under nasheed s administration the maldivian government made climate change adaptation a top priority and today the country spends 30 50 percent of its gdp annually on adaptation and mitigation measures around the country adaptation is expensive we are already spending more than 30 percent of our expenditures on adaptation desalination water systems irrigation systems harvesting issues on flood defenses coastal erosion sand migration and many other natural disasters nasheed said before cop26 in glasgow last year the maldives released updated targets in its ndc national determined contribution report and now aims to reduce 26 percent of its emissions and achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2030 pending increased international financial support the latest ipcc report released last august paints an even more dire picture for the country the u n s climate panel said limiting global warming close to 1 5 degrees celsius or even 2 degrees celsius will be beyond reach in the next two decades without immediate rapid and large scale reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for small states like the maldives the report says that global warming is dangerously close to spiraling out of control small island developing states sids including the maldives kiribati tuvalu and the marshall islands were labeled as having a disproportionately higher risk of adverse consequences of global warming nasheed has been the chief climate voice for maldivians and other small states for years referring to the ipcc ar6 report he said this report is devastating news for the most climate vulnerable countries like the maldives it confirms we are on the edge of extinction climate emergency is intensifying we are on the front lines our nations are already battered by extreme climate a new ipcc report is expected this month in outer atolls this is already a reality in the more densely populated islands in the north of the maldives residents have volunteered to evacuate in the coming years as tidal surges become the norm half of the country s inhabited islands have already reported coastal erosion with more than 30 islands in a severely eroded state despite the urgency paying for these climate costs is overwhelming one of the very difficult issues that we have is our debt many vulnerable countries are debt ridden for us to spend much money on adaptation building sea walls reclamation embankments and such things to make sure that we survive the extreme weather is expensive for us to do that expensive work we would need the money because we already are in so much debt whatever assistance that we get would go right to the debt holders nasheed told npr last year glasgow disappointments twelve years later just before cop 26 in glasgow nasheed shifted his climate message saying i see more people talking about adaptation instead of mitigation we are all going to lose it s not just the maldives after the new agreement in glasgow statements from the maldives delegation indicated disappointment president ibrahim solih said on twitter the maldives welcomes the glasgow climate pact that was agreed to at cop26 the crucial 1 5c is alive however there is still a lot of work to be done the maldives calls upon all nations to do all that is necessary to ensure that climate ambition becomes climate reality maldives environment minister aminath shauna said that the latest agreement was not in line with the urgency and scale required and the difference between 1 5 and 2 degrees is a death sentence for us what looks balanced and pragmatic to other parties will not help the maldives adapt in time cops are always disappointing and are always watered down to the lowest common denominator but there were lots of positive outcomes too a new renewable energy target which has the potential to transform south asia and will be great for the maldives indian solar industry said roberts a financial conundrum as a middle income country the maldives is in a tight financial spot not eligible for a lot of development assistance in many cases but also unable to access affordable loans with low interest rates because of political instability and high climate risks the u n has created funds specifically to help climate stressed countries but the money isn t coming quick enough there is no financing coming from the green climate fund so far for the maldives it s extremely difficult to access these funds mark lynas a climate expert who advises nasheed on climate and works with the 48 member climate vulnerable forum told the diplomat more than 12 years ago there were promises by wealthy countries for 100 billion in climate finance to help climate vulnerable countries adapt and protect themselves from future climate impacts according to npr much of that funding came in the form of loans instead of grants which developing countries say further strains their climate efforts as they struggle to repay them the maldives needs an estimated 9 billion climate financing is way too slow and redundant the money will likely never come roberts said there have been two projects since 2009 and they were impossibly bureaucratic the key problem is that financing its ambitions to net zero the costs are so high while fossil fuels are inexpensive interest rates are above 10 percent and expensive because of political instability debt problems storms and climate related risks if they can focus on access to cheap capital that would unlock the free market covid 19 has exacerbated the situation making it even harder for the government to achieve its climate goals for future emission reduction and resilience whatever we have budgeted for climate finance in our national budgets has gone to dealing with the pandemic foreign minister abdullah shahid said recently new forms of resilience aside from the giant ongoing construction on hulhumalé there are numerous other projects in the works around the country this year the netherlands based company dutch docklands is due to start construction on the world s first sustainable floating city to mitigate climate effects and stay on top of rising sea levels which will be eventually connected to malé the project should be less environmentally harmful compared to the dredging necessary to create hulhulmalé which has been harmful to the coral reefs that serve as the literal backbone of the country s physical geography coral plays a crucial role in coastal protection as a natural buffer from storms and helps protect underwater life coral transplants from resistant species are being installed into dead coral areas around the country to survive warmer currents the floating city is good for allowing housing without land reclamation by dutch docklands roberts said in the addu atoll the creation of artificial reefs by 3d printing is another solution against bleaching and coral destruction floating solar panels are planned for outer islands which can place them in lagoons that are much calmer than the open sea last june after a long campaign by environmental activists headed by the advocacy organization parley the government banned single use plastics an uncertain future it s going to be very difficult for us to adapt to climate change issues if we do not have a solid and secure democratic governance nasheed said in 2012 after resigning under threat of a coup just four years after being elected a backslide to the old regime would likely mean climate mitigation efforts could stall completely or be undone by a different administration last year in may nasheed survived another assassination attempt and in late november former president abdullah yameen was released from jail while 30 years of authoritarian rule ended with the 2008 election but politics have been turbulent in the country ever since with the next presidential election coming up in september 2023 there is a huge risk in terms of backtracking roberts said as for hulhumalé a flood assessment detailed in a recent report concluded that hulhumalé is built sufficiently high to be safe from flooding under present extreme still water level conditions and with these conditions combined with wave events this indicates that hulhumalé is likely to be safe from flooding during the 21st century as long as the sea level rise is less than 0 6 m if we remain at the paris levels the islands should be ok hulhumalé should be enough although environmentally it s not great sea level rise is not an existential risk but compounded by extreme storm surges is more of a risk malé should also be fine with adaptation measures until the end of the century depending on sea level rise said lynas despite the resilience of maldivians who have lived alongside the sea for generations the country cannot wait much longer for more durable solutions dozens of other islands in the maldives face a multitude of threats erosion that continuously chips away at the land difficulties in disposing of waste and a constant freshwater crisis our islands are slowly being inundated by the sea one by one solih the current president of the maldives said at cop26 if we do not reverse this trend the maldives will cease to exist by the end of this century
washington amid a steady drip of damaging headlines pressure is building for congress to pass legislation that would curtail lawmakers ability to speculate on the stock market trading in congress has long been criticized by government watchdogs who say the access to nonpublic information creates a temptation for lawmakers to prioritize their own finances over the public good but public anger has mounted since the first tremors of the pandemic when some lawmakers were caught buying and selling millions of dollars worth of stock after being warned about the coming disruption from the virus the pandemic s arrival tanked markets and caught many americans by surprise now with november elections fast approaching and members of both parties embracing reform congressional leaders are getting on the bandwagon expressing their willingness to toughen the rules after a spate of controversies over suspiciously timed trades and undisclosed transactions few lawmakers are defending the status quo raising hopes that a significant ethics package is within reach this isn t going to solve all of america s problems but it s a substantive reform that three fourths of the country supports said sen jon ossoff who is sponsoring a bill that would require lawmakers and their spouses to sell off stocks or place such assets in a blind trust the georgia democrat beat republican sen david perdue last year in a race that turned largely on perdue s pandemic era stock trading there s reason for skepticism past efforts to tighten ethics rules have fallen short of lawmakers lofty declarations and in the end the task of writing ethics rules governing congress is left to the lawmakers themselves creating a conflict that often results in easily evaded restrictions advertisement but progress is apparent a raft of bills have been introduced some by lawmakers at opposite ends of the ideological spectrum senators are working on a compromise and house speaker nancy pelosi whose husband is a prolific trader is on board with the legislative push though she has advocated a more targeted approach pelosi supports strengthening an existing law the stock act which requires lawmakers to disclose their stock sales and purchases she has also called for extending stock trading disclosure requirements to members of the judiciary while stiffening penalties for members of congress who flout the rules it s complicated pelosi said last week what we re trying to build is consensus her stance has evolved since december when pelosi reacted to a question about lawmaker trades by saying there is a free market that members of congress should be able to participate in past ethics reforms demonstrate the challenge ahead the stock act was signed into law in 2012 at the time lawmakers and government watchdogs predicted that public disclosure would shame lawmakers out of actively buying and selling stock that hasn t happened a decade later trading continues apace and no one has been prosecuted under the law advertisement the same could be said for reforms enacted in the wake of the jack abramoff lobbying scandal a 2007 law that was intended to force more disclosure of lobbying activity instead created a new class of shadow lobbyists who work to influence public policy but don t have to register as a lobbyist or disclose their activities both those bills certainly did not solve the actual problems themselves said craig holman a registered lobbyist for the good government group public citizen he said the earlier laws were important but added that there is room for improvement several lawmakers have come under fire for their stock portfolios last year the associated press reported that democratic rep tom malinowski of new jersey repeatedly failed to disclose trades worth as much as 1 million in medical and tech companies that had a stake in the virus response he now supports efforts to curtail lawmakers trading former sens perdue and kelly loeffler both georgia republicans lost their runoff bids for the senate last year after their own stock trades became a campaign issue both were investigated by the justice department and ultimately cleared perdue had dumped between 1 million and 5 million worth of stock in a company where he was formerly a board member after markets crashed he bought it back and earned a windfall after its price skyrocketed advertisement loeffler and her husband the ceo and chairman of the parent company of the new york stock exchange bought and sold millions of dollars in stock following a briefing on the virus republican sen richard burr of north carolina drew perhaps the most scrutiny for his trades he stepped aside as chairman of the senate intelligence committee after the fbi obtained a search warrant to seize a cellphone burr and his wife sold 1 6 million in early 2020 just before the market began to dive according to court records the justice department investigated burr s actions but did not file charges and closed the case the securities and exchange commission continues to probe the matter drafting the legislation presents a challenge difficult questions remain such as whether lawmakers who sell their assets would be required to pay capital gains tax whether the proposed ban would apply to spouses and children and whether stocks purchased before serving in congress would be exempt but supporters of the effort say the rules need to be as tight as possible i think that the worst possible thing that democratic leadership could do would be to put forth a bit of a hand wave effort said rep abigail spanberger d va that would be so outrageously insulting to the american people spanberger is sponsoring a bill with texas republican chip roy that would require lawmakers to place assets like stock in a blind trust advertisement the issue has broad support from the public republicans and democrats alike point to recent polling which they say indicates as much as three quarters of the electorate supports action too many americans have lost faith in congress as an institution said sen steve daines r mont who is sponsoring a bill with sen elizabeth warren d mass to ban lawmakers from owning stock sen warren and i disagree on many important issues but we agree and have found common ground that we have to restore faith in congress holman the good government lobbyist said it s time for congress to go further than the stock act it really did reduce stock trading activity by members of congress by two thirds holman said the problem is there s still one third of members of congress
