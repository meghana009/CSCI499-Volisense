a colorado man needed to repair his damaged screen door so he went on amazon to order fiberglass screen mesh when the package arrived don thompson was shocked to discover a 20 gauge shotgun inside the box the 78 year old thompson said he orders things from amazon all the time usually getting four of five packages delivered every day but this was the biggest shipping mistake he has ever encountered i was totally dumbfounded it s terrifying absolutely terrifying to me thompson told kcnc thompson reached out to the jefferson county sheriff s office which dispatched an officer to retrieve the gun a preliminary investigation revealed the shotgun had been reported stolen it does appear that it was stolen but we ve barely begun our investigation and there is apparently a lot to unravel said jenny fulton with the jefferson county sheriff s office it is unclear how the mix up happened because amazon does not stock or sell firearms the news station confirmed that the tracking number thompson received for the screen mesh was the same as the number on the box with the shotgun the label also showed that the package which was shipped by the united states postal service came from a fulfillment center in illinois amazon said it is investigating the incident and has refunded thompson for the cost of the screen mesh and credited his account with an additional 250 i m terribly sorry to hear we ve shipped you a firearm instead of the screen you purchased this certainly isn t what we want our customers to expect and i can assure you the firearm was shipped unintentionally an amazon representative wrote in an email to thompson we re conducting an internal investigation of the errors leading to this shipping out from our fulfillment center to ensure this doesn t happen to any other customers

in a sign that national security tech is a safe bet even during troubled economic times defense and security focused vc firm razor s edge ventures today announced the closing of its third startup investment fund at just under 340 million it exceeded the initial target of 250 million the firm notes and will target companies developing autonomous systems space technologies cybersecurity ai and machine learning digital signal processing and other aerospace and defense technologies founded in 2010 razor s edge funds multistage startups with both commercial and government customers but specializes in ventures that national security community solve difficult technology problems and advance critical missions in its own words the outfit s interest areas are informed by strategic national security priorities managing partner mark spoto tells techcrunch with the ostensible goal of helping the u s maintain technological superiority advertisement advertisement while economic conditions in the broad financial markets are challenging at this time spending for defense has grown significantly both in the u s and abroad we face an increasingly complex and growing threat environment spoto said via email limited partners lps in our latest fund appreciated that razor s edge offers an investment opportunity that participates in a unique way in a growing market and is not correlated to the broad financial stock or commercial technology markets and in many ways serves as a countercyclical hedge to those asset classes we launched our fundraising for the new fund last fall and wrapped it up in june exceeding our fundraising target traditional venture firms are often reluctant to invest in defense oriented startups given both the ethical implications and long pathway to profitability in the u s it typically takes at least 18 months of planning before a government contractor wins its first contract and most contracts are awarded to incumbents any startup that gets a foot in the door has to bridge the gap between the r d phase and the contract award razor s edge claims to have an advantage in its connections with the national security community and its investment approach the firm operates under a two pronged strategy backing early stage startups e g series a and b as well as more established companies for example razor s edge recently invested in corsha a washington d c based cybersecurity startup looking to bring multifactor authentication security to machine to machine api traffic another of the firm s portfolio companies is x bow systems which is developing a solid rocket motor story continues when it comes to the early stage investments razor s edge says it narrows in on companies it believes can grow into sizable business in the defense and intelligence markets and then later expand into commercial enterprise verticals for the more established and later stage prospects which tend to be companies already doing work with the u s government razor s edge advises on strategic business investments and tuck in acquisitions we believe we are one of the first venture capital funds created that had as its sole investment thesis a national security focus the idea for razor s edge was borne out of the successes of blackbird technologies and ravenwing both national security technology companies founded and operated by the firm s managing partners spoto said we have a strong bias for management teams that seek revenue quickly operate leanly and can leverage government contracts and revenues to mitigate longer term capital requirements and to build products that the markets want and will pay for a huge network of talent in areas such as management operations engineering and sales that our portfolio companies draw from razor s edge has a few successes under its belt two initial public offerings and two material m a exits and 600 million in assets under management a perfect track record is elusive no matter the thoroughness of the due diligence however and when asked about hype cycles in the defense space spoto admitted that it s a difficult trap for vcs not to fall into there s overhype from valuation and funding perspective in cybersecurity and also in parts of some other areas like drone and border security technologies he said there are other areas that we are trying to get smarter on and taking a longer view such as quantum computing alternative power and energy technologies and the impacts of climate change on government and defense operations in any case razor s edge will have to compete with new and established rivals like booz allen hamilton s recently launched 100 million corporate venture arm booz allen ventures and shield capital a firm with defense department connections other competitors include lockheed martin s lockheed martin ventures and horizonx which spun off from boeing in august 2021
solution for ideological division revising the constitution collapse erin schaff the new york times ap file chief justice john roberts center shown with then members of the supreme court in october 2021 has pushed back against questions about the court s politicization in the wake of its decision to overturn roe v wade in june a constitution drafting project proposed limiting justices terms to 18 years and allowed for two supreme court appointments for every presidential term could constitutional rights be a contributing factor in america s ideological divisions that s the argument made by jamal greene author of how rights went wrong why our obsession with rights is tearing america apart courts have reduced complex discussions about rights into zero sum conflicts where a constitutional right overrides all other interests writes the columbia law school professor and former clerk for justice john paul stevens more recently he has been involved in the constitution drafting project organized by the national constitution center the venture grouped constitutional scholars into ideological teams and tasked them with drafting their ideal constitutions professor greene spoke with the monitor about the project as well as how america can move beyond the current climate of despair and divisiveness toward cooperation this interview has been edited for length and clarity could you explain what the constitution drafting project is and why you wanted to be a part of it so this is an initiative of the national constitution center in philadelphia that is trying to bring together people who come from different ideological orientations to see if they can come up with some sensible revisions to the constitution the way it was structured was to set up three teams each with a different ideological orientation a progressive team a libertarian team and a conservative team have them work independently to draft their own constitutions and then see where they agree and where they disagree that was kind of the first phase of the project and i don t know if this was intended from the start or whether it arose out of the first phase but the next phase was to have the teams get together and see if they can actually hammer out language in relation to the provisions or the potential amendments that they actually agree about so that s what we ve done there was a kind of mock constitutional convention in which we got together via zoom and tried to work out actual constitutional language that all three of these teams could actually agree on what have you learned throughout that process i think the biggest take home from the process is that quite a number of people across ideology actually can agree that there are aspects of the constitution that are in need of revision and about which revisions would be useful and helpful we actually agreed on five amendments some of which would be significant there was disagreement about the language and exactly around the margins and people had to make compromises but it was an object lesson in negotiation that people from different starting points can get together around something if they re willing to be open minded and engage with the arguments and objections made by others can you give more details on that what were you able to agree on one would remove the limitation on a president to be a natural born citizen everyone agreed that naturalized citizens should be able to be president at least if they have lived in the country for a certain length of time there was a second amendment relating to and this gets a little bit inside baseball but it s quite important what s called a legislative veto which enables the legislature to override an agency regulation without necessarily getting the approval of the president a third amendment had to do with impeachment we all agreed to lower the threshold for senate conviction but raise the threshold for house impeachment so that they would both be three fifths the current constitution the house can impeach with a simple majority and the senate requires two thirds to convict so we made both of those numbers three fifths jason berger courtesy of harper collins jamal greene is a professor at columbia law school and author of how rights went wrong he participated in the constitution drafting project which brought together scholars with different ideologies to propose revisions to the u s constitution professor greene says it was an object lesson in negotiation that people from different starting points can get together around something if they re willing to be open minded and engage with the arguments and objections made by others a fourth amendment basically imposes 18 year term limits on the supreme court and regularized appointment process so that there are two justices appointed for every presidential term and then a final amendment that would change article 5 itself and change the actual amendment procedure in the constitution right now it requires a two thirds vote of both houses and three quarters of the state legislatures we changed that to a three fifths vote in both houses and two thirds of the states and also an additional possibility of either two thirds of the states or states representing three quarters of the population why did you want to be part of this and devote time to this what do you think is the broader significance well i really do think that the constitution which is a very old document was written for a very different society than what we have today is in need of significant revision and i also think that if we are going to revise the document it needs to be in a way that takes into account the views and commitments of a broad range of people and it s also important to show that it s possible for people who have different views and attitudes and commitments to compromise to negotiate and not just yell at each other on social media or cable news i think this is a good kind of object lesson in how one can actually come to agreement on things that we all can believe in even if we start from different points the country could use more examples of people coming to engage in what i think of as genuine politics which are figuring out how to move forward even though you come from different starting places you talk about the current state of our politics is that related to our constitution and in particular how it s interpreted right now they are related in the sense that one of the basic premises of the book is that we are a very pluralistic diverse people and the only way for a pluralistic diverse people to move forward together as a single society is if they don t understand themselves to have absolute entitlements against each other that conflict with each other that they really do need to engage in political conversation i m trying to live that by getting together with people i disagree about lots of things that s no reason not to try to come together around the things that we can agree on and also again to compromise in reality our constitution is famously difficult to change you write about how the problem of the 21st century is the problem of the rights line can you give an example of rights conflicting and what that s meant for our politics and our country there are lots of examples of it abortion rights is a clear example where there are entrenched sides both of which understand themselves to be vindicating constitutional rights gun rights affirmative action also in a lot of ways take these forms lots of conflicts over freedom of speech between the freedom of the listener or the freedom of the speaker and we tend to view those conflicts as if the job of the legal decision maker is to choose one of those rights or the other when they come into conflict as opposed to trying to mediate between them and that s a big part of what the book is about is some strategies for mediating between rights as to how realistic the project is as an academic one engages in lots of projects that don t have an immediate payoff so in some ways this seems more realistic than some of the things that academics typically do but i m not so sure that there s no practical possibility it is incredibly difficult to amend the constitution but we also have a kind of despair about constitutional amendment as if there s just nothing we could possibly agree to and this project shows that that s not true there are things that people could possibly agree to and just developing some momentum toward that end i think is a productive thing to do what do you see as the stakes the momentum that we have right now that you re trying to change where do you see that heading why do you think we need a correction i think among the stakes is self government itself governing oneself according to a 200 plus year old document that we can t change means that we in fact are not governing ourselves and so invigorating the idea that we actually have some agency in trying to decide what constitutional rules apply to our society is as important as anything in constitutional law i m just one person but it seems to me that among the things that a single person can do to try to get at that problem showing that it actually can be done and then actually going out and doing it and trying to defend it is among the more productive things one can do in the face of very steep odds whether we think of the constitution as something that we have any power to change it is the very stakes of self governance and i take those very seriously
philippine president ferdinand marcos jr addresses the 77th session of the united nations general assembly at u n headquarters in new york sept 20 2022 philippine president ferdinand marcos jr in his debut speech on the international stage at the u n general assembly on tuesday called for a united effort among the world s nations to confront climate change and other challenges such as inequality and injustice in an address that lasted about 21 minutes the new leader of the philippines and son of a former filipino president touched on issues ranging from global warming to inequalities between rich and poor countries as well as emerging technologies that are rapidly changing humanity we are confronted by tectonic shifts that will inform the ebb and flow of the coming century marcos said as he became the first philippine leader in eight years to speak in person at the general assembly hall in new york climate change is the greatest threat affecting our nations and peoples there is no other problem so global in nature that it requires a united effort one led by the united nations he said he called on the members of the world body to come together to correct a historical injustice reflected in climate change and for industrialized countries to cut carbon emissions and do their part in meeting their obligations under international agreements on climate change those who are least responsible suffer the most the philippines is a net carbon sink absorbing more carbon dioxide than we emit and yet we are the 4th most vulnerable country to climate change said marcos who wore a white embroidered traditional filipino barong shirt buttoned up to the collar with a philippine flag pinned to the lapel but the namesake son of the late dictator ferdinand e marcos pictured who in his time had addressed the same world body said little about human rights given his family s history the issue has shadowed him since before he was elected president in a landslide in may we need to reaffirm the wisdom of the founders of our united nations this means transcending our differences and committing to ending war upholding justice respecting human rights and maintaining international peace and security he said when the younger marcos gave his speech it was wednesday morning in manila on the day that marked the 50th anniversary of when his father signed a presidential proclamation that imposed martial law nationwide during 14 years of martial law activists have documented thousands of cases of deaths and enforced disappearances marcos also made no mention of the rule of law on the domestic front or efforts by the u n s international criminal court to investigate alleged abuses and thousands of officer involved killings committed by his immediate predecessor rodrigo duterte in the philippine war on drugs earlier this month the marcos administration said it was seeking to block an icc investigation into duterte ferdinand e marcos president of the philippines left is greeted by united nations secretary general u thant upon his arrival at the u n in new york where marcos addressed the general assembly sept 21 1966 however marcos alluded to his country s international legal battles with china over a territorial dispute in the south china sea at the same time he implied that his administration would take no sides in a geopolitical rivalry between beijing and washington amidst challenging global tides an important ballast stabilizes our common vessel the philippine president said that is our open inclusive and rules based international order that is governed by international law and informed by the principles of equity and justice as i have underscored the philippines shall continue to be a friend to all and enemy of none he had used the same catch phrase a friend to all and enemy of none in his first state of the nation speech to the philippine congress within a month of taking office in front of the united nations on tuesday marcos also talked about geopolitics but without naming china the united states or other powers widening geopolitical polarities and sharpening strategic competitions are transforming the international political landscape a profound lack of trust is putting enormous strains on our multilateral system he said in asia our hard won peace and stability is under threat by increasing strategic and ideological tensions marcos 65 was also making his first trip to the united states since he took office in late june during a speech at the new york stock exchange on monday he declared that ties between the philippines and the united states would become stronger under his administration president duterte his predecessor had pivoted manila away from traditional ally washington and closer to beijing during his six years in office despite tensions over the south china sea it is very clear to me that i cannot see the philippines in the future without having the united states as a partner marcos said at the stock exchange jojo riñoza in manila contributed to this report

delivered its third consecutive 0 75 percentage point rate hike to tamp down inflation markets are looking for any reason for a dovish read said kevin gordon senior investment research manager at charles schwab parts of the equity market don t buy that they re going to continue to keep their foot on the brake he said he added that it s clear that markets react and often rally any time that fed chair powell mentions any softening of economic data or signs of lower growth that s because investors are hoping that the fed pauses and pivots to rate cuts sooner rather than later that s unlikely though according to gordon pain is sort of a code word for recession he said commenting on powell s use of the word in his wednesday press conference that he first used in his jackson hole speech in august carmen reinicke investors should stay underweight on equities glenmede s pride says following wednesday s 75 basis point increase glenmede estimated the federal funds rate now sits close to neutral and could surpass it with future rate hikes that should give investors pause said one of its investing chiefs given the stubborn inertia of inflation and the fed s will to fight it prevailing premium valuations on equities do not appear justified given the material risks facing the economy and corporate profits said jason pride glenmede s private wealth chief investment officer as a result investors should maintain an underweight to equity market risk pride also noted that the fed s economic projections show the median respondent expecting slower economic growth and an increased unemployment rate that is essentially an admission that economic pain will likely be tolerated as an incidental effect from rising interest rates meant to combat inflation he said alex harring markets are mostly pricing in recession scenario stocks are finally coming around to the idea that the federal reserve is willing to push the economy into a recession to tame inflation according to chris zaccarelli chief investment officer of independent advisor alliance the market is beginning to believe that the fed is willing to cause a recession in order to bring inflation back down said zaccarelli he added that it seems that a recession scenario is about two thirds priced in because stocks are down about 20 from all time highs instead of 30 we would continue to exercise caution in the near term as the fed is determined to keep raising rates until inflation begins to drop closer to their fed funds target he said carmen reinicke tech leads s p 500 bounce tech stocks led a bounce

rates by 0 75 percentage point wednesday its third consecutive hike of that size to cool down high inflation the central bank also raised its terminal rate how far it expects to hike before pausing to 4 6 in 2023 by the end of the year it will get to 4 4 which means there s at least one more 0 75 percentage point hike coming that s more than some expected and potentially signals that the fed is willing to push the u s economy into a recession the extent of the aggressiveness that the fed is signaling did indeed surprise us said mark cabana head of u s short rates at bank of america this is very consistent with the recent shift in commentary from the fed and it certainly sounds like a fed that is absolutely okay risking recession bringing inflation lower with restrictive monetary policy

solution for ideological division revising the constitution collapse erin schaff the new york times ap file chief justice john roberts center shown with then members of the supreme court in october 2021 has pushed back against questions about the court s politicization in the wake of its decision to overturn roe v wade in june a constitution drafting project proposed limiting justices terms to 18 years and allowed for two supreme court appointments for every presidential term could constitutional rights be a contributing factor in america s ideological divisions that s the argument made by jamal greene author of how rights went wrong why our obsession with rights is tearing america apart courts have reduced complex discussions about rights into zero sum conflicts where a constitutional right overrides all other interests writes the columbia law school professor and former clerk for justice john paul stevens more recently he has been involved in the constitution drafting project organized by the national constitution center the venture grouped constitutional scholars into ideological teams and tasked them with drafting their ideal constitutions professor greene spoke with the monitor about the project as well as how america can move beyond the current climate of despair and divisiveness toward cooperation this interview has been edited for length and clarity could you explain what the constitution drafting project is and why you wanted to be a part of it so this is an initiative of the national constitution center in philadelphia that is trying to bring together people who come from different ideological orientations to see if they can come up with some sensible revisions to the constitution the way it was structured was to set up three teams each with a different ideological orientation a progressive team a libertarian team and a conservative team have them work independently to draft their own constitutions and then see where they agree and where they disagree that was kind of the first phase of the project and i don t know if this was intended from the start or whether it arose out of the first phase but the next phase was to have the teams get together and see if they can actually hammer out language in relation to the provisions or the potential amendments that they actually agree about so that s what we ve done there was a kind of mock constitutional convention in which we got together via zoom and tried to work out actual constitutional language that all three of these teams could actually agree on what have you learned throughout that process i think the biggest take home from the process is that quite a number of people across ideology actually can agree that there are aspects of the constitution that are in need of revision and about which revisions would be useful and helpful we actually agreed on five amendments some of which would be significant there was disagreement about the language and exactly around the margins and people had to make compromises but it was an object lesson in negotiation that people from different starting points can get together around something if they re willing to be open minded and engage with the arguments and objections made by others can you give more details on that what were you able to agree on one would remove the limitation on a president to be a natural born citizen everyone agreed that naturalized citizens should be able to be president at least if they have lived in the country for a certain length of time there was a second amendment relating to and this gets a little bit inside baseball but it s quite important what s called a legislative veto which enables the legislature to override an agency regulation without necessarily getting the approval of the president a third amendment had to do with impeachment we all agreed to lower the threshold for senate conviction but raise the threshold for house impeachment so that they would both be three fifths the current constitution the house can impeach with a simple majority and the senate requires two thirds to convict so we made both of those numbers three fifths jason berger courtesy of harper collins jamal greene is a professor at columbia law school and author of how rights went wrong he participated in the constitution drafting project which brought together scholars with different ideologies to propose revisions to the u s constitution professor greene says it was an object lesson in negotiation that people from different starting points can get together around something if they re willing to be open minded and engage with the arguments and objections made by others a fourth amendment basically imposes 18 year term limits on the supreme court and regularized appointment process so that there are two justices appointed for every presidential term and then a final amendment that would change article 5 itself and change the actual amendment procedure in the constitution right now it requires a two thirds vote of both houses and three quarters of the state legislatures we changed that to a three fifths vote in both houses and two thirds of the states and also an additional possibility of either two thirds of the states or states representing three quarters of the population why did you want to be part of this and devote time to this what do you think is the broader significance well i really do think that the constitution which is a very old document was written for a very different society than what we have today is in need of significant revision and i also think that if we are going to revise the document it needs to be in a way that takes into account the views and commitments of a broad range of people and it s also important to show that it s possible for people who have different views and attitudes and commitments to compromise to negotiate and not just yell at each other on social media or cable news i think this is a good kind of object lesson in how one can actually come to agreement on things that we all can believe in even if we start from different points the country could use more examples of people coming to engage in what i think of as genuine politics which are figuring out how to move forward even though you come from different starting places you talk about the current state of our politics is that related to our constitution and in particular how it s interpreted right now they are related in the sense that one of the basic premises of the book is that we are a very pluralistic diverse people and the only way for a pluralistic diverse people to move forward together as a single society is if they don t understand themselves to have absolute entitlements against each other that conflict with each other that they really do need to engage in political conversation i m trying to live that by getting together with people i disagree about lots of things that s no reason not to try to come together around the things that we can agree on and also again to compromise in reality our constitution is famously difficult to change you write about how the problem of the 21st century is the problem of the rights line can you give an example of rights conflicting and what that s meant for our politics and our country there are lots of examples of it abortion rights is a clear example where there are entrenched sides both of which understand themselves to be vindicating constitutional rights gun rights affirmative action also in a lot of ways take these forms lots of conflicts over freedom of speech between the freedom of the listener or the freedom of the speaker and we tend to view those conflicts as if the job of the legal decision maker is to choose one of those rights or the other when they come into conflict as opposed to trying to mediate between them and that s a big part of what the book is about is some strategies for mediating between rights as to how realistic the project is as an academic one engages in lots of projects that don t have an immediate payoff so in some ways this seems more realistic than some of the things that academics typically do but i m not so sure that there s no practical possibility it is incredibly difficult to amend the constitution but we also have a kind of despair about constitutional amendment as if there s just nothing we could possibly agree to and this project shows that that s not true there are things that people could possibly agree to and just developing some momentum toward that end i think is a productive thing to do what do you see as the stakes the momentum that we have right now that you re trying to change where do you see that heading why do you think we need a correction i think among the stakes is self government itself governing oneself according to a 200 plus year old document that we can t change means that we in fact are not governing ourselves and so invigorating the idea that we actually have some agency in trying to decide what constitutional rules apply to our society is as important as anything in constitutional law i m just one person but it seems to me that among the things that a single person can do to try to get at that problem showing that it actually can be done and then actually going out and doing it and trying to defend it is among the more productive things one can do in the face of very steep odds whether we think of the constitution as something that we have any power to change it is the very stakes of self governance and i take those very seriously
the headline was ardern hitches ride to new york with canadian prime minister what it should have read is ardern exposed as climate hypocrite she is in good company whether it s al gore harry and meghan or her fellow chardonnay socialist justin trudeau they are all the same they claim one thing do another trudeau took his own jet to the funeral despite the fact he was expressly asked not to ardern at least had the decency to make much of the fact that in london she didn t have a problem catching a bus to the abbey in fact she is probably running the same line for new york she probably thinks of the plane as a ride share after all it was going any way wasn t it the thing about the climate debate is it s run by the two faces on the one side you have the virtuous earnest preachers of all that is good for the climate on the other you have the dishonest they want to save the planet as long as it doesn t inconvenience them if you are a climate warrior which our prime minister purports to be you cannot afford to be found on private jets harry and meghan have become a laughing stock because of the hypocrisy ardern is now well on her way to achieving the same goal from a personal point of view none of this bothers me i m not against private jets they are more a symbol of pollution than they are a cause china is a polluter america is a polluter india is a polluter plenty of countries are polluters and i mean real polluters they outputs that are if you subscribe to all of this stuff actually doing damage in comparison whether trudeau gore ardern or harry ride a few planes isn t really the end of the world ironically if you want to go down that track flying first class is hypocritical if you really value the planet and pollution but that s the point isn t it you can t be or do both you can t lecture and preach and then do the opposite it can t be your nuclear moment until you jump onboard flight trudeau to new york and yet i wonder if those thoughts entered her mind as the champagne was served at 37 000 feet having skipped the queues and settled into the recliner listen above

that they really do need to engage in political conversation i m trying to live that by getting together with people i disagree about lots of things that s no reason not to try to come together around the things that we can agree on and also again to compromise in reality our constitution is famously difficult to change you write about how the problem of the 21st century is the problem of the rights line can you give an example of rights conflicting and what that s meant for our politics and our country there are lots of examples of it abortion rights is a clear example where there are entrenched sides both of which understand themselves to be vindicating constitutional rights gun rights affirmative action also in a lot of ways take these forms lots of conflicts over freedom of speech between the freedom of the listener or the freedom of the speaker and we tend to view those conflicts as if the job of the legal decision maker is to choose one of those rights or the other when they come into conflict as opposed to trying to mediate between them and that s a big part of what the book is about is some strategies for mediating between rights as to how realistic the project is as an academic one engages in lots of projects that don t have an immediate payoff so in some ways this seems more realistic than some of the things that academics typically do but i m not so sure that there s no practical possibility it is incredibly difficult to amend the constitution but we also have a kind of despair about constitutional amendment as if there s just nothing we could possibly agree to and this project shows that that s not true there are things that people could possibly agree to and just developing some momentum toward that end i think is a productive thing to do what do you see as the stakes the momentum that we have right now that you re trying to change where do you see that heading why do you think we need a correction i think among the stakes is self government itself governing oneself according to a 200 plus year old document that we can t change means that we in fact are not governing ourselves and so invigorating the idea that we actually have some agency in trying to decide what constitutional rules apply to our society is as important as anything in constitutional law i m just one person but it seems to me that among the things that a single person can do to try to get at that problem showing that it actually can be done and then actually going out and doing it and trying to defend it is among the more productive things one can do in the face of very steep odds whether we think of the constitution as something that we have any power to change it is the very stakes of self governance and i take those very seriously

bank of america corp bac financial is one of the most frequently traded bank stocks with average daily volume touching 40 million shares due to its popularity among investors the asset will likely trade near fair value as its liquidity dilutes price arbitrage in light of the rising economic turbulence and stock market volatility i have taken it upon myself to place a valuation on the stock and cover a few idiosyncratic features here is what i discovered valuation banking stocks tend to oscillate around their price book ratios as their businesses essentially function by trading quoted assets ideally a bank s price book ratio should sit below 1 for the security to be considered undervalued however according to gurufocus latest data bank of america is overvalued at a price book value of 1 14 taking it a step further i computed the justified price book ratio which is a company specific adjustment of the fair value threshold in other words bank of america s company specific value threshold is 1 13 instead of a theoretically generalized 1 however even from this vantage point the stock is priced in as its market derived price book ratio is within the same range if not marginally above source author s calculations lastly i computed the stock s justified price earnings ratio although this ratio is less relevant for banks it still bears substance as it assesses a stock s earnings capacity relative to its market traded price according to gurufocus data and my calculations bank of america s price earnings ratio exceeds its justified threshold therefore the stock is arguably overvalued operational review to eyeball the stock s future prospects observing the underlying company s operating results is necessary bank of america has been off the pace recently the bank missed its second quarter earnings target by 2 cents per share amid stumbling stock and bond markets the company s non interest income declined by 9 year over year due to adverse capital market activities and a downward reversion in investment banking activities however the bank s lending operations remained robust with a 22 year over year increase primarily due to rising interest rates and consumer loan demand persistence which is expected during late economic expansions having said that bank of america increased its provision for credit losses to 2 1 billion indicating it expects credit risk to exacerbate additionally the bank s cet1 ratio of 10 5 remains above the regulatory threshold but does not provide much of a margin of safety in a questionable economy dividends to assess bank of america s total return prospects it is necessary to evaluate the bank s dividend profile bank of america experienced rapid dividend growth over the past five years at a compound annual rate of 24 70 achieving a current dividend yield of approximately 2 40 are these dividends sustainable based on bank of america s dividend coverage ratio of 3 71 and cash from operations of 3 97 billion its dividend is as safe as houses however investors should account for macroeconomic headwinds that could dampen the bank s cash flows and in turn hinder dividend payouts to elaborate resilient inflation threatens bank of america s lending activities while a recession could squander service based banking activities and allocate more obstacles toward its capital markets division concluding thoughts bank of america is slightly overvalued amid elevated market based valuations and rising macroeconomic concerns investors could opt to stay invested in the stock for its highly lucrative dividend profile but systemic risk needs to be tracked closely
thank you adam i appreciate the opportunity to speak here today i last gave a talk at piie a couple of years ago while wearing my previous hat as an academic one great thing that you immediately notice about piie s experts and affiliates is that in addition to economic theory they care about the practical details institutional and otherwise that can constitute the difference between a successful or unsuccessful policy now as a policymaker at treasury i have a more visceral appreciation for this reality including when it comes to cross border lending and to cross border borrowing i thought therefore this would be a great place to discuss some practical ways to do both better developing and emerging markets were in a very difficult spot at the start of the year the covid 19 pandemic led to a 2 percent fall in their collective output in 2020 the first overall contraction in the post world war ii period governments appropriately borrowed and spent to weather the shock and fight back against the disease their debt levels jumped from 54 percent of gdp before covid to 64 percent by the end of last year and then at this time of great vulnerability russia unleashed its brutal and unjustified war against ukraine the war has caused food and energy prices to jump and accelerated inflation around the world as advanced economy central banks have raised rates cross border investment flows have retrenched net outflows across emerging markets in the first quarter of 2022 were the largest since the global financial crisis the dollar in real terms has appreciated to levels not seen for several decades together these ingredients all but assure debt distress in a number of countries we ve all seen the recent images of social unrest in sri lanka while the specter of a systemic sovereign debt crisis has not materialized the difficult global conditions are amplifying domestic vulnerabilities and economic stresses are appearing around the world more i fear may come in the short run turmoil following some episodes of distress we should be ready to quickly deliver assistance potentially taking steps such as repurposing existing international programs to fill urgent needs but what can be done to help after that and what can we do to reduce the likelihood of these events in the first place today i would like to discuss the logic behind working together to resolve unsustainable debts why multilateral restructuring has in practice become more difficult and how roadblocks in that process prevent countries from being able to take advantage of the international financial institutions that we ve all worked so hard to build i ll suggest some concrete steps that creditors borrowers and the global community can take stopping some practices and ramping up others to achieve better outcomes now and into the future 1 dealing with overhang let me start by noting that it s a good thing that developing countries and emerging markets can borrow from abroad and we should continue to pursue policies that allow them to do so these countries have less capital per worker than advanced economies and so have many investment opportunities offering high economic and social returns given their incomes will be higher in the future it makes good sense for them to finance these opportunities with foreign capital not to mention the additional benefits carried by cross border investment such as positive technology transfers these financial flows are also a good thing for the united states offering our citizens and companies a chance to diversify risks finance projects complementary to domestic production and more generally deepen cultural and commercial ties of course macro shocks and other unpredictable developments can stress the sustainability of this borrowing for many countries such stresses can be resolved by pursuing the appropriate reforms perhaps involving the international monetary fund imf or others without any need to restructure however for countries with debt loads that significantly exceed the value of what will likely be repaid a condition referred to as debt overhang we have a now standard playbook the first step is to reduce the country s external debts to make sure the borrower doesn t forgo useful projects after all with debt overhang and no debt restructuring some of the return to future investments will go toward repaying the existing creditors leading to underinvestment it is in the country s interests and also in the collective interest of the creditors to avoid this outcome given this alignment of interests won t the creditors on their own offer the efficient level of relief unfortunately no together the creditors would benefit from restoring sustainability and allowing the country to obtain new financing to pursue high return activities but individually each creditor would rather be repaid in full and let the others take losses further some creditors focused on their own interest may prefer deeper cuts to local spending than what a global social planner would suggest much of the international financial architecture developed over the past several decades aims to deal with these incentive and collective action problems the paris club for example was formed to coordinate debt restructuring among bilateral official creditors the london club was formed to similarly organize commercial bank creditors once a borrower makes a good faith effort to restructure its private debts and official bilateral creditors provide financing assurances promises that they ll sufficiently restructure what is owed to them we reach the second step an agreed imf program the imf then provides lending coupled with conditionality and expertise to help the country restore macroeconomic stability and catalyze fresh lending for high return investments and growth i do not mean to make it sound so easy nor to imply that these elements are sufficient for a good outcome it is only natural that there may be imperfections when countries work with the imf to design and implement programs and of course additional shocks and uncertainties often intervene but having this playbook in place and ready to deploy has been good for the world will this playbook work if we see a new wave of debt crises among developing and emerging market countries four major changes in the international lending landscape over the past decade have strained its efficacy first the debt burdens of developing and emerging market countries have risen considerably second use of non traditional arrangements including collateralized borrowing has proliferated third private sector creditors have grown in importance fourth while many official creditors have shifted their focus toward offering grants non traditional official creditors have increased their lending to developing and emerging markets in particular china has vastly expanded its portfolio of loans and trade credits and is now by far the largest bilateral official creditor in the world all these elements have introduced new complexities to the needed coordination among creditors in debt restructurings my remarks will focus on some steps that creditors borrowers and international financial institutions should take in response 2 recent complications in sovereign debt restructuring one important change in the creditor landscape stems from how china restructures its bilateral debts chinese policy and commercial banks typically rely on limited cash flow treatments and do not write down large losses researchers have found that the majority of chinese debt relief deals have come with significant delays and have not reduced the borrower country s nominal debt burden instead the deals involved lengthening maturities or grace periods and in fewer cases interest rate reduction or new financing only four cases since 2000 have reportedly involved haircuts on chinese official debt in some cases such as the republic of congo in 2018 debt restructurings have even increased the net present value of china s loans as a result the restructurings typically do not resolve the debt overhang and can stoke uncertainty about the need for repeated rescheduling does the approach of any one country in this process matter all that much in fact china s enormous scale as a lender means its participation is essential estimates of the total stock of outstanding chinese official loans range widely from roughly 500 billion to 1 trillion concentrated in low and middle income countries china became the world s largest official creditor in 2017 surpassing the claims of the world bank imf and all paris club official creditors combined a recent study estimates that as many as 44 countries now owe debt equivalent to more than 10 of their gdp to chinese lenders after factoring in both on and off balance sheet liabilities failure to act on these debts could imply years of ongoing difficulties with the servicing of debts and with underinvestment and lower growth in low and middle income countries in november 2020 the g20 established the common framework to bring china and other non paris club creditors into a multilateral effort to restructure the debts of low income countries on a case by case basis this helpful instance of global economic cooperation carried the hope that by bringing all creditors together the common framework would result in needed debt treatments in a timely and orderly manner however that ambition has not yet materialized there have been three common framework cases to date in the case of chad china delayed the formation of a creditor committee in the case of ethiopia china delayed the formation of a creditor committee until it was clear that the imf program would expire and discussions on a debt treatment would not take place because of the conflict china did join the creditor committee for zambia but only after six months of delays following the staff level agreement with the imf encouragingly china announced in late july that it and the other official bilateral creditors would provide zambia with debt treatments and the imf approved a three year lending program for zambia on august 31 but even if as i hope the situations ultimately improve in all three countries these delays carry suffering and uncertainty may discourage others from requesting needed treatments and preclude the best outcomes successful efforts under the common framework have alas been uncommon progress has also been slow on debt restructurings for middle income countries outside of the common framework furthermore china has engaged in unconventional practices that have allowed the imf to move forward in several recent cases without obtaining standard financing assurances for example in 2020 china agreed to 2 4 billion in new lending as a financing assurance for ecuador s imf program and to offset upcoming interest payments due to chinese creditors even as private creditors agreed to a 17 4 billion debt restructuring however rather than delivering the promised new financing in a matter of months china only came to terms with ecuador this past week in suriname china and india have so far failed to provide financing assurances that the imf considers specific and credible leading to the imf s reliance on an unusual application of its policy to move forward with a program in the case of argentina china is not restructuring debt service while paris club creditors are likely to do so and china has opted instead to promise net financing by offering new loans in many of these cases china is not the only creditor holding back quick and effective implementation of the typical playbook but across the international lending landscape china s lack of participation in coordinated debt relief is the most common and the most consequential 3 what can creditors including china do the immediate priority for creditors is to conclude the pending common framework cases as quickly as possible we are also open to expanding the common framework to middle income countries and should prioritize discussions of ideas including those offered by new creditors to boost the speed and predictability of the process creditors should also focus on making their lending more transparent since a lack of clear information on a borrower s indebtedness makes lending to them riskier ex ante and makes resolutions more difficult ex post g7 countries have largely met their commitment to publish their direct lending portfolios on a loan by loan basis and at the u s treasury we ve greatly improved our online foreign credit reporting system g20 creditors should also follow the norms for financing terms and contractual clauses they endorsed in 2018 a number of features common in china s lending reduce transparency or differ from international norms in ways that exacerbate the coordination problem in multilateral restructurings chinese loan contracts often contain non disclosure agreements as a result liabilities to china are systematically excluded from multilateral surveillance or restructuring efforts one study found that all contracts with chinese state owned entities after 2014 contain strong confidentiality clauses that prevent the borrower from disclosing any terms unless required to do so by law chinese loan contracts also commonly feature novel clauses that allow chinese lenders to cancel loans and demand immediate repayment in a wide variety of circumstances collateral is included in up to half of all chinese loan contracts and arrangements for repayment commonly involve escrow accounts all these elements limit a borrower s ability to engage in standard multilateral restructuring processes and incentivize the borrower to cut side deals on more generous terms with the chinese creditor in fact around three fourths of all chinese debt contracts contain clauses that expressly commit the borrower to exclude chinese debt from paris club restructurings or from any comparable debt treatment countries that seek a paris club debt restructuring find themselves either having to violate the terms of their borrowing from china or to violate the principle of comparability of treatment additional problems may stem from institutional fragmentation within china s internal lending bureaucracy in contrast to the typical practice among traditional official creditors debt distress appears to be managed by the specific chinese creditor rather than by the ministry of finance mof or an agency that is not the lender like the people s bank of china but chinese policy banks and state owned commercial banks do not report directly to the mof or to the pboc as a result the mof and pboc have often been unable to provide details on behalf of the creditor banks on a debt treatment for the purpose of providing financing assurances to the imf this institutional fragmentation can also keep china s lenders from coordinating on an assessment of borrowers debt sustainability prior to extending loans some of these institutional frictions may simply reflect the fact that china has grown so rapidly as a creditor and they are only natural given china is so new to the restructuring process that said there are many ways china could quickly reduce these frictions in addition to improving its own tracking and transparency of all its foreign lending china might consider implementing different financial structures such as the creation of a sovereign asset management entity or bad bank as a way to allow the various creditor agencies to isolate distressed loans specialized management expertise can then focus on restructuring while the development banks and other lending institutions are freed up to return to their normal focus with the right design features such a structure might restore incentives toward resolving rather than holding out on troubled debts a useful parallel may be made with reforms to the chinese bankruptcy system amidst large increases in corporate debt and bankruptcies china reformed its corporate bankruptcy code in 2007 and introduced specialized courts over the following decade research suggests these actions led to an increase in the scale and speed of resolutions and boosted productivity in china changes in institutional structure or legal and management practices related to the restructuring of china s external debts as part of the multilateral process would not only benefit low income borrowers around the world but could also benefit china itself private creditors could also do more to improve their own transparency the oecd launched the debt transparency initiative in 2021 to operationalize the voluntary principles for debt transparency that were helpfully put together by the institute for international finance iif but few have participated so far as with many of these suggestions by reducing risk information frictions and coordination problems such steps not only help borrowers but can also benefit the creditors themselves 4 what can borrowers do borrowers can of course take their own steps to maximize the likelihood that if they do end up in debt distress they can obtain relief and restore stability and growth including with an imf program the antidote to non disclosure by creditors is transparency by borrowers and a number of countries have made remarkable progress on this dimension benin strengthened its level of debt disclosure by creating a debt portal and extending the coverage of its debt statistics regular trainings and interactions with the world bank and imf have improved capacity along with prudent macro fiscal policies benin s reputation in markets strengthened sufficiently that it was able to issue international debt even in the middle of the pandemic burkina faso with the help of the bank and fund last year issued its first statistical debt bulletin that meets international best practices and includes detailed information on loan terms and conditions it includes government direct debt guarantees and public private partnership contracts madagascar in 2014 adopted a law on public debt and guarantees that introduces reporting requirements including to their parliament as the sovereign debt expert anna gelpern has suggested more countries should consider passing laws requiring their governments to in essence make their public debt public with a clearer picture of their own consolidated external liabilities borrowers could implement measures that minimize the likelihood of individual ministries or state owned enterprises from contracting unsustainable debts many low income countries already have legal provisions that require authorization of all public sector borrowing by the central government and more should consider doing so some including west african countries such as cote d ivoire and gambia have gone further by allowing their central government to impose debt limits on all public entities borrowers should also look around evaluate which types of arrangements produce positive long term outcomes and exercise caution when agreeing to unusual contract terms if a borrower country has an abundance of labor that is qualified to work on infrastructure is there a good reason to agree to only deploy foreign workers on financed projects requiring standard construction skills is there a good reason for payments to be made via an offshore escrow account that can be controlled by the creditor borrowers might further enhance their sharing of information and best practices with technical level regional dialogues and conferences including presentations by experts in procurement project audits and debt management for example the uruguay chamber of construction recently held such a conference promoting international best practices in public contracting that brought together experts from across the world to share their experiences government officials financial and legal experts and construction and infrastructure firms shared their perspectives on how at each stage of the procurement life cycle decisions should not entirely reflect price but also the quality and anticipated return of the projects and the social benefit brought to the local community 5 what should multilaterals and the rest of the world do we should continue to support initiatives that foster sustainable lending practices and transparency like the g20 s guidelines or the oecd s and iif s debt transparency initiative we should also continue to support initiatives that provide capacity building assistance to developing countries like the world bank debt management facility we should build on recent successes such as the adoption of enhanced collective action clauses in bond contracts to minimize coordination problems and reduce disruption from holdout creditors the g7 private sector working group pswg led by the u k is making helpful progress in developing templates for majority voting provisions that serve a similar purpose in non bonded debt we might also strive to create deeper markets for well designed state contingent securities which could reduce the need for debt restructurings in the first place borrowing countries should issue whatever securities are best suited to their needs but we should continue efforts to brainstorm create and stress test contract templates whether the ideas come from the private sector or from the official sector such as the climate resilient debt instruments currently worked on by the pswg we must minimize the chances that the imf provides financing that could ultimately be used to repay select creditors the imf s and wb s debt sustainability analyses dsa constitute the core of efforts to coordinate and overcome debt overhang modeling quantitatively the needed policies and potentially debt treatments the expanding set of creditors and complexity of lending approaches may have made it more difficult but the imf must remain vigilant so that restructurings both meet the terms of the dsas and are promised with financing assurances that hit the imf s standard of specific and credible especially for creditors without a robust track record of meeting this standard details about financing assurances their form scale provenance etc should be more transparently reported and tracked in staff reports all official bilateral creditors must be treated equally in these restructurings finally we should increase the scale of high quality development financing particularly through the multilateral development banks by stretching their existing resources and using them to mobilize private capital this would not only advance our development goals but has the added benefit of providing developing countries with a stronger set of alternatives when considering loans with potentially onerous terms 6 conclusion as i mentioned earlier official bilateral creditors led by china and france agreed in late july to offer debt treatment for zambia this is a great step but it is only the first step toward finalizing technical details and actually delivering the relief now that the imf program for zambia has been approved it is vital that creditors move expeditiously to hash out and then transparently meet the terms of the debt treatment and zambia is not the only pressing case sri lanka urgently needs a debt restructuring and unfortunately is not eligible for the common framework on september 1 sri lanka reached a staff level agreement with the imf on a robust set of policies to restore economic stability in order to bring this lending program forward creditors now need to step up to negotiate a debt treatment that is line with this economic program we are in new territory but the coming weeks offer a real opportunity for progress borrowers lenders and multilaterals all have a role to play swiftly concluding the first common framework case and making clear progress on multilateral restructuring outside of the framework would be a big win not only for current and future debtors and their citizens but also for all official creditors whether traditional ones or new ones we must build on recent experiences apply lessons learned and push ahead in these cases to prevent any depreciation of our global financial infrastructure see krugman paul financing vs forgiving

by alison kosik and kate trafecante cnn business the new york state comptroller said tuesday that several of new york city s fiscal challenges could result in a budget gap nearing 10 billion by 2026 potentially affecting essential services in the future total revenue is expected to decline by 10 5 billion in fiscal year 2023 according to a new report titled review of the financial plan of the city of new york the city s fiscal position significantly improved last year the report added but that was due to several one time factors including higher than expected tax revenue extraordinary federal covid relief aid and record pension returns due to the stock market s gains many of those factors have begun to reverse the comptroller said while the city s published gaps are manageable by historical standards these factors may create risks that worsen the city s budgetary volatility substantially and could put the city on a path to structural budgetary imbalance if left unaddressed the report said new york city mayor eric adams said during a press conference on monday that the city is getting ready to enter a financial typhoon if i don t make the smart decisions now am i going to wait until we re at the cliff or prevent the cliff adams said adams last week asked city agencies to reduce spending by 3 but to do so without cutting services however going forward further spending reductions while also prioritizing critical programs will be part of balancing the city s budget according to citizens budget commission a non partisan watchdog organization the magnitude of the potential gaps and specter of other more fluid risks means the city will have to continue to see an improvement in its economic recovery and associated revenues even as the rest of the country s growth slows to avoid a series of difficult decisions on revenue enhancements service adjustments and how to close its budget the report said the report does note a gap could impact the budget of city services including police the fire department sanitation and public transportation particularly the comptroller s office said that the metropolitan transportation authority or mta s uncertain finances combined with rising debt payments could force it to close future budget gaps through service cuts greater than planned fare hikes or delays to critical capital projects the mta also updated its financial plan in july which showed that fare revenue is expected to return slower than forecasted in its february plan the report also said that many new city services like the expansion of the city s pre k program for 3 year olds had been funded by federal assistance that is no longer available the city s economic troubles were initially driven by the pandemic but have now been exacerbated by the recent economic downturn along with lower tax revenues and the potential cost of labor contracts beyond the amount budgeted its pension funds also fell far short of their assumed rate of return in fiscal year 2022 increasing the burden on the city s contributions at the same time new york city is facing labor market challenges noting a slow recovery threatened further by a possible recession that is leading to record vacancies in commercial real estate adding to the budget shortfall that the city expects will peak in 2023 cnn s mark morales contributed to this report the cnn wire 2022 cable news network inc a warner bros discovery company all rights reserved

by huw jones london reuters halving settlement time for stock trades in europe to one business day would be challenging and needs full analysis by regulators before any decision is taken a markets industry body said on wednesday since 2014 banks and brokers have had two working days known as t 2 to settle the final leg of a trade where legal ownership of a stock is swapped for cash a move to t 1 would remove the only business day between trading and settlement creating significant pressure on post trade operations particularly for global participants the association for financial markets in europe afme said in a discussion paper pressure is building for such a move in europe after initiatives in the united states canada and india the u s securities and exchange commission has proposed rules to introduce t 1 from the end of march 2024 to cut exposures to credit market and liquidity risks and reduce the number and value of unsettled transactions at any given time it also reduces the amount of time brokers have to tie up capital and margin to cover unsettled trades saving them money authorities in britain and the european union mindful of keeping their capital markets globally competitive have already held informal discussions with industry on t 1 afme said adopting t 1 in the eu would be more complex given it has far more trading clearing and settlement operators than single jurisdictions like the united states switzerland and britain it called for a comprehensive analysis by regulators policymakers and industry to quantify the impact of moving to one day settlement while also keeping an eye on what s happening in switzerland and britain as well an important area for further discussion will be whether or not a synchronised implementation timeline is required across europe more broadly afme said some market participants are already planning instant settlement using blockchain the technology that underpins cryptoassets u s settlement house dtcc is piloting t 0 reporting by huw jones editing by mark potter

tesla chief executive elon musk blamed overreliance on factory robots for sending the electric carmaker to production hell four years ago saying humans were better at certain jobs now musk s texas company is floating ambitious plans to deploy thousands of humanoid robots known as tesla bot or optimus within its factories expanding eventually to millions around the world according to job postings buzz is building within the company as tesla is having more internal meetings on robots a person familiar with the matter said artificial intelligence powered by google helps french officials tax over 20 000 undeclared pools longer term musk said at a ted talk robots could be used in homes making dinner mowing the lawn and caring for the elderly people and even becoming a buddy or a catgirl sex partner the robot business eventually may be worth more than tesla s car revenue according to musk who is now touting a vision for the company that goes well beyond making self driving electric vehicles at its ai day on sept 30 tesla will unveil a prototype from its project optimus an allusion to the powerful and benevolent leader of the autobots in the transformers series production could start next year musk said tesla faces skepticism that it can show technological advances that would justify the expense of general purpose robots in factories homes and elsewhere according to robotics experts investors and analysts interviewed by reuters tesla already employs hundreds of robots designed for specific jobs for production of its cars humanoid robots have been in development for decades by honda motor co and hyundai motor co s boston dynamics unit like self driving cars the robots have trouble with unpredictable situations self driving cars weren t really proved to be as easy as anyone thought and it s the same way with humanoid robots to some extent the lead of nasa s dexterous robotics team shaun azimi told reuters russian chess robot breaks child s finger during moscow match if something unexpected happens being flexible and robust to those kinds of changes is very difficult at an autonomy event in 2019 musk promised 1 million robotaxis by 2020 but has yet to deliver such a car musk s robots may be able to demonstrate basic capabilities at the event but it would be hard for them to impress public expectations of robots that are as capable as humans experts say to succeed tesla will need to show robots doing multiple unscripted actions said nancy cooke a professor in human systems engineering at arizona state university such proof could provide a boost to tesla stock which is down 25 from its 2021 peak if he just gets the robot to walk around or he gets the robots to dance that s already been done that s not that impressive she said tesla did not respond to reuters request for comments but musk in the past proved skeptics wrong jump starting the electric car market and building a rocket company spacex although some product launches were behind schedule elon musk says tolkien is turning in his grave over amazon s rings of power in house expertise initially optimus will perform boring or dangerous jobs including moving parts around its factories according to musk musk acknowledged that humanoid robots do not have enough intelligence to navigate the real world without being explicitly instructed but he said tesla can leverage its expertise in ai and key components to develop and produce smart yet less expensive humanoid robots at scale he tweeted on monday that its autopilot team is also working on its optimus robot when asked about fixes of what it calls full self driving beta a test version of its new automated driving software tesla is on hiring spree for people to work on humanoid bi pedal robots with about 20 job postings on tesla bot including jobs for designing key robot parts like actuators the code you will write will at term run in millions of humanoid robots across the world and will therefore be held to high quality standards one of the job postings said tesla has over 2 million vehicles on the road jonathan hurst chief technology officer at agility robotics a humanoid robot firm founded in 2015 said the technology is right now starting to turn the corner certainly an important measure of success is do they make money from it he told reuters referring to tesla s humanoid robot efforts human help analysts see more pageant than product it s all part of distracting people and giving them the next shiny object to chase after guidehouse insights analyst sam abuelsamid said investors are not excited about optimus said gene munster managing partner at venture capital firm loup ventures which holds tesla stocks it s just such a low probability that it works at scale he said saying it is infinitely harder than self driving cars and then there is musk s own experience with robots in the factory during the 2018 production hell musk specifically noted the problems of the fluff bot an assembly robot that failed to perform simple tasks that human hands can do picking up pieces of fluff and placing them on batteries he said the cost of having technicians maintain the complicated robot far exceeded that of hiring someone to do the assembly the fluff bot is a funny example but drives home the point that autonomy often doesn t generalize well and so handling soft fluffy material that isn t as predictable as a rigid part was causing a huge problem aaron johnson a mechanical engineering professor at carnegie mellon university said human hands are way better at doing that musk said
article 3 months old australia sep 21 2022 with australians heavily exposed to variable rate mortgages the rba has to tread more carefully than the fed despite a still solid consumer outlook australian fixed mortgages low in number and short in duration compared to the us rba wary of putting more pressure on struggling households australian consumer still positive if they can afford it by greg peel with fed chair jerome powell laying down the law at august s jackson hole symposium wall street is expecting at least another 75 point rate hike tonight by contrast rba governor philip lowe suggested recently the case for a slower pace of increase in interest rates becomes stronger as the level of the cash rate rises a comment backed up in the minutes of the september policy meeting while this is fairly obvious the fact he said it suggested a slightly more dovish tone to the rba than the fed and on the day sent the local market surging those minutes released yesterday noted the rba did consider only a 25 point rate hike before settling on 50 yet the rba is forecasting the australian cpi to rise to 7 75 by year end from 6 1 in the june quarter while in the us the signs are inflation has peaked and should start to come down albeit slowly why then is the rba seemingly more dovish than the fed the difference lies in the impact of monetary policy on households in the two countries suggests jarden in the us the pass through of monetary policy to the real economy is primarily through financial conditions the stock market and corporate credit spreads jarden notes with the direct impact on households relatively limited in the us some 95 of mortgages are fixed for 15 30 years thus while borrowers may have looked aghast when the standard 30 year us mortgage rate recently rose above 6 the impact is only felt by those looking to buy a home or refinance their mortgage not on existing mortgages by contrast fixed rate mortgages in australia are typically only of 1 5 year in duration and the share of fixed mortgages as opposed to standard variable rate mortgages is typically around only 10 12 jarden currently estimates that number to be around a third given australian banks panicked during the pandemic and dropped their fixed rates on offer to below their svrs in order to grow their loan books to as low as less than 2 and drew a substantial refinancing push but still this means an estimated 80 are exposed to higher rates within a year hence the rba is wary of taking its cash rate too high jarden is estimating a terminal cash rate where the rba will stop of 3 1 rate currently 2 35 well above the rba s assumed neutral rate balance between stimulatory and restrictive of 2 5 restriction is required to bring inflation down however jarden estimates the neutral rate is currently 1 5 not 2 5 hence it is unlikely an rba rate above 3 can be maintained for too long jarden s economists thus expect 25 point rate hikes at the next three meetings although would not be surprised by another 50 pointer next month most economists expect 50 points next month but the september minutes have now led to some doubt stressful new research from roy morgan shows an estimated 854 000 australian mortgage holders 19 4 were at risk of mortgage stress in the three months to july 2022 this period encompassed the first three interest rate increases from the rba in may 25 points june 50 and july 50 with the cash rate hitting 1 35 mortgage holders are considered at risk if their mortgage repayments are greater than a certain percentage of household income depending on income and spending mortgage holders are considered extremely at risk if even the interest only is over a certain proportion of household income the good news is the proportion of mortgage holders considered at risk of mortgage stress in mid 2022 is well below the high reached during the gfc in early 2009 of 35 6 1 455 000 mortgage holders and below the average of the last decade of 20 8 904 000 there has been a similar trend for mortgage holders considered extremely at risk with only 12 7 or 542 000 in this group in the three months to july 2022 below the average of the last decade of 13 9 585 000 mortgage holders the bad news is the rba has since hiked rates by 50 points in each of august and september taking the cash rate to 2 35 if the rba increases interest rates by 50 points in each of the next two months roy morgan estimates this would mean 24 3 of mortgage holders 1 100 000 would then be classified as at risk an increase of 246 000 on july 2022 this would be the most mortgage holders classified as at risk since july 2013 that said goldman sachs notes elevated inflation has eroded real income growth across the globe and led to a drop in consumer confidence real spending growth meaning adjusted for inflation has slowed substantially in north america and europe but remains solid in japan and australia given later covid re openings and less elevated inflation on the positive side notes goldman tight labour markets mean unemployment rates remain very low across all developed economies and household balance sheets also remain strong given high levels of savings during lockdowns debt servicing ratios to income also remain low due to years of low interest rates comparing economies goldman sachs rates consumer health on a scale of 0 100 as 35 in the uk and europe 40 in the us 50 in canada and 60 in japan and australia but if the rba hikes a further 75 points to 3 10 svr mortgage rates rise in concert inflation rises to 7 75 noting the fuel excise holiday is set to end can australian consumer health continue to be above other economies particularly given the above the wealth gap the most asked question of ubs equity strategists this year has been for how much longer can the australian consumer keep spending after surveying 1000 australian consumers between august 15 and 29 ubs found consumers are still positive despite higher rates and cost of living through a period where the rba had enacted multiple interest rate hikes the survey s results showed spending is still expected to accelerate over the next 12 months but which consumers the survey pointed toward record levels of positive sentiment from high income earners greater than 120k who recorded a significant increase in their spending intentions they were also the group ubs notes that is now on the clearest upward trend in terms of income growth savings debt intentions home purchases home renovations travel and vehicle spending the story is not the same for low income earners less than 48k cost of living pressures are forcing consumers to spend more on essentials with food fuel utility and healthcare costs impacting most clearly this disproportionately hurts lower income earners whose daily needs spending represents a much higher ratio of the household budget by contrast the tight economy shines positively ubs suggests on higher income groups due to the wage gains they are experiencing and their ownership of capital property stocks etc given a high level of savings consumers still want to spend on post covid travel and 56 of those surveyed said they would draw down on savings to do so while falling house prices have dented the wealth effect which supports spending consumers continue to cite high levels of income stability and job security as the key positive supports behind their financial outlook ubs notes find out why fnarena subscribers like the service so much your feedback thank you warning this story contains unashamedly positive

it s a move that would likely cause panic on wall street but wells fargo securities michael schumacher suggests the federal reserve is raising rates too slowly telling cnbc s fast money he would seriously consider a 150 basis point hike this week if he were chair jerome powell the fed knows what the destination is so it s got the funds rate now the upper bound is 2 5 very likely it gets to 4 plus this year the firm s head of macro strategy said on tuesday why not just rip off the band aid let s get there in one day but of course the fed won t do that get dfw local news weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc dfw newsletters he acknowledges it would be a tough maneuver to pull off without violently shaking markets the key is policymakers need to convince investors the historical jump in rates is frontloaded according to schumacher it would do a huge move and then stop or stop pretty soon the big fear in the market would be oh my goodness they ve done a record sized move what s going to happen next month or the month after that we ve better get out of the way said schumacher it would require incredibly good communication and confidence or the result carnage and nobody wants that based on this month s cnbc fed survey the street believes the fed will lift rates by 75 basis points on wednesday it would be the fed s fifth hike this year schumacher believes the street has the september meeting rate forecast right but he warns it s likely powell will be more hawkish during wednesday s news conference due to hot inflation when you consider the last 10 plus years we ve had incredibly easy monetary policy for most of that time super stimulative fiscal policy in a lot of cases especially the u s so doing a very quick u turn i suspect it s going to be very rocky it has been rocky already noted schumacher to think that it would somehow go smoothly from here is probably a big leap the dow s p 500 and nasdaq on tuesday fell one percent and are down three out of the last four sessions since the july fed meeting the dow and nasdaq are off about 5 while the s p is down 4 and treasury yields are rapidly climbing the 2 year treasury note yield hit its highest level since 2007 it s a place schumacher is recommending to investors for relative safety look at the front end of the u s treasury curve you ve got the 2 year treasury yielding just about 4 it s gone up enormously schumacher said if you think about the real yield which a lot of people in the bond market focus on it s probably not a bad place to hide out take a short duration position sit there for a few months see what the federal reserve does and then react disclaimer
the managing director chief executive officer central securities clearing system plc jalo waziri haruna in this interview with kayode tokede speaks on how nigeria s central securities depository s iso 27001 2013 certification encapsulates its commitment to global best practice in data security cscs role in capital market development what has changed post covid 19 among other topical issues in the capital market what has been the role of the central securities clearing system cscs plc in capital market wealth creation and ensuring settlement of trades done across the capital market as central securities depository we provide depository clearing and settlement for all asset classes in the nigerian financial market our role provides assurance on safety of securities held by investors as well as settlement of secondary market transactions irrespective of the counterparty beyond this conventional role we provide ancillary services that create wealth for investors and participants in our network for instance our collateral management offering provides an opportunity for investors to create liquidity and derive extraneous value from their passive investments across all asset classes as regards your second part of the question which relates to our responsibility for ensuring settlement of trades done across the capital market i am pleased to say that we have 100 settlement success across all asset classes and exchanges as you may reckon that we are a multi asset csd including equities fixed income securities as well as commodities and we serve different exchanges including the nigerian exchange limited previously known as nigerian stock exchange nasd otc exchange lagos commodities and futures exchange fmdq exchange and nigerian commodity exchange interestingly throughout the pandemic we had zero settlement failure and our agility ensured a seamless transition to virtual remote operation you may recall that prior to our establishment settlement was done manually and flawed various issues including delays beyond the t 5 settlement window approved at the time it s exciting that not only have we worked with other stakeholders in the market to narrow the settlement window to t 3 we are also currently seeking opportunities to leverage advancements in the payment system and enhanced operational efficiency of our esteemed participants to further narrow the settlement gap as a way of creating more value for investors it s being an exciting journey leveraging new technologies investments in talents and working with different stakeholders in modernising hitherto traditional process in a way that creates sustainable value for all stakeholders and more importantly seeks new growth opportunities for the capital market ecosystem the world has changed dramatically on the heels of covid 19 pandemic what has changed in cscs strategy the pandemic redefined business processes and prospects but just as it caused varying disruptions it also exposed businesses into a new world of endless possibilities for us we stepped on those disruptive nodes to drive innovation and excellence and i am pleased that our diligent response eventually became levers for our earnings and broader corporate growth it would interest you to know that we at cscs were one of the first corporates in nigeria that activated business continuity protocols and switched to a fully remote digital service whilst we never anticipated the pandemic our robust business continuity plan and crisis management framework afforded us a swift transition without disruption it s quite interesting that the pandemic validated our decade long advisory to private and public institutions to deploy electronic document management systems edms it was a veritable tool for many of our clients during pandemic as it provided a foundation for switching to a remote work from home protocol today we are working with new clients across different sectors to digitize their electronic management systems to achieve full digitization of process and electronic archiving of operational and strategic records we live in fast paced world and with the experience of the pandemic every institution private or public needs to become agile and ready for service anywhere anytime the capital market authority in the united states working on the recommendations and advocacy of the clearing and settlement house is making arrangements to shorten capital market settlement cycle to t 1 what are your perspectives on the t 3 settlement in nigeria and what are your plans if any to enhance settlement of securities in nigerian capital market globally markets are evolving and nigeria would not be an exemption having transited from t 5 settlement window to t 3 in 2005 i believe nigerian market is mature for a shorter settlement cycle and cscs would be happy to collaborate with other stakeholders in making this transition whilst this would require change management across our esteemed participants i believe new technologies and enhancements in payment systems provide good foundation for shortening the settlement cycle albeit execution of such market wide initiative goes beyond the cscs it requires the conviction of all stakeholders and the oversight of our regulator the securities and exchange commission sec there are costs associated to such transition especially as regards change management but the benefits outweigh the cost beyond the time value of money consideration it is expected to improve market liquidity and mitigate settlement risks as the clearing and settlement institution for the capital we are ready for the switch capital market activities are slowing down what are the reasons for the waning liquidity in the market and how does cscs plan to change this narrative and more importantly as a company whose earnings is tied to capital market activities how do you intend to mitigate the risk on your company s earnings performance i believe there are some fundamental issues undermining liquidity in the nigerian capital market some are reflective of broad macro factors including monetary and fiscal policies whilst others are structural for instance there is need to further liberalise market access especially to attract the youthful population the current structure of the market was best fit for the past decades but perhaps not today it is exigent to further liberalize market access for all categories of investors to stimulate capital flows we need to remove frictions by leveraging technologies and centralised utilities this would not only help to unlock new capital flows from the youthful population but may also reduce service cost across the industry indeed it may help to reduce the growing unclaimed dividends which again is one of the disincentives for investors these initiatives would help to strengthen investor confidence especially as enhanced oversight of the securities and exchange commission should help in reinforcing market integrity as a financial market infrastructure our earnings performance is vulnerable to the volatilities of the capital market and more importantly the liquidity of the market hence we are at the forefront of executing new initiatives that can potentially stimulate market liquidity we are collaborating and investing in ideas that are requisite for sustainably growing the capital market by deepening penetration and introducing new offerings that meet changing investor preferences in addition we are increasing our offerings to cover more value adding services for different stakeholders it s about value creation for the ecosystem and it s more towards mining latent opportunities in the capital market and unlocking value from idle capital and assets that being said we are also diversifying the business as we expand the scope of our ancillary services this would further serve as an immunity against the impact of market volatilities on our earnings profile the cscs has had 25years of meritorious service to the market what do you think the future holds for cscs it has been an exciting and rewarding journey working with different stakeholders to make transformational changes in the market however we still have a long way to go especially as investors preferences and technology disruptions are shifting the boundaries of markets and redefining asset classes like other csds globally we see increasing responsibility for us in strengthening and sustaining market integrity and investor confidence whilst nigerian market may be unduly fragmented we expect steady consolidation especially in leveraging centralized processes which have proven to be cost effective in peer markets so we are investing in technology people and infrastructure to take on more responsibilities and fulfill our strategic objective of being the lever for market penetration and growth so the future looks brighter than the past as we invest resources in process optimization strategic partnership and product innovation all geared towards creating value and enhancing investor experience cscs performs the functions of depository clearing and settlement of all transactions in the nigerian capital market how well are you leveraging new technologies and how do you manage the global rise in cyber attacks we are partly seen as a technology company because our operations are mainly digital which reinforces the big investments we make in technology more importantly we reckon our central role in upholding the integrity of the market especially as regards the safe depository of assets and the security of investor information thus information security is at the heart of our strategy and operations from design of technology architecture to application and system controls we make notable investments in cybersecurity and broader information security technologies more importantly we invest in people and process controls which are crucial to the different lines of defense we are iso 27001 2013 certified a reflection of our commitment and compliance to global best practice in data security and indeed we also play active role in sensitizing our ecosystem and the broader financial market on cyberattacks through our annual conference dedicated to cybersecurity this year s edition of our annual cybersecurity conference themed future of cybersecurity emerging issues and solutions would be held at the transcorp hilton hotels in abuja on 27 october 2022 with the collaboration of renowned private and public sector institutions this is one of the ways we have been creating awareness and facilitating knowledge exchange as well as global best practices and innovation in cybersecurity especially in the past five years broadly how accessible is our capital market to both local and foreign investors how easy is it to buy and sell stocks within a short period of time given the improving technologies in recent times different stakeholders have made tremendous efforts and leveraged technology in enhancing market access but i must say there is still a lot to be done to liberalise the market and this is perhaps the stage at which it may be useful to centralise the initiative for better efficiency both in terms of impact on the market and cost we need to improve investor accessibility to both the primary and secondary markets whilst enhancing secondary market structures and driving liquidity helps to deepen and enhance valuation prospect in the primary market there is also the need to revisit the structure of the primary market with the ultimate objective of liberalising market access for greater efficiency technology can play a greater role and the mtn electronic ipo is a good start and validation of the potential of technology in breaking barriers to market access so it s important to reform the structure of the market with focus on both equity and fixed income offerings another important aspect is the time to market in today s world both the issuer and investors are keen on time value of money and not only are they keen at raising capital or investing their funds timely both sides of the table want to get value asap so intermediaries in the form of market participants and regulation should not be hinderance to achieving this objective depending on intermediaries and also sometimes the capacity of issuers primary market equity transactions can take six months or more that s too long for a company that is trying to explore an opportunity set which would never wait sadly some companies may lose the opportunity before the capital is raised or inflation and or exchange rate volatility may have distorted the dynamics of the target investment so delay in the process of capital raising may render the money useless or at least less useful so there is a need to engage different stakeholders to streamline processes and ensure a more efficient end to end standard is adopted the quicker it is for investors

amd nasdaq amd stock has declined for the past year on fears that the semiconductor market is heading for a glut mainly as fears of a global slowdown weigh on sentiment after this years of shortages in addition to the potential glut that is expected to come in 2023 amd is now witnessing the price fall for some of its chips while the fall in price is currently primarily segregated to the secondary market the price decline is now starting to affect the primary sales as well get the full henry singleton series in pdf get the entire 4 part series on henry singleton in pdf save it to your desktop read it on your tablet or email to your colleagues q2 2022 hedge fund letters conferences and more analysts are currently torn between whether there will be a chip shortage or a glut going into 2023 and the mixed news is clearly leading to a negative outlook amd isn t the only semiconductor company facing headwinds other competitors such as nvidia nasdaq nvda have also witnessed their stock retreat amd has been continuing to perform well and with the zen4 architecture and xilinx chips and when combined with the demand for the older chips the stock may be oversold some of that is due to demand for electronics and demand has slowed down for them when compared to previous years but the supply of semiconductors remains a problem with demand from autos and network based demand keeping supply in check prices also remain higher than in the past few years although they have come down in recent times even if only slightly and the high prices are leading to generous margins for chip makers while electronics are showing signs of a slowdown the auto market has been quickly recovering and more and more large companies such as amazon continue to invest in backend infrastructure in anticipation of long term demand although the pace of investment has slowed down in recent times the demand for data center chips has helped balance out the weakness in other areas and amd has increasingly started to bet on data centers in order to continue its pace growth with amd s pesando deal re iterating the strategy of concentrating resources on data centers which is clearly paying off ceo amd this is all for us doubling down on the data center of course we love our traditional pc and gaming markets but the data center is the most strategic area for future growth supply chains exacerbate shortages new supply is expected to slowly come through in 2023 and 2024 which may finally ease up the current shortages as plants across the united states and asia japan open up but issues that continue to hamper supply in the short term as material shortages stemming from supply chain disruptions in china and water shortages continue to affect the market the zen 4 chips will be built on the 5 nanometer processor and are expected to be up to 29 30 faster than the previous zen 3 chips the release of the chips will be quickly followed by the next generation of zen 5 chips which will be released somewhere in 2024 the continued rollouts mean that the product cycle is likely to continue to see demand thereby ensuring that revenue growth remains within the expectations of the market fundamental and technical analysis looking at the fundamentals the current forward price to earnings stands at a relatively moderate level trading at 30x meanwhile analysts are currently forecasting a forward p e of 17 18x all things considered the current valuations are quite cheap semiconductor stocks tend to be quite volatile mainly due to the news cycle that surrounds them therefore the risk of supply chain constraints and the constant push and pull between shortage and glut keep the stock trading at valuations that are lower than they should be meanwhile the technicals also remain slightly bearish with the put call ratio at 82 and the current rsi is at 35 indicating the stock is oversold investors and traders are clearly on the back foot as the increasingly dovish monetary policy is weighing on sentiment to some extent amd s rally was previously driven by liquidity and speculation but the current environment doesn t justify the oversold conditions especially considering the long term fundamentals remain intact amd has risks and the global economy slowing down leading to a cyclical downturn combined with excess investment leading to a chips glut remain the biggest ones but the stock clearly has a lot of upsides as well amd was previously riding the wave of low discount rates and that has partially weighed on valuation but that isn t enough to justify current price levels according to the most recent quarter s results the long term fundamentals of the company remain intact which could be a good opportunity for long terms investors to get into the stock should you

a colorado man needed to repair his damaged screen door so he went on amazon to order fiberglass screen mesh when the package arrived don thompson was shocked to discover a 20 gauge shotgun inside the box the 78 year old thompson said he orders things from amazon all the time usually getting four of five packages delivered every day but this was the biggest shipping mistake he has ever encountered i was totally dumbfounded it s terrifying absolutely terrifying to me thompson told kcnc thompson reached out to the jefferson county sheriff s office which dispatched an officer to retrieve the gun a preliminary investigation revealed the shotgun had been reported stolen it does appear that it was stolen but we ve barely begun our investigation and there is apparently a lot to unravel said jenny fulton with the jefferson county sheriff s office it is unclear how the mix up happened because amazon does not stock or sell firearms the news station confirmed that the tracking number thompson received for the screen mesh was the same as the number on the box with the shotgun the label also showed that the package which was shipped by the united states postal service came from a fulfillment center in illinois amazon said it is investigating the incident and has refunded thompson for the cost of the screen mesh and credited his account with an additional 250 i m terribly sorry to hear we ve shipped you a firearm instead of the screen you purchased this certainly isn t what we want our customers to expect and i can assure you the firearm was shipped unintentionally an amazon representative wrote in an email to thompson we re conducting an internal investigation of the errors leading to this shipping out from our fulfillment center to ensure this doesn t happen to any other customers

it s a move that would likely cause panic on wall street but wells fargo securities michael schumacher suggests the federal reserve is raising rates too slowly telling cnbc s fast money he would seriously consider a 150 basis point hike this week if he were chair jerome powell the fed knows what the destination is so it s got the funds rate now the upper bound is 2 5 very likely it gets to 4 plus this year the firm s head of macro strategy said on tuesday why not just rip off the band aid let s get there in one day but of course the fed won t do that feeling out of the loop we ll catch you up on the chicago news you need to know sign up for the weekly chicago catch up newsletter here he acknowledges it would be a tough maneuver to pull off without violently shaking markets the key is policymakers need to convince investors the historical jump in rates is frontloaded according to schumacher it would do a huge move and then stop or stop pretty soon the big fear in the market would be oh my goodness they ve done a record sized move what s going to happen next month or the month after that we ve better get out of the way said schumacher it would require incredibly good communication and confidence or the result carnage and nobody wants that based on this month s cnbc fed survey the street believes the fed will lift rates by 75 basis points on wednesday it would be the fed s fifth hike this year schumacher believes the street has the september meeting rate forecast right but he warns it s likely powell will be more hawkish during wednesday s news conference due to hot inflation when you consider the last 10 plus years we ve had incredibly easy monetary policy for most of that time super stimulative fiscal policy in a lot of cases especially the u s so doing a very quick u turn i suspect it s going to be very rocky it has been rocky already noted schumacher to think that it would somehow go smoothly from here is probably a big leap the dow s p 500 and nasdaq on tuesday fell one percent and are down three out of the last four sessions since the july fed meeting the dow and nasdaq are off about 5 while the s p is down 4 and treasury yields are rapidly climbing the 2 year treasury note yield hit its highest level since 2007 it s a place schumacher is recommending to investors for relative safety look at the front end of the u s treasury curve you ve got the 2 year treasury yielding just about 4 it s gone up enormously schumacher said if you think about the real yield which a lot of people in the bond market focus on it s probably not a bad place to hide out take a short duration position sit there for a few months see what the federal reserve does and then react disclaimer
president joe biden said this week that the covid 19 pandemic is over but boston doctors and massachusetts public health data say otherwise biden s statement aired in an interview sunday on 60 minutes sparking a national debate among politicians and health experts boston doctors argue that the covid 19 pandemic is still very much active based on the definition of the word and massachusetts covid data and emphasized that the government still has an important role to play in addressing it i don t take my public health guidance and facts from politicians so you know i actually didn t put much stock into that statement tufts medical center s dr shira doron said but of course it made me think about the question that i ve thought about many times throughout the last six months which is how do we know when do we decide that that pandemic is over the definition of pandemic doron said citing the dictionary written by epidemiologists is an epidemic occurring worldwide or over a very wide area crossing international borders and usually affecting a large number of people an epidemic is more local a widespread occurrence of an infectious disease in a community at a particular time get new england news weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for necn newsletters as we head into fall there are concerns that covid cases might rise again according to those very classic definitions we are still in a pandemic and will be for a very very long time doron said she called it a matter of semantics health care is going to have to be dealing with covid 19 for a very long time public health officials are going to be dealing with it for a very long time we re going to have expectations that our government fund our interventions and support our interventions with resources for a very long time from those standpoints you know it s not over and it won t be over for years or decades even i don t take my public health guidance and facts from politicians dr shira doron tufts medical center hospital epidemiologist brigham and women s chief of infectious diseases dr daniel kuritzkes echoed doron adding that the definitions of epidemic pandemic and endemic are clearly very blurry since case numbers across the u s are somewhat constant kuritzkes argued that covid 19 is at least in an endemic phase but that doesn t mean the virus has gone away i think this is largely a semantic argument or debate that has only some practical significance kuritzkes said i think the biggest practical issue and where i think the president may have inadvertently caused himself unnecessary trouble is that what we do desperately still need is emergency funding from congress to be able to continue to pay for testing vaccination and treatment covid cases massachusetts the massachusetts department of public health s covid 19 dashboard shows that cases and hospitalizations have hit a plateau since coming down from the omicron surge in february then another peak in may the doctors said now we re just hovering at this high plateau that is just so annoying to be honest doron said and the wastewater which is a more accurate measure of what is going on with the virus because cases by and large are not getting reported to the state is also just stuck just really stuck at a high level so there s a lot of covid out there there s definitely a lot of covid massachusetts health officials reported 7 936 new covid 19 cases and 37 new deaths in the last week according to the most recent data in total there have been 1 860 512 cases and 20 206 deaths since the start of the coronavirus pandemic there s been a steady stream of covid 19 cases at brigham and women s hospital as well according to kuritzkes with between 20 and 30 people on the regular medical floors and between two and six people in the icu every day since may i don t think i ve really seen any significant change since may kuritzkes said now in some respects that s kind of interesting in and of itself obviously things are not going down and that s what we would like to see if we re stuck at a level much higher than where we were june 2021 but it s also becoming more and more interesting now that we re at the end of september that it s been what five months since we ve had a new variant maybe you need to knock on wood or something

by huw jones london reuters halving settlement time for stock trades in europe to one business day would be challenging and needs full analysis by regulators before any decision is taken a markets industry body said on wednesday since 2014 banks and brokers have had two working days known as t 2 to settle the final leg of a trade where legal ownership of a stock is swapped for cash a move to t 1 would remove the only business day between trading and settlement creating significant pressure on post trade operations particularly for global participants the association for financial markets in europe afme said in a discussion paper pressure is building for such a move in europe after initiatives in the united states canada and india the u s securities and exchange commission has proposed rules to introduce t 1 from the end of march 2024 to cut exposures to credit market and liquidity risks and reduce the number and value of unsettled transactions at any given time it also reduces the amount of time brokers have to tie up capital and margin to cover unsettled trades saving them money authorities in britain and the european union mindful of keeping their capital markets globally competitive have already held informal discussions with industry on t 1 afme said adopting t 1 in the eu would be more complex given it has far more trading clearing and settlement operators than single jurisdictions like the united states switzerland and britain it called for a comprehensive analysis by regulators policymakers and industry to quantify the impact of moving to one day settlement while also keeping an eye on what s happening in switzerland and britain as well an important area for further discussion will be whether or not a synchronised implementation timeline is required across europe more broadly afme said some market participants are already planning instant settlement using blockchain the technology that underpins cryptoassets u s settlement house dtcc is piloting t 0 reporting by huw jones editing by mark potter

this is the introduction to volume 1 of covid capitalism and class war a social and political chronology of the pandemic this volume is available to purchase as an e pub or printed book at mehring books this book compiled from the world socialist web site s coverage of the covid 19 pandemic as it spread across the globe is a social and political chronology of a historically critical event whose impact on the twenty first century will prove to be as profound as that of world war i on the twentieth century the comparison of the pandemic to the first world war is justified not only on the basis of the scale of human losses in a manner no less profound than the cataclysm that erupted in the summer of 1914 the outbreak of the pandemic in the opening months of 2020 triggered a world crisis that exposed the political social and moral bankruptcy of capitalist society confronted with a public health emergency of unprecedented magnitude virtually every government in the world refused to implement policies that were required to prevent mass infection debilitating illness and death economic interests specifically those of the financial and corporate elite determined the response to the pandemic saving profits was prioritized over saving lives humanity is grappling with the consequences of the socially criminal response of governments to the pandemic despite vast advances in mankind s scientific understanding and technology over the past century sars cov 2 the virus that causes covid 19 has proven to be the most devastating infectious disease since the 1918 influenza pandemic which killed between twenty five and fifty million people in the span of just two years government policies have been characterized by a staggering indifference to human life in october 2020 the former british prime minister boris johnson blurted out no more f ing lockdowns let the bodies pile high in their thousands more recently us president joseph biden declared in a television interview that the pandemic was over on september 18 2022 the day his statement was broadcast to a nationwide audience there were according to the new york times 61 712 official new infections and 464 deaths from covid 19 in the united states since the start of the pandemic over six hundred million people have officially tested positive for covid 19 and over 6 5 million have died from the disease worldwide both of which are known to be significant undercounts studies indicate that well over half the world s population has already been infected with sars cov 2 while estimates of excess deaths attributable to the pandemic place the real global death toll at over twenty million people worldwide hundreds of millions more have been impacted by long covid a myriad range of symptoms that can affect nearly every organ in the body for unknown duration of this large portion of humanity suffering lingering symptoms from their infection tens of millions have been disabled by the virus unable to work and often largely confined to their homes for the first time since world war ii global life expectancy declined by nearly two years in 2020 and 2021 national declines in the first two years of the pandemic were highest in five countries in latin america peru 5 6 years guatemala 4 8 paraguay 4 7 bolivia 4 1 and mexico 4 0 and three in europe including russia 4 3 bulgaria 4 1 and north macedonia 4 1 in the united states the wealthiest and most powerful country in the world life expectancy dropped by nearly three years during this time experts anticipate massive long term health ramifications from the pandemic as covid 19 infection substantially increases one s risk of heart attack stroke dementia kidney disease and more as we approach the beginning of the fourth year of the pandemic it continues to exact a horrific toll each day as nearly every world government outside china has abandoned all mitigation measures to slow the spread of the virus and has instead adopted a policy of forever covid provided with billions of hosts the coronavirus continues to evolve into new variants threatening to further erode the efficacy of existing vaccines and treatments and cause recurring waves of mass infection debilitation and death past struggles against polio malaria measles smallpox and other infectious diseases have been justly celebrated as milestones in the progressive impact of science on civilization there will be no celebration of the official response to covid 19 its history will be a record of lies and crimes by governments the corporate media and official institutions that have subordinated the health of society to the profit interests of a tiny corporate financial oligarchy in the coming years historians of the covid 19 pandemic will subject to scathing criticism the lack of preparation despite numerous advance warnings they will expose the social and economic interests that determined policy and explain why governmental institutions were compromised to the point that they completely abandoned public health the historians will examine how the fascistic herd immunity policy was developed and the role of the media and trade unions in enforcing this policy they will also call attention to the global fight by workers and scientists to stop the pandemic in probing these topics this book and the archives of the world socialist web site will be recognized as an indispensable and authoritative guide which provided the most incisive contemporary analysis of the pandemic the analyses of events as they were unfolding were extraordinarily prescient the great advantage of the editors and writers of the world socialist web site published by the international committee of the fourth international was that they were guided by a perspective deeply informed by history and a marxist trotskyist understanding of the conflict between private economic interests and the welfare of the public in modern capitalist society on this foundation the wsws identified the pandemic not simply as a medical event or a biological phenomenon but primarily as a social and political crisis of global dimensions this is the first of three volumes that cover the years 2020 2021 and 2022 each volume provides an annual chronology charting both the objective development of the pandemic and the perspective elaborated by the wsws a major challenge the editors faced in compiling these volumes was the matter of selection since january 2020 the wsws has published over 5 500 articles on the pandemic with the articles selected for these volumes representing less than 10 percent of this total emphasis was placed on the most critical statements which elucidate key turning points in the pandemic and explain their social and political significance in introducing this book it is necessary to review some of these key developments and how the pandemic has unfolded 2020 initial outbreak and the two dominant strategies towards the pandemic elimination and herd immunity in the decades preceding the spillover of sars cov 2 at a wet market in wuhan china there was a series of global outbreaks of new infectious diseases including the sars outbreak 2002 2004 the h5n1 bird flu epidemic 2003 the h1n1 swine flu pandemic 2009 the mers outbreak 2012 the ebola virus epidemic 2014 2016 the zika outbreak 2015 2016 and more scientists who continuously warned of the dangers of a devastating pandemic were treated as cassandras and nothing was done instead scientific research and pandemic preparedness were severely underfunded based on the lie that there was no money even while global stock markets soared and military budgets ballooned the well known factors that would lead to new spillover events climate change unplanned urbanization and ecological destruction were allowed to worsen year after year when the outbreak of sars cov 2 began in late 2019 world capitalism was completely unprepared in the opening months of 2020 all of the key issues and basic problems that have defined the pandemic were first raised the two fundamental strategies that have since dominated governments responses to the pandemic elimination and herd immunity emerged during this time the central problem involved in public health and the control of infectious diseases i e stopping viral transmission was dealt with in two diametrically opposed manners within china after initially bungling the response and faced with growing opposition within the working class the chinese communist party ccp implemented the first successful elimination program to contain the coronavirus it utilized every public health measure at its disposal including mass testing rigorous contact tracing the safe isolation of infected patients and quarantining of exposed people all of which had been developed by mankind over centuries it also initiated the first mass lockdowns in history in hubei province on january 23 2020 after seventy six days filled with enormous stress and self sacrifice among workers doctors and scientists chinese society had stamped out viral transmission in the most populous country on earth protecting 1 4 billion people from sars cov 2 this became the model followed by new zealand vietnam and other countries in the region and internationally many of which maintained elimination for over a year until finally succumbing to the pressures of global finance capital the total death toll from covid 19 in china since april 17 2020 just after the end of the wuhan lockdown now stands at just 594 by far the lowest death toll of any major country in the world and just 0 013 percent of the per capita death toll in the united states during the same time nearly all of these deaths in china took place from april to may 2022 the result of a major outbreak of the omicron ba 2 subvariant in shanghai that was again successfully suppressed outside of china a very different response unfolded in early 2020 nearly every other government viewed the coronavirus not through the prism of science and public health but that of global finance and corporate profits as is always the case this took the crassest form in the united states where president donald trump encouraged americans to inject themselves with disinfectant and ultraviolet light to supposedly ward off infection on february 7 2020 chinese president xi jinping personally informed trump and presumably many other world leaders that sars cov 2 is airborne and has a much higher fatality rate than the flu concealing these truths trump whipped up anti chinese xenophobia by branding sars cov 2 the china virus in january 2020 his fascist adviser steve bannon first promulgated the wuhan lab lie which was later promoted by the corporate media and utilized by governments to deflect blame onto china for their own disastrous mishandling of the pandemic covid 19 patients are treated inside a non invasive ventilation system at the municipal field hospital gilberto novaes in manaus brazil on may 18 2020 as the virus spread a veil of silence was imposed by the corporate media and political establishment through the end of february 2020 covering up the growing dangers facing society in march 2020 as hospitals and morgues filled up throughout the world and workers mounted wildcat strikes to halt production governments were forced to belatedly implement partial lockdowns causing a plunge in global stock markets by the end of march the cares act and other financial bailouts were crafted and rapidly approved internationally funneling trillions of dollars into the financial markets the aim was to provide immediate resources to restore the stock market once this objective had been achieved the fight to stop viral transmission was subordinated to a ruthless back to work drive the new mantra for the back to work campaign coined by new york times columnist thomas friedman and immediately picked up by trump was that the cure cannot be worse than the disease in essence this phrase expressed the class interests of the financial oligarchy which after less than two weeks would no longer tolerate lockdowns or other essential public health measures that slowed viral transmission but deprived the corporations of the workforce they required for the exploitation of labor and the generation of profits in promoting the reopening of businesses before the virus was contained trump friedman and the times hailed the swedish government s refusal to implement lockdowns based on the distortion of the scientific concept of herd immunity while historically this term had always referred to the level of vaccine induced population immunity necessary to stop the spread of a given disease beginning in march 2020 sweden s chief epidemiologist anders tegnell encouraged the deliberate infection of the majority of the population to create a mythical herd immunity while supposedly shielding the elderly and infirm tegnell and his adviser johan giesecke exported this pseudoscience globally and it became codified in the infamous great barrington declaration which the wsws characterized as a manifesto of death over the course of 2020 the official covid 19 death toll in sweden reached 9 706 a per capita rate over ten times higher than neighboring norway and among the highest in the world from march 2020 on sweden s homicidal herd immunity strategy was adopted by the united states the united kingdom brazil india and other countries based on eugenicist conceptions akin to survival of the fittest throughout the world numerous scientists opposed these policies and advocated for measures necessary to stop the pandemic since april 2020 aerosol scientists in particular have waged a heroic struggle urging governments to publicize the fact that sars cov 2 is an airborne virus that can be dramatically curtailed through the use of high quality masks and improved ventilation yet to this day nearly every government and even the world health organization who have refused to educate society on airborne transmission keeping the global population largely ignorant of this most essential feature of the virus and how it spreads the public health methods used in china new zealand and other countries were never seriously adopted throughout much of the world each of these techniques which mankind has accumulated through centuries of struggle against past plagues and which could be deployed in a highly advanced manner using modern technology were instead withheld from the beginning what transformed the pandemic into a catastrophe was that the resources of governments were mobilized not to stop viral transmission but to limit and even sabotage such a necessary response the concluding months of 2020 saw the approval of anti covid vaccines and the escalation of the herd immunity policy in what the wsws termed a winter of death in the final three months of the year nearly 850 000 people officially died from covid 19 worldwide while estimates of excess deaths place the real total at roughly 2 5 million 2021 the roll out of vaccines the mitigationist strategy and viral evolution as the pandemic entered its second year new problems emerged the rollout of life saving vaccines was done in a haphazard manner subordinated to corporate profits producing vast inequities in global vaccination rates between wealthy and poorer countries furthermore the mass vaccination efforts not only encountered a vile anti scientific campaign of misinformation which stymied uptake in many countries but also produced a more subtle problem the vaccines were increasingly seen by governments not as an auxiliary but as a substitute that rendered unnecessary a comprehensive public health program this became the basis for a third mitigationist strategy towards the pandemic which encouraged vaccinations alongside an amorphous mixture of other public health measures while accepting that a certain unspecified level of viral transmission would remain mitigation amounted to an attempt to negotiate with the virus while ignoring the objective laws of viral evolution ostensibly liberal governments cultivated illusions that the vaccines would serve as magic bullets and provide lasting protection against infection thinking pragmatically that they could now proceed as if everything was fine most notoriously on may 13 2021 us centers for disease control and prevention cdc director dr rochelle walensky told vaccinated americans that they could take off their masks this led to the wholesale scrapping of mask mandates across the us which never returned to the same levels as before a process replicated by many other governments two months later on july 4 2021 us president joe biden absurdly declared independence from covid 19 just weeks before the more infectious and virulent delta variant ripped through the country and killed over 200 000 americans during this time the delta variant was spreading rapidly in india and soon worldwide from late march to mid may 2021 over two million people were killed in india alone as the fascistic bharatiya janata party bjp government headed by narendra modi enforced the herd immunity policy of mass death this remains the worst surge to have happened anywhere in the world during the pandemic scientists warned that new variants such as delta could cause breakthrough infections among vaccinated people and that vaccines alone would not stop viral transmission but these warnings were once again ignored family members pray next to the burning pyre of a person who died of covid 19 at a crematorium in srinagar india may 25 2021 the mitigationist strategy was expressed most sharply in the full reopening of schools which by early 2021 had been definitively proven to be centers of viral transmission extraordinary claims were made that if schools required masks opened windows improved ventilation or some combination thereof they would be safe havens from infection in reality reopening schools before the pandemic was contained proved disastrous throughout the world including in districts with more stringent mitigation measures with thousands of children and an untold number of educators killed by covid 19 internationally over the past two years over the course of 2021 the wsws intensified its fight for a scientific strategy to eliminate sars cov 2 globally on august 20 2021 it published a major statement which provided a clear political assessment of the mitigationist strategy stressing mitigation is to epidemiology what reformism is to capitalist politics just as the reformist harbors the hope that gradual and piecemeal reforms will over time lessen and ameliorate the evils of the profit system the mitigationists nourish the delusion that covid 19 will eventually evolve into something no more harmful than the common cold this is a pipe dream totally divorced from the science of the pandemic in reality as long as the virus spreads it will continue to mutate into new more infectious lethal and vaccine resistant variants that threaten all of humanity unless it is eradicated on a world scale the embers of covid 19 will continue to burn and create the conditions for the virus to flare up anew over the past year this perspective has been entirely vindicated in advancing the strategy of global elimination the wsws collaborated with a broad layer of scientists who had advocated for this policy this collaboration led to two public webinars hosted by the wsws on august 22 and october 24 2021 which provided a comprehensive strategy to eliminate the coronavirus globally while many scientists workers and anti covid activists advocated for comprehensive mitigation measures their appeals to the capitalist politicians fell on deaf ears it became increasingly clear that workers and scientists determined to stop the pandemic would have to take matters into their own hands this found its most advanced expression in a series of powerful school strikes initiated by british parent lisa diaz and supported by the wsws the first of which took place on october 1 2021 while these strikes involved the most scientifically informed and politically conscious sections of the working class it was clear that the great majority of workers remained cut off from both a scientific and political understanding of the pandemic to educate the working class and counter the self serving lies of governments and the media the wsws launched the global workers inquest into the covid 19 pandemic on november 20 2021 in the statement announcing the inquest we wrote this inquest is necessary to break through the cover up falsifications and misinformation that have been deployed to justify policies responsible for the avoidable deaths of millions since the initial detection of sars cov 2 the inquest will gather and make available to the public ample evidence of socially malign and even criminal indifference to human life the launching of this inquest cannot be delayed as the world enters the third year of the pandemic the global contagion is not abating far from it the sixth global surge of the pandemic is now well under way with cases hospitalizations and deaths once again on the rise as winter approaches in the northern hemisphere while powerful vaccines have been manufactured only 41 percent of the world s population has received two doses of vaccine including fewer than 7 percent of africans and 3 percent of people in low income countries just 2 6 percent of the world population has received a necessary third dose of vaccine scientists have repeatedly warned that continued mass infection amid the slow rollout of vaccines creates evolutionary pressures that threaten to produce a vaccine resistant variant only four days after this statement was published on november 24 2021 news broke that the omicron variant was spreading rapidly in south africa within weeks this highly infectious and immune resistant variant had spread to every corner of the globe infecting millions of people each day 2022 the collapse of the mitigationist strategy and the pursuit of forever covid the response of capitalist governments to the omicron variant was coldblooded and catastrophic far from acknowledging the disastrous consequences of their policies and mounting a comprehensive strategy to stop the pandemic governments throughout the world seized on this most infectious variant to scrap whatever limited mitigation measures were still in place and embrace the herd immunity strategy identified with the far right in doing so they worked with the corporate media to pursue a relentless propaganda campaign based on the lies that omicron was mild and that mass infection with this variant would even be a positive good on january 17 2022 a day when over 800 000 americans were officially infected with covid 19 and 1 397 died from the disease dr anthony fauci stated it is an open question as to whether or not omicron is going to be the live virus vaccination that everyone is hoping for this pragmatic and unscientific conception repeated by official scientists throughout the world was essentially a warmed over version of the herd immunity strategy based on the lie that natural infection would provide long lasting immunity and attenuate the dangers of the virus causing it to become endemic this outlook was used to justify the lifting of all mask mandates and recommendations the erosion and ultimate scrapping of isolation and quarantine guidelines the end of free testing and the universal rejection of lockdowns and social distancing implementing this false and reactionary policy required the systematic manipulation of data on the pandemic to cover up the real scale of death and debilitation caused by the virus throughout the world data collection and reporting systems were curtailed most often switching from daily to weekly reports in the united states the department of health and human services hhs scaled down the most comprehensive system to collect data from hospitals including daily death reports a development which only the wsws reported upon just prior to biden s march 1 2022 state of the union speech the cdc introduced its distorted community levels map to provide a pastel tinted veneer to the ongoing mass infection of the american population two maps of us zip codes from the cdc in late february 2022 showing actual rates of community transmission left versus the community levels right the results of this universal adoption of herd immunity have been horrendous in the nearly ten months since omicron first emerged more than three billion people have been infected with covid 19 globally including hundreds of millions of reinfections or breakthrough infections among vaccinated people officially 1 055 050 people have died from covid 19 worldwide so far this year while the excess deaths tracker of the economist the source used in graphs noting official and excess deaths at the start of each chapter in this book estimates that in reality 4 4 million people have already died directly or indirectly from the pandemic in 2022 the unhindered spread of the virus has spawned numerous omicron subvariants including omicron ba 2 ba 2 12 1 ba 4 and ba 5 each producing further waves of infections and deaths throughout much of the world scientists are warning that it is only a matter of time before new more devastating variants evolve that could further undermine existing vaccines and treatments such as paxlovid the propaganda campaign has had a profound impact on mass consciousness disarming hundreds of millions of people throughout the world by encouraging them to stop wearing masks and abandon their vigilance against the ongoing threat of covid 19 the mantra guiding this policy repeated ad nauseam by politicians globally is that society must learn to live with the virus in effect this cheap slogan aims to normalize perpetual mass death and debilitation in an unprecedented manner mass death from an infectious disease is now treated with complete indifference by the powers that be while attempting to cultivate a fatalistic and indifferent attitude in the population the ruling elites and their pliant media continue to promote the wuhan lab lie as well as endless lies about the elimination strategy in china above all the myth that it entails endless lockdowns in reality the example of china where the elimination strategy has found mass popular support in the working class is powerful proof of the viability of this strategy and shows the potential to eliminate sars cov 2 worldwide in a matter of months through the global deployment of every available public health measure coinciding with the brutal enforcement of a forever covid policy this year has also seen the unprecedented global spread of monkeypox an excruciatingly painful disease closely related to smallpox as of this writing there have been over 60 000 confirmed monkeypox cases in over one hundred countries with twenty three confirmed deaths in addition polio and other infectious diseases eliminated throughout much of the world in the twentieth century have reemerged in the united states the united kingdom and other advanced capitalist countries following the outbreak of the war in ukraine in february 2022 unlimited resources have been funneled into military budgets alongside massive cuts to all social programs in germany the government seized on the war to pass a 100 billion remilitarization budget the largest since the fall of hitler s third reich while cutting the health budget from 64 billion to 22 billion close to pre pandemic levels the lessons that must be learned contrary to the lies of capitalist politicians and the media the covid 19 pandemic is not over the future course that the pandemic will take remains to be seen however after three years it should be readily apparent that neither the pandemic nor any of the other dangers confronting humanity will be resolved under the auspices of world capitalism the covid 19 pandemic is only the first plague of the twenty first century climate change and the unplanned nature of capitalist development are creating the conditions for ever more infectious diseases to spill over from destabilized animal populations into urban centers and to then rapidly spread worldwide via international travel and commerce if any conclusion can be drawn from the experience of the past three years it is that the resolution of these crises is dependent not on the discovery of a miraculous medical cure or technology but on a social and political movement against the root cause of the crisis the anarchic capitalist profit system the pandemic climate change and the destruction of public health are only symptoms of a more profound disease the capitalist system itself which subordinates all human needs to the profit interests of a money mad ruling class the title of this book covid capitalism and class war is justified the pandemic has revealed the reality of a global class war in which the most urgent needs of mankind are subordinated to the drive for corporate profits and the accumulation of obscene levels of personal wealth the disastrous consequences cannot be explained as solely the unintended by product of incorrect policies the policies implemented by governments bear the criminal mark of what is defined in law as malice aforethought the response of capitalist governments to the pandemic has served the interests of their super rich patrons lowering life expectancy in order to reduce pension obligations and social spending has been a longstanding aim of sections of the ruling class and this effect of the pandemic is not simply an unforeseen coincidence according to forbes by may 4 2022 the day that the official covid 19 death toll in the us surpassed one million the wealth of america s 727 billionaires had increased by 1 71 trillion since the start of the pandemic the grotesque accumulation of wealth by those described by the wsws as pandemic profiteers amid mass death and suffering can be seen throughout much of the world in the course of april may 2020 the wsws first characterized the pandemic as a trigger event in world history akin to the june 28 1914 assassination of austrian archduke franz ferdinand which triggered the outbreak of world war i over two years later it is clear that the pandemic profoundly accelerated the destabilization of world capitalism as with the trench warfare of world war i during the pandemic the ruling elites have subjected mankind to wave after wave of mass infections and deaths these policies have produced unprecedented labor shortages a spiraling global economic crisis with massive inflation and an escalation of geopolitical tensions that triggered the outbreak of war in ukraine the antechamber to world war iii the criminal pandemic policies of nearly every government have exposed the brutality of capitalism radicalizing masses of workers in every industry throughout the world the class struggle has steadily intensified over the past two years and has now reached a fever pitch the pandemic and the looming threat of world war will only be stopped through the global revolutionary struggles of the working class international nurses strikes in 2022 at the 2021 wsws international may day online rally we announced the founding of the international workers alliance of rank and file committees iwa rfc whose central aim was to unify workers globally in opposition to the pandemic policies of the corporations governments and unions and to fight for their own independent interests since its founding the iwa rfc has expanded to become the organizing center of the increasingly militant struggles of the international working class whose working conditions and living standards have dramatically declined during the pandemic the iwa rfc must be developed systematically in every country as can be seen in the extensive list of authors from throughout the world this book is a collective global effort in addition there are numerous scientists and experts that the wsws has consulted with during the pandemic and to whom we are immensely grateful in our work with scientists we have not imposed a political litmus test our only requirement was a commitment to scientific truth we set ourselves the goal to analyze the pandemic as carefully as possible and not to impose conclusions on facts but to draw the conclusions out of the facts we had an immense advantage as socialists educated in the marxist trotskyist tradition in that our response has been informed by history science and a profound awareness of the class dynamics at play in society the work of the international committee of the fourth international which finds powerful expression in the leadership that it has given to the fight against the pandemic represents the intellectual political interaction of a commitment to scientific truth irreconcilable opposition to social inequality and exploitation and unshakable confidence in the ability of the international working class to put an end to a failed capitalist system and reconstruct the world on a socialist basis nearly sixty five years ago in 1958 the brilliant scholar and socialist george rosen published his monumental a history of public health his work traced the development of man s struggle against disease from its origins in the ancient world at the conclusion of his work rosen wrote we are now in a position to look back and to see clearly the road that has been traversed in dealing with the health problems of the community the manner in which these have been handled has always been connected with the way of life of the community and the scientific and technical knowledge available to it today the community is in a better position than ever to control its environment and so to preserve health and avert disease more and more man can consciously plan and organize his campaign for better health because available knowledge and resources make it possible for him in many instances to act with a clear understanding of what he is doing george rosen were he still alive would be deeply shocked by the socially retrogressive response of contemporary governments to the covid 19 pandemic he would have condemned their policies as a repudiation of the knowledge painfully acquired by scientists physicians and public health workers over many generations and even centuries but the struggle is not over the world socialist web site will continue to provide leadership in the fight against the pandemic in presenting this and subsequent volumes to the public our aim is to develop a global mass movement based on the working class and drawing support from all progressive sections of humanity
