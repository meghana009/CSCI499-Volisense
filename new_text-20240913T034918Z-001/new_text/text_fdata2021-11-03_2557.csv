another move today by the liberals of this country will have residual results on our educational system for years to come in an ap story today it was announced that new york mayor bill de blasio is ending the gifted and talented academic programs in new york schools because they promote segregation yup you heard it right too many white and asian kids are in that program leaving latino black and native american kids behind they are pushing for a coast to coast movement to eliminate these elevated academic programs where are all you educators out there you should be furious at this ridiculous policy get our free mobile app not pushing kids to excel will have a catastrophic impact on our future professionals for many years to come the question should be why are so many kids regardless of ethnicity not excelling in their studies that s the problem not the fact that these classes are available when you look at our test scores as a nation and as a state it s alarming we keep putting more and more money into it and the results keep deteriorating i don t believe for a moment that our teachers would purposely not work hard to try to get these kids in accelerated classes in fact i would bet they go above and beyond to try to get them there for a promising future and a promising career this will only now indoctrinate more kids on how unfair this country is and incorporate a why try attitude i would have never imagined that this would have ever happened and i fear for what is coming next
file a salvation army bell is rung by michael cronin as he staffs the charity s red donation kettle in front of a grocery store tuesday dec 8 2020 in lynden wash in the wake of the most devastating public health emergency in a century and the resulting economic uncertainty americans provided more charitable dollars to united way worldwide than any other nonprofit focused on direct aid followed by the salvation army and st jude childrens research hospital according to new rankings by the chronicle of philanthropy ap photo elaine thompson file in the wake of the most devastating public health emergency in a century and the resulting economic uncertainty americans provided more charitable dollars to united way worldwide than any other nonprofit focused on direct aid followed by the salvation army and st jude children s research hospital according to new rankings by the chronicle of philanthropy the most striking increase in charitable giving last year came at feeding america a national network of more than 200 food banks which grew the fastest of the 100 nonprofits in the chronicle rankings feeding america raised over 515 million last year more than three and a half times what it brought in in 2019 recommended videos even with that increase though feeding america officials like the leaders of other nonprofits are worried about what will happen as the urgency of the health and economic crises fade but demand for charitable services continues we are in a fortunate position to have such an influx of donors but the need is enormous says casey marsh chief development officer at feeding america the cameras have started to go away from the food bank lines but the lines haven t gone away it s so incredibly important that people stick with us at the salvation army officials are worried that americans will hold back after nearly two years of feeling the urgency of the pandemic what we fear like other nonprofits of course is donor fatigue says dale bannon national community relations and development secretary at the salvation army which raised 1 8 billion last year an increase of 31 the findings come from the chronicle of philanthropy s america s favorite charities ranking of organizations that earn the most direct financial support from individuals foundations and corporations the chronicle gathers information from federal informational tax returns that nonprofits file and other reporting to determine which organizations fared the best roughly 1 out of every 11 donated in 2020 went to the 100 nonprofits on this list a sign of the gigantic percentage big nonprofits get compared to the more than 1 million other charitable organizations in the united states while the big charities get a large share of americans dollars they did not do as well last year as nonprofits over all adjusted for inflation the 100 top charities raised 2 7 more than in 2019 overall charitable giving last year grew 3 8 in 2020 according to estimates from the annual giving usa report the share of americans who give has been declining for decades and now hovers at 50 even as total giving continues to increase but the pandemic deepened charities reliance on donors who can make the biggest gifts and that is likely to continue in the years ahead says eric javier managing director at the consulting firm ccs fundraising if the market stays high and full employment lags i would predict that this trend will continue charities will depend on the wealthiest donors he wrote in an email these donors have both the financial capacity and psychological comfort to consider major gifts but working nonprofits like the salvation army and feeding america are not the only entities that can accept tax deductible contributions in recent years many high net worth donors have chosen to give to donor advised funds the charitable giving accounts housed at commercial banks community foundations and other charities while donors receive an immediate tax break for their contributions to these funds there is no required timeline for directing those funds to working nonprofits that s why the chronicle does not count them in its rankings which focus on money flowing out of donors hands into charities doing work today still the size of those donor advised funds compared with other nonprofits is eye catching fidelity charitable alone took in upwards of 10 7 billion last year almost triple the nearly 3 6 billion united way worldwide no 1 in our survey raised 3 3 more than in 2019 raised and nearly six times what the salvation army collected to compete for funding in an environment in which the wealthy dominate charitable giving united way worldwide has made big changes it was once defined by its workplace giving campaigns which raise recurring modest contributions from everyday people but those efforts have been declining for years falling 15 in 2020 in large part because of remote work or layoffs due to the pandemic gifts of 10 000 or more helped the organization increase its cash support by more than 3 from 2019 to 2020 those big contributions meant that for the first time since 2014 united way worldwide s donations grew year over year among those big gifts were contributions from mackenzie scott the novelist and former wife of jeff bezos who supported 46 united way affiliates across the united states while leaning on affluent americans produced fundraising success at the legacy social services group tolli love chief investor relations officer at united way worldwide worries that the nature of united way will change as it relies less and less on the working class united way likes to think of ourselves as democratizing philanthropy love says to have fewer people deciding where the philanthropic resources go it s a danger or a risk that could possibly leave everyday community supporters disenfranchised one reason major donors felt emboldened to give big last year was the booming stock market some charities especially colleges and universities have decided to launch major fundraising drives to attract big gifts from high net worth donors there s a momentum there there s a heightened interest in philanthropy says karin george managing principal at washburn mcgoldrick a fundraising firm that primarily works with independent schools and colleges and universities nonprofits say they also benefited as donors were willing to provide them money for their operating expenses like paying utility bills and technology costs rather than earmarking aid for specific programs as they often do in 2020 individual donors to the ymca of the usa no 63 raised 338 million in 2020 down 3 3 from 2019 went above and beyond their usual gifts to fund the services the charity offers making no strings gifts directly to the charity s national office these contributions helped the headquarters set up programs including child care programs for essential workers who lived incommunities under stress from natural disasters disease outbreaks and other challenges rebecca bowen its chief advancement officer credits some big unprompted gifts to national media coverage of ymcas across the country meeting community needs a large one came in after npr ran a story on the ymca that featured a photo of kids in a child care program pretending to be airplanes to stay socially distanced the adviser who called said my donor saw that picture bowen says even charities that had banner fundraising years in 2020 are uncertain how the pandemic has changed americans thinking about the best ways to do good what happens when all the people of this country live inside for a year and a half wonders sara rubin vice president of development at ohio state university no 51 raised 398 million in 2020

cnn by matt egan cnn business sticker shock is causing anxiety for millions of americans right now with prices soaring for gasoline groceries and used cars unfortunately it s going to take longer than expected to work out the supply demand imbalances at the heart of inflation goldman sachs warned clients sunday night the inflation overshoot will likely get worse before it gets better the bank s economists wrote in a research report like much of wall street and the federal reserve goldman sachs had been anticipating high prices would swiftly come back to earth now there is a realization that inflation will be sticking around longer as supply struggles to keep up with surging demand due to prolonged supply demand imbalances soaring wages and rising rent amid the housing boom inflation metrics will remain quite high for much of next year goldman sachs conceded that s bad news for americans struggling with the high cost of living as well as businesses squeezed by shortages and rising prices low income families and those living on a fixed budget are hurt the most by rising prices on necessities like gas food and clothing the inflation forecast is also a setback for the white house because high prices and supply chain problems are souring americans views on the us economy which had been expected to be a strongpoint for president joe biden this year instead nearly two thirds of americans described the economy as poor in a poll released last week nearly half expect the economy to get worse in the next year 30 year high for inflation annual inflation climbed at the fastest pace in more than 30 years during september according to the commerce department that s based on the 4 4 increase in the personal consumption expenditures price index excluding food and energy core pce the fed s preferred inflation metric rose 3 6 in august and september the fastest pace since may 1991 the fed has now changed its tune on inflation acknowledging that high prices won t go away anytime soon we see shortages and bottlenecks persisting into next year well into next year fed chairman jerome powell told reporters during a press conference last week we see higher inflation persisting everyday americans seem to agree consumers are now expecting prices to rise by 5 7 over the next year according to a survey released monday by the ny federal reserve that marks the highest level since the survey began in june 2013 and the 12th consecutive monthly increase the fed watches these surveys closely because expectations of high inflation can change consumer and business behavior creating a self fulfilling prophesy the good news is that goldman sachs says its core view remains that supply demand imbalances will largely work themselves out leaving inflation near the fed s goal that jives with what powell has said in recent weeks we do not think that aggregate demand is on an unsustainable trajectory or that inflation expectations have become unanchored and the overshoot should therefore ultimately prove transitory goldman sachs economists wrote in the report in other words the fed likely won t need to slam the brakes on the economy to fight inflation through sharp interest rate hikes risks tilted towards more not less inflation still goldman sachs expects core pce inflation to rise from the current 30 year high of 3 6 to 4 4 by the end of 2021 the fed s preferred inflation metric is expected to eventually cool off to 2 3 at the end of 2022 and 2 1 at the end of 2023 likewise core consumer prices are expected to remain in the mid 5 range for much of the winter before easing to 4 next summer and 3 2 at the end of 2022 goldman sachs said that s well above the fed s 2 goal and may keep anxiety about the economy high as powell said during his press conference there remains vast uncertainty over the inflation outlook no one can say for certain when prices will get back to normal the risks to our forecast are probably tilted to the upside goldman sachs acknowledged the cnn wire 2021 cable news network inc a warnermedia company all rights reserved

trip car ride from dorset was more than worth it this dining experience has it all the history the setting the food the chef the service all extraordinary as soon as you walk into an intimate and charming 1920s worcester dining car restored to its vintage glory you know you are in for a unique evening of fine dining and pure pleasure in about 400 square feet sit seven or so tables each graced by a simple white dahlia in an open kitchen of half that size the brilliance of owner chef michael fuller is on display right before your eyes it all works to perfection chef michael began learning his craft at 19 as an apprentice for the renowned rene chardain the owner chef of the four columns restaurant in newfane the four columns was the first true farm to table restaurant in the united states in keeping with that tradition chef michael locally sources whenever possible including cheese from parish hill in westminster and seafood from adam s in brattleboro t j buckley s is an opportunity to savor world class dining that is seasonal organic healthy and yes absolutely delicious all you have to do at t j buckley s is choose your dinner from a verbal menu because each evening s choices are dependent upon available local ingredients then sit back and let it unfold before you we began with an onion pepper and parmesan bread from orchard hill farms in east alstead brought to us by our delightfully well informed servers effie and amy who worked the room gracefully and efficiently this tastebud wake up along with a crisp and flavorful pouilly fuisse from domaine cheveau at a reasonable 52 paired well with what was yet to come several starters ranging in price from 12 to 22 are artwork on a plate the evening we were there the choices included a country pate with pommery mustard and homemade peach rhubarb fig chutney mostly from chef michael s garden a crab cake with shrimp accompanied by a garlic aioli a smoked trout and chevre tart served with roast corn creme fraiche and paddlefish roe a parmesan cheese tart with pine nuts and membrillo a sweet jelly from the fruit of the nutritious quince tree a familiar meal ender in spain often served alongside manchego

local greens and vegetables with blue cheese from highgate s boucher family farm four impeccably executed entrees all priced at or near 50 were carefully choreographed but never at the expense of being a joy to eat as good as chef michael s food looks it tastes even better it s clean yet elegant it s playful yet polished each plate is perfectly prepared and presented meticulous without being fussy you soon realize that this is a meal you cannot prepare at home it feels special because it is we had halibut something we rarely order because it too often is dry or tasteless seared and steamed with an incredible calasparra rice mixed with vermont shepherd cheese local sweet corn and charred scallions topped off with a shellfish dashi we weren t familiar with dashi but learned that it is a family of stocks used in japanese cuisine such as the base for miso soup it is meant to accentuate the savory flavor known as umami we have never experienced halibut that tasted as good as this did our other main was seared sea scallops served atop a stone ground polenta cake with local greens artichoke maitake mushrooms and an optional crispy pork belly which we thoroughly enjoyed the creative combination of these uncommon flavors was remarkably coordinated to deliver a most satisfying and pleasant package for the palate since the tables are obviously close to one another conversation between guests is inevitable the folks next to us were from california and at another nearby table sat people from boston it s perfectly acceptable at t j buckley s to more than glance at what is served at your neighbors tables it s all part of the fun although we did not have the wagyu ribeye it looked tempting and got rave reviews from those who did order it it s served with a house made herb gnocchi and a mushroom garlic pan au jus the remaining entree was rabbit the leg is stuffed with bacon and swiss chard while the loin is wrapped in pancetta the takeaway here is that you will eat food you may have never had before and enjoy the heck out of it chef michael is about offering a fresh and flavorful ingredient driven menu there were no missteps the night we were there and we would return with the confidence that anything we ordered would be magical kudos as well to sous chef kristen who has toiled in the kitchen with michael for 30 years since we couldn t leave without

president joe biden said he ll announce soon his choice of nominees for chair and other vacancies on the federal reserve amid a scandal over stock trades by central bank officials we ll be making those announcements fairly quickly he said tuesday at a press conference at a climate summit in glasgow scotland president joe biden said he plans to announce fed picks fairly quickly bloomberg news biden has started meeting with top white house and treasury advisers to review candidates to lead the central bank ahead of the expiration of chair jerome powell s term in february it remains unclear whether he is leaning toward reappointing powell replacing him with liberal democrats preferred candidate fed governor lael brainard or choosing someone else for the job the president faces the decision amid the fed s internal investigation of stock trading by top regional officials in 2020 at the same time the bank was pumping money into the economy powell moved quickly to roll out new ethics rules guiding officials trades but the incident has given his critics fresh ammunition biden has also been urged by some democrats to put his own stamp on the fed by nominating a chair he has selected rather than leaving powell who was chosen by donald trump in 2017 to continue shaping monetary policy biden has valued gender and racial diversity in his senior personnel choices and has specifically called for the fed to ramp up its diversity efforts senate banking committee chairman sherrod brown said last week on bloomberg television that he expects biden to roll out a slate that includes not just a fed chair but a pick for the vacant vice chair of supervision slot as well as choices for two other seats on the board biden s predecessors have traditionally announced their pick by this point in the calendar with the exception of trump who rolled out his selection of powell on nov 2 2017 with biden not slated to return from a trip to europe until nov 3 he s on track to be even later in revealing his decision we re going to have plenty of time to ensure nominees can clear the senate biden said presidents often reappoint the sitting chair even if that person was first nominated by the opposing party for the sake of continuity in monetary policy and many democrats have indicated they d like to see powell stay in the job months ago treasury secretary janet yellen a former fed chair communicated her support for a second powell term to the white house massachusetts democrat elizabeth warren is the only senator to voice opposition to powell s reappointment no senators have publicly backed brainard though some liberal groups are campaigning for her she would likely draw nearly unanimous opposition from republican senators while powell would likely draw a bipartisan consensus

olmsted county wants to help build 500 single family homes in the next five years i think it s going to be a significant challenge but i think frankly as a community as a county as cities in the county we are up to it olmsted county housing director dave dunn said the program which was unanimously approved by county commissioners on tuesday was initiated by commissioner matt flynn who wanted to provide help for residents seeking to build single family homes throughout the county related olmsted county to use 16 1 million in covid relief for affordable housing homeless dubbed the growing affordable inclusive neighborhoods program the project will provide 10 000 down payment assistance loans to qualified residents building homes with construction costs of 300 000 or less the loans will be forgiven after five years of living in the home advertisement flynn said the goal was to make the program simple but practical in growing the future of olmsted county i really believe this program will do that he added the effort will be funded with a portion of the 30 7 million the county expects to receive during a two year period under the american rescue plan act it s a wonderful use of what was unexpected cash that flowed through the door commissioner ken brown said while another 10 million is earmarked for work with the coalition for rochester area housing the 5 million is dedicated to growing the stock of single family homes throughout the county the loans will be provided to qualified county residents who are building homes that are deemed affordable for people earning less than 80 of the area median income in olmsted county that s right at 80 000 a year for a family of four dunn said using minnesota housing guidelines that s an annual income for an individual at 80 ami is 56 720 advertisement flynn said discussions with bankers have indicated a 300 000 home is achievable in that income level as long as land prices and other expenses aren t inflated to qualify for the loans county residents must either earn less than 80 of the area median income live in a defined census tract with lower incomes or have served in business or industry disproportionately affected by the covid 19 pandemic to ensure the loans create new homeowners the county will require owners to apply for the homestead tax exemption which means they will live in the property it also limits construction to single family homes duplexes and manufactured homes in some cases we want to provide a steady roof over your head home flynn said last month when commissioners reviewed program details commissioners are also hoping local communities will chip in with fee reductions or their own loans to help add to the effort i ve already heard from a few of the communities flynn said they are going to add on the plan calls for olmsted county housing staff to contract communities so local officials know the funds are available advertisement flynn said at least 25 loans have been earmarked for each community to make sure there s enough of an incentive to spur housing development since many builders find efficiencies in constructing multiple houses at a time if a community doesn t have enough applications in place by the end of 2023 the funds could be shifted to another community since the county needs to have the entire 5 million committed by the end of 2024 and spent by the end of 2026 with specifics still being finalized the loan applications will come directly from residents or through lenders or builders working with a future homeowner additionally a builder committed to constructing a new residence that meets the program criteria will be able to market the property to qualifying buyers while the program is targeting the creation of homeownership the applicant does not need to be a first time homebuyer

the drought stricken island nation of madagascar is a wake up call to what the world can expect in coming years due to climate change the head of the united nations food aid agency said tuesday david beasley executive director of the world food program told the associated press in an interview that what s happening in the south of the indian ocean country is the beginning of what we can expect to see as the effects of global warming become more pronounced madagascar was heartbreaking beasley said referring to his recent visit there it s just desperate with people reduced to selling their household pots and pans to try to buy food he said some 38 million people worldwide were displaced last year because of climate change leaving them vulnerable to hunger according to beasley a worst case scenario could see that number soar to 216 million people displaced due to climate change by 2050 that s the year many industrialized nations but not china russia or india have set as their target for achieving carbon neutrality meaning reducing greenhouse gas emissions to the point where they can be absorbed and effectively add zero to the atmosphere file a view of the mandrare river which is often dry during the austral winter when beasley a former south carolina governor took the world food program helm in 2017 the top reason for people being on the brink of starvation was man made conflict followed by climate change he said but since then climate change has been eclipsing conflicts as the bigger driver in displacing people and leaving them not knowing where their next meal will come from last year about 38 million he said were displaced strictly because of climate shocks climate change beasley said i would like to think this is the worst case scenario 216 million people by 2050 that will be migrating or displaced because of climate change he said according to updated wfp figures released tuesday close to 30 000 people on madagascar will be one step away from famine by the end of the year and some 1 1 million already suffer from severe hunger the island is struggling with exceptionally warm temperatures drought and sandstorms crops have wilted and harvests are scarce people have taken to eating cactus leaves which usually are cattle fodder the u n food agency said related cop26 world leaders vow to protect forests plug methane leaks madagascar is not an isolated incident beasley said the world needs to look to madagascar to see what is coming your way and to many other countries around the world he pointed out that madagascar a country of 27 million people accounts for only the tiniest fraction of greenhouse gas emissions in global terms what did they do to contribute to climate change he asked rhetorically the world food program has been supplying some 700 000 people on the island with food and supplemental nutritional products for pregnant and nursing women and children in ethiopia by contrast famine is man made caused by conflict related biden administration moves to curb methane emission from oil and gas operations the world food program estimates that 5 2 million people are in need of emergency food assistance in tigray ethiopia s embattled northern region united nations officials have warned in recent weeks that more than 400 000 people could face starvation and death if humanitarian aid isn t delivered quickly but hardly any aid can get to those who desperately need to eat the tigray forces say they are pressuring ethiopia s government to lift a months long blockade on their region of around 6 million people where basic services have been cut off and humanitarian food and medical aid denied beasley says the wfp has been messaging to all sides including the ethiopian government the leadership that this is a crisis needing immediate access for food aid but we re not making headway he said we re not able to get food aid trucks in or get fuel in we re not even able to get the cash to the people we need to pay beasley told the ap as a result tigray s people have to be dying at unprecedented numbers but we can t get the access we need he said it s a disgrace related cop26 biden calls this decade decisive on climate change apologizes for trump s actions he said the wfp should be moving in 30 trucks a day loaded with food and another 70 full of medicine and other humanitarian assistance we re not even getting 10 of that in trucks a day the agency director said for many of tigray s people beasley said it has come down to either die or migrate paradoxically afghanistan s new taliban rulers have allowed wfp access to food distribution centers and schools where many teachers are going unpaid and protected wfp warehouses while international donors haven t been supplying sufficient funding beasley said you run into the issue of donors who do not want to be seen in any way as aiding or abetting or supporting the taliban beasley said in afghanistan 22 8 million people half of the population face acute food insecurity or are marching toward starvation as beasley put it related us to consider emissions from federal oil gas leases to gauge climate damage conflict and drought combined to create that impoverished nation s food crisis the dire situation will grow even more critical starting in january when the wfp s food stocks for afghanistan will run low if more donors don t come through that price tag is 230 million a month feeding them at only partial rations beasley said adding that there are 8 7 million people in afghanistan knocking of famine s door the u n agency was awarded the nobel peace prize last year

president muhammadu buhari on tuesday said 1 5 trillion dollars is the cumulative estimated amount needed by nigeria over a ten year period to achieve an appreciable level of the national infrastructure stock president buhari gave the figure on tuesday in glasgow at a cop 26 high level side event on improving global infrastructure hosted by president joe biden of the united states eu commission president von der leyen and the uk prime minister boris johnson nigeria is ready for your investments in infrastructural development in the country my administration has established a clear legal and regulatory framework for private financing of infrastructure to establish a standard process especially on the monitoring and evaluation process we look forward to working with you in this regard he told world leaders at the high level meeting on the margins of the climate change conference president buhari also declared that his administration had taken infrastructure expansion in nigeria seriously conscious of the fact that new investments in critical sectors of the economy would aid lifting 100 million nigerians from poverty by 2030 there is a nexus between infrastructural development and the overall economic development of a nation my administration identified this early enough as a major enabler of sustainable economic development and the realization of other continental and global development aspirations particularly the 2030 agenda for sustainable development goals on my assumption of office in 2015 nigeria faced a huge infrastructure deficit and the total national infrastructure stock was estimated at 35 of our gross domestic product in solving these problems we embarked on a massive infrastructure expansion programme in the areas of health care education transportation manufacturing energy housing agriculture and water resources we provided more financial resources for these policies charted new international partnerships and pursued liberalization policies to allow private sector participation we introduced the revised national integrated infrastructure master plan a policy document that ensures our infrastructure expansion projects is cross sectorally integrated and environmentally friendly he said the president welcomed the g7 countries for its ground breaking plan to mobilize hundreds of billions of dollars of infrastructure investment for low and middle income countries he noted that the build back better world plan an initiative of the g7 countries is expected to be a values driven high standard and transparent infrastructure partnership it is our fervent hope and expectations that this plan will be pursued to its logical conclusion in order to bridge the infrastructural gap between the north and south he said the president also used the occasion to outline the principles values and standards nigeria would like to see from infrastructure initiatives and the challenges the country has faced in partnering with donors on infrastructure development the aim of pursuing quality infrastructure investment is to maximize the positive economic environmental social and development impact of infrastructure and create a virtuous circle of economic activities while ensuring sound public finances this virtuous circle can take various forms in stimulating the economy he said the nigerian leader noted that infrastructure investment should therefore take into account economic environmental and social and governance aspects guided by a sense of shared long term responsibility for the planet consistent with the 2030 agenda for sustainable development the president added that the positive and negative impacts of infrastructure projects on ecosystems biodiversity climate weather and the use of resources should be internalized by incorporating these environmental considerations over the entire process of infrastructure investment domestic resource mobilization is critical to addressing the infrastructure financing gap assistance for capacity building including for project preparation should be provided to developing countries with the participation of international organizations quality infrastructure investment also needs to be tailored to individual country conditions and consistent with local laws and regulations furthermore infrastructure projects should align with national strategies and nationally determined contributions for those countries determined to implement them and with transitioning to long term low emissions strategies while being mindful of country circumstances he said the president also called for the environmental impact of infrastructure investment to be made transparent to all stakeholders noting that this will enhance the appreciation of sustainable infrastructure projects and increase awareness of related risks

billion down 5 year over year and diluted earnings per share of 1 88 billion while somewhat disappointing in the short term these results are just a piece of the puzzle in terms of evaluating apple s worth about apple to see how much apple is worth take a look at this snapshot of the company s current state along with a discussion of the company s history value and future outlook about apple headquarters cupertino california year founded 1976 founders steve jobs steve wozniak ceo tim cook apple s worth share price 52 week range 124 17 179 60 fiscal year 2022 revenue 394 33 billion fiscal

trillion market cap does have its drawbacks as an evaluation method however for starters market cap changes frequently and it s closely tied to the company s current share price it doesn t take into account any of the direct financial metrics of the company such as earnings per share growth rate or book value by way of comparison the price earnings ratio which is another popular valuation method is also closely tied to a company s market share price the p e ratio also relies heavily on a company s earnings which some investors feel is a more important determinant of a company s valuation as of march 21 apple s p e ratio is 26 87 apple s founders steve jobs and steve wozniak met through a mutual friend and bonded over their love of technology the two steves co founded apple in 1976 laying

file a salvation army bell is rung by michael cronin as he staffs the charity s red donation kettle in front of a grocery store tuesday dec 8 2020 in lynden wash in the wake of the most devastating public health emergency in a century and the resulting economic uncertainty americans provided more charitable dollars to united way worldwide than any other nonprofit focused on direct aid followed by the salvation army and st jude children s research hospital according to new rankings by the chronicle of philanthropy ap photo elaine thompson file in the wake of the most devastating public health emergency in a century and the resulting economic uncertainty americans provided more charitable dollars to united way worldwide than any other nonprofit focused on direct aid followed by the salvation army and st jude children s research hospital according to new rankings by the chronicle of philanthropy the most striking increase in charitable giving last year came at feeding america a national network of more than 200 food banks which grew the fastest of the 100 nonprofits in the chronicle rankings feeding america raised over 515 million last year more than three and a half times what it brought in in 2019 even with that increase though feeding america officials like the leaders of other nonprofits are worried about what will happen as the urgency of the health and economic crises fade but demand for charitable services continues advertisement we are in a fortunate position to have such an influx of donors but the need is enormous says casey marsh chief development officer at feeding america the cameras have started to go away from the food bank lines but the lines haven t gone away it s so incredibly important that people stick with us at the salvation army officials are worried that americans will hold back after nearly two years of feeling the urgency of the pandemic what we fear like other nonprofits of course is donor fatigue says dale bannon national community relations and development secretary at the salvation army which raised 1 8 billion last year an increase of 31 the findings come from the chronicle of philanthropy s america s favorite charities ranking of organizations that earn the most direct financial support from individuals foundations and corporations the chronicle gathers information from federal informational tax returns that nonprofits file and other reporting to determine which organizations fared the best roughly 1 out of every 11 donated in 2020 went to the 100 nonprofits on this list a sign of the gigantic percentage big nonprofits get compared to the more than 1 million other charitable organizations in the united states while the big charities get a large share of americans dollars they did not do as well last year as nonprofits over all adjusted for inflation the 100 top charities raised 2 7 more than in 2019 overall charitable giving last year grew 3 8 in 2020 according to estimates from the annual giving usa report the share of americans who give has been declining for decades and now hovers at 50 even as total giving continues to increase but the pandemic deepened charities reliance on donors who can make the biggest gifts and that is likely to continue in the years ahead says eric javier managing director at the consulting firm ccs fundraising if the market stays high and full employment lags i would predict that this trend will continue charities will depend on the wealthiest donors he wrote in an email these donors have both the financial capacity and psychological comfort to consider major gifts but working nonprofits like the salvation army and feeding america are not the only entities that can accept tax deductible contributions in recent years many high net worth donors have chosen to give to donor advised funds the charitable giving accounts housed at commercial banks community foundations and other charities while donors receive an immediate tax break for their contributions to these funds there is no required timeline for directing those funds to working nonprofits that s why the chronicle does not count them in its rankings which focus on money flowing out of donors hands into charities doing work today still the size of those donor advised funds compared with other nonprofits is eye catching fidelity charitable alone took in upwards of 10 7 billion last year almost triple the nearly 3 6 billion united way worldwide no 1 in our survey raised 3 3 more than in 2019 raised and nearly six times what the salvation army collected to compete for funding in an environment in which the wealthy dominate charitable giving united way worldwide has made big changes it was once defined by its workplace giving campaigns which raise recurring modest contributions from everyday people but those efforts have been declining for years falling 15 in 2020 in large part because of remote work or layoffs due to the pandemic gifts of 10 000 or more helped the organization increase its cash support by more than 3 from 2019 to 2020 those big contributions meant that for the first time since 2014 united way worldwide s donations grew year over year among those big gifts were contributions from mackenzie scott the novelist and former wife of jeff bezos who supported 46 united way affiliates across the united states while leaning on affluent americans produced fundraising success at the legacy social services group tolli love chief investor relations officer at united way worldwide worries that the nature of united way will change as it relies less and less on the working class united way likes to think of ourselves as democratizing philanthropy love says to have fewer people deciding where the philanthropic resources go it s a danger or a risk that could possibly leave everyday community supporters disenfranchised one reason major donors felt emboldened to give big last year was the booming stock market some charities especially colleges and universities have decided to launch major fundraising drives to attract big gifts from high net worth donors there s a momentum there there s a heightened interest in philanthropy says karin george managing principal at washburn mcgoldrick a fundraising firm that primarily works with independent schools and colleges and universities nonprofits say they also benefited as donors were willing to provide them money for their operating expenses like paying utility bills and technology costs rather than earmarking aid for specific programs as they often do in 2020 individual donors to the ymca of the usa no 63 raised 338 million in 2020 down 3 3 from 2019 went above and beyond their usual gifts to fund the services the charity offers making no strings gifts directly to the charity s national office these contributions helped the headquarters set up programs including child care programs for essential workers who lived incommunities under stress from natural disasters disease outbreaks and other challenges rebecca bowen its chief advancement officer credits some big unprompted gifts to national media coverage of ymcas across the country meeting community needs a large one came in after npr ran a story on the ymca that featured a photo of kids in a child care program pretending to be airplanes to stay socially distanced the adviser who called said my donor saw that picture bowen says even charities that had banner fundraising years in 2020 are uncertain how the pandemic has changed americans thinking about the best ways

the drought stricken island nation of madagascar is a wake up call to what the world can expect in coming years due to climate change the head of the united nations food aid agency said tuesday david beasley executive director of the world food program told the associated press in an interview that what s happening in the south of the indian ocean country is the beginning of what we can expect to see as the effects of global warming become more pronounced madagascar was heartbreaking beasley said referring to his recent visit there it s just desperate with people reduced to selling their household pots and pans to try to buy food he said some 38 million people worldwide were displaced last year because of climate change leaving them vulnerable to hunger according to beasley a worst case scenario could see that number soar to 216 million people displaced due to climate change by 2050 that s the year many industrialized nations but not china russia or india have set as their target for achieving carbon neutrality meaning reducing greenhouse gas emissions to the point where they can be absorbed and effectively add zero to the atmosphere file a view of the mandrare river which is often dry during the austral winter when beasley a former south carolina governor took the world food program helm in 2017 the top reason for people being on the brink of starvation was man made conflict followed by climate change he said but since then climate change has been eclipsing conflicts as the bigger driver in displacing people and leaving them not knowing where their next meal will come from last year about 38 million he said were displaced strictly because of climate shocks climate change beasley said i would like to think this is the worst case scenario 216 million people by 2050 that will be migrating or displaced because of climate change he said according to updated wfp figures released tuesday close to 30 000 people on madagascar will be one step away from famine by the end of the year and some 1 1 million already suffer from severe hunger the island is struggling with exceptionally warm temperatures drought and sandstorms crops have wilted and harvests are scarce people have taken to eating cactus leaves which usually are cattle fodder the u n food agency said related cop26 world leaders vow to protect forests plug methane leaks madagascar is not an isolated incident beasley said the world needs to look to madagascar to see what is coming your way and to many other countries around the world he pointed out that madagascar a country of 27 million people accounts for only the tiniest fraction of greenhouse gas emissions in global terms what did they do to contribute to climate change he asked rhetorically the world food program has been supplying some 700 000 people on the island with food and supplemental nutritional products for pregnant and nursing women and children in ethiopia by contrast famine is man made caused by conflict related biden administration moves to curb methane emission from oil and gas operations the world food program estimates that 5 2 million people are in need of emergency food assistance in tigray ethiopia s embattled northern region united nations officials have warned in recent weeks that more than 400 000 people could face starvation and death if humanitarian aid isn t delivered quickly but hardly any aid can get to those who desperately need to eat the tigray forces say they are pressuring ethiopia s government to lift a months long blockade on their region of around 6 million people where basic services have been cut off and humanitarian food and medical aid denied beasley says the wfp has been messaging to all sides including the ethiopian government the leadership that this is a crisis needing immediate access for food aid but we re not making headway he said we re not able to get food aid trucks in or get fuel in we re not even able to get the cash to the people we need to pay beasley told the ap as a result tigray s people have to be dying at unprecedented numbers but we can t get the access we need he said it s a disgrace related cop26 biden calls this decade decisive on climate change apologizes for trump s actions he said the wfp should be moving in 30 trucks a day loaded with food and another 70 full of medicine and other humanitarian assistance we re not even getting 10 of that in trucks a day the agency director said for many of tigray s people beasley said it has come down to either die or migrate paradoxically afghanistan s new taliban rulers have allowed wfp access to food distribution centers and schools where many teachers are going unpaid and protected wfp warehouses while international donors haven t been supplying sufficient funding beasley said you run into the issue of donors who do not want to be seen in any way as aiding or abetting or supporting the taliban beasley said in afghanistan 22 8 million people half of the population face acute food insecurity or are marching toward starvation as beasley put it related us to consider emissions from federal oil gas leases to gauge climate damage conflict and drought combined to create that impoverished nation s food crisis the dire situation will grow even more critical starting in january when the wfp s food stocks for afghanistan will run low if more donors don t come through that price tag is 230 million a month feeding them at only partial rations beasley said adding that there are 8 7 million people in afghanistan knocking of famine s door the u n agency was awarded the nobel peace prize last year

by john harwood as economic concerns erode president joe biden s political standing his aides are trying to assure americans they re doing everything possible to address fears about inflation and hard to find goods heading into the holiday season the white house website is rolling out a new supply chain dashboard to be updated every two weeks that will track progress in easing the backlog of imported goods that has accompanied the economy s recovery from coronavirus shutdowns the dashboard comes as tangled supply chains have boosted the cost and limited the availability of everything from automobiles to clothing to toys in the opening edition obtained before its launch tuesday by cnn white house aides attempted to explain and quantify the problem now hitting consumers in the wallet emphasizing the good news they note that strong demand means overall consumer spending has nearly reached its pre pandemic levels but as the pandemic persists the reshaping of consumer demand from services to physical goods has created choke points at busy ports like those in los angeles and long beach california in normal times only a few container ships would wait offshore at those ports to unload their goods as of last friday the white house said there were 75 a shortage of truck drivers has stalled the distribution of offloaded goods to retailers and other businesses to address both problems the white house supply chain disruptions task force has worked to relax trucking regulations and persuade ports and railroads to operate around the clock for the first two weeks of october the two major california ports off loaded 379 000 containers that makes a total of 8 1 million for the year ahead of the pace of the previous record year of 2018 as of the beginning of october that robust volume of containers had fueled a national inventory of retail goods with a dollar value of 455 billion that total which excludes automobiles is 4 above the same point last year the administration says as americans prepare to buy holiday gifts the white house is also tracking a data series compiled by the private firm iri that data shows how easily consumers can find goods that retailers offer as of sunday iri s on the shelf availability data showed retailers had in stock 89 of the goods they sell that was just slightly below the 91 level measured in february 2020 before coronavirus shutdowns more important than administration efforts to directly ease the supply chain crunch is the course of the pandemic itself in the us economists expect that the return to normal life will shift more consumer spending away from goods and back to services taming the pandemic in asia and elsewhere would reduce disruptions in manufacturing for semiconductors those chips are in particularly short supply hindering production of cars and other technology dependent goods but the pandemic has defied predictions so far leaving forecasts for inflation and other economic indicators in doubt the significant reason why prices are up is because of covid affecting the supply chain president joe biden said tuesday at a news conference closing out his overseas trip in glasgow scotland the president declined an invitation to specify when supply chains might be repaired he expressed confidence only that americans will prefer conditions this thanksgiving to last year s holiday the cnn wire 2021 cable news network inc a warnermedia company all rights reserved

toronto nov 02 2021 globe newswire noranda income fund tsx nif un the fund today reported its financial results for the third quarter ended september 30 2021 except where otherwise indicated all amounts in this press release are expressed in us dollars earnings before income taxes of 5 9 million compared to a loss of 4 1 million adjusted ebitda 1 of 5 7 million compared to 14 3 million of 5 7 million compared to 14 3 million zinc metal production of 64 063 tonnes compared to 64 748 tonnes zinc metal sales of 63 676 tonnes compared to 64 749 tonnes sulphuric acid sales of 95 821 tonnes compared to 93 588 tonnes our third quarter financial results reflect both higher zinc and by product prices and suppressed treatment charges in what remained a tight zinc concentrate market said paul einarson chief executive officer of canadian electrolytic zinc limited the fund s manager from an operational standpoint we are on track to achieve our 2021 zinc production and sales target of between 260 000 and 270 000 tonnes and continue to move forward with our strategic expansion projects while labour and supply chain challenges are putting pressure on our budget and timeline these continue to be manageable and to date have not impacted the planned gradual ramp up of our zinc production by an additional 10 000 tonnes in 2022 added mr einarson looking ahead to the remainder of the year and 2022 our sector continues to be impacted by global supply chain pressures rising energy prices in europe anticipated metal production curtailments and power availability concerns in china while this has led to an increase in commodity prices it has not yet translated into an increase in spot treatment charges in this context there is uncertainty if there will be a meaningful increase in this key revenue driver for the fund before 2022 when the projected zinc concentrate market surplus materializes concluded mr einarson executive officer appointments the fund also announced today the appointment of paul einarson as chief executive officer ceo and sylvain lirette as chief financial officer cfo of the fund s manager both paul and sylvain bring a deep understanding of our industry as well as the unique nature of the fund and have been instrumental in supporting the fund in the achievement of its business objectives over the last several years with the support of cezinc s

joining cezinc in 2014 prior to that mr lirette held senior finance roles for over 15 years in various industries he has a bachelor of business administration and accounting from université laval financial results for the third quarter 2021 revenues were 204 8 million compared to 136 5 million for the same period of 2020 the increase of 50 is mainly due to higher zinc and by product prices revenues less raw material purchase costs and derivative financial instruments loss gain net revenues were 44 9 million compared to 39 1 million for the same period of 2020 the increase was a net result of higher zinc prices lower treatment charges and the loss on derivative instruments in 2021 versus a gain in 2020 adjusted net revenues2 were 41 0 million compared to 49 3 million in the same period last year lower adjusted net revenues reflect lower treatment charges partially offset by higher zinc prices compared to 2020 production costs before change in inventory were 32 8 million 1 4 million higher than the 31 4 million recorded for the same period in 2020 unit production costs3 were 512 per tonne for the three months ended september 30 2021 compared to 485 per tonne in the same period of 2020 mainly explained by the impact of the strengthening of the canadian dollar compared to the us dollar liquidity position and distribution policy as at september 30 2021 the fund s asset based revolving credit facility the abl facility was 132 4 million down from 141 8 million at the end of december 31 2020 the fund s senior secured metal liability as at september 30 2021 was 45 1 million up from 31 1 million as at december 31 2020 the fund s cash as at september 30 2021 increased to 1 0 million from 0 2 million as at december 31 2020 cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended september 30 2021 was 29 8 million including a positive 21 3 million decrease in non cash working capital mainly due to a decrease in inventories and a decrease in accounts receivables in the same period of 2020 cash used in operating activities was 3 1 million including a positive 18 6 million decrease in non cash working capital due to an increase in accounts payables and a decrease in inventories partially offset by an increase in accounts receivables based on the fund s current liquidity position and capital requirements as well as continued challenging market conditions the fund has limited ability to pay regular distributions which are subject to the approval of its abl facility lenders the board continues to carefully monitor and review the fund s financial performance capital requirements business environment and prospects on a periodic basis as well as its required levels of reserves and expected future cash flows in order to determine its ability to pay distributions to unitholders in future production and sales outlook for 2021 2022 the fund s annual production and sales target for 2021 is between 260 000 to 270 000 tonnes for 2022 the fund expects its annual production and sales target to be between 270 000 to 280 000 tonnes reflecting the planned gradual production ramp up following the commissioning of its strategic expansion projects expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2022 barring any additional delays due to materials and contractor availability for more information on the fund s ongoing expansion projects and the impact of covid 19 please consult our latest consolidated financial statements and md a available on sedar and our corporate website market outlook the general global economic disruption and uncertainty caused by the covid 19 pandemic has resulted in a tight global concentrate market that until this point in 2021 has suppressed treatment charges as per wood mackenzie the indicative spot treatment charges on chinese imported concentrates have remained relatively flat finishing 2020 at 85 per tonne and are reported at similar levels in september 2021 80 per tonne over the same period the prices of zinc copper and sulphuric acid have increased most recently there has been an increased level of discussion on the impact of supply chain pressures energy price increases in europe and the availability of power in china specifically in europe there have been news reports of zinc smelters constraining production due to the high power costs similarly there is discussion that chinese zinc production has also been affected by power availability which is related to coal availability and carbon emission controls as a result zinc and copper prices increased sharply in october 2021 even in the absence of a clear quantification of potential or actual production curtailment there is limited evidence to date of the actual or potential impact of smelter production cuts on spot treatment charges however prior to the news of european smelters curtailing production industry experts were forecasting improved treatment charges on the basis that their supply and demand analysis projected a concentrate surplus in 2022 zinc premiums are also being impacted north american zinc producers have experienced disruptions in 2020 such as teck s trail smelter in british columbia being affected by forest fires in 2022 hudbay will close their flin flon smelter further there is concern that the zinc volumes previously imported to north america from europe will no longer be available in the same volumes as in the past finally the transportation industry is also experiencing labour shortages and cost increases with these contributing factors cru is indicating the premium for zinc in north america has doubled since the end of 2020 as well in their market outlooks many analysts are of the opinion that the zinc metal market is transitioning from a surplus in 2021 to a deficit in 2022 the same supply chain and energy challenges that are affecting the zinc smelting industry are also expected to have an impact on other sectors and potentially on the demand for other commodities as an example zinc galvanizers in china another energy intensive industry and an important end user of zinc were asked to curtail production in september by 10 15 overall chinese manufacturing is experiencing challenges due to a slowdown in the real estate sector supply chain disruptions and power shortages china s national bureau of statistics manufacturing purchasing manager s index has been decreasing over the last six consecutive months to 49 6 in september the first time the index has been below 50 since february 2020 the 50 point mark separates growth from contraction readers should

billings mont ap the biden administration is planning to sell oil and gas leases on huge tracts of public land in the u s west despite the interior department s conclusion that doing so could cost society billions of dollars in climate change impacts according to government documents administration officials announced last week that government regulators for the first time will analyze greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels extracted from government owned lands across the u s burning those fuels accounts for about 20 of energy related u s emissions making them a prime target for climate activists who want to shut down leasing president joe biden campaigned on pledges to end new drilling on public lands hundreds of parcels of land that companies nominated for leasing were dropped from the sales because of concerns about wildlife being harmed by drilling rigs yet officials with the interior department s bureau of land management blm said for now there s little they can do to prevent the broad climate change impacts from burning fuels extracted from the remaining parcels that s in part because they can t discern the significance of emissions from government owned fuel reserves versus other sources officials wrote in newly released documents the determination applies to lease sales planned early next year in wyoming colorado montana utah nevada new mexico north dakota and other states blm has limited decision authority to meaningfully or measurably prevent the cumulative climate change impacts that would result from global emissions agency officials wrote in their montana lease proposal similar statements were included in documents released for sales in other states the leasing plans could change as the administration continues to analyze greenhouse gas emissions and their effects on people and the environment administration officials said tuesday the land bureau plans to defer leasing on almost 600 square miles 1550 square kilometers in wyoming 213 square miles 550 square kilometers in colorado and 5 square miles 14 square kilometers in montana because of potential impacts to a struggling bird species the greater sage grouse and migrating pronghorn antelope still wyoming has the most land up for new leasing roughly 280 square miles 725 square kilometers the so called social costs of emissions from burning oil and gas from all the parcels including more natural disasters crop losses and public health problems due to climate change are projected to range from 630 million to about 7 billion according to land bureau documents the administration s decision not to cite the climate costs as a reason to limit leases frustrates environmental activists and others who have urged curbs in government fossil fuel sales they said it undermined the president s participation in the u n climate summit in glasgow where biden and other world leaders on tuesday pledged to cut emissions of methane a byproduct of drilling harvard university economics professor james stock said it was confusing for the administration to put a dollar value to greenhouse emissions but then assert that such impacts are impossible to discern because of the global nature of climate change to say it s too hard they can t do that that s simply not true all of those calculations have been done stock said this is very surprising to me and inconsistent with the biden administration s climate goals similar determinations that u s fossil fuel lease sales should not be sharply restricted over global warming concerns were made under former presidents donald trump and barack obama this seems to be is business as usual jeremy nichols with the environmental group wildearth guardians said of the upcoming lease sales it flies in the face of scientists finding that any more fossil fuel production is unacceptable and countries need to find ways to limit production republicans and petroleum industry representatives were quick to slam biden last week when he announced plans to analyze greenhouse gas emissions the decision not to directly address them reinforces that stopping development of federal lands would have little impact on climate change said kathleen sgamma with the western energy alliance an industry trade group stopping all leasing and development on federal lands would have zero impact on climate change as the production is simply displaced to nonfederal lands or to opec or other foreign producers sgamma said studies by independent experts have concluded that some but not all reduced drilling on federal lands and waters would be offset by crude imports approvals to drill on leased u s owned lands surged toward the end of trump s presidency as companies stockpiled permits that continued when biden first took office before slowing in recent months figures released tuesday showed 261 drilling permits approved in september compared to more than 800 during trump s last full month in office land bureau officials said in the leasing documents that their regulatory authority was limited to activities tied directly to oil and gas development not the subsequent burning of the fuels instead they propose curbing emissions by addressing methane leaks from oil field activities and other avenues additional measures to reduce methane emissions from drilling were announced tuesday by the environmental protection agency next year s lease sale will be the first by the bureau since biden suspended the program just a week after taking office as part of his plan to address climate change the administration in june was ordered to resume the sales by a federal judge in louisiana who said interior officials offered no rational explanation for canceling them attorneys general from 13 states sued the administration saying the suspension would cost the states money and jobs ___ follow matthew brown on twitter matthewbrownap

by matt egan cnn business democrats want to tax stock buybacks to help pay for president joe biden s 1 75 trillion spending plan billionaire investor charlie munger isn t happy about it i think it s insane literally insane munger the right hand man of legendary investor warren buffett told cnn in an interview the build back better framework released by the white house last week promises the ambitious economic and climate agenda will be fully paid for in part by imposing a 1 surcharge on corporate stock buybacks but munger the 97 year old vice chairman of buffett s berkshire hathaway worries this plan represents a slippery slope it s so irrational and i think it sort of destroys the whole system once you start tinkering from washington said munger who describes himself as a republican companies frequently return extra cash to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks wall street loves buybacks because they simultaneously boost demand for shares and limit supply they also inflate per share profits a key metric that drives stock prices added bonus buybacks can be turned on and off more easily than dividends berkshire hathaway buffett s holding company spent 24 7 billion on stock buybacks last year alone under the democrats proposed buyback tax berkshire would have owed 247 million to uncle sam on those purchases i don t think the dividend policies of american corporations ought to be determined from washington munger told cnn the biden administration fired back after munger s criticism we have had an economy based on tax breaks and tax evasion by billionaires for decades that strategy has failed as the 2017 tax giveaway to the wealthy and corporations demonstrated and buybacks long have been used to increase executive compensation at the expense of our middle class a white house official told cnn in response to munger s comments president biden instead believes we should shift to supporting families getting to work and getting ahead we understand why some billionaires might be disappointed buffett ceos have an embarrassing record critics of buybacks argue that some companies have abused them to the detriment of american workers and the broader economy the white house framework for build back better says corporate executives often use buybacks to enrich themselves rather than investing workers and growing the economy in 2017 when taxes were cut substantially you did not see any surge in investment spending treasury secretary janet yellen told lawmakers at a hearing last month instead what you saw was a surge in stock buybacks business spending on factories equipment and software did not live up to the hype following the 2017 tax cuts by early 2019 bank of america declared it the investment boom that wasn t companies including general electric and sears have been criticized for blowing billions of dollars on buybacks at inflated prices only to later face cash crises even buffett himself has been critical of excessive buybacks american ceos have an embarrassing record of devoting more company funds to repurchases when prices have risen than when they have tanked buffett wrote in his 2020 annual report yet the oracle of omaha is a big believer in buybacks done at the right price because they shrink the number of outstanding shares allowing investors to own bigger pieces of companies the process offers a simple way for investors to own an ever expanding portion of exceptional businesses buffett wrote munger no reason to remove jerome powell from the fed munger also told cnn he s in favor of federal reserve chairman jerome powell getting four more years at the helm of the us central bank if i were president i d reappoint him munger said i regard him as very intelligent very honorable and did the very best job he could i see no reason to change him the white house hasn t said whether or not president biden will reappoint powell whose term expires in february democratic senator elizabeth warren is urging biden to replace powell who she recently called a dangerous man as fed chair warren argued the powell led central bank has been soft on regulating wall street munger said warren is wrong about powell adding the fed chairman has been okay on regulation yet munger does support the need to keep a close eye on banks and wall street firms here i am a republican i agree with senator warren that there ought to be more regulation of our financial institutions munger said we kind of overdid it the berkshire hathaway executive described himself as an admirer of the fed s response to the pandemic in march 2020 the central bank dropped interest rates to zero promised to buy 120 billion worth of bonds every month and rolled out a series of emergency programs that successfully unfroze credit markets the federal reserve did a magnificent job when the covid thing came munger said yet munger was critical of the stimulus plans enacted by congress and both the trump and biden administrations i think we kind of overdid it a little bit in retrospect munger said we made some of the benefits for the working people so great that they stay home instead of going back to work i think that was a mistake the united states has a near record number of job openings and businesses have struggled to hire workers but it s not clear that enhanced jobless benefits are to blame the labor force shrank in september even though beefed up unemployment payments expired that month and many republican run states had dropped those benefits earlier in the summer we needed the stimulus and don t like the worker shortage it s a problem munger said god knows how you do it exactly right we re stumbling through as best we can democracies will have big problems with inflation in the longer run munger expressed concern about governments fanning the flames of inflation just as i expect that all human beings will die i expect that in due course all democracies will have big problems with inflation he said because the politicians try and buy votes by spending money that s what happens eventually that s what happened in the roman empire the current period of inflation has been stronger and lasted longer than many anticipated this is the early harbinger of eventual trouble munger said munger really doesn t like spacs asked if he would consider investing in the spac special purpose acquisition company that former president donald trump s media entity is merging with munger said no i never invest in spacs munger said i hate spacs i think they reflect discredit on humanity in february the berkshire executive warned that the surge in popularity of spacs is an irritating bubble and the world would be better off without them what if trump s media company went public through a traditional ipo i wouldn t hate it as much a spac munger said the cnn wire 2021 cable news network inc a warnermedia company all rights reserved
the french ambassador has denounced the australian government s release of a private text message from emmanuel macron as an unprecedented new low arguing other world leaders would now worry their words might be weaponised against them jean pierre thébault said the leaking of the text message from the french president was a setback in terms of truth and trust and it would be sad if this was the australian government s answer to france s request for concrete actions to heal the relationship the australian prime minister scott morrison told reporters in dubai on wednesday he would never make any apologies for scrapping the french contract to deliver submarines that were not going to do the job that australia needed to do morrison did not dispute a suggestion that his office had leaked the text message simply saying claims had been made and those claims were refuted what is needed now is for us to move on the extraordinary rift between australia and france flows from macron s accusation that morrison lied to him over plans with the us and the uk to acquire nuclear propelled submarines as a replacement for the 90bn french project morrison rejected macron s claim and several australian media outlets then reported that the french president had texted the australian prime minister two days before the aukus announcement in mid september to ask should i expect good or bad news for our joint submarines ambitions thébault said far from backing the australian government s position that it had been candid with france about its changing needs the text demonstrates that until the last minute we didn t know where things were heading to the french ambassador told the national press club in canberra the leak of the text would not help build confidence to repair the relationship this is an unprecedented new low in terms of how to proceed and also in terms of truth and trust thébault said you don t behave like this on personal exchanges of leaders who are allies but maybe it s just confirmation that we were never seen as an ally but doing so also sends a very worrying signal for all heads of state beware in australia there will be leaks and what you say in confidence to your partners will be eventually used and weaponised against you one day asked whether morrison should apologise to macron a suggestion made by former prime minister malcolm turnbull the ambassador said the us had taken concrete steps to mend ties over what joe biden called the clumsy handling of the aukus partnership thébault said eating humble pie may sometimes be difficult and it was up to everyone to make his own decision the deputy prime minister barnaby joyce defended the release of the text message suggesting macron had triggered that action by claiming morrison had lied it is not as extraordinary as calling the leader of another country a liar when they re not joyce told abc tv the french ambassador was recalled to paris in september after australia scrapped a 90bn french deal in order to launch an 18 month study with the us and the uk on acquiring nuclear propelled submarines having now returned to canberra thébault said the morrison government had acted in a way that was out of this world and not befitting of friends and he questioned whether any other partner could now trust the value of australia s signature and commitment thébault also raised doubts about whether australia s new partnership with the us and the uk would deliver nuclear propelled submarines quickly enough magical thinking will not change the facts and he said australia would be scrutinised by the rest of the world over its very specific responsibilities arguing the deal could have implications in terms of our common efforts to strengthen nonproliferation norms france will always be a close and loyal friend of australia he said no artificial wedge despite attempts can be put between our people if there is a problem today it is with certain aspects of the canberra bubble and its secret city practices thébault said the defence and foreign ministers of france and australia met just two weeks before aukus was announced with both sides agreeing to a joint statement that underlined the importance of the future submarine program do you agree on such a joint communique when there is the slightest doubt on something so massive as the official backbone of our cooperation maybe on mars but not on this planet thébault said thébault suggested that the reason the australian government did not want to be explicit was explained by morrison on 16 september when the prime minister said there was never any certainty that the aukus process would result in a deal thébault said that meant it was deemed necessary to keep open the possibility of continuing the french submarine program and so it was mandatory to keep us in the dark on the backburner arguing the deceit was intentional thébault said because there was far more at stake than providing submarines because it was a common agreement on sovereignty sealed with the transmission of highly classified data the way it was handled was a stab in the back he acknowledged that the australian government would make its own decisions when it came to national security but the way this australian government decided to turn its back on our solemn and far reaching partnership without ever frankly consulting with france when there were countless opportunities without having shared frankly and openly its thoughts or without having looked for alternatives with france is just out of this world thébault said alarm bells should have rung on the likely consequences and if it was the case and they were disregarded it is even worse sign up to receive the top stories from guardian australia every morning thébault said the naval group backed project to deliver 12 conventional submarines had not been troubled or suffered cost blowouts despite an intensive smearing campaign about the program

brattleboro we ve all been to diners but we guarantee you ve never been to a diner like this a brattleboro treasure for more than 30 years t j buckley s is so exceptional that our three hour round trip car ride from dorset was more than worth it this dining experience has it all the history the setting the food the chef the service all extraordinary as soon as you walk into an intimate and charming 1920s worcester dining car restored to its vintage glory you know you are in for a unique evening of fine dining and pure pleasure in about 400 square feet sit seven or so tables each graced by a simple white dahlia in an open kitchen of half that size the brilliance of owner chef michael fuller is on display right before your eyes it all works to perfection chef michael began learning

states in keeping with that tradition chef michael locally sources whenever possible including cheese from parish hill in westminster and seafood from adam s in brattleboro t j buckley s is an opportunity to savor world class dining that is seasonal organic healthy and yes absolutely delicious all you have to do at t j buckley s is choose your dinner from a verbal menu because each evening s choices are dependent upon available local ingredients then sit back and let it unfold before you we began with an onion pepper and parmesan bread from orchard hill farms in east alstead brought to us by our delightfully well informed servers effie and amy who worked the room gracefully and efficiently this tastebud wake up along with a crisp and flavorful pouilly fuisse from domaine cheveau at a reasonable 52 paired well with what was yet to come several starters ranging in price from 12 to 22 are artwork on a plate the evening we were there the choices included a country pate with pommery mustard and homemade peach rhubarb fig chutney mostly from chef michael s garden a crab cake with shrimp accompanied by a garlic aioli a smoked trout and chevre tart served with roast corn creme

fussy you soon realize that this is a meal you cannot prepare at home it feels special because it is we had halibut something we rarely order because it too often is dry or tasteless seared and steamed with an incredible calasparra rice mixed with vermont shepherd cheese local sweet corn and charred scallions topped off with a shellfish dashi we weren t familiar with dashi but learned that it is a family of stocks used in japanese cuisine such as the base for miso soup it is meant to accentuate the savory flavor known as umami we have never experienced halibut that tasted as good as this did our other main was seared sea scallops served atop a stone ground polenta cake with local greens artichoke maitake mushrooms and an optional crispy pork belly which we thoroughly enjoyed the creative combination of these uncommon flavors was remarkably coordinated to deliver a most satisfying and pleasant package for the palate since the tables are obviously close to one another

houston nov 3 the american petroleum institute api has reported an increase of 3 594 million barrels of crude oil in us inventories for the week ending october 29 analysts on tuesday had expected an increase of about 1 567 million barrels for the week the api reported a surge of 2 318 million barrels in the previous week xinhua news agency reported oil prices ended mixed on tuesday as traders are awaiting us fuel stocks data and a key meeting of the organization of the petroleum exporting countries and its allies collectively known as opec the west texas intermediate for december delivery lost 14 cents to settle at 83 91 us a barrel on the new york mercantile exchange brent crude for january delivery increased 1 cent to close at 84 72 a barrel on the london ice futures exchange the us energy information administration is set to release its weekly petroleum status report on wednesday while opec is expected to meet on thursday discussing its plan on crude production despite growing pressure from the major oil consuming countries the alliance is expected to stick to its plan for gradual monthly production increase of 4 00 000 barrels per day according to analysts
climate change poses challenges for financial markets and economy many policy institutions across the world have recognised these challenges and have been discussing how to update their mandates accordingly for instance the ecb 2021 has stated that it is committed to reflect environmental sustainability considerations in its monetary policy similarly the bank of england 2021 defines its objective as to play a leading role through its policies and operations in ensuring the financial system the macro economy and the bank of england are resilient to the risks from climate change and supportive of the transition to a net zero economy see also the statements by brunetti et al 2021 of the federal reserve these statements indicate that in near future the financial regulatory framework will go through an important change to incorporate the climate change if not it is already happening one agreement policymakers have reached about the climate change is that it is a global problem in line with this agreement several central banks and supervisors established the network for greening the financial system in 2017 with the purpose of helping to strengthen the global response required to meet the goals of the paris agreement network for greening the financial system 2021 despite this effort there is still a large heterogeneity across countries in terms of climate policy stringency in figure 1 we plot the levels of the climate change performance index ccpi developed by germanwatch at the country level the map lays bare the fact that countries have different levels of climate policy stringency this heterogeneity can be an important factor in the fight against climate change since it may allow firms to circumvent the higher climate policy stringency in their home country by shifting their operations to less stringent countries supporting this concern bartram et al 2021 document that financially constrained firms shifted emissions and output from california to other us states after the introduction of cap and trade programme in california figure 1 country averages of climate policy note countries with no colour shade are not part of the sample in a recent paper benincasa et al 2021 we analyse whether banks exploit this heterogeneity in climate policy stringency across countries more specifically we investigate whether banks use cross border lending to react to higher climate policy stringency in their home countries from the literature we know that cross border lending is an important transmitter of shocks among countries cetorelli and goldberg 2011 giannetti and laeven 2012 ongena et al 2015 claessens 2017 hale et al 2020 doerr and schaz 2021 therefore banks may increase their cross border lending when faced with more stringent climate policy in their home country we find that banks do indeed react to greater climate policy stringency in their home country by increasing their cross border lending as an illustration of our findings figure 2 shows a strong positive relationship between cross border loan ratios on bank balance sheets and home country climate policy stringency our regression analysis suggests a large effect banks increase their shares in cross border syndicated loans by 10 if policy of their home country increases by same level experienced in the us between 2007 and 2017 overall our results depict a clear picture in which banks use cross border lending as a regulatory arbitrage tool against climate policies which may reduce the effectiveness of such policies figure 2 home country climate policy and cross border bank lending as indicated before our measure of climate policy stringency is the ccpi developed by germanwatch e v with the aim of tracking efforts to combat climate change in 57 countries and the eu as argued by delis et al 2019 a measure for the stringency of country climate policy should account for both the ambition and the effort of the government policy itself the former is measured by the efficiency of the policy while the latter is measured by the effectiveness of the policy in reaching specific outcomes therefore providing a complete picture of countries climate protection action efforts the ccpi has been employed by other studies to measure countries climate policy stringency delis et al 2019 atanasova and schwartz 2019 lin et al 2020 the ccpi comes with two main advantages first being a weighted average of 14 different climate policy indicators the ccpi is a broad and inclusive assessment of the countries climate policy stringency second it facilitates climate policy comparison of countries with different backgrounds as it summarises the differences with one metric we combine the ccpi with syndicated loan data which we use to assess bank cross border lending syndicated loans are one of the main tools for cross border lending de haas and van horen 2013 in addition syndicated loans make cross border lending easier for smaller banks too as the lead arranger of a syndicated loan can take actions to reduce the information asymmetries therefore a combination of the ccpi series and syndicated loan data provides us with a relevant setting to investigate whether banks alter their cross border lending to react to a change in climate policy stringency a regression model in which shares in cross border loans are regressed on ccpi can account for the effects of loan demand and other country level variables in addition to the effect of ccpi for instance observing an increase in the ccpi of a country a firm may increase its loan demand to the banks from that country this can occur as the firm may want to use the relationship with a bank from a high ccpi country as a signalling device similarly this increase in loan demand can be driven by firm s desire to increase its knowledge in efforts against climate change and a lending relationship with this bank can provide this knowledge these arguments imply that without properly controlling for loan demand the relationship between the ccpi and cross border lending cannot be interpreted in terms of the loan supply in our preferred specification we control for all loan demand driven aspects such as borrowers and loans characteristics and identify an effect that reflects banks loan supply in addition to the loan demand country level characteristics that are correlated with both climate policy stringency and cross border lending can create a bias in our estimations for instance an improvement in economic conditions can lead to an increase in both the ccpi and cross border lending or a change in demographics of the country can affect the ccpi by altering the perception of the climate change and cross border lending by affecting loan demand to mitigate such concerns we collect information about country level economic conditions culture legal environment and demographics and include these variables into our models our results do not change when we control for these variables we find evidence supportive of the aforementioned mechanism i e the increase in cross border lending is driven by a regulatory arbitrage by exploiting the heterogeneity among the lenders first we document that the positive effect of climate policy stringency on cross border lending occurs only if the home country of the lender has a more stringent climate policy compared with the borrower s country this finding indicates that the banks use the cross border lending as a device to mitigate the effects of the climate policy since it shows that banks increase their cross border lending selectively second we find that banks that are expected to engage with cross border lending as a reaction to climate policy stringency are indeed the ones who are more likely to do so for instance the magnitude of the effect is significantly larger for the banks that have higher cross border loans in their books and for banks that face a higher non performing loans ratio npl a higher cross border loans ratio implies that the bank has more experience with cross border lending which means that it is easier for this bank to use cross border lending to react to changes in domestic climate policy stringency a higher npl ratio creates a stronger incentive for the bank to engage with cross border lending since more stringent climate policy can reduce the returns of the loans when the bank needs a higher return rate due to the high npl ratio we continue our analysis by examining which category of the ccpi is more important for the cross border lending the ccpi has four categories greenhouse gas emissions renewable energy energy use and climate policy estimating horse race regression models that includes these four categories we find that climate policy is the most important category for cross border lending this implies that banks react to the actual measures taken by the respective domestic governments instead of the realised outcomes of these measures in terms of emissions for example this finding also lends support to our interpretation that the underlying mechanism of our findings is capturing regulatory arbitrage overall our paper provides two main new insights first banks may be taking actions to reduce the influence of climate policy stringency on their loan portfolio second the heterogeneity in climate policy stringency among countries can induce cross border lending due to regulatory arbitrage opportunities it creates which indicates that lack of homogeneity in the regulations for climate change can reduce the effectiveness of such
