roosevelt room 4 34 p m edt the president you re not out in the rain with the halloweeners q yeah the president well i got to go out so you got to come with me laughs q we ll be there the president well good afternoon this is a very short statement but a consequential one in my view putin s invasion of ukraine in march set gas prices soaring literally around the world not just here but around the world and because of the action we ve taken since then gas prices have actually come down going into the strategic petroleum reserve here at home in america they re down more than 1 20 since their peak this summer and they ve been falling for the best of best part of the last three weeks in june the average price not the most common price but the average price nationwide was was over 5 a gallon today the average price for a gallon of gas is 3 76 that s adding up to real savings for american families the difference between those prices and this difference makes a difference in a difficult time americans across the country have stepped up and they to do the right thing but not everyone has stepped up the oil industry has not has not met its commitment to invest in america and support the american people one by one major oil companies have reported record profits not just a fair return on for hard work every company is entitled to that a fair return for the work they do or innovation they generate it means but i mean profits so high it s hard to believe now the second quarter of the profits were really high but the third quarter last week shell announced that it made 9 5 billion in profits for the third quarter 9 5 billion that s almost twice as much as it made in the third quarter of last year i think that s something you think that s incredible i thought my that s as good as as high as it s going to get then along came exxon exxon s profits for the third quarter were at 18 7 billion one quarter 18 7 billion nearly triple what exxon made last year and the most in its 152 year history it s never made that much profit in the last six months six of the largest oil companies have made more than 100 billion 100 billion and we had a little discussion about this the three of us and others one hundred billion in profits in two less than 200 days that s not bad and here s why this here s why this matters i think it s outrageous what their the the size of the profit here s why it matters if these companies were making average profits they ve been making by refining oil over the last 20 years instead of the outrageous profits they re making today and if they passed the rest on to the consumers the price of gas would come down around an additional 50 cents if they re investing their profits in the historic at historic rates in their u s operations then america would be producing more oil today and prices would be down even further but rather than increasing their investments in america or giving american consumers a break their excess profits are going back to their shareholders and to buying back their stock so the executive pay is are going to skyrocket give me a break enough is enough look i m a capitalist you ve heard me say this before i have no problem with corporations turning a fair profit or getting the return on their investment and innovation but this isn t remotely what s happening oil companies record profits today are not because they re doing something new or innovative their profits are a windfall of war the windfall from the brutal conflict that s ravaging ukraine and hurting tens of millions of people around the globe you know at a time of war any company receiving historic windfall profits like this has a responsibility to act beyond their narrow self interest of its executives and shareholders i think they have a responsibility to act in the interest of their consumers their community and their country to invest in america by increasing production and refining capacity because they they don t want to do that they they have the opportunity to do that lowering prices for consumers at the pump you know if they don t they re going to pay a higher tax on their excess profits and face other restrictions my team will work with congress to look at these op these options that are available to us and others it s time for these companies to stop war profiteering meet their responsibilities to this country and give the american people a break and still do very well the american people are going to judge who s standing with them and who is only looking out for their own bottom line i know where i stand and i want to let the i m going to hear more from me about this when the congress gets back thank you all very very much appreciate it q mr president how was your call with president lula today mr president how was your call with lula from brazil today mr president the president what q your your call with lula from brazil the president elect how was it the president it went very well we re putting a team together to get together and discuss what what we can do together he wants to focus on the environment democracy and dealing with the poor in his country and saving the

news and opinion how to spend 400 billion president biden s 400 billion student loan bailout is a startling amount to consider but those who could get the generous federal aid may not be interested in spending the money on higher education there is insight on current attitudes and there s a poll of course and it s specific to find how recipients would use the extra money they would have each month we surveyed 1 250 individuals who have applied or plan to apply for biden s student loan forgiveness program said intelligent com which has released a telling report on their findings the report found that 73 of applicants say they likely would spend their extra money on nonessential goods including vacations smartphones drugs and alcohol in addition some respondents said they would spend the money on stock market investments gifts or wedding plans the news is not completely negative though the would be recipients also said they would use the funds for groceries rent or mortgage credit card debt medical care or child care men are more likely than women to spend the money on nonessentials 84 vs 65 while another 4 in 10 say student loans haven t hurt their lives in the first place the online survey was conducted oct 20 by intelligent com a seattle based organization that produces ad free data based guides to colleges internship opportunities and other topics for the lexicon blue state panic this handy little term comes from mike berg deputy communications director for the national republican congressional committee with just days until the election republicans are going on offense in deep blue districts mr berg said in a statement to inside the beltway he noted that the tactic is forcing democrats to spend their resources in house districts where residents voted for president biden by a wide margin rather than in swing districts nbc news offered a quick takeaway on the phenomenon the crush of last minute spending in deep blue states and democratic strongholds detailed through data from the ad tracking firm adimpact underscores just how much the political winds have shifted in republicans favor and how the gop buoyed by well funded super pacs has expanded the battlefield in the final sprint of the campaign the network said in an analysis released sunday hungry for normal lockdowns masks financial worries city violence social upheavals these worrisome events have been fixtures for quite some time it is not surprising that many people would like a little peace and common sense now and then americans are hungry for normalcy and they re not going to get it from democrats many voted for president joe biden hoping for this return to normal but much of biden s presidency and his democratic party s direction is a rejection of all rationality and embrace of fringe figures and ideas writes karol markowicz an editorial columnist for the new york post she cites persistent and disconcerting inflation and culture war issues as factor that have threatened the everyday sense of security or peace among americans along with reluctance among certain democrats to even say that crime is an important issue we can t go on like this anymore we can t start from debating whether crime matters or whether it even exists we need to move on and elect people dedicated to fighting it there are two distinct roads here and we have to choose one ms markowicz advises we ve been in the upside down where lax crime policies insane school programs and so much more have been winning the day a red wave will mean americans demand a different direction it will mean we tried the leftist ideas declared them failures and want to try something else it will mean a return to something better back to the normal we have longed for and deserves she concludes

one of the things you need to prepare for when you ve reached your retirement age is your will it is a document that lists all your properties and assets and how you want them to be distributed when you re no longer here while it might seem too soon to think about this uncomfortable topic it s still something that needs to be carefully planned to make everyone s life a little easier as they handle the grief of losing a loved one in that sense it s good to know what things your children might or might not actually want to see as a part of their inheritance preparing a list of things you want your kids to inherit might save you a lot of time especially when you have a lot of things in mind that you want to pass on to them you might think that your collection of plates and curtains might be an ideal inheritance to give but they might not be the things that your kids expect to receive nor want it s not that including these items as a form of inheritance is bad but there s a high chance that they will only end up disposing of them especially when they do not serve a specific purpose if you want to make your children s life a little bit easier if you pass away unexpectedly here are 12 things that they might actually want to inherit 1 cash cash is the classic and ideal asset to hand down to your kids it s convenient and easy to access and you can earn interest over time if you have it in a savings account additionally it provides a great deal of ease as cash can be easily divided depending on how many people will receive it and how much each one will have this can make splitting the inheritance easier and avoid conflict between siblings 2 an annuity an annuity is a great asset to pass down to your children inherited annuities have several advantages like tax benefits especially if they re non qualified annuities you paid for with after tax dollars by annuitizing an annuity your children can convert it into a steady and dependable income stream to help cover their living expenses either for a predefined period of time or for life if the original annuity contract was set up as a multy life annuity one reason why your kids might want to inherit cash is because of how versatile it is they can use it to buy anything they want or invest it to make it grow cash also provides an easy way to send money to others and share their wealth they can even share and send cash to a friend if they ever need to for example they may invest it in other assets like properties or stocks or even a personal enterprise which will provide an opportunity for your children to earn income from their inheritance this freedom of use and flexibility make cash the first thing your kids will want to inherit an annuity is a great asset to pass down to your children inherited annuities have several advantages like tax benefits especially if they re non qualified annuities you paid for with after tax dollars by annuitizing an annuity your children can convert it into a steady and dependable income stream to help cover their living expenses either for a predefined period of time or for life if the original annuity contract was set up as a multy life annuity while annuities like the ones mentioned above can be financially complicated to set up and also quite expensive they do offer simplicity for your heirs 3 recipes besides the pleasure of each others company there s a reason why the family flocks together at grandma s house during the holidays no matter how far they are and that s because of the sumptuous food that tastes like no other whether it s a secret recipe for your classic stuffed turkey or the chocolate chip cookies your grandkids line up for every weekend your kids will definitely be happy to receive a cookbook full of all their favorite recipes with annotations and footnotes with all your little culinary secrets it is both a sentimental and useful inheritance to have and it preserves the tradition within the family even when you are no longer around to make the food you ll be surprised how many successful restaurants and gastronomic products started with grandma s recipe that comfort food feeling you get when you taste your mother s food isn t easily replicated when it comes to good food that only the hands of a parent can make a record of how it s done is worth having and passing down 4 family photos as much as your kids may look like they only enjoy things that have monetary value there are many things that they ll consider worth having and old family photos are one of them while today we have thousands of pictures on our mobile phones it s still nice for kids to have something tangible like an old fashioned polaroid photo that captures moments that are worth keeping for a lifetime photos never fail to remind someone of something beautiful that has happened in the past even when they are no longer there to rekindle that moment having a physical photograph that your kids know you held in your hands that you had in a real photo album is something they ll value and cherish for life 5 trust funds a trust fund is a type of asset that helps your kids manage their inheritances wisely if you are going to be handing them down a huge amount of money and perhaps a couple of properties there s a chance that conflicts may arise other people might file for a claim on those assets or your kids might end up fighting among themselves even if they don t they could splurge and dilapidate all their inheritance through reckless spending on useless things the biggest perk of setting up a trust fund for your kids is that it allows them to properly allocate the money over different uses so that they don t go about spending it on things that do not matter you can also set it up so your loved ones will only have access to the money at a certain age and point in time they probably won t like these limitations at first but they ll definitely be thankful once they re more mature and realize the value of investing in the future 6 furniture believe it or not your kids may be interested in inheriting your furniture as well especially if it s something different and hard to find accent pieces that are timeless and fit the interior of almost any house many are definitely worth keeping and it can save your kids a couple of hundred dollars when they re moving to a new apartment or house 7 vinyl records besides the great music they contain vinyl records are also collectible items that only gain value as time passes do you have an original jimmy hendricks album from the 70s that s in pristine condition i m sure your vintage loving millennial kids will be more than happy to keep it for years to come if your child grew up listening to vinyl records that have become a collection in the family chances are they ll want to have them nothing beats a classic pink floyd or the beatles vinyl to take a trip down memory lane and your kids will be more than happy to know that you have these records ready for them to take in the future just like photos music can evoke pleasant memories and it s always a good decision to leave something for your kids that will serve as a memento of the things you loved doing back in the day your children and loved ones will certainly thank you for this and they ll still have a piece of you with them even after you have passed on 8 life insurance if you want to leave money for your children but worry that the taxes might take a big chunk of it life insurance is a viable option the main purpose of applying for life insurance is to avoid your family facing financial difficulties relative to your passing because of the tax free feature of life insurance policies it s a great idea to set one up with your children as beneficiaries when the time comes and the funds are available they will be able to receive the amount in full and you ll have achieved your goal of leaving something valuable for your family without any deductions 9 real estate after working hard all your life you may have acquired some valuable properties these could be the best thing you could ever leave for your kids real estate assets are a safe investment that has historically grown throughout the years so passing these properties down to your kids is a surefire way to protect their financial future additionally if the property or properties you leave behind are something that stores shared memories your kids will feel more connected with this inheritance 10 a business a family business is a common asset often passed down to children as an inheritance sometimes while parents are still alive an established business is a great inheritance because it not only has monetary value upfront but it s also a source of steady income this alone can mean your kids will be set up for life financially when you re no longer around to provide for them this can be invaluable you should take this with a grain of salt though because businesses can fail as much as they can thrive depending on how they re managed so make sure that the enterprise you are leaving behind is not something that has acquired debts through the years but is profitable and will provide the children with a steady income teaching your kids how to run a business from an early age will prepare them for the unlikely scenario that they may need to take care of your family business soon 11 brokerage accounts another form of financial inheritance that is not cash but that can provide long term value is a brokerage account these include stocks and bonds that you can start trading while you are still alive then delegate to your children over time as the account s value rises one of the best things about having these brokerage accounts is how easily divisible they are if you have several children to whom you want to leave the stocks you can easily divide the assets among them stocks are also easy to liquidate or convert into cash so if your kids ever need money they can simply sell them through the brokerage account 12 quality education fund quality education isn t cheap in america students are often caught up in student loans by the time they graduate and rather than spending the rest of their lives doing amazing things and checking things off their bucket lists your children might have to work for a long time to pay off those debts this is why educational savings plans are a great inheritance for your children not only will it save them from years of financial struggle but it will also give them a chance to take on career paths they re passionate about in the us you ll find options like the 529 plan you can apply for to save up enough money for your children s future education depending on which variation of the plan you get you will have to pay varying amounts and your children will also be entitled to an array of benefits the bottom line death isn t something most people like to think about and it s definitely not something most people are comfortable planning for however putting your children s happiness and well being on the table puts things into perspective this is why you must start thinking of what you ll leave behind immediately in case of an unwanted and unexpected early departure these twelve inheritance ideas are just suggestions of what your kids will likely appreciate they ll make their lives a little easier and once they re mature enough to realize their true potential they ll be even happier to have them whether it is something that carries sentimental value or an actual financial asset that can be traded in exchange for cash what matters more is the underlying intention of leaving behind something that will help them out in times of need and remind them of you always after you re gone by jordan bishop

two election workers in georgia won a victory in federal court on monday as a judge declined to dismiss their defamation lawsuit filed against former new york city mayor and donald trump s longtime friend and erstwhile election attorney rudy giuliani filed in december 2021 ruby freeman and wandrea shaye moss allege that the man once known as america s mayor defamed them when he falsely claimed they had engaged in election fraud as ballot counters at the state farm arena in atlanta georgia as election workers across the state worked long hours carefully ensuring the accuracy of the election the trump campaign and its allies including giuliani engaged in a media offensive that at best questioned and at worse condemned their work u s district court for the district of columbia chief judge beryl a howell wrote in a 25 page opinion accompanying the order denying the motion to dismiss the opinion takes stock of the allegedly defamatory actions and giuliani s role in spreading that information around on december 3 plaintiffs who had been counting absentee ballots and participating in the recount in fulton county at the state farm arena were drawn into this offensive when trump campaign surrogates testified before the georgia senate alleging that fraud and misconduct had occurred during georgia s november 2020 election in support of their allegations a lawyer assisting the trump campaign played snippets of a state farm arena security camera video showing grainy images of two women later identified as plaintiffs counting ballots the trump campaign witnesses alleged that after republican observers had been asked to leave the arena in contravention of georgia law the women in the video clip and other election workers produced and counted 18 000 hidden fraudulent ballots the witness referred to suitcases of ballots under a table under a tablecloth and stated that one of the women in the video clip had the name ruby across her shirt somewhere but did not otherwise identify the women by name the same day the trump campaign repeated the same allegations on twitter sharing the edited video and tweet that it showed suitcases filled with ballots pulled from under a table after supervisors told poll workers to leave room and 4 people stayed behind to keep counting votes giuliani shared the trump campaign tweet repeatedly on his own twitter account on december 3 and 4 repeating the same caption as law crime previously reported moss is freeman s daughter giuliani went quite a bit further than the court s heavily annotated record suggests explaining away trump s narrow but decisive loss in the peach state by saying that moss handed her mother usb drives full of votes as if they were vials of heroin or cocaine in actuality moss handed her mother a ginger mint she told the january 6th committee in june of this year the mother and daughter sued the right wing one america news oan network and giuliani in a federal court in washington d c after receiving a bevy of death threats and racial harassment both women are black the lawsuit against oan was later settled but the one against giuliani will now move forward with discovery on the merits giuliani tried to have the lawsuit dismissed by arguing that he was engaged in constitutionally protected opinion the court rubbished that idea giuliani s alleged statements accuse plaintiffs of criminal activity which can be proven to be true or false in court and consequently he cannot seek refuge under the opinion doctrine howell wrote even if giuliani made clear that his statements were his own subjective views those statements still included accusations of election fraud that can be verified as true or false giuliani additionally attempted to have the lawsuit dismissed by claiming that it was barred by the statute of limitations that he did not specifically refer to the plaintiffs by name and because he was not the author of the statements in the so called strategic plan used by trump s post election loss team that made unfounded accusations of electoral fraud each of those arguments were also dismissed in turn giuliani s motion to dismiss is denied and the entirety of plaintiffs claims may advance to discovery the court concluded have a tip we should know
every good horror movie needs some sort of villain to pit its heroes against be it a chainsaw wielding maniac a demonic entity from another realm or simply mankind s own inner darkness but not all horror villains are created equal only some truly stand the test of time and manage to frighten and entertain moviegoers even decades after they originally debuted on the big screen with that in mind we re breaking down the 31 best and most terrifying horror movie villains of all time where do icons like the shining s jack torrance saw s jigsaw killer and the unstoppable michael myers clock in read on to find out the top 31 horror movie villains 32 images 31 the babadook now that he s become an unlikely lgbtq icon it s easy to forget just how terrifying the titular villain is in 2014 s the babadook this demonic entity haunts a single mother and her aggressively annoying child until both reach the breaking point between the children s book that just won t go away and that terrifying phone call the babadook has easily claimed his spot among the most memorable and frightening horror villains of the past decade 30 jigsaw never let it be said john kramer doesn t put in the work this prolific killer doesn t settle for just any old murder weapon he designs elaborate death traps that push victims to the limits of their endurance and sanity and unlike so many slasher villains jigsaw has a true method to his madness he wants his victims to appreciate life by fighting tooth and nail to stay alive jigsaw has so far appeared in eight of the nine saw movies 2021 s spiral being a spinoff focused on a copycat killer and while the series formula has definitely seen diminishing returns over time there s something about this villain that just clicks we ll find out if jigsaw still has his mojo when actor tobin bell returns in the upcoming tenth saw movie loading play 29 kevin wendell crumb after a string of increasingly disappointing duds in the 00s m night shyamalan roared back into top form with 2016 s split that s thanks in no small part to james mcavoy s terrifying scenery chewing performance as kevin wendell crumb an apparently innocuous zoo employee whose mind is home to 23 other alternate personalities reigning over all of them is the beast a seemingly superhuman monster who devours human flesh kevin and his other selves returned in 2019 s glass if not a particularly satisfying conclusion to shyamalan s unbreakable split trilogy at least it gives mcavoy another chance to bring this horrifying character to life 28 the entity it follows it follows cleverly revolves around a supernatural force that s basically a curse std once a person is infected they have to either pass it on to the next unlucky shmuck or spend the rest of their life running from a relentless killer what truly makes the entity so terrifying is the fact that it can look like anyone you never know when a random person down the hall in the street or on the bus might actually be death incarnate 27 frankenstein s monster mary shelley s frankenstein was an early classic of the horror genre and the book that many consider to be the dawn of science fiction it s little wonder that dr victor frankenstein and his signature creation have appeared in so many film adaptations while the first frankenstein movie appeared way back in 1910 it s universal s 1931 adaptation that remains the most iconic boris karloff defined the look of this lumbering fearsome monster as well capturing all the tragedy that makes him such an enduring character in pop culture frankenstein s monster has appeared in dozens of movies over the decades and inspired countless more 26 norman bates norman bates is the proprietor of the bates motel a seemingly innocent little inn that holds great danger for any who stop for the night bates severe psychological problems make him prone to spying on guests stabbing them in the shower and dressing up like his dead mother bates was brought to justice at the end of the original psycho one of alfred hitchcock s best but he returned in several sequels a remake and the very successful tv series bates motel it s hard to top the original but bates remains a charismatic and disturbing villain whether he s played by anthony perkins vince vaughn or freddie highmore 25 damien thorn if the omen series proved anything it s that children can be just as creepy as adult villains like norman bates damien is the central antagonist of the omen series he happens to be the anti christ a fact which most of the adults in his life discover far too late even as a young boy damien was sending his enemies plummeting to their deaths and generally getting in good practice for the day he would seize control of the world his reign of terror and legacy were explored in three sequels and a recent remake 24 the creeper the creeper more than lives up to his name in the jeepers creepers series this villain might look like a man at first glance but he s actually an ancient demon who appears for 23 days every 23rd spring to feast on human flesh and assemble himself a new body from the various body parts he also drives a massive truck that has become as much a hallmark of the franchise as anything else the creeper returned in a 2003 sequel and the word is that mgm has given writer director victor salva the go ahead to film a back to back pair of sequels the creeper should be feasting on human flesh for a long time to come 23 annabelle the conjuring series has several demonic entities and ghosts who could easily qualify for this list but we have to give the nod to annabelle the most unsettling movie doll this side of chucky heck even if annabelle did nothing in these movies but stare creepily from inside her protective glass case she d be the stuff of nightmares but after stealing the show in the original conjuring annabelle and the demon housed in her porcelain frame have gone on to star in a very successful spinoff series it s probably only a matter of time before she returns in annabelle 4 the conjuring movies in chronological order 9 images 22 the armitage family few things are scarier than the prospect of visiting your significant other s family for the first time but get out shows just how horribly wrong that ordeal can go this clever racially charged psychological horror film follows daniel kaluuya s chris as he meets the armitage family they might initially come across as a bunch of well meaning but casually racist yuppies but by the end it becomes clear the armitages are as deadly and inhuman as any chainsaw wielding slasher villain 21 ghostface with the 70s and 80s playing host to so many great horror movie villains it seemed liked hollywood had nothing left to add by the time the 90s rolled around cue ghostface the villain of the horror satire scream series ghostface is characterized by his signature halloween mask and proclivity for taunting his victims and drawing out the act of murder the twist is that ghostface isn t any one single villain instead each film centers around the mystery of who has donned the costume and renewed the process of killing young dumb pretty people that formula has given us four scream movies so far 20 candyman the candyman is a villain who will appeal to anyone who ever stood in a dark bathroom and whispered bloody mary into a mirror like that infamous ghost candyman is a vengeful killer who appears before anyone dumb enough to summon him he s distinguished by his tattered cloak and the hook that rests where his hand used to be however candyman is more than your average slasher villain he has a tragic backstory and the original movie is often praised for offering a more intelligent and thoughtful alternative to the nightmare on elm streets and friday the 13ths of the horror world best of all 2020 s candyman proves this character still has plenty of weight even decades after his debut loading play 19 samara morgan samara morgan and her japanese counterpart sadako yamamura is the demonic poster child for the ring series this twitchy creepy villainess appears to her victims seven days after they watch a cursed videotape we can t imagine many things worse than seeing samara crawl out of a tv screen and right into your living room and despite the attempts of the protagonists in the ring movies to put an end to the curse and quiet samara sadako s restless spirits these demonic girls just keep on killing 18 death final destination in most horror movies survival is about running out the clock until you re the last one standing but what if your enemy isn t a serial killer or angry spirit but death itself the final destination series has gotten a lot of mileage out of that simple premise these movies feature heroes who manage to avoid their imminent demise only for death to pull out all the stops to ensure fate unfolds as it s written the result is an increasingly elaborate series of gruesome over the top death scenes that have become the series true calling card 17 the poltergeist they re here the villains of poltergeist aren t physical monsters or serial killers but rather disembodied spirits that terrorize a hapless family these spirits are led by a dominating force called the beast that attempts to lure young carol ann freeling through the family s tv set and into the realm of the dead ultimately viewers learned that the restless spirits were angry that the freeling family home was built atop a burial ground later sequels served to complicate that arrangement and the nature of the beast itself but regardless the original continues to scare viewers who fear what they can t see the fact that the movie has built up a reputation over the years for being cursed itself doesn t hurt either 16 annie wilkes stephen king s novels don t always translate that well to the big screen but one could argue misery was tailor made for a film adaptation this deeply unsettling claustrophobic horror film thrives on the strength of kathy bates performance as annie wilkes a superfan so obsessed with james caan s romance novelist character that she breaks his legs and leaves him chained to a bed annie s peculiar mix of obsession and barely masked sadism makes her one of king s most haunting movie villains if anything she s only become more relevant with time as social media has kicked down the barriers between storytellers and fans the 12 best stephen king movies 13 images 15 chucky dolls are creepy it s something about their big glassy eyes and almost human features that rubs people the wrong way the child s play series played on that shared fear when it introduced the world to chucky reportedly inspired by hasbro s my buddy dolls chucky debuted as a talking doll with the peculiar ability to come to life and murder every adult that crossed his path as it turned out the doll was actually possessed by the soul of a serial killer voodoo enthusiast that particular spell proved to have significant staying power and chucky has returned to menace the children of the world in various sequels over the years he even got married and had a baby 14 regan macneil pazuzu ask anyone for their list of the scariest movies of all time and you re bound to find the exorcist high up in the rankings in this 1973 classic an innocent girl named regan begins displaying bizarre behavior that her mother and doctors initially blame on puberty puberty sucks but it doesn t explain floating furniture or the ability to spin one s neck 360 degrees regan s mother eventually realizes that her daughter has been possessed by a demon named pazuzu the demon is eventually driven out but it has a habit of returning again and again to torment regan and others in the various sequels and prequels none of those follow ups have the raw terrifying appeal of the original and its many iconic scenes of demonic possession the head spinning the soup barfing the spider walking etc 13 jack torrance jack torrance suffered from the world s worst case of cabin fever in this adaptation of the popular stephen king novel torrance along with hi wife wendy and son danny is hired to serve as winter caretaker to the famed overlook hotel unfortunately the hotel has a sordid past and is practically crawling with ghosts these spirits feed off of torrance s fragile psychology and his son s psychic talents growing stronger and more dangerous over the course of the winter before long torrance snapped and set about trying to murder his family with an ax he managed to kill the cook but ultimately torrance s fate was to freeze to death while lost in a hedge maze the shining is host to numerous scary scenes the bloody elevator the women in room 237 but torrance s appeal centers on the idea that even a good man can become a depraved killer once he s pushed far enough 12 the thing john w campbell s novel who goes there inspired the 1951 sci fi movie the thing from another world where a group of antarctic researchers battled a plant based alien life form however most horror fans know the thing as the titular monster in john carpenter s 1982 classic more faithful in tone and execution to campbell s novel the thing easily ranks among carpenter s scariest movies the scene of the thing consuming a room full of dogs and its inhuman scream upon being torched with fire still give us nightmares even today the fact that the monster rarely appeared in the flesh but rather disguised itself as various human characters only added to the creep factor even at the very end viewers can never be sure who is real and who had been consumed and replaced by the thing 11 jaws humanity has a primal fear of the ocean and the dangers it hides no animal better encapsulates that fear than the great white shark and no movie captures the terror of a shark attack quite like jaws based on peter benchley s novel which in turn was loosely inspired by the 1916 new jersey shark attacks jaws follows the reign of terror of one oversized shark as it torments the inhabitants and tourists of a new england community the movie works so well because it leaves so much to the viewer s imagination until the climax viewers rarely catch more than a glimpse of the shark instead seeing shots from its point of view and hearing the iconic musical cue that announces its arrival though the shark affectionately dubbed bruce by the film crew exploded at the end of the first movie more great whites returned to terrorize amity in various sequels but other than the decent jaws 2 those sequels are better left forgotten we can only assume that the reason so few directors have attempted to make a serious horror movie about sharks is that there s no topping jaws 10 zombies zombies may have supplanted vampires as the most common horror movie villains these days the contemporary idea of what constitutes a zombie was introduced in george romero s seminal 1968 horror film night of the living dead but while romero may be the father of the modern zombie countless other directors have tried their hand at depicting the undead apocalypse a few common traits appear almost every time zombies are the reanimated bodies of the dead they crave human flesh with a preference for brains and can only be killed by destroying the head zombies are generally dangerous because of their large numbers although some films like 28 days later have introduced zombies that can run and kill with frightening ease loading play 9 pennywise some people have a deep rooted fear of clowns and after watching it it s really not difficult to understand why another adaptation of a stephen king book it follows the trials and tribulations of a group of friends in a small maine town who encounter a demonic sewer dwelling clown named pennywise as both children and adults pennywise is anything but a jolly fun loving entertainer not unlike gozer in ghostbusters pennywise s perceived form is determined by the minds of the victims he torments and like any good horror movie villain he slumbers for decades before reawakening to renew his reign of terror the fact that the inimitable tim curry was cast as the villain in the original tv movie only helps the fear factor bill skarsgård took over the role in the 2017 movie and its sequel his pennywise is a more overtly terrifying figure but both versions are responsible for countless nightmares and cases of coulrophobia at this point 8 pinhead pinhead is easily one of the most visually distinctive horror villains of all time he leads a group of bondage enthusiasts demons known as the cenobites in the various hellraiser movies hapless humans who solve a puzzle box known as the lament configuration are rewarded with a one way ticket to pinhead s realm and an eternity of pain and torture but as fearsome as he is part of pinhead s appeal lies in his regal charm there s an element of dracula esque nobility and tragedy to this dark figure which set him apart from 80s contemporaries jason voorhees and freddy krueger and just when pinhead s stock had dropped thanks to a series of increasingly underwhelming hellraiser sequels the character got a huge boost thanks to the 2022 hulu reboot 7 hannibal lecter if you want to talk charismatic villains the conversation has to include hannibal lecter intelligent and charming in equal measure hannibal is also a serial killer fond of cooking and eating his victims though ostensibly the villain of the movies silence of the lambs and red dragon viewers can t help but root for hannibal after all he usually only punishes those deserving of his wrath hannibal made his cinematic debut in the 1986 film manhunter played by brian cox however it was oscar winner anthony hopkins who elevated hannibal to a movie icon in silence of the lambs and its spinoffs mads mikkelsen later gave fans a much more suave and urbane version of the character in nbc s hannibal series but one who proved every bit as demented as his predecessor 6 leatherface one of the first of the iconic band of slasher movie villains leatherface is a serial killer inspired by real life figure ed gein leatherface is known for wearing masks made of human skin and wielding a chainsaw his victims in the texas chainsaw massacre series are those hapless teenagers and police officers who wander too close to his dilapidated home part of leatherface s terrifying appeal is that one never truly knows what evil is lurking behind closed doors we just know we never want our van to break down in the texas wilderness 5 count dracula is there any horror villain with a longer hollywood history than count dracula the first confirmed adaptation of bram stoker s novel was the 1922 silent classic nosferatu though due to copyright concerns the character s name was changed to count orlok dracula s most enduring film appearance came nine years later when bela lugosi starred in universal s dracula that movie defined the look and mannerisms of the character for decades to follow dracula has appeared in hundreds of movies played by everyone from christopher lee to frank langella to gary oldman and though moviegoers are currently obsessed with vampire movies where the vampires who sparkle and smolder there will always be a place for the most famous bloodsucker of them all loading play 4 the xenomorphs the original alien introduced the xenomorph a bloodthirsty alien carnivore that grew from human host bodies and managed to nearly wipe out an entire spaceship crew before being sucked out into space aliens upped the ante considerably by introducing an entire colony of xenomorphs worse still these aliens were merely drones serving the gargantuan alien queen a much larger and more fearsome version of her children heroine ellen ripley narrowly escaped her first encounter with a queen in that movie but she wasn t so lucky the second time around the xenomorphs have been a consistent threat in spinoffs like aliens vs predator and alien covenant even if the quality of those movies varies wildly these creatures are always the stuff of nightmares 3 jason voorhees jason voorhees is the central antagonist of the long running friday the 13th series he s instantly recognizable as the lumbering killer who hides his deformed face behind a hockey mask and wields a deadly machete interestingly it wasn t until the third friday the 13th movie that his look was solidified voorhees wasn t even the central villain of the original film instead his mother was the one who set about murdering a group of camp counselors in revenge for her son s drowning years before but jason emerged from the grave to carry on his mother s legacy no one is more skilled at murdering pretty boneheaded teenagers in various brutal ways and like michael meyers jason seemingly can t be killed his thirst for blood has even taken him to the cold reaches of space and back he s even do to be rebooted in a prequel series written by noted friday the 13th superfan bryan fuller 2 freddy krueger it s hard to argue with freddy krueger s track record freddy debuted in 1984 s a nightmare on elm street and has enjoyed a long and robust career of tormenting innocent people in their dreams that supernatural quality is partly what sets freddy above the pack it doesn t hurt that he has such a striking visual design the burned face the razor sharp shears the tattered sweater and fedora freddy was played by robert englund for eight consecutive movies between 1984 and 2003 culminating in his long awaited clash with jason voorhees in freddy vs jason as well as in the tv series freddy s nightmares jackie earle haley took over the role in the 2010 reboot one thing these movies have made abundantly clear is that freddy krueger is a man to be feared in both the waking world and dream world 1 michael myers michael myers is one of the most popular and enduring slasher movie villains heck he practically birthed the genre as we know it in 1978 s halloween unlike a character like freddy krueger myers has no real personality or emotion he s simply a cold silent remorseless killer a true embodiment of the boogeyman the various halloween films establish that myers was incarcerated in a mental institution as a child after killing his sister many of the sequels and reboots see myers escape from imprisonment or apparent death and return to torment laurie strode who is sometimes made into myers sister he can t be killed he can t be stopped there s no escaping the wrath of michael

tesla ceo elon musk now sole director and ceo of twitter is asking employees of the social network to redesign their subscription and verification systems within one week musk has authorized dozens of autopilot software engineers and other tesla employees to do code reviews and more at the social network twitter employees say managers instructed them to work 12 hour shifts seven days a week to hit musk s aggressive deadlines and that their jobs are at stake new twitter owner elon musk has pulled more than 50 of his trusted tesla employees mostly software engineers from the autopilot team into his twitter takeover cnbc has learned musk who is ceo of automaker tesla and reusable rocket maker spacex completed the 44 billion acquisition of twitter on oct 28 and made his mark there immediately he fired the company s ceo chief financial officer policy and legal team leaders right away and has also dissolved twitter s board of directors according to internal records viewed by cnbc employees from musk s other companies are now authorized to work at twitter including more than 50 from tesla two from the boring company which is building underground tunnels and one from neuralink which is developing a brain computer interface get a weekly recap of the latest san francisco bay area housing news sign up for nbc bay area s housing deconstructed newsletter some of musk s friends advisors and backers including the head of his family office jared birchall angel investor jason calacanis and founding paypal chief operating officer and venture capitalist david sacks are also involved so are two people who share musk s last name james and andrew musk who have worked at palantir and neuralink respectively among the dozens who elon musk enlisted specifically from tesla are director of software development ashok elluswamy director of autopilot and teslabot engineering milan kovac senior director of software engineering maha virduhagiri pete scheutzow a senior staff technical program manager and jake nocon who is part of tesla s surveillance unit as a senior manager of security intelligence nocon previously worked for uber and nisos a security company that had a multimillion dollar contract with tesla to identify insider threats and monitor critics of the company at twitter musk is counting on his lieutenants and loyalists to decide who and what to cut or keep at the social network he is also pressing them to learn everything they can about twitter as quickly as possible from source code to content moderation and data privacy requirements so he can redesign the platform several twitter employees told cnbc over the weekend musk has billed himself as a free speech absolutist but he has to balance those wishes with laws and business realities he said in an open letter to advertisers last week as he was taking over the company twitter obviously cannot become a free for all hellscape where anything can be said with no consequences it is not immediately clear how tesla employees are expected to split their schedules between the automaker and twitter typically when tesla employees work for other elon musk ventures usually spacex or the boring company they can get paid by the other venture as a consultant some of musk s employees have full time roles at more than one of his businesses for example tesla vice president of materials charlie kuehmann is concurrently a vice president at spacex at other times two tesla employees told cnbc workers at the electric automaker are pressured to help with projects at his other companies for no additional pay because it s seen as good for their careers or because the work is regarded as helping with a related party transaction or project tesla is facing serious scrutiny around the technology built and maintained by its autopilot team namely its driver assistance systems which are marketed as autopilot fsd and fsd beta the securities and exchange commission the department of justice and the california department of motor vehicles are all investigating whether tesla or musk violated laws and misled consumers about tesla s driver assistance systems which are still in development and do not make the company s cars self driving meanwhile the federal vehicle safety authority nhtsa continues to investigate whether tesla driver assistance systems may have contained defects that contributed to or caused collisions the way that tesla marketed these systems on social media including twitter is part of the scope of at least one nhtsa investigation code reviews and 12 hour shifts several twitter employees told cnbc over the weekend that tesla employees now at twitter have been involved in code review at the social network even though their skills from working on autopilot and other tesla software and hardware do not directly overlap with the languages and systems used to build and maintain the social network these employees asked not to be named because they re not authorized to talk to the press about internal matters and feared retaliation for example most engineers in automotive companies even the tech forward tesla do not have experience designing and operating search engines and platforms that are broadly accessible to the public twitter has multiple code bases with millions of lines of code in each and myriad 10 million or even 100 million or more queries per second qps systems underpinning it at tesla python is one of the preferred scripting languages and at twitter programmers have used scala extensively twitter also has more exposure to international regulations around hate speech and data privacy for example particularly the european union s general data protection regulation twitter employees who were there before musk took over said they have been asked to show his teams all manner of technical documentation to justify their work and their teams work and to explain their value within the company the threat of dismissal looms if they do not impress they said the employees said they are worried about being fired without cause or warning rather than laid off with severance some are worried that they will not be able to reap the rewards of stock options that are scheduled to vest in the first week of november according to documentation viewed by cnbc meanwhile the twitter employees said they have not received specific plans from musk and his team yet and are largely in the dark about possible head count cuts within their groups budgets and long term strategies musk has set nearly impossible deadlines for some to do list items however one immediate project is to redesign the company s subscription software dubbed twitter blue and the company s verification system known sometimes as blue checks for the way they are denoted on the service employees say musk wants that work done by the first week of november the verge previously reported that musk wants to charge 20 per user per month and to only give verification marks to the accounts of users who are paid subscribers and would remove verification from accounts who do not pay for twitter blue managers at twitter have instructed some employees to work 12 hour shifts seven days a week in order to hit musk s aggressive deadlines according to internal communications the sprint orders have come without any discussion about overtime pay or comp time or about job security task completion by the early november deadline is seen as a make or break matter for their careers at twitter in an atmosphere of fear and distrust many twitter employees have stopped communicating with each other on internal systems about workplace issues what s more some of twitter s slack channels have gone nearly silent multiple employees told cnbc meanwhile musk and his inner circle have been plumbing archived messages in the systems ostensibly looking for people to fire and budgets or projects to slash on sunday night in a display of his unfettered access to internal information at the company ceo elon musk who calls himself chief twit but is officially ceo and sole director posted a screenshot to his 112 million listed followers on twitter the screenshot depicted comments made by twitter s head of safety and integrity yoel roth in may 2022 at the time musk was trying to get out of his agreement to buy twitter for 54 20 per share in court and in public musk had vociferously accused twitter of faking metrics specifically of playing down the amount of spam fake accounts and harmful bots that exist on the platform in the internal message that musk made public roth wrote disparagingly of a person involved with the business named amir and also remarked that if amir continued to bs him or others about objectives and key results twitter would be literally doing what elon is accusing us of doing musk alleged in a tweet that wachtell twitter board deliberately hid this evidence from the court he also appeared to threaten further legal action writing stay tuned more to come representatives for twitter tesla and the law firm wachtell lipton rosen katz have yet to respond to requests for comment correction updated to clarify twitter s systems are capable of 10 million to 100 million or more queries per second

october jobs on friday night the midterms next tuesday and the october cpi next friday and earnings season rolls on data to date suggest average s p500 year on year earnings growth of 2 2 which is the lowest rate since the 5 7 of the march 2020 quarter but still better than feared so far 71 of companies delivered a beat on earnings and 68 on revenue that 2 2 nevertheless included a heavy contribution from the energy sector exxon and chevron posted super sized profits last week and the energy sector is up 63 year to date compared to an 19 fall for the s p500 this has raised the ire of the biden administration the average consumer and indeed anyone other than energy company shareholders can biden do anything before next week s midterms can the australian government do anything about gas prices that 2 2 is however net of shockers from the big tech companies which in market cap terms are goliath to energy s david although a lot of the selling was due to guidance more so than actual earnings the october rally lends a lot to the growing belief the fed will soon be ready to pause the pace of rate hikes even with 75bp being baked in for wednesday night last time wall street made this assumption in july it didn t end well the us bond market is not so sure the two year yield hit 4 50 again last night before slipping back to 4 48 up 6 points while the ten year rose 7 points to 4

washington leonardo drs is on track to begin trading on the nasdaq stock market shortly after thanksgiving in a move the company s head believes will free up cash for among other things greater acquisition activity in the future in an october interview with breaking defense bill lynn ceo of the american subsidiary of the italian defense giant said he expected all the paperwork to be done in the immediate period after thanksgiving to allow the company to launch as a traded stock a company spokesman this week confirmed that the expectation is that the stock would go live sometime around the end of november start of december timeframe the process which kicked off with the june acquisition of israeli firm rada is not a traditional ipo where companies go around trying to actively pursue investors instead through a reverse merger process leonardo drs will be able to hit the stock exchange immediately upon the paperwork being finalized with a built in clutch of investors those who already held rada stock in place leonardo drs had looked into a traditional ipo in 2021 but ultimately killed those plans given the response they got when they looked at rada it was purely as a merger and acquisition move that would give drs a new radar portfolio but once the deal started coming together the potential for the reverse merger became clear lynn said we didn t need to do the risk of the cost or the long period for a ipo instead we do this reverse merger and we instantly get the nasdaq spot lynn said in the oct 11 interview and because the company didn t need to worry about finding investors during the holiday season getting up and running at the end of the year isn t a problem he said you don t wait once you re ready you go as to the benefits of an ipo for lynn you can answer it at a number of levels at the level of italian parent company leonardo the company gets a stock on a us exchange that should improve valuation just because of that it also gave them a way to monetize part of the drs value without giving up control lynn said as a global aerospace and defense company you re not global if you re not in the world s biggest market right so they re not giving that up but they are able to use some of those resources tied up here to do other initiatives that includes potentially using funding for other m a activity in europe locally for drs it creates a more independent operating entity one with our own balance sheet we have our own governance we have our own board we have our own stock that gives us much more strategic flexibility to build lynn said we ve had great organic growth over the past several years this gives us the ability to also look at acquisitions as part of increasing the value which going back to of course they want us to increase our value but it gives us a way of self financing acquisitions and for the rada stakeholders the acquisition means the company is no longer going it alone when they run up against the biggest us firms they re now moving into a world where programs of record lynn said so they re facing big us primes and they re saying you know we need a bigger partner to play in this part of the world we need some more scale we need some manufacturing expertise we need more investment capacity and we need it in the us market which is where most of their business even though it s an israeli company most of their businesses is here overall lynn said the company is trying to spread our wings a bit in terms of what drs can offer the us military with a focus on four key business areas advanced sensing network computing force protection and electric power and propulsion we bring a lot of the capability of the larger guys without the same you know number of layers without the same cost structure he said we re more agile we re able to turn to priorities faster than most and produce something in a compressed schedule and to bring that combination of agility and technology that is somewhat unique to the mid tier

fund today announced that the funds paid the distributions noted in the table below on october 31 2022 on a per share basis to all shareholders of record as of october 24 2022 ex dividend date october 21 2022 each fund has adopted a distribution policy to provide investors with a stable distribution out of current income supplemented by realized capital gains and to the extent necessary paid in capital under applicable u s tax rules the amount and character of distributable income for each fund s fiscal year can be finally determined only as of the end of the fund s fiscal year however under section 19 of the investment company act of 1940 as amended the 1940 act and related rules the funds may be required to indicate to shareholders the estimated source of certain distributions to shareholders the following tables set forth the estimated amounts of the sources of the distributions for purposes of section 19 of the 1940 act and the rules adopted thereunder the tables have been computed based on generally accepted accounting principles the tables include estimated amounts and percentages for the current distributions paid this month as well as for the cumulative distributions paid relating to fiscal year to date from the following sources net investment income net realized short term capital gains net realized long term capital gains and return of capital the estimated compositions of the distributions may vary because the estimated composition may be impacted by future income expenses and realized gains and losses on securities and currencies each fund s estimated sources of the current distribution paid this month and for its current fiscal year to date are as follows asgi has a 9 30 fiscal year end fax has a 10 31 fiscal year end includes currency gains where the estimated amounts above show a portion of the distribution to be a return of capital it means that fund estimates that it has distributed more than its income and capital gains therefore a portion of your distribution may be a return of capital a return of capital may occur for example when some or all of the money that you invested in a fund is paid back to you a return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the fund s investment performance and should not be confused with yield or income the amounts and sources of distributions reported in this notice are only estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes the final determination of the source of all distributions for the current year will only be made after year end the actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the fund s investment experience during the remainder of the fiscal year and may be subject to change based on tax regulations after the end of each calendar year a form 1099 div will be sent to shareholders for the prior calendar year that will tell you how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes the following table provides the funds total return performance based on net asset value nav over various time periods compared to the funds annualized and cumulative distribution rates 1 return data is net of all fund expenses and fees and assumes the reinvestment of all distributions reinvested at prices obtained under the fund s dividend reinvestment plan 2 based on the fund s nav as of september 30 2022 3 the fund launched within the past 5 years the performance and distribution rate information presented reflects data from inception july 29 2020 through september 30 2022 shareholders should not draw any conclusions about a fund s investment performance from the amount of the fund s current distributions or from the terms of the distribution policy the distribution policy while nav performance may be indicative of the fund s investment performance it does not measure the value of a shareholder s investment in the fund the value of a shareholder s investment in the fund is determined by the fund s market price which is based on the supply and demand for the fund s shares in the open market pursuant to an exemptive order granted by the securities and exchange commission the funds may distribute any long term capital gains more frequently than the limits provided in section 19 b under the 1940 act and rule 19b 1 thereunder therefore distributions paid by the funds during the year may include net income short term capital gains long term capital gains and or a return of capital net income dividends and short term capital gain dividends while generally taxable at ordinary income rates may be eligible to the extent of qualified dividend income earned by the funds to be taxed at a lower rate not to exceed the maximum rate applicable to your long term capital gains distributions made in any calendar year in excess of investment company taxable income and net capital gain are treated as taxable ordinary dividends to the extent of undistributed earnings and profits and then as a return of capital that reduces the adjusted basis in the shares held to the extent return of capital distributions exceed the adjusted basis in the shares held capital gain is recognized with a holding period based on the period the shares have been held at the date such amount is received the payment of distributions in accordance with the distribution policy may result in a decrease in the fund s net assets a decrease in the fund s net assets may cause an increase in the fund s annual operating expense ratio and a decrease in the fund s market price per share to the extent the market price correlates closely to the fund s net asset value per share the distribution policy may also negatively affect the fund s investment activities to the extent that the fund is required to hold larger cash positions than it typically would hold or to the extent that the fund must liquidate securities that it would not have sold for the purpose of paying the distribution each fund s board has the right to amend suspend or terminate the distribution policy at any time the amendment suspension or termination of the distribution policy may affect the fund s market price per

president joe biden s staffers are pressuring border chief alejandro mayorkas to stop the growing wave of poor haitian migrants with a new version of president donald trump s remain in mexico program according to nbc news the policy u turn comes after pro migration mayorkas wrecked the democrat party s poll ratings by inviting a huge wave of at least 3 million poor economic migrants the public s understated opposition to mayorkas open border policies may evict his fellow democrats from their house and senate majorities and so cripple the democrats many other left wing agendas nbc reported on october 31 the white house national security council is asking the department of homeland security what number of haitian migrants would require the u s to designate a third country known as a lily pad to hold and process haitian migrants who are intercepted at sea and what number would overwhelm a lily pad country and require haitians to be taken to guantánamo according to the document the proposed lily pad plan would start small said the report plans are under consideration that would roughly double the capacity at the migrant operations center to 400 beds according to the document the plan is an improved version of president donald trump s successful and popular remain in mexico plan in trump s last year 4 500 haitian migrants were allowed to enter the country in 2021 mayorkas allowed 38 500 haitians to enter the country his green light invited more migrants and mayorkas then allowed another 42 300 haitians to enter in the 12 months up to october 2022 tens of thousands more haitians are now trying to reach the border mostly by walking through the deadly darien gap trail in panama s jungle mayorkas mass migration has killed many haitians including women and children many migrants gamble their savings and lives to get into the united states because they know the federal government is reluctant to deport illegal migrants la selva del darien todos los días y eso que yo había visto un video en tik tok que decía que venezuela se arregló me siento estafado pic twitter com dl6sgeikih javierhalamadrid javierito321 october 3 2022 most of the economic migrants who get to the u s border are not desperately poor many are relatively prosperous in their home countries and so can save or raise the funds needed to make the expensive often months long trips this hidden trend suggests that mayorkas policy tends to further damage haiti s crippled economy by extracting better off haitians for use in the u s economy nbc noted in late september violent gangs seeking to overturn haiti s government staged a land blockade of the country s main fuel supply point blocking fuel from leaving the depot and thwarting the hopes of those seeking to leave the country by boat the biden administration predicts that when the fuel is no longer blocked and migrants are able to buy gas to power boats there could be a mass exodus of haitians trying to make the dangerous journey to the u s by sea the u s officials said in mid october officials blocked the migration of venezuelans to the border by announcing that they would not be allowed through the title 42 anti epidemic barrier since then the number of venezuelans trying to reach mexico has crashed to about 100 per day the white house s remain in guantanamo plan for haitians is being leaked as a trial balloon partly because it will face furious opposition by pro migration investors and their front groups in the non profit progressive advocacy community but the pre election leak may mark another effort by biden s east coast political network to force a post election reversal of the semi open doors policy set by mayorkas and his west coast investor allies those allies include the west coast investors at fwd us who use the flow of illegal migrants to divert public debate from the legal inflow of cheap and compliant visa workers into white collar fortune 500 jobs but the plan could also offer huge benefits to blue collar americans before the 2024 election since 2021 biden s deputies imported at least 3 million foreign workers immigrants and illegal immigrants in 2022 for example he imported at least seven migrants for every 10 births biden s migration is unfairly pressuring down americans wages it is also boosting rents and housing prices and is pushing up inflation for a wide variety of goods such as used autos and food extraction migration it is easier for government officials to grow the economy by immigration than by growing exports productivity or the birth rate so the federal government deliberately stimulates low wage businesses by extracting millions of migrants from poor countries to serve as extra workers consumers and renters this extraction migration policy shifts vast wealth from ordinary people to investors billionaires and wall street it makes it difficult for ordinary americans to advance in their careers get married raise families buy homes or gain wealth extraction migration slows innovation and shrinks americans productivity this happens because migration allows employers to boost stock prices by using stoop labor and disposable workers instead of the skilled american professionals and productivity boosting technology that earlier allowed americans and their communities to earn more money many polls show the public wants to welcome some immigration but the polls also show deep and broad public opposition to labor migration and the inflow of temporary contract workers into the jobs needed by the families of blue collar and white collar americans this third rail opposition is growing anti establishment multiracial cross sex non racist class based bipartisan rational persistent and recognizes the solidarity that american citizens owe to one another

this story enjoy more audio and podcasts on ios or android your browser does not support the element macroeconomics is partly to blame soaring inflation and rising mortgage repayments are leading consumers to cut back on discretionary spending and most digital offerings are discretionary even the industry s trillion dollar giants have not been spared despite continuing to rake in handsome profits alphabet amazon apple and microsoft have collectively lost 2trn in market value in the past year if you think big tech has it bad spare a thought for the not so big tech in particular three business models embraced by firms born after the dotcom crash of 2001 and subsequently by investors are losing steam the movers which shuttle people or things around cities the streamers which offer music and tv online and the creepers which make money by watching their users and selling eerily well targeted ads over the past year the firms that epitomise these business models uber and doordash netflix and spotify and snap and meta which has tumbled spectacularly out of the trillion dollar club have shed two thirds of their market capitalisation on average see chart things could get worse on november 1st uber reported strong growth but despite being the global leader in ride hailing another quarter of net losses in its 13 year life it has so far torched 25bn of cash equivalent to roughly half its current market value doordash the leader in food delivery remains lossmaking so do spotify despite rising revenue and snap on top of sharply slowing sales netflix a child of the 1990s but a streamer only since 2007 turns a profit but its revenue grew by just 6 year on year in the third quarter compared with a historical average of more than 20 meta s revenues have now shrunk for two consecutive quarters on the surface the movers streamers and creepers and their problems look distinct on closer inspection however their businesses all turn out to face the same main pitfalls a misplaced faith in network effects low barriers to entry and a dependence on someone else s platform start with network effects or flywheels in silicon valley speak the idea that a product s value to a user rises with the number of users once the user base passes a certain threshold the argument goes the flywheel powers a self perpetuating cycle of growth this explains why so many startups seek growth at all cost spending millions acquiring ever more customers to get the flywheel spinning network effects are real but they also have their limits uber believed that its headstart in ride hailing gave it a ticket to riches as more riders and drivers would mean less idle time for both drawing ever more users into an unstoppable vortex instead it encountered high unit costs and diminishing returns to scale reducing average wait times from two minutes to one would require twice as many drivers even though most riders would barely notice the difference doordash s hungry consumers likewise only require so many alternative indian restaurants to choose from and what network effects the movers enjoy are local a user in new york cares little about the popularity of the app in los angeles spotify and netflix also try to capitalise on network effects as data on the listening and viewing habits of similar users promised to deliver an unbeatable product belief that netflix s trove of user information would give it a winning edge in creating content has been shattered by flops like true memoirs of an international assassin which scored a rare 0 audience rating on rotten tomatoes a review website for the creepers whose social networks are a network effects business par excellence the worry is what happens if the flywheels start spinning in reverse meta had a scare in the fourth quarter of 2021 when it lost 1m users that loss did not turn into a stampede the company has added users since next time it may not be so lucky the second problem low barriers to entry is another supposed boon turned bane advances in technology from smartphones to cloud computing allowed all manner of startups including the movers streamers and creepers to build consumer software cheaply and quickly but that also meant that copycats soon emerged and easy money allowed them to offer generous discounts to quickly build the minimum necessary scale although at home uber faces only one real ride hailing rival lyft its global expansion soon ran up against local rivals such as didi in china or grab and gojek in south east asia meanwhile the combination of relatively simple products and free of charge user experience means a new twist on social media can be enough for a new challenger to gain momentum just try prying a teenager from tiktok the barriers to entry for the streamers are higher netflix and spotify spend a lot of money making or licensing content but they are not insurmountable for deep pocketed rivals to fend off the challenge from disney which is spending a total of 30bn a year on content netflix must keep splurging too to the tune of around 17bn a year like customer acquisition costs for the movers content costs eat into streamers profits disney s streaming services lost 1 1bn in the second quarter of this year and the company has said that its disney platform expects to lose money until 2024 heavy investment explains why netflix s free cashflow the money companies generate after subtracting capital investments is equal to only 6 of revenue the third flaw common to the three wobbly business models is their reliance on distribution platforms that are not their own uber and doordash pay a handsome fee to advertise on apple s iphone and alphabet s android app stores spotify forks over a 15 commission on subscriptions purchased on iphones a tax so annoying that it has filed a complaint against apple over it netflix avoids the commission by forcing users to subscribe through their web browser shifting the irritation to the customer and quite possibly missing out on subscriptions worst affected by the lack of their own rails are the creepers their dependence on the iphone android duopoly is an existential threat apple s newish requirement that users give iphone apps permission to track their activity across other apps and websites a move replicated by alphabet may this year cost meta 10bn in forgone revenue parler a creeper favoured by the far right was temporarily suspended by both apple and android if american national security hawks worried about tiktok s chinese ownership get their way and force apple and alphabet to expel it from their app stores the rising star of social media could find itself similarly thwacked the different business models do not face an equal balance of challenges the movers would be in better nick if the industry had meaningful barriers to entry the streamers might have been able to bat away new entrants if network effects had been stronger and the creepers were in reasonable shape until apple and alphabet spoiled their party one shaky pillar is problematic enough three of them is a disaster waiting to happen to stay on top of the biggest stories in business

with the u s midterm elections looming and europe s economic situation deteriorating the threat of reduced international support for ukraine could limit kyiv s options heading into the new year by john p ruehl since february 24 2022 ukraine s armed forces have successfullydefended much of their country but without american assistance the ukrainian military campaign would have likely floundered months ago since the beginning of the russian invasion of ukraine the u s has provided the lion s share of military aid to ukraine alongside enormous financial and humanitarian assistance with the u s midterm elections to be held on november 8 2022 both president joe biden s administration and ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy fear that these channels of support for ukraine will diminish significantly the economic effects of the russian ukrainian conflict such as higher energy prices have taken their toll on american voters and recent polling shows that u s support for the war is waning especially among republicans according to pew research center the belief that the u s is providing too much support to ukraine surged among republicans and republican leaning independents from 9 percent in march to 32 percent in september while the u s economy is in a relatively good state compared to much of the rest of the world republicans have exploited domestic economic concerns to undermine biden and the democrats for months and though many influential republicans such as senator lindsey graham continue to voice strong support for ukraine others aligned with the tea party and former u s president donald trump form the gop s increasingly vocal isolationist wing the influence of this populist group has been reflected in the growing splitbetween senate minority leader mitch mcconnell and house minority leader kevin mccarthy with both of them recently sparring over the issue of ukraine aid in may 57 house republicans voted against the 40 billion aid package to ukraine and during the middle of october mccarthy warned that the u s is not going to write a blank check to ukraine with elections polls predicting a republican house majority future aid packages to ukraine are likely to face greater gop resistance support for nato and ukraine among trump leaning republicans has traditionally been low trump derided nato throughout his 2016 presidential campaign and presidency and his july 2019 phone call with zelenskyy led to the first official efforts to impeach him florida republican governor and trump ally ron desantis was also comfortable enough to ignore calls to pull his state s 300 million investments from russia shortly after the war began unfortunately for kyiv democratic support for ukraine has also fallen according to the september pew research center poll as anxiety over the economy access to abortion and other issues have mounted another pew research center poll from october found that the economy is the top issue for voters heading into the midterm elections biden s explanation of rising inflation as putin s price hike in gasoline has only reinforced the notion in some voters minds that u s led sanctions targeting moscow and support for ukraine have been partly responsible for their economic pain and on october 24 30 members of the progressive caucus in the u s house of representatives sent a letter to joe biden urging him to hold direct talks with russia and end the war while the letter was retracted the next day it further demonstrated ukraine s falling support with the left in the u s any significant drop in american assistance to ukraine the u s has provided more than 52 billion euros in military humanitarian and financial aid to ukraine from january 24 to october 3 2022 will severely impact the latter s ability to defend itself according to christoph trebesch head of the team compiling the kiel institute for the world economy s ukraine support tracker the u s is now committing nearly twice as much as all eu countries and institutions combined the uk has led major european efforts to defend ukraine and is on track to train up to 10 000 ukrainian soldiers on its own soil this year but the uk is experiencing political destabilization following the death of queen elizabeth ii in september and the resignation of two prime ministers in under two months these events have inhibited the british government s ability to form a coherent foreign policy and expand its support for ukraine furthermore the uk has its own disputes with the eu regarding brexit and is unlikely to rally many of the eu states to join its efforts to support ukraine without strong u s coordination the eu has sent billions of euros of financial aid to ukraine since the beginning of the conflict but far less humanitarian and military aid bilateral military aid from ukraine s most important eu suppliers france germany spain italy and poland fell significantly since the end of april 2022 with no new military pledges being made in july large scale european military assistance only resumed following the launch of the successful ukrainian offensive that has reclaimed a large part of the territory since early september yet around the same time on september 5 eu foreign policy chief josep borrell warned that member states weapons stocks were severely depleted after months of providing ukraine with arms reinforcing perceptions of the eu s inability to provide long term military support to kyiv on october 17 the eu formed its own military training program for ukrainian soldiers france declared it would train 2 000 on its soil while other eu members will train another 13 000 ukrainian soldiers though they are unlikely to match nato led initiatives the latest round of eu sanctions against russia which were approved on october 5 demonstrate europe s commitment to keeping pressure on russia a drastic increase in eu assistance to ukraine and confrontation with russia however remains unlikely poland the leading member state advocating for these policies was the largest recipient of eu fundsbetween 2007 and 2020 and will not be able to coalesce the bloc for these purposes on its own and with europe s energy costs mounting the ability of the eu countries to maintain let alone increase their support for ukraine may also soon come under much further strain as in the u s much of europe s political right wing as well as left wing political elements is already far less enthusiastic about maintaining support for ukraine than the political mainstream citing economic pain at home fueled in part by rising energy costs hungarian prime minister viktor orbán a close ally of russian president vladimir putin has led the continental criticism against russian sanctions since the ukrainian invasion his enthusiastic reception at the august 4 conservative political action conference in dallas texas proves that these policies have not caused much concern in the gop with the threat of reduced support from the u s and europe ukraine s ability to hold off russia will weaken significantly in 2023 while most un members voted to condemn russia for its invasion only western allies like japan south korea taiwan australia canada and new zealand have chosen to sanction russia and aid ukraine this is unlikely to change particularly if pressure from washington and brussels subsides because the newly elected and reelected representatives in the 2022 u s midterm elections will not take office until january 2023 the biden administration appears intent on using this window to build up its support for kyiv lawmakers have begun discussing a 50 billion aid package for ukraine that is expected to be finalized by january one problem with this strategy is that winter weather risks grinding ukraine s autumn offensive to a halt any potential russian counteroffensive may wait until next spring and ukraine s needs may have changed by then russia has shifted strategies throughout the war including bolstering the use of artillery iranian drones and other weapons the first of the roughly 300 000 russian reservists and volunteers are expected to arrive soon in ukraine allowing russia to change strategies once more by then the war would be more than a year old and u s public and political support would likely have fallen further having already provided more than 52 billion euros in military humanitarian and financial aid to ukraine since january 24 2022 washington is unlikely to provide ukraine with more large aid packages until the u s domestic economic situation improves it remains to be seen if republicans win the house or the senate and if ukrainian forces manage to regain a significant amount of territory from russia over the next few months then current levels of u s support could be mostly maintained even if republicans gain control over either chamber of congress nonetheless kyiv may be wise to prepare for one more extensive u s aid package and focus on maintaining support for current sanctions while appealing for greater help from europe while the ukrainian armed forces may not mount any new major offensives for the foreseeable future they may be able to prevent the russian military from doing so this article was produced by globetrotter john p ruehl is an australian american journalist living in washington d c he is a contributing

this rendering shows the proposed 36 story manchester hotel which calls for 1 150 rooms and 100 000 square feet of meeting space located near the corner of broadway and pacific highway developer doug manchester who is responsible for building san diego s single biggest hotel is close to submitting plans for a new 36 story 1 150 room hotel tower that would be located just a block from the downtown waterfront while a large convention hotel was always destined for what is a navy owned site going back more than 30 years ago it was only in the last few years that the manchester financial group began working on and designing the current 550 million project advertisement this story is for subscribers we offer subscribers exclusive access to our best journalism thank you for your support it will also likely be the last big hotel development undertaken by the 80 year old manchester says ted eldredge president of the financial group manchester developed the 1 628 room manchester grand hyatt near the city s bayfront convention center as well as the fairmont grand del mar in carmel valley he no longer owns either one what remains a big unknown is whether manchester financial will be able to secure financing and an equity partner in the current economic environment of rapidly escalating interest rates and construction costs the question is what kind of terms can i get eldredge said right now the financial markets aren t favorable and when interest rates go up a quarter of a point on a project of this size that s a lot of money material costs are also up so it will be a challenge if i can t get the financing i want i ll have to wait a little bit advertisement we will probably need an equity partner as well as a lender but i think it s worth it there s a lot of pent up money out there the near term plan eldredge said is to submit plans to the city of san diego some time in november for the purpose of eventually obtaining building permits if manchester financial group is successful in securing financing next year the hotel could potentially be under construction by the very end of 2023 or early 2024 eldredge estimates he expects that construction would take about 30 months manchester financial is currently in talks with a luxury hotel chain to operate the property he added advertisement rendering of entrance to proposed new hotel courtesy of manchester financial group gensler the nearly two acre hotel parcel represents the last remaining property that manchester controls out of the original 12 acre site that his company entitled years ago as a mega mixed use development formerly known as the navy broadway complex located south of broadway between pacific highway and harbor drive two years ago iqhq real estate investment group purchased the bulk of manchester s leasehold as part of its plan to build a 1 6 billion life science city on the bay that it s calling the san diego research and development district it also is building a long planned 1 5 acre public park adjoining the hotel site given the location of the hotel near the water with bay views and san diego s strong rebound from the pandemic eldredge believes there will be no shortage of demand for more than a thousand new hotel rooms while the long planned expansion of the convention center remains a big question mark eldredge said the business plan for the new hotel relies more on in house meetings business which generates significant food and beverage revenue the design of the hotel calls for 100 000 square feet of meeting and event space advertisement there haven t been any 1 000 room hotels built on the waterfront in almost 15 years he said and those hotels aren t our competition we re going to go after the bigger groups to keep them inside the hotel and serve them meals two times a day yeah the convention center is nice and brings business to the hotel but it s not essential to the hotel s success he noted that the manchester hotel would have a built in financial advantage over the waterfront convention hotels which sit on state tidelands and have to pay millions of dollars a year in rent to the port of san diego by comparison the manchester leasehold pays the navy just a dollar a year for nearly 100 years although it was required to build a new regional headquarters office building for the navy at a cost of 210 million advertisement alan reay president of orange county based atlas hospitality group agrees that the hotel s prime location is a clear advantage for manchester and if he s able to get financing which is likely to be costly it will be ahead of its competition three four years from now once the hotel is completed i d expect on a deal of this size you could get about 50 percent of the financing so you would have to come up with 50 percent down reay said and if the cost of money is too high it does not pencil out but having said that the contrarian view would be that everyone else is faced with the same problem one of the issues for new hotels is when you have a lot of new supply in the marketplace and that s not something that s going to happen in downtown san diego it s location location and location and you re in this for the next 30 years this is irreplaceable real estate so as long as you have the capital to weather the interest rate risk this will be a good investment advertisement designing the new hotel is san diego based gensler which describes the look as a contemporary design with art deco and mid century modern influences the all glass facade is accented with bronze and gold tones and the lower level of the structure has a creamy limestone exterior interior spaces are embellished with plush blue fabrics backlit crystal and large scale art installations the more contemporary look is a definite change of pace for manchester whose previous projects bespoke a more old world grandeur with heavier more ornate furnishings rendering of proposed lobby area courtesy of manchester financial groui gensler advertisement we wanted to create a sense of place unique to the waterfront so the design relates to our climate in terms of having meeting space and restaurants and bars that open to the outdoors and spill out onto the plaza and the park so it s not just glass walls said j kevin heinly a managing director with gensler the use of bronze metals and their warmth harken back to art deco and the bronze cap on top of the building will be illuminated so bronze is used throughout the project whether it s decorative metal around the elevators or in the restaurants and bars rendering of pool area planned for proposed manchester hotel courtesy of manchester financial group gensler manchester and gensler are still hashing out details for the various food and beverage venues which will include a signature fine dining restaurant fast casual option lobby bar and a noodle concept there could be as many as seven dining and drinking outlets the gensler firm said also planned is a

whatever the reason your business client may not understand that the simplicity or complexity of moving their company to another state depends on the entity s legal structure your clients may have many reasons to move their businesses to another state better market opportunities more prospective customers or access to a more skilled workforce to suggest a few or your client might prefer another state s small business tax breaks or incentives given to small businesses the reasons for moving could be personal to be closer to extended family cheaper housing or cost of living or even a better climate in this final conversion series post we reveal what you need to know to help your clients move their businesses from one state to another sole proprietorship and partnerships moving a company to another state is relatively simple for clients running non entities such as sole proprietorships and partnerships sole proprietorships and partnerships do not need to register with the state when they re founded however they are required to terminate any current local business licenses and permits and then apply for new ones in the new state and municipality they ve moved to your clients must also cover other business obligations such as paying outstanding debts like sales and employment taxes if the sole proprietorship or partnership operates under an assumed name doing business as dba the owner will need to withdraw the name from the secretary of state s office if the company owners want to use the dba in the new state they ll need to do a name search and reserve the name in the new state also if the company s business bank doesn t have a branch in the new state they will need to close their business accounts and find a new bank to reopen them finally the internal revenue service irs must be informed of the business s move to ensure the federal tax id or federal employer identification number ein on file reflects the updated business address clients should use form 8822 b to report the change of address and of course if the move is made mid year your client must submit tax returns in both states corporations and llcs because corporations and limited liability companies llcs are required to register with the state in which they are founded the process is a bit more complicated once your clients decide to move their corporations or llcs to a new state they have two options they can either 1 dissolve the company in their former state and file to reform it in the new state or 2 keep the original state as the company s home state and file for a foreign qualification in the new state filing for foreign qualification makes sense if your client still plans to do business in both the state they left and the state they re moving to if so your client must contact the new state s secretary of state office to understand the correct process for foreign qualification typically your clients can register online or by mail for a certificate of authority and pay the appropriate fees some states require proof that the company is in good standing in its home state which means it complies with incorporation protocol and has paid its taxes your client will need to provide details about the company such as the corporation s name list of corporate officers the domestic state stock information e g number of shares authorized etc the local mailing address and the registered agent registered agents are people or companies with the authority to accept service of process legal documents and government notices on behalf of a company however if your client does not plan to conduct business in the original state it makes more sense for them to permanently close the business there and then register a new corporation or llc in their new state although closing a business protocols vary by state most states require the following all board members in a corporation or llc must agree to the closure and move to another state also the agreement should be recorded in the meeting minutes and signed by all parties incorporated entities must also file a certificate of termination or articles of dissolution with the secretary of state again before a state dissolves a company the business must be in good standing the corporation or llc must also pay all debts belonging to the company and any remaining assets must be distributed to the members owners how the llc files its taxes determines if taxes are due on the distributed assets once the company has permanently been closed in the previous state the business owners must re register in the new state by reserving a business name filing articles of incorporation and acquiring the required business licenses and permits statutory conversion or domestication another alternative for changing a company s state of formation is through a statutory transaction called a conversion or domestication however not all states offer this option conversion domestication also referred to as redomestication relieves the entity from having to start over and form a new llc or corporation in its new state after the business completes the conversion domestication process it no longer exists in the previous state in the states that allow redomestication the process is straightforward companies apply for conversion domestication in the new state by submitting articles of domestication or articles of continuance typically the company must provide a certificate of good standing from the original state of formation and a copy of the articles of dissolution form from the old state once redomestication has been approved by the new state the company dissolves the business in the old state by filing articles of dissolution states allowing domestication include arizona california colorado delaware district of columbia florida idaho indiana kansas kentucky louisiana massachusetts maine mississippi nebraska new hampshire new jersey nevada pennsylvania south carolina south dakota texas utah virginia washington wisconsin wyoming payroll requirements in most cases whenever a business employs workers in a state the employer is required to register the company with that state s

you have to make sure you don t burn a lot of fuel doing that because then you sort of defeated your purpose to make a low carbon fuel mercurius biorefining chief karl seck has come from the us to queensland in the belief sugar cane is best placed to be the jet fuel of the future daryl wright seck s company mercurius biorefining is based in the us state of washington and has previously tried to establish projects in north america that turn plant matter into sustainable aviation fuels but seck now spends most of his time in mackay sampling the waste sugar cane spat out the back of the local refinery that is mostly owned by german sugar giant nordzucker it does look a lot like garden mulch and there is literally piles of it almost big hills of it he says of the way the mackay refinery aggregates the sugar cane waste into one location carbon dioxide is released to the atmosphere when biofuels are burned but that carbon was initially extracted from the atmosphere by a plant meaning biofuels are considered carbon neutral fuels that do not release additional carbon dioxide into the atmosphere advertisement on the contrary new carbon dioxide is added to the atmosphere when fossil fuels are extracted from underground and burnt biofuels a fast path to net zero biofuels loom as the fastest and easiest path to decarbonisation for heavy transport sectors such as shipping or aviation given that the adoption of biofuels will not require significant changes to existing equipment and infrastructure such as fuel tanks engines and hydrants while electric engines are starting to power small aircraft few believe they will be capable of powering big commercial passenger planes any time soon less than 0 1 per cent of the fuel burnt by the global aviation sector last year was sustainable but the international energy agency believes that will need to rise to 10 per cent by 2030 for the world to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050 the iea said in a report on the sector in september increasing saf use from less than 0 1 per cent of all aviation fuels in 2021 to around 10 per cent by 2030 in line with the net zero scenario will require investment in production capacity and new policies such as fuel taxes low carbon fuel standards and mandatory blending advertisement oil giant shell is investing in development of sustainable fuels in the belief that internal combustion engines are likely to dominate passenger cars globally for decades even if electric vehicles are adopted quickly the world s top motorsport competition formula 1 has also vowed to adopt sustainable fuels by 2026 partly because rival motorsport competition formula e has the exclusive right to race electric vehicles big airlines are already blending biofuels into their jet fuel at certain airports as part of efforts to lower their carbon footprints qantas and british airways have started blending waste cooking oil into their aviation fuel at london s heathrow airport hydrants at singapore s changi airport now supply fuel that is a mix of conventional jet fuel made by exxonmobil and sustainable fuels made by neste us carriers such as american airlines and delta airlines have commissioned nasdaq listed company gevo to supply vast quantities of sustainable aviation fuel in future and gevo is planting huge crops in south dakota to ensure it can meet demand advertisement qantas is among several airlines that have committed to getting 10 per cent of their fuel from sustainable sources by 2030 and the sydney based airline has pledged to invest up to us200 million 312 3 million to foster a domestic sustainable aviation fuel industry the exxon of biofuels mercurius wants to become a supplier to the industry and seck jokes to tech zero that his company might become the exxon of biofuels there s not going to be electric airplanes any time soon especially not the big long haul airliners that people love to go on vacation and conduct business using he said there s really only one alternative in the near or even medium future to decarbonise airplanes and that s biofuels and e fuels while the waste fat oil and grease produced by commercial kitchens are the low hanging fruit for sustainable fuels seck says there will not be enough of such materials to fully supply the world s future demand for low carbon fuel advertisement mercurius has established a pilot plant next to the mackay refinery where it is trialling a new liquid phase catalytic method of turning the waste sugar cane into fuel there are currently two methods for making biofuels from cellulosic material such as sugar cane waste a biochemical path that involves the fermentation of sugar into ethanol and thermochemical where the feedstock is heated and gasified and then reassembled at molecular level however both methods emit carbon dioxide as a waste product during the manufacturing process seck s process relies on liquid hydrochloric acid to work as a catalyst heat is applied in the process but at lower levels than is typically applied in thermochemical production of biofuels he says his process has lower carbon dioxide emissions than the two traditional methods and therefore will convert more of the available carbon into fuel and waste less of it he is also confident it will require less capital spending on equipment and be faster advertisement the research is only in its infancy but will produce an intermediate crude product suitable to power a diesel truck financial incentives needed seck says the product would not be suitable to power a jet aircraft on its own but would be if blended with aviation fuel crops and organic matter are not the only way of making carbon neutral versions of diesel and aviation fuel companies such as southern green gas hope to use direct air capture technology to suck carbon out of thin air and convert it into sustainable diesel and methane seck says the queensland government had provided a lot of support to help mercurius set up its mackay trial without them we wouldn t be here he says advertisement but further government action might be required to convince the likes of mercurius to sell their product here if i was making jet fuel in queensland i d send every drop of it to california because of their very generous credits says seck that s what companies do now from singapore and other places send everything to california and take advantage of the credits california has offered financial incentives toward those reducing the carbon intensity of transport fuels since it introduced the low carbon fuel standard in january 2011 those credits can now be claimed in addition to incentives included in us president joe biden s inflation reduction act which will offer us1 01 for each gallon of biofuel produced and us1 25 for sustainable aviation fuels if australia wants to actually burn to biofuels they make here there has to be some kind of incentive to level that playing field out in my view says seck

while gas prices have fallen to 3 76 on average nationally the white house says they should be lower given declines in global oil prices over the same period washington president joe biden on monday accused oil companies of war profiteering as he raised the possibility of imposing a windfall tax on energy companies if they don t boost domestic production biden in brief remarks criticized major oil companies for making record setting profits while refusing to help lower prices at the pump for the american people the president suggested he will look to congress to levy tax penalties on oil tax companies if they don t begin to invest some of their profits in lowering costs for american consumers the president issued the warning just days before the nov 8 midterm elections my team will work with congress to look at these these options that are available to us and others biden said it s time for these companies to stop war profiteering meet their responsibilities in this country and give the american people a break and still do very well biden took aim at one company exxonmobil that reported 19 7 billion earnings in the third quarter alone he lashed at the irving texas headquarter company for using record profits to provide shareholders with hefty dividends and stock buybacks but failing to invest in production improvements that would benefit consumers at the pump another oil company chevron had 11 23 billion in profits in the third quarter almost reaching the record profits it attained in the prior quarter over the last two quarters exxonmobil chevron shell bp conocophillips and totalenergy earned over 100 billion in profits more than they earned all of last year and more than two and a half times what they earned in the same quarters of 2021 oil companies record profits today are not because of doing something new or innovative biden said their profits are a windfall of war a windfall for the brutal conflict that s ravaging ukraine and hurting tens of millions of people around the globe high prices at the pump have exacerbated inflation and have taken a toll on biden and democrats standing among voters congress would have to approve any additional taxes on the energy producers which would be a tall order in the current congress where democrats have narrow control of the house and senate and even less likely should republicans retake one or both chambers on nov 8 americans have struggled with painfully high gasoline prices in recent months paying more than 4 80 on average for a gallon of regular at the beginning of july according to aaa they ve since fallen to 3 76 on average nationally but the white house says they should be lower given declines in global oil prices over the same period can t believe i have to say this but giving profits to shareholders is not the same as bringing prices down for american families biden tweeted on friday biden has been critical of energy companies profits since at least june when he complained publicly that exxon made more money than god this year biden s threat of windfall taxes on energy companies follows calls by progressive democrats including bernie sanders and elizabeth warren for such a proposal and last week california gov gavin newsom called on congress to tax the profits of oil companies crude oil prices are down but oil and gas companies have jacked up prices at the pump in california this doesn t add up newsom said on friday we re not going to stand by while greedy oil companies fleece californians instead i m calling for a windfall tax to ensure excess oil profits go back to help millions of californians who are getting ripped off the democratic controlled house passed a bill in may authorizing the federal trade commission to punish companies that engage in price gouging and adding a new unit at the ftc to monitor fuel markets the bill has stalled in the senate a related measure by senate commerce committee chair maria cantwell d wash has not come to the senate floor for a vote this is exactly the type of leadership we ve been waiting for from president biden said jamie henn spokesperson for the group stop the oil profiteering big oil has made nearly 300 billion in excess profits this year by gouging us at the pump a windfall profits tax can provide immediate relief by redirecting that money into the pockets of hardworking americans industry groups have condemned the prospect of a windfall tax with american exploration production council ceo anne bradbury saying it would likely backfire by further driving up energy costs for american families and businesses
in today s daily reckoning australia a lesson is to be learned from australia s whale oil history that explains why the current push to renewable energy is illogical at least for right now it isn t a popular take but history shows that governments driving investment decisions based on arbitrary targets is a recipe for disaster read on to see why a good part of the capital which had so lavishly employed in the import trade they are gradually diverting into that safer and infinitely more productive channel the oil fisheries the whaling merchants are public benefactors entitled to the gratitude of the whole community they are stopping the inlets of australian poverty and opening those of australian wealth sydney gazette 18 march 1830 the second fleet a convoy of six ships containing convicts settlers and supplies landed in sydney in 1789 it was a notorious voyage 25 of the convicts on board died en route and 40 were dead within six months of their arrival the private contractors who arranged transport and provisions were blamed the authorities obviously didn t instruct them to get their human cargo to sydney in one piece a reminder if any is needed that economics is all about incentives this debacle which put the fledgling settlement on the brink of starvation provided an opportunity for an enterprising whaling captain named samuel enderby enderby was heavily involved in the british american whale trade through his fleet of ships however following the american revolution an embargo was placed on exports to britain this included whale oil before the discovery of petroleum in the 1850s whale oil was the primary machine lubricant and preferred lamp oil in europe and north america enderby in search of new markets lobbied the british government to allow whalers to transport convicts to sydney and to then continue hunting whales in the southern ocean that way he could make money on both voyages human cargo on the way out and whale oil cargo on the way back in 1791 the third fleet left england for sydney of the 11 ships that landed five continued to hunt in the southern ocean establishing the whale oil industry in australia according to the national museum of australia whaling became an essential part of the new south wales economy and culture whalers were the most frequent visitors to the colony in its first decade whaling was australia s first major industry with thousands of men and hundreds of ships eventually involved in the trade the peak of australian whaling activity was between 1820 and 1855 with up to 1 300 men working in the industry each year with the 1851 discovery of gold in australia however sailors deserted their ships en masse to travel to the goldfields as petroleum increasingly replaced whale oil throughout the 1850s the industry went into decline an industry that had provided new south wales with 52 per cent of her exports in 1832 provided less than one per cent by 1855 the prosperity that the whale oil trade brought to the colony of new south wales wasn t lost on the public as highlighted by the sydney gazette quote above the whaling merchants were benefactors preventing poverty and increasing wealth how times have changed in 2022 23 australia s exports of liquid natural gas coal and oil are expected to total 225 billion that s 50 of our total resource exports the same as whale oil at its peak yet the industry is vilified and shunned wealthy activists and university educated know nothings want to shut these industries down they only see the world through the prism of emissions they don t see the other side of the balance sheet these exports help provide food shelter and heating for millions of people and they pay for schools hospitals and a bloated public service for australians we re a long way from the gratitude shown to our vital industries back in the early years of settlement back then before the welfare state saw the government become everyone s benefactor there was a much greater awareness of what the wealth creation process was all about to the modern mind killing whales to harvest oil is abhorrent but back then it was entirely acceptable thankfully technology saw the whaling industry quickly decline through the large scale discovery of oil and its refinement into petroleum products moreover this discovery made energy much cheaper cheap energy along with free markets and the rule of law is vital for increasing living standards the more a nation s wealth is devoted to energy expenses the less wealth is available for other endeavours that s why this transition to renewables is so contentious politicians see it as a vote winner and are ploughing ahead regardless of cost but the more we force it to occur in an unnaturally short time frame the greater the costs will be the rallying cry of the zero carbon advocate is that renewable energy is free yet the more we invest in it the higher our energy prices become why is that making millions of non renewable solar panels and wind turbines is not free building extensive transmission lines to connect these far flung new energy sources to the existing system is not free building backup supply to support and guarantee intermittent renewable generation is not free those investing in this new infrastructure will want a return on their substantial investment and you ll be paying for it at the same time traditional energy forms have suffered from chronic underinvestment technology has driven all prior energy transitions as a result the cost of energy has declined and contributed to the broad rise in global living standards over the years this energy transition is different while technology plays a role it s not the driving force politics is as a result this energy transition for the first time in history will result in a higher cost of energy and a commensurate reduction in living standards it doesn t have to be that way for australia but i don t like our odds australia is a net energy exporter in 2020 21 we exported 15 420 petajoules and imported just 2 115 petajoules see below we stand to benefit massively from the structural rise in energy prices in the years ahead meanwhile net energy importers like the uk europe and asia will have to spend more on their energy needs while beyond the scope of this report this dynamic will have huge implications for international capital flows and trade balances as just one small example look at germany long famed as a high value added exporter it s built up considerable trade surpluses especially post reunification in 1989 90 but as you can see below thanks to the energy crisis its trade surpluses have collapsed it s now using nearly all its export wealth to pay for its energy needs if this continues not just for germany but for others like it it will have huge implications anyway the point is that australia s very well placed to benefit from this energy induced power shift but as i said i m not hopeful we will invest the dividends wisely for evidence of this you just have to look to queensland one of the most naturally endowed states in australia in late september the qld state government announced a 62 billion energy and jobs plan this includes a new renewable energy target of 70 by 2032 and 80 by 2035 currently renewables generate around 20 of queensland s electricity needs coal provides 60 and gas 10 with biomass accounting for the remaining 10 under this new plan all state owned coal plants will be shut down by 2035 what will replace this critical and cheap energy source new hydro dams now just to be clear i m not criticising adding hydro energy to the mix but trying to replace cheap and reliable energy with hydro is a big risk to energy security hydro works by having two reservoirs an upper and a lower one it generates electricity by letting the water in the upper reservoir flow through turbines a process that generates electricity into the lower reservoir one of the issues with the proposed hydro dams is that they ll have just 24 hours of storage capacity this means they ll be able to produce reliable energy for just 24 hours before the upper reservoir needs refilling that compares to the snowy hydro 2 0 product which will be able to produce energy for seven days this requires a lot of energy to pump the water back up from the lower reservoir energy that ll have to come from wind and solar and presumably backed up by gas plants in 10 15 years time queensland risks having some of the highest electricity costs in the world while remaining one of the largest exporters of fossil fuels helping keep other countries electricity costs down i know this isn t a popular take you may agree or disagree but the historical record shows that governments driving investment decisions based on arbitrary targets is a recipe for disaster economic growth and higher living standards for our kids come from in part technological advances that lower energy costs this time around our brain dead politicians seem to be spending our energy export windfall on technologies and projects that are almost guaranteed to increase energy costs and decrease our standard of living but it s for your own good and there s really not much you can do about it despite ample evidence from europe that renewable energy is nowhere near capable of powering the economy australia continues to panic towards net zero targets with the mr micawber like hope that something will turn up to make it happen the odds are against it as i explain in this exclusive report your best hedge against political insanity on energy policy is to have an overweight allocation to quality energy stocks read it here regards greg canavan for the daily reckoning australia
the federal reserve is expected this week to announce another three quarter point increase in its key interest rate the question now is whether fed officials will to slow its rate hikes which are intended to cool the worst inflation in four decades but are also raising the risk of a recession fed chair jerome h powell is shown at a september news conference announcing the last rate increase the federal reserve may reach a turning point this week as it announces what s expected to be another substantial three quarter point increase in its key interest rate its fourth straight fed officials will probably engage in a fraught debate over whether it may soon be time to slow the rate hikes which are intended to cool the worst inflation in four decades but are also raising the risk of a recession advertisement at a news conference wednesday after the fed s meeting chair jerome h powell could signal a forthcoming shift to smaller rate increases doing so would give officials time to assess the effect of the hikes powell probably won t explicitly spell out the fed s likely next moves but economists say he could acknowledge that officials are discussing a downshift to a half point rate increase in december the fed s hikes have already led to much costlier borrowing rates for home auto and business loans those higher loan costs have weakened the home market in particular the average rate on a 30 year fixed rate mortgage which was just 3 14 a year ago topped 7 last week for the first time since 2002 mortgage buyer freddie mac reported nationwide sales of existing homes have fallen for eight straight months advertisement fed officials have emphasized that they need to raise rates significantly to tame inflation which has caused hardships for millions of households high inflation has also become a central point of attack for republicans against democrats in the midterm congressional elections yet some economists have said the fed should soon consider scaling back the fastest pace of rate increases since the early 1980s it is time to think about calibrating these rate hikes said diane swonk chief economist at kpmg as the fed moves closer to finishing its rate increases she said it makes sense to not be hitting the brakes so hard advertisement the fed s benchmark short term rate stands in a range of 3 to 3 25 in september policymakers forecast that they would raise it by an additional 1 25 percentage points by year s end that timetable suggests increases of three quarters of a point wednesday and half a point in december one concern for the fed is that if it suggests it could ease its credit tightening the financial markets might conclude that it will soon stop raising rates and perhaps cut them next year stock and bond prices would move higher countering the fed s efforts to slow the economy fed watchers say there are two ways the central bank could avoid raising any misplaced optimism officials could send a tough anti inflation message wednesday by reiterating a point from the minutes of their september meeting the minutes showed that the policymakers preferred to err on the side of raising rates too high rather than raising them too little and risk perpetuating high inflation advertisement another possibility is that in december when policymakers will update their economic forecasts they could pencil in an extra quarter point rate increase early next year to underscore their determination to curb inflation which reached a punishing 8 2 in september one reason the fed might begin pulling back soon is that some early signs suggest that inflation could start declining in 2023 consumers squeezed by high prices and costlier loans are starting to spend less supply chain snarls are easing ocean freight costs have plunged 67 in the last year which means fewer shortages wage growth is plateauing which if followed by declines would reduce inflationary pressures for now though many fed officials have said they see few signs inflation is coming down in a sustainable way advertisement we need to see actual progress in core inflation and services inflation and we are not seeing it yet neel kashkari president of the federal reserve bank of minneapolis said recently core inflation excludes volatile food and energy costs and is considered a good reflection of underlying price pressures a few have sounded more optimistic notes fed vice chair lael brainard listed several reasons inflation would probably fall soon including price cuts by retailers to clear excess inventories as a result she said moving forward deliberately would help the fed determine how the economy is handling its rate increases and how many more might be needed and mary daly president of the san francisco fed noted recently that the central bank won t be carrying out three quarter point rate increases indefinitely advertisement the time is now to start talking about stepping down daly said business here s a tip to take advantage of rising interest rates your high yield savings account may not be keeping up with rising interest rates a little vigilance can help you squeeze out a much better return most of the signs of easing inflation have emerged in private sector data sources including websites that track rents and home prices some economists think fed officials will have to assign greater weight to such sources in the coming months the data firm apartmentlist for example said rents in new leases fell from august to september for the first time this year and tracked over the last 12 months the still high 6 8 increase in rents was far less than the 12 month increase of 17 1 that was measured a year ago yet in the government s consumer price index housing costs are still rising at the fastest pace in decades that reflects what many people are experiencing apartment dwellers who are now renewing leases probably face higher rents than they did a year ago advertisement the slowdown in housing costs will eventually feed into the government s data though it could take a year or longer many economists think the fed will have to take those slowing housing costs into account before then kathy bostjancic chief u s economist at nationwide said that as interest rates reach levels that slow growth and as real time data show slowdowns in rents and wages fed officials need to be looking through the front windshield not the back and be more careful with their rate increases other central banks have already started pulling back the bank of canada raised rates by only a half point last week even though a three quarter point hike was expected the european central bank raised its key rate by 0 75 percentage point but signaled that its increases could cool advertisement these moves contributed to expectations that a dovish pivot is coming for all global central banks td ameritrade economists said

amazon told investors earlier in october it is bracing for lower holiday sales as consumers likely slow spending related the company cut about 1 billion from its operating costs in the third quarter it was supposed to open the 3 8 million square foot facility just south of 8 mile road at woodward near detroit s northern border with ferndale in oakland county in july the fulfillment centers allow businesses to store merchandise in a property run by amazon which is then outsourced to get purchases to customers typically by sending them to a smaller sorting and so called last mile shipping centers like one in canton township that just opened so far full recruitment has not started in detroit although about 100 people were hired to work in the detroit facility in october the city said we have begun initial operations at our fulfillment center in detroit with the intent of ramping up and launching next year amazon spokesperson austin stowe told bridge michigan on friday the company did not give a reason for the latest michigan based delay or say when it would launch recruiting however moving the full detroit opening to 2023 comes as amazon said it is confronting higher expenses and bracing for a potential slide in consumer spending both due to inflation we ve continued to moderate our build expectations to better align with demand amazon cfo brian olsavsky told analysts last week on an investor call as the company announced its third quarter results amazon earlier this year canceled plans to build a 183 000 square foot warehouse in ypsilanti township and is slowing projects near ann arbor and lansing plus two buildings in grand rapids the statewide amazon slowdown already put the brakes on an estimated 1 000 jobs anticipated outside detroit a number that grows to 2 100 jobs on hold when the estimates for the detroit workforce are added detroit watches project closely the city of detroit sold 142 acres on the former fairgrounds site for the project in 2020 for 9 million as developers hillwood investment properties in texas and sterling group of detroit collaborated to bring amazon to the city neither developer responded when bridge asked for comment on the delay the city acquired the property from the state in 2018 paying 7 million in hopes of luring developers the purchase was controversial among some neighbors who worried about truck traffic a lack of negotiated community benefits and the conversion of public property to industrial use the amazon project was announced with fanfare in august 2020 by detroit mayor mike duggan we need good paying jobs and jobs of the future he said at the time according to the detroit free press in 2020 the city anticipated the work would pay at least 15 per hour today amazon says fulfillment jobs pay 16 to 26 per hour hillwood and sterling configured the property for amazon to build five stories leaving 42 acres for two future developments in addition to a new transit center which is now out for bids for a contractor to convert a former state fair building into a bus station to service the area frank and karen hammer neighbors who helped form the state fairgrounds development coalition and oppose the development said they are keeping close tabs on the delays frank hammer said ongoing issues for the community include non binding agreements the city made with the property developers that call for amazon to give detroiters hiring priority for the once expected 1 200 jobs once amazon occupied the building from that point forward they have a year to fulfill the 1 200 job commitment he said we didn t see any provisions for what would be the penalty that amazon would pay if it didn t meet those hiring goals emails went out in october to a database of about 84 000 detroit residents registered with detroit at work the city s contractor with the statewide workforce development office michigan works they were invited to express interest in the initial 100 positions created at the new facility city officials said though no details on the positions were available the link is no longer active detroit at work listed 11 000 open jobs in the city officials said monday the jobless rate in wayne county was 4 6 percent in september compared to a state average of 4 1 percent when amazon expands hiring at the detroit facility city officials told bridge they expect to use social media billboards information fairs and career fairs with the company to attract applicants they would not say whether they know amazon s timing amazon could have chosen anywhere else said nicole sherard freeman a city executive who oversees economic issues for duggan s administration this is great for the city and we re not concerned about the delay given the fact that the project was announced at the beginning of the pandemic amazon has made a tremendous investment and commitment to the city of detroit and we look forward to the facility s opening amazon changing course even as amazon cuts 1 billion this quarter from its retail operations including fulfillment centers it has invested 10 billion so far this year in technology infrastructure cfo olsavsky said on the most recent conference call that investment will support what he called the rapid growth innovation and continued expansion of the amazon web services cloud computing network the company also continues to invest in some hotter markets including san francisco where it recently signed a deal for two warehouses of about 350 000 square feet amazon s slowdown in many markets is relative and still represents significant investment by the company said marc wulfraat president of logistics consultants mwpvl international inc in montreal they are slowing down he said but the growth arc is still a rocket ship heading into space amazon added 100 million square feet of space in the u s in 2021 and this year it will open 60 million said wulfraat who studies the company for supply chain customers that s less than last year but it s huge wulfraat said amazon stock fell 17 percent from tuesday through friday last week going from 119 93 per share to 99 13 per share after the company reported revenue was up 15 percent but still 370 million off of projections the quarterly report prompted a stock sell off after the company projected sales growth of 2 to 8 percent in the fourth quarter below the 9 percent and 38 percent seen in the holiday seasons of 2021 and 2020 online shopping represented 9 percent of u s retail sales in early 2019 according to the u s census bureau and it nearly doubled to 17 percent in 2020 but it started to drop in the third quarter of 2021 this past summer it grew at 1 9 percent compared to 5 3 percent a year earlier adobe s sales analytics predicted online sales will grow 2 5 percent in november and december we re realistic that there s various factors weighing on people s wallets and we re not quite sure how strong holiday spending will be versus last year olsavsky told analysts he also said amazon s streamlining likely is not done even as holiday hiring including as estimated 3 000 temporary works in michigan begins fulfillment centers already are using robots for some labor and two new robots are in the pipeline

the result could be 20 times larger if the pope brought the practice to the us millions of tonnes of carbon emissions could be mitigated every year if the tradition of meat free fridays is revived by the pope a study has found the practice was originally brought about as christ is said to have died on a friday and was seen a day of repentance but in 1984 it became non compulsory however in september 2011 it was reinstated by the catholic bishops of england and wales according to researchers at the university of cambridge only around a quarter of catholics changed their dietary habits as a result nevertheless this saved over 55 000 tonnes of carbon a year the equivalent to 82 000 fewer people taking a return trip from london to new york if bishops issued an obligation to resist meat on a friday in the united states alone the environmental benefits would likely be twenty times larger than in the uk according to the study millions of tonnes of carbon emissions could be mitigated every year if the tradition of meat free fridays is revived by the pope a study has found pictured pope francis after the 2011 move back to meat free fridays in england and wales 28 per cent of catholics adjusted their diet left of this segment 41 per cent stated that they stopped eating meat on friday and 55 per cent said they tried to eat less meat on that day right what did the study find after the 2011 move back to meat free fridays in england and wales 28 per cent of catholics adjusted their diet of this segment 41 per cent stated that they stopped eating meat on friday and 55 per cent said they tried to eat less meat on that day this was calculated to be the equivalent of every working adult in england and wales cutting two grams of meat a week out of their diet it also saves 1 070 tonnes of carbon a week or 55 000 tonnes over a year according to researchers a separate calculation found that from 2009 to 2019 meat consumption fell by around eight grams per person in england and wales compared to the rest of the uk this could be an impact of meat free fridays but also suggests that a reduction of two grams a week is an underestimate advertisement the catholic church is very well placed to help mitigate climate change with more than one billion followers around the world said lead author professor shaun larcom pope francis has already highlighted the moral imperative for action on the climate emergency and the important role of civil society in achieving sustainability through lifestyle change meat agriculture is one of the major drivers of greenhouse gas emissions if the pope was to reinstate the obligation for meatless fridays to all catholics globally it could be a major source of low cost emissions reductions even if only a minority of catholics choose to comply as we find in our case study for christians the practice of meat free fridays dates back to at least pope nicholas i s declaration in the 9th century catholics were required to abstain from eating meat or flesh blood or marrow in memory of christ s death and crucifixion many followers would have fish on a friday as a protein substitute and as a result even inspired the filet o fish meal at mcdonald s but in 1985 the practice was amended to allow catholics to substitute another form of penance in its place such as giving up alcohol or reading the bible then in 2011 a statement was released calling on congregations to again go without meat on the day this was to help unite the faithful with a clear and distinctive mark of catholic identity the economists behind the new study published today on the social science research network wanted to quantify the effects of this change from 2009 to 2019 meat consumption fell by around eight grams per person in england and wales compared to in scotland and northern ireland pictured average meat consumption on friday treat catholics in england and wales control catholics in scotland and northern ireland meat consumption should be slashed to the equivalent of two burgers a week to avoid a climate crisis study claims slashing meat consumption to the equivalent of just two beef burgers per person a week by 2030 will help avoid a climate crisis a new report claims the new state of climate action 2022 report released on wednesday outlines how much work humanity has to do to achieve the aims of the paris agreement described as a to do list for humankind the report calls on meat eating members of the public to do their bit to reduce global warming across high consuming meat regions daily meat consumption needs to decrease to 79 kilocalories per person by 2030 about the same as two beef burgers per week and to 60 kilocalories by 2050 1 5 beef burgers per week read more here advertisement in a survey of 489 catholic people in england and wales 28 per cent said they adjusted their friday diet following the announcement of this segment 41 per cent stated that they stopped eating meat on friday and 55 per cent said they tried to eat less meat on that day according to the national diet and nutrition survey ndns people in england and wales eat an average of 100 grams of meat a day using this data and assuming that survey participants who reduced their meat consumption halved it on a friday the researchers calculated the impact of the 2011 ruling on meat consumption nationwide it was found to be the equivalent of each working adult in england and wales cutting two grams of meat a week out of their diet assuming those who amended their diets switched to high protein non meat meals on fridays it also equates to approximately 875 000 fewer meat meals a week this saves 1 070 tonnes of carbon a week or 55 000 tonnes over a year according to researchers as eating meat contributes significantly to our emissions by some estimates the farming of livestock contributes 14 5 per cent of human induced global greenhouse gas emissions this is because it involves converting forests into agricultural land meaning carbon dioxide absorbing trees are being cut down and contributing to climate change more trees are cut down to convert land for crop growing as around a third of all grain produced in the world is used to feed animals raised for human consumption when meat free fridays were reinstated by the catholic church in england and wales in 2011 around a quarter of catholics changed their dietary habits saving over 55 000 tonnes of carbon a year stock image a separate calculation that compared the meat reduction on fridays alone in england and wales with scotland and northern ireland was also conducted this is because catholic bishops in the latter countries did not attempt to reintroduce meatless fridays it was found that from 2009 to 2019 meat consumption fell by around eight grams per person in england and wales compared to in scotland and northern ireland this could be for a number of reasons the authors say as meat consumption has fallen across the uk in this time but is likely linked to the 2011 change as such they say that the carbon footprint calculations using a two gram per week drop for catholics in england and wales are likely to be conservative the study authors say that catholics currently make up just under 10 per cent of the british population and has been stable for decades our results highlight how a change in diet among a group of people even if they are a minority in society can have very large consumption and sustainability implications said co author dr po wen she co author dr luca panzone from newcastle university added while our study looked at a change in practice among catholics many religions have dietary proscriptions that are likely to have large natural resource impacts other religious leaders could also drive changes in behaviour to further encourage sustainability and mitigate climate change
listen to this article listen to this article maryland voters by mail and early voting and on election day will have the opportunity to be heard on a handful of ballot issues in addition to choosing the next governor comptroller and attorney general after decades of debate the voters have the chance to approve the legalization of recreational marijuana they ll also get to weigh in on proposed changes to the names of the state s top appeals courts the thresholds for jury trials in civil cases as well changes to residency requirements for state legislative candidates the first ballot question asks voters to amend the state constitution to change the names of maryland s top two courts related when where and how can i vote in maryland if approved maryland s court of appeals would become the supreme court of maryland the court s judges would then be called justices the state court of special appeals would become the maryland appellate court only maryland and new york and the district of columbia currently refer to their top appellate court as the court of appeals in 2021 mary ellen barbera then chief judge of the maryland court of appeals told lawmakers the names of the state s top courts was the subject of confusion especially among out of state lawyers law students and litigants that confusion persists among marylanders barbera told lawmakers they are most familiar with our nation s united states supreme court and expect that maryland would have the same name for its highest court the change affects only the name and not terms or official responsibilities there are minimal costs with the change as the courts would be required to exhaust existing supplies of letterhead business cards and other items before ordering new stock to reflect the changes related maryland counties cities residents provide free rides to polls a second question if approved by voters would change the eligibility requirements for state delegates and senators and require them to maintain a primary place of abode for at least six months prior to the election currently lawmakers only have to maintain a domicile in the district in which they intend to serve and while the change seems minor it would close a loophole created by a 24 year old court of appeals ruling involving sen clarence blount blount then 77 and the longtime senate majority leader and chairman of the education health and environmental affairs committee represented a district in baltimore city but was living in pikesville in baltimore county keeping only an apartment and bed in his district the court of appeals ruled that blount had not abandoned his district and maintained his eligibility because he was domiciled outside the district the blount rule effectively opened the door for lawmakers to sleep in places outside their district while maintaining an in district address even if only for appearances a recent case of this involved del hasan jay jalisi who owned an expensive home near the caves valley country club in the 11th district of baltimore county but claimed that he lived in a home that served as office space inside the 10th district voters will also be asked to approve an increase to the threshold that would permit a civil jury trial from more than 15 000 to more than 25 000 sen jeff waldtreicher d montgomery and sponsor of the 2021 bill said the change would make the process of low dollar lawsuits more efficient by keeping them in district court he said jury trials in those civil matters are antithetical to the interests of justice the bill was supported by tort lawyers including the maryland association for justice and opposed by insurance companies related moore cox clash on crime abortion and fitness for office after years of debate voters are being asked to approve an amendment to the maryland constitution that would legalize the use of recreational cannabis for adults 21 and older beginning july 1 2023 approval would also trigger companion legislation passed this year that includes a study of the cannabis industry in the state with an eye toward equity in licensing earmarks about 30 of the state s proceeds for communities historically and disproportionately impacted by marijuana enforcement and allows for expungement of possession charges those serving jail time for those crimes could petition to be released for time served since 2021 13 states have put the question of legalization of recreational marijuana to voters all have been successful at the ballot box a series of recent polls show majority support for the change in maryland the final statewide question would eliminate the orphans court in howard county estate and probate matters in that county the court handled nearly 850 cases in fiscal 2020 and nearly 1 100 in fiscal 2021 would be handled by the judges in the circuit court of howard county only harford and montgomery counties currently handle estate cases in this manner del vanessa atterbeary a howard county democrat and sponsor of the bill passed in 2021 told lawmakers the additional cases would increase the circuit court workload by about 2 byron mcfarlane the register of wills in howard county said the change would reform the process by ending reliance on three lay judges who must agree on decisions sit part time and often delay decisions that are appealed more than any other orphans court except one this bill would create a more efficient more reliable and more equitable process for grieving families by providing them with a fully vetted professionalized court they can rely on

team transitory is gone meet team overcorrection federal reserve chairman jerome powell has been challenged by a number of well known economists who have called on the central bank to relax in its fight against inflation for example jeremy siegel the russell e palmer professor of finance at the wharton school of the university of pennsylvania said recently that he would give the fed a d for its handling of the economy arguing that they are now overcorrecting in tightening to combat inflation jim paulsen chief investment strategist at the leuthold group recently said the fed has gone rogue in its fight against inflation harvard economist greg mankiw recently endorsed a column by new york times columnist paul krugman arguing that the fed is braking too hard right now the fed seems set to pursue further big rate hikes in the coming months i would urge it to look hard at what s happening and think twice krugman wrote the grumbling from politicians is also getting louder ohio democrat sen sherrod brown who chairs the senate banking committee which has jurisdiction over the fed sent a letter to powell last week that all but accused the fed chief of abrogating the central bank s duty to maintain maximum employment brown wrote that potential job losses brought about by monetary over tightening will only worsen these matters for the working class what s more the stock market has experienced a historic run in october largely on the belief that the federal reserve will pivot away from tightening in the months ahead coming into this week october was shaping up to be the best month for the dow jones industrial average since january of 1976 according to several wall street analysts this has been the best october since 1901 the main argument among those who think it is time for the fed to back off from hiking or at least signal that it will back off is that the effects of tightening monetary policy are felt with a lag so if the fed continues to raise rates until it sees inflation come down significantly it will wind up over tightening and causing an excessive downturn instead they would have the fed take a step back and watch if the hikes put in place this year are working to bring down inflation the noises are even coming from inside the house the federal reserve has tightened policy strongly to bring inflation down and u s tightening is being amplified by concurrent foreign tightening fed vice chair lael brainard said in a speech this month we are starting to see the effects in some areas but it will take some time for the cumulative tightening to transmit throughout the economy and to bring inflation down powell is not alone of course larry summers has an op ed in the washington post monday arguing that the fed s critics are wrong and that it will take significantly higher rates to bring down inflation to the federal reserve s two percent target if they believe that interest rates above 4 percent in an economy with 7 percent core inflation will cause a recession serious enough to reduce inflation below the fed s 2 percent target they need to explain why i find it absurd summers writes with his characteristically delicate approach the summers op ed makes the argument that progressive policy goals depend on defeating inflation first regaining price stability at as low a cost as possible is far from sufficient to maximize american economic performance but it is necessary only from a foundation of price stability can we meet the profound challenges of speeding up growth including all americans in prosperity and maintaining american leadership at a dangerous global moment policymakers must not flinch he writes it is all but certain that the federal reserve s federal open market committee on wednesday will announce a 75 basis point raise in its target to a range of 3 75 and four percent powell s challenge on wednesday will be to convince markets that not only is he not going to flinch but that pushing rates even higher is the right thing to do for the economy
workers party pt s candidate luiz inácio lula da silva won brazil s presidential election on sunday defeating the incumbent fascistic president jair bolsonaro lula won 60 3 million votes 50 9 percent against 58 2 million votes 49 1 percent for bolsonaro this was the smallest margin of victory in a presidential race since 1989 the first election after the end of the 1964 1985 military dictatorship even with both candidates receiving record votes a quarter of brazilian voters refused to vote either by not showing up at the polls 20 57 percent or by casting a blank or invalid ballot 4 59 percent brazil s president elect luiz inácio lula da silva addressing supporters in são paulo inspired by former us president donald trump and trying to repeat in brazil a capitol hill scenario bolsonaro has carried out with the support of the armed forces a systematic campaign to discredit the brazilian electoral system he will undoubtedly seek to exploit the divisions exposed in the election with two months to escalate his dictatorial conspiracy until the presidential inauguration on january 1 2023 of the 27 brazilian states including the federal district lula won in 13 and bolsonaro in 14 lula had the most votes in the nine states of brazil s impoverished northeast while bolsonaro won in every state in the midwest the south and in three of the four states in the southeast sunday s election also chose the governors of 12 brazilian states along with the right wing união brasil party whose origins date back to the ruling party of brazil s military dictatorship the pt was the party with the most elected governors it won in the four northeastern states it already ruled bahia rio grande do norte piauí and ceará in são paulo brazil s largest and richest state the pt s candidate for governor fernando haddad was defeated by bolsonaro s ally tarcísio de freitas lula s victory was hailed by leaders of imperialist powers and the self proclaimed leftist presidents of latin america which in recent years has seen a return to power in several countries of bourgeois nationalist politicians linked to the pink tide congratulations dear lula on your election that begins a new chapter in the history of brazil french president emmanuel macron wrote on twitter german chancellor olaf scholz tweeted i look forward to close and reliable cooperation in november of last year lula met with macron and scholz on a trip to europe that sought the legitimization of his candidacy by the european imperialist powers us president joe biden wrote i send my congratulations to luiz inácio lula da silva on his election to be the next president of brazil following free fair and credible elections i look forward to working together to continue the cooperation between our two countries in the months and years ahead the new york times also hailed lula s victory after endorsing his candidacy in an editorial on thursday titled brazil s presidential election will determine the planet s future in his speech after the announcement of the election results lula emphasized that he intends to form a government of national unity with the political right to rebuild brazil his victory he said was the result of an immense democratic movement that was formed above political parties personal interests and ideologies so that democracy would emerge victorious he claimed that the fight against hunger was the number one priority of his government while also promising to reestablish dialogue between government businessmen workers and organized civil society and to regain the credibility predictability and stability of the country so that investors national and foreign will regain confidence in brazil recognizing lula s efforts to win the support of the section of the bourgeoisie which opposed him and to form a government beyond the pt the são paulo stock market closed up on the first day after the election and the dollar was down regarding policies for the amazon lula made a point in his speech that was a signal to the imperialist governments especially those of macron and biden who had criticized bolsonaro s management of the rainforest we are open to international cooperation to preserve the amazon whether in the form of investment or scientific research lula declared on paulista avenue in são paulo where lula s supporters celebrated the victory of the pt candidate lula also said that in any place in the world the defeated president would have already called me to concede defeat but so far he hasn t i don t know if he will call and i don t know if he will acknowledge it twenty four hours after lula s victory on sunday night bolsonaro had still refused to comment on the election results his ominous silence comes on top of the military s refusal to present the conclusions of its parallel count of the vote before the inauguration of the new president this intervention by the armed forces was initiated on the basis of false allegations of a risk of fraud at the polls the coming weeks will be marked by an escalation of political tensions in the brazilian state and society the week before the election had already seen new attempts by bolsonaro s supporters to cast doubt on the legitimacy of election results last monday bolsonaro s campaign organizers and his minister of communications fabio faria alleged that radio stations in the northeast had stopped broadcasting their electoral propaganda giving an advantage to the pt candidate politicians linked to the fascistic president among them his son eduardo bolsonaro used these allegations as a pretext for demanding that the elections be postponed the superior electoral court tse found that the accusations were backed by no evidence in a flagrant attempt to make it harder for voters to reach the polls on election day the federal highway police prf conducted more than 600 operations against public transportation half of them in the states in the northeast the decision to organize the blockades came directly from the president on october 19 who met with the justice minister who oversees the prf a ruling by tse president alexandre de morares the day before the elections prohibiting operations that interfered with the transportation of voters was provocatively ignored by the prf the tse has sought to avoid a confrontation by declaring that the illegal operations did not alter the electoral outcome both bolsonaro and the military are looking for a pretext to advance their authoritarian agenda after his electoral defeat last week the far right gazeta do povo website published an article titled military worries about disorder in the streets after sunday s vote count the article stated the perception among active and reserve military personnel speaking to gazeta do povo is that an eventual defeat of bolsonaro at the polls could further inflame the spirits of voters and lead them to the streets in demonstrations and protests against the tse and the supreme court stf in this case the report continued the armed forces would be responsible for establishing order by means of an operation to guarantee law and order retired general maynard santa rosa former head of the secretariat of strategic affairs of the presidency of the republic at the beginning of the bolsonaro administration was quoted in the article i think it s not only possible but probable if there is some climate of uprising and conflict that gets out of the control of the civil authorities it is possible that there will be a participation of troops it is worrying i think we are in a climate of potential crisis initial demonstrations of this character began shortly after the announcement of the election results with bolsonaro supporters blocking roads across the country especially in regions dominated by sections of agribusiness and corporations linked to the fascistic president as of early monday afternoon 81 protests had been registered on highways in 14 states across brazil the protesters some identified as truck drivers have as their main demand an intervention by the military in brasilia traffic on the esplanade of the ministries was blocked by the public safety secretariat of the federal district after identifying a possible act scheduled for the location on social networks in addition to the seats of the legislative and executive branches the supreme federal court one of the main targets of bolsonaro s threats is located on the esplanade should lula make it through the turmoil that is expected in the coming months he will lead a government even more to the right than his previous two administrations 2003 2011 and one marked by deep political instability the latest developments confirm the warnings of the socialist equality group gsi about the grave dangers facing the brazilian working class they reinforce its call for a mobilization of the working class independent of the pt and its pseudo left apologists to counter the escalating threats of dictatorship

washington president joe biden on monday accused oil companies of war profiteering as he raised the possibility of imposing a windfall tax on energy companies if they don t boost domestic production biden in brief remarks criticized major oil companies for making record setting profits while refusing to help lower prices at the pump for the american people the president suggested he will look to congress to levy tax penalties on oil tax companies if they don t begin to invest some of their profits in lowering costs for american consumers the president issued the warning just days before the nov 8 midterm elections my team will work with congress to look at these options that are available to us and others biden said it s time for these companies to stop war profiteering meet their responsibilities in this country and give the american people a break and still do very well biden took aim at one company exxonmobil that reported 19 7 billion earnings in the third quarter alone he lashed at the irving texas headquarter company for using record profits to provide shareholders with hefty dividends and stock buybacks but failing to invest in production improvements that would benefit consumers at the pump another oil company chevron had 11 23 billion in profits in the third quarter almost reaching its record profits in the prior quarter over the last two quarters exxonmobil chevron shell bp conocophillips and totalenergy earned over 100 billion in profits more than they earned all of last year and more than two and a half times what they earned in the same quarters of 2021 oil companies record profits today are not because of doing something new or innovative biden said their profits are a windfall of war a windfall for the brutal conflict that s ravaging ukraine and hurting tens of millions of people around the globe advertisement high prices at the pump have exacerbated inflation and have taken a toll on biden and democrats standing among voters congress would have to approve any additional taxes on the energy producers which would be a tall order in the current congress where democrats have narrow control of the house and senate and even less likely should republicans retake one or both chambers on nov 8 americans have struggled with painfully high gasoline prices in recent months paying more than 4 80 on average for a gallon of regular at the beginning of july according to aaa they ve since fallen to 3 76 on average nationally but the white house says they should be lower given declines in global oil prices over the same period can t believe i have to say this but giving profits to shareholders is not the same as bringing prices down for american families biden tweeted on friday biden has been critical of energy companies profits since at least june when he complained publicly that exxon made more money than god this year biden s threat of windfall taxes on energy companies follows calls by progressive democrats including bernie sanders and elizabeth warren for such a proposal advertisement and last week california gov gavin newsom called on congress to tax the profits of oil companies crude oil prices are down but oil and gas companies have jacked up prices at the pump in california this doesn t add up newsom said on friday we re not going to stand by while greedy oil companies fleece californians instead i m calling for a windfall tax to ensure excess oil profits go back to help millions of californians who are getting ripped off the democratic controlled house passed a bill in may authorizing the federal trade commission to punish companies that engage in price gouging and adding a new unit at the ftc to monitor fuel markets the bill has stalled in the senate a related measure by senate commerce committee chair maria cantwell d wash has not come to the senate floor for a vote this is exactly the type of leadership we ve been waiting for from president biden said jamie henn spokesperson for the group stop the oil profiteering big oil has made nearly 300 billion in excess profits this year by gouging us at the pump a windfall profits tax can provide immediate relief by redirecting that money into the pockets of hardworking americans industry groups have condemned the prospect of a windfall tax with american exploration production council ceo anne bradbury saying it would likely backfire by further driving up energy costs for american families and businesses rather than taking credit for price declines and shifting blame for price increases the biden administration should get serious about addressing the supply and demand imbalance that has caused higher gas prices and created long term energy challenges said mike sommers president and ceo of the american petroleum institute today the president is proposing to raise taxes on the u s natural gas and oil industry that is competing globally to produce the fuels americans need every single day oil

washington the federal reserve may reach a turning point this week as it announces what s expected to be another substantial three quarter point hike in its key interest rate its fourth straight fed officials will likely engage in a fraught debate over whether it may soon be time to slow its rate hikes which are intended to cool the worst inflation in four decades but are also raising the risk of a recession at a news conference wednesday after the fed s latest meeting chair jerome powell could signal a forthcoming shift to smaller rate increases doing so would give officials time to assess the impact of the hikes powell won t explicitly spell out the fed s likely next moves but economists say he could acknowledge that officials are discussing a downshift to a half point rate increase in december the fed s hikes have already led to much costlier borrowing rates ranging from mortgages to auto and business loans those higher loan costs have weakened the home market in particular the average rate on a 30 year fixed rate mortgage which was just 3 14 a year ago topped 7 last week for the first time since 2002 mortgage buyer freddie mac reported sales of existing homes have fallen for eight straight months fed officials have stressed that they need to raise rates significantly to tame inflation which has caused hardships for millions of households high inflation has also become a central point of attack for republicans against democrats in the midterm congressional elections advertisement yet some economists have said the fed should soon consider scaling back the fastest pace of rate increases since the early 1980s it is time to think about calibrating these rate hikes said diane swonk chief economist at kpmg as the fed moves closer to finishing its rate increases she said it makes sense to not be hitting the brakes so hard the fed s benchmark short term rate stands in a range of 3 to 3 25 in september policymakers forecast that they d raise it by an additional 1 25 percentage points by year s end that timetable suggests a three quarter point hike on wednesday and a half point increase in december one concern for the fed is that if it suggests it could ease its credit tightening the financial markets might conclude that it will soon stop raising rates altogether and perhaps cut them next year stock and bond prices would move higher countering the fed s efforts to slow the economy fed watchers say there are two ways the central bank could avoid raising any misplaced optimism officials could send a tough anti inflation message wednesday by reiterating a point from the minutes of their september meeting the minutes showed that the policymakers preferred to err on the side of raising rates too high rather than raising them too little and risk perpetuating high inflation another possibility is that in december when policymakers will update their economic forecasts they could pencil in an extra quarter point rate hike early next year to underscore their determination to curb inflation which reached a punishing 8 2 in september advertisement one reason the fed might begin pulling back soon is that some early signs suggest that inflation could start declining in 2023 consumers squeezed by high prices and costlier loans are starting to spend less supply chain snarls are easing ocean freight costs have plunged 67 in the past year which means fewer shortages wage growth is plateauing which if followed by declines would reduce inflationary pressures for now though many fed officials have said they see few signs inflation is coming down in a sustainable way we need to see actual progress in core inflation and services inflation and we are not seeing it yet neel kashkari president of the federal reserve bank of minneapolis said recently core inflation excludes volatile food and energy costs and is considered a good reflection of underlying price pressures a few have sounded more optimistic notes fed vice chair lael brainard listed several reasons inflation would likely fall soon including price cuts by retailers to clear excess inventories as a result she said moving forward deliberately would help the fed determine how the economy is handling its rate hikes and how many more might be needed and mary daly president of the san francisco fed noted recently that the central bank won t be carrying out three quarter point rate hikes indefinitely the time is now to start talking about stepping down daly said advertisement most of the signs of easing inflation have emerged in private sector data sources including websites that track rents and home prices some economists think fed officials will have to assign greater weight to such sources in the coming months the data firm apartmentlist for example said rents in new leases fell from august to september for the first time this year even tracked over the past 12 months the still high 6 8 increase in rents was far less than the 12 month increase of 17 1 that was measured a year ago yet in the government s consumer price index housing costs are still rising at the fastest pace in decades that reflects what many people are experiencing apartment dwellers who are now renewing leases likely face higher rents than they did a year ago the slowdown in housing costs will eventually feed into the government s data though it could take a year or longer many economists think the fed will have to take those slowing housing costs into account before then kathy bostjancic chief u s economist at nationwide said that as interest rates reach levels that slow growth and real time data show slowdowns in rents and wages fed officials need to be looking through the front windshield not the back and be more careful with their rate increases other central banks have already started pulling back the bank of canada raised rates by only a half point last week even though a three quarter point hike was expected the european central bank raised its key rate by 0 75 percentage point but signaled that its increases could cool these moves contributed to expectations that a dovish pivot is coming for all global central banks said economists at td ameritrade send questions comments to the editors previous next filed under

before the last couple of years the spectacular rise in chinese housing prices was underpinned by ultra fast growth in incomes with expectations of future growth pushing prices ever higher if income growth stalls china s residential and commercial real estate prices could collapse like a house of cards taking down the banks and the local governments that have been furiously lending to the sector many particularly in the media seem to believe that china s recent real estate meltdown including the spectacular default of property developer evergrande can be attributed to government efforts to crack down on excessive credit but it would be more accurate to say that by and large government policies have propped up housing prices for example by limiting citizens ability to invest in other assets real estate prices are falling simply because decades of overbuilding have left supply outstripping demand in many areas excessive state control after all is a tried and true recipe for becoming mired in the middle income trap that chinese leaders have long vowed to avoid china s economic growth has been slowing for years but recently the decline has accelerated given the external and internal headwinds china is facing the international monetary fund s forecast that the economy would grow by 4 4 per cent in 2023 after 3 2 per cent expected growth this year seems optimistic the government s strategy of cracking down on tech companies and education entrepreneurs while supporting state sponsored investment projects looks more like an instrument of control than a sensible economic strategy that could move china closer to becoming a high income economy advertisement moreover the fact that china s growth strategy is proving less effective means that it needs to invest greater amounts to achieve the same rate of gdp growth per person decreasing returns on real estate and infrastructure investments are among the main drivers of the collapse in chinese productivity especially since 2014 china s problems recall the soviet union s diminishing returns on its investments in steel plants and railroads and japan s construction of bridges to nowhere in the late 1980s and 1990s after decades of building real estate at breakneck speed soaking up raw materials from all over the world china now finds itself with a housing and commercial real estate stock similar to those of much wealthier countries such as germany and france alas gone are the days when china could rationalise soaring housing prices and endless new construction by pointing to rising incomes true china can avoid some of the protracted problems that defaults in the west often trigger and which can take years to resolve owing to the government s tight control over the legal system the government controls key information and seems to treat data on home and apartment vacancy rates which could shed light on the extent of overbuilding as a state secret but the scale of the problem is such that not even the chinese government can hide its effects even though it will undoubtedly try china and the global economy appear to be at a turning point heightened political tensions together with deglobalisation look set to slow productivity and raise long run inflation worldwide forward looking indicators of long term real interest rates have shot up while the stunning rise of the us dollar continues to expose financial fragilities given that europe is headed for a deep recession and that the united states seems to be headed for a slump as well china cannot count on exporting its way out of its real estate driven slowdown advertisement it is very much in the world s interest that china finds a solution to its real estate sector s overbuilding problems and avoids prolonged economic instability more than two years ago at a time when the overwhelming consensus in academic and policy circles was that china could easily overcome the adverse legacy of overbuilding i suggested that the country had likely hit peak housing today with the chinese government even less inclined to adopt market oriented reforms a smooth landing seems less likely than ever project syndicate
president joe biden s administration is taking stock of a newly empowered xi jinping as the chinese president begins a third norm breaking five year term as communist party leader with u s chinese relations already fraught concerns are growing in washington that more difficult days may be ahead xi has amassed a measure of power over china s ruling party unseen since mao zedong the leader from 1949 until his death in 1976 xi s consolidation of power comes as the united states has updated its defense and national security strategies to reflect that china is now america s most potent military and economic adversary biden takes pride in having built rapport with xi since first meeting him more than a decade ago when they served as their countries vice presidents but biden now faces in xi a counterpart buoyed by a greater measure of power and determined to cement china s superpower status even while navigating strong economic and diplomatic headwinds we re not back in the mao era xi jinping is not mao said jude blanchette chair of china studies at the center for strategic and international studies but we are definitely in new territory and unpredictable territory in terms of the stability and predictability of china s political system biden and xi are expected to hold talks on the sidelines of next month s group of 20 summit in indonesia a long anticipated meeting that would come after nearly two years of tense relations the leaders are dug into winning the upper hand in a competition that both believe will determine which country is the leading global economic and political force driving the next century there s an awful lot of issues for us to talk to china about said national security council spokesman john kirby he added that u s and chinese officials have been working to arrange a meeting of the leaders though one has yet to be confirmed some issues are fairly contentious and some should be collaborative kirby said biden and xi traveled together in the u s and china in 2011 and 2012 and they have held five phone or video calls since biden became president in january 2021 but the u s china relationship has become far more complicated since those getting to know you talks over meals in washington and on the tibetan plateau a decade ago as president biden has repeatedly taken china to task for human rights abuses against the uyghur people and other ethnic minorities beijing s crackdowns on democracy activists in hong kong coercive trade practices military provocations against self ruled taiwan and differences over russia s prosecution of its war against ukraine xi s government has criticized the biden administration s posture toward taiwan which beijing looks eventually to unify with the communist mainland as undermining china s sovereignty and territorial integrity the chinese president also has suggested that washington wants to stifle beijing s growing clout as it tries to overtake the u s as the world s largest economy external attempts to suppress and contain china may escalate at any time xi warned in his address before the communist party congress we must therefore be more mindful of potential dangers be prepared to deal with worst case scenarios and be ready to withstand high winds choppy waters and even dangerous storms dali yang a political scientist at the university of chicago who researches chinese politics said there are some potentially stabilizing developments emerging in the relationship after months of rancor two of china s best known diplomats in washington were elevated at the communist party meeting foreign minister wang yi was selected for the communist party s politburo the policymaking body made up of the 24 most senior officials china s ambassador to the u s qin gang is joining its central committee their elevation should bring a measure of continuity to the u s china relationship yang said yang noted there has also been an effort on the part of the communist party leadership to tone down its warm embrace of russia last month after meeting with xi on the sidelines of a summit in uzbekistan russian president vladimir putin acknowledged that xi had expressed concern and questions about the war in ukraine with his third term confirmed in some ways xi is now freer to act and less encumbered in terms of no longer having to always watch what his rivals are doing yang said i think that actually may affect his approach and may make him more comfortable in dealing with biden white house officials have played down hopes that xi s new five year hold on the communist party could give him breathing room to more fully engage on matters where china has some overlapping interests with the u s biden during a meeting with defense department officials on wednesday stressed that the u s was not seeking conflict with china hours later chinese state television reported xi told members of the national committee on u s china relations that beijing should find ways to work with washington on issues of mutual concern the conciliatory moment was short lived the following day u s and chinese officials were trading rhetorical shots about the u s move earlier this month to expand export controls on the sale of advanced semiconductor chips to china the u s has overstretched the national security concept and suppressed china s development and normal business cooperation has been politicized and weaponized wang hongxia counselor at the chinese embassy in washington told reporters her comments came not long after a top commerce department official undersecretary alan estevez said at a washington forum that if i was a betting person i would put down money on the u s imposing additional export controls on china china s economy is slowing with beijing reporting this month that growth for the first nine months of the year was 3 putting it on pace to fall well below its official full year target of 5 5 the country s economy is also dragging from strict zero covid rules and beijing is confronting a deceleration in exports and home prices that fell to a seven year low in september it also faces increased competition from a u s and european union that are investing tens of billions of dollars to compete on semiconductors and other technologies all of this points to the possibility that china might not eclipse u s gross domestic product by 2030 as many economists have forecast ruchir sharma chairman of rockefeller international recently concluded that with its likely growth trajectory china would exceed the u s economy by 2060 if it manages to do so at all at the same time secretary of state antony blinken as well as the u s chief naval operations officer adm mike gilday have recently expressed concern that beijing may try to step up its timeline to seize taiwan blinken said china had made a fundamental decision that the status quo was no longer acceptable china has largely refrained from criticizing russia s war in ukraine but also has held off on supplying moscow with arms still the conflict has raised concerns in taiwan that china which has never controlled the island might be further emboldened to move on its long stated plan for unification u s china tensions have been further enflamed by house speaker nancy pelosi s august visit to taiwan and biden s remark in may that the u s military would defend taiwan in case of an attack by china comments the white house later played down what s concerning now is that with xi s unlimited power and ambition he may use taiwan to distract from his internal problems said keith krach a former undersecretary of state during the trump administration i hope he s looked at the courage of the ukrainians and reckoned that the people of taiwan are just as courageous perhaps even more so credit associated press ap photo credit ap

patrick mcmullan via getty images the economist s rhetorical style the economist magazine is a treasure i read it every week carefully they re good especially on china e g great even courageous coverage of faulty covid statistics and china s vast undercounting of covid infections and mortality and lately a solid critical perspective on the quality problems with chinese economic data good also on matters related to banking and finance their bread and butter as you might expect and always interesting to see how they triangulate american political issues much less afflicted by the group think that vitiates much american reporting but the best thing about the magazine is its avoidance usually of the good vs evil narrative framework that clouds so many accounts of the workings of capitalism in less economically literate media outlets recommended as the part of every diet that said there are the quirks in their style which may be about english ness or british ness or it may be a product of the magazine s legacy and its 181 year old reputation as a rather above middle brow publication with a flair for financial insider know how one of those quirks that i notice more and more is their on the one hand on the other hand ism the tendency to state a strong thesis on the one hand and then to undercut that thesis the other hand by citing critics with other views or by raising the possibility that the trends they have cited will self correct or that the facts they bring up may have interesting alternate interpretations this fair balanced formula is a common journalistic practice and the economist performs it adroitly for the most part it is bland enough that it may not catch the reader s attention but i find its effect is often that i finish an article and i m not quite sure what their take away is supposed to be the argument may flip back and forth several times in just a few paragraphs it is kind of the opposite of and some respects the antidote to the more polemical pov point of view treatment that prevails in many other media channels still this forced even handedness is not always helpful sometimes the on the one hand argument is clear enough but the other hand the counter arguments can seem superficial or contrived e g cyclicality in the semiconductor industry some topics lend themselves especially to this rhetorical idiosyncrasy the semiconductor industry is known as in everyone thinks they know it to be highly cyclical with huge booms followed by severe busts on a more or less regular basis chart by author prices are unstable with price declines lagging volume declines excluding the post pandemic anomaly chart by author the instability of the revenue stream is why semiconductor companies for all their technological glamor often trade at a significant discount to pedestrian businesses such as consumer staples or retail intel for all its tech prowess and strategic importance has a price to earnings ratio 65 lower than kellogg and its cornflakes even highflying nvidia trades at a 10 discount to costco a mere retailer the rationale usually cited is that both kellogg and costco have constructed very stable revenue streams easy to model predictable year after year the semiconductor industry does not have a stable revenue model it s the perfect story for the one hand other hand treatment cyclicality sets up a standard narrative in which the point seems to be to figure out which side of the cycle we are on now or which will prevail at some point in the future will the chip industry enjoy a period of expansion and prosperity or descend into a trough of bloated inventories devastated profit margins and cutthroat competition this bivalent or ambivalent reporting style is on display in the piece in the latest issue of the magazine in a story entitled provocatively the american chip industry s 1 5 tn meltdown the looks nightmarish micron a maker of memory chips reported a 20 fall in sales amd slashed its sales estimate by 16 intel plans to lay off thousands following a string of poor results that are likely to continue when it presents its latest quarterly report on october 27 th the result could be a diminished american industry with less global clout and too much capacity a shaky foundation on which to build america s future the industry is notoriously cyclical three easy answers the economist attributes this disvaluation to three all too easy analytical tropes 1 fear of enabling china chip tech embargo will cause china to invest more and become a competitor become more of a threat even achieve tech leadership is a recipe for trouble if america s policies speed up china s efforts to resolutely win the battle in key core technologies as president xi jinping affirmed in a speech to the communist party congress on october 16th they may give rise to powerful chinese competitors enough to keep you awake in terror at night china could retaliate further restricting access to its market it is already redoubling efforts to nurture domestic champions such as smic in logic chips and ymtc in memory which may one day challenge america s silicon supremacy 2 market distortion chips act is simply going to create a glut and a prolonged slump by unbalancing supply and demand the chips act which became law in august to cheers from chip bosses is stimulating the supply side of the semiconductor business just as the biden administration is stepping up efforts to stop american made chips and chipmaking equipment from going to china dampening demand the combination of more supply and less demand is a recipe for trouble 3 structural volatility the 3rd fallacy is that standard cyclical pattern in the chip industry will persist that it is structural and unfixable a presently recurring nightmare driven by consumer whims and moods the cyclical slump has so far been felt most acutely in consumer goods pcs and smartphones inflation weary shoppers are buying fewer gadgets inflation weary shoppers buying fewer gadgets is that what they do this is where you can see the thinness of the counterargument when is a cycle not a cycle none of this is true first of all the china threat is an illusion yes it is that simple china is incapable of challenging for tech supremacy in chips any time soon and perhaps never as i explained in a recent lengthy interview with the mercatus institute of george mason university second the chips act subsidies whatever else they accomplish or fail to accomplish will amount to only about 5 of the capital investment program already forecast by the private sector its potential for distortion is small moreover the revenue cycle and the capital expenditure cycle to the extent that they are cycles of the classical sort see next point do not align the chips act will have its affect two or five years down the road the revenue cycle will have entered a completely different phase by that point third the chip industry cycle itself is different this time in its classical form the vicious cycle was driven by the so called whiplash effect when manufacturers are tightly coupled to narrow market segments small changes downstream demand for finished goods in the consumer market propagate back upstream into much bigger swings in demand for components the bullwhip effect is a supply chain phenomenon where orders to suppliers tend to have a larger variability than sales to buyers which results in an amplified demand variability upstream in part this results in increasing swings in inventory in response to shifts in consumer demand as one moves further up the supply chain wikipedia wikipedia a bullwhip cycle begins with actual changes in consumer buying patterns but that is not what is happening now the cause of the current glitch in the industry and the term glitch refers to its peculiar causal nature not to its insignificance is rooted in the pandemic shock which led to three unusual patterns 1 panic by manufacturers who are customers of the chip industry that is purchases by manufacturers that were not driven by accurate understandings of changes in consumer demand the best example is the auto industry which misjudged consumer demand severely and then tried to overcorrect by excessive purchases and hoarding behaviors panic buying amid last year s chip shortage has left many manufacturers with too much silicon between april and june industrial firms stock of chips was about 40 above the historical level relative to sales intel and micron have blamed weak results in part on customers high inventories taiwan semiconductor manufacturing co warned of excessive inventory at its clients over the rest of the year and beyond company ceo c c wei said customers have taken actions to clear hefty chip inventories that were built as a buffer against the massive uncertainty in supply chains following the outbreak of the covid 19 pandemic 2 buy ahead behaviors by locked down remote working consumers which drew future revenues that is what would have been today s sales in 2022 forward into 2020 or 2021 firms like intel which in february told investors it expected pc demand to grow steadily for the next five years are revising their outlooks as it becomes clear that many covid era purchases were simply brought forward 3 geopolitics china which imported 400bn worth of semiconductors in 2021 intel s chinese sales made up 21bn of its total revenues of 79bn last year nvidia said that an earlier round of restrictions which curbed sales of advanced data centre chips to chinese customers and to russia after its invasion of ukraine would cost it 400m in third quarter sales equivalent to 6 of its total revenues to repeat the classic cycle in any cyclical industry is driven by changes in end user demand that is not what has happened here three factors combine to account for today s chip cycle and the diminished valuations that the market is placing on chip manufacturers the economists 1 5 trillion shock number bloated inventories created by panic buying hoarding etc mean reduced demand for a time consumers accelerating their purchases which nota bene is the exact opposite of the normal cyclical trigger which is driven by a reduction in demand reducing demand for a time geopolitically driven government policies to prohibit sales of advanced chips to china haircutting revenue possibly permanently from missiles to pc s to everything the strategic factor that is overlooked here is the immense diversification of the semiconductor market in the last decade or so chip war a new book by chris miller provides a breezy overview of the history of this vital modern technology it is instructive and interesting to be reminded that the original applications of semiconductors were all military uses icbm missiles and the like i remember at the beginning of my career meeting with the guys who later created qualcomm they were under contract to my company at the time and hearing how their business had started with providing technology to decode the signals from deep space probes it is amazing now the consumer application breakout for the chip industry was based on a limited selection of specialized consumer products starting with texas instruments and hewlett packards calculators and evolving into the personal computer which dominated the 1980 s and 1990 s it was a large but narrow market and small changes in the end user environment made and broke major semiconductor companies in the day that day is not today today the semiconductor industry has become a supplier to manufacturers of just about every conceivable kind of consumer product from kitchen appliances and automobiles to smartphones and home security systems the industry s customer base has diversified enormously it is no longer simply driven by pcs and servers the market for chips has expanded by an order of magnitude as the engineers say and then some it has also deepened and by the laws of scale and diversity the volatility of demand will inexorably decline the revenue stream will become more stable and as the market recognizes this the valuations on the sector will become more like kellogg or costco
team transitory is gone meet team overcorrection federal reserve chairman jerome powell has been challenged by a number of well known economists who have called on the central bank to relax in its fight against inflation for example jeremy siegel the russell e palmer professor of finance at the wharton school of the university of pennsylvania said recently that he would give the fed a d for its handling of the economy arguing that they are now overcorrecting in tightening to combat inflation jim paulsen chief investment strategist at the leuthold group recently said the fed has gone rogue in its fight against inflation harvard economist greg mankiw recently endorsed a column by new york times columnist paul krugman arguing that the fed is braking too hard right now the fed seems set to pursue further big rate hikes in the coming months i would urge it to look hard at what s happening and think twice krugman wrote the grumbling from politicians is also getting louder ohio democrat sen sherrod brown who chairs the senate banking committee which has jurisdiction over the fed sent a letter to powell last week that all but accused the fed chief of abrogating the central bank s duty to maintain maximum employment brown wrote that potential job losses brought about by monetary over tightening will only worsen these matters for the working class what s more the stock market has experienced a historic run in october largely on the belief that the federal reserve will pivot away from tightening in the months ahead coming into this week october was shaping up to be the best month for the dow jones industrial average since january of 1976 according to several wall street analysts this has been the best october since 1901 the main argument among those who think it is time for the fed to back off from hiking or at least signal that it will back off is that the effects of tightening monetary policy are felt with a lag so if the fed continues to raise rates until it sees inflation come down significantly it will wind up over tightening and causing an excessive downturn instead they would have the fed take a step back and watch if the hikes put in place this year are working to bring down inflation the noises are even coming from inside the house the federal reserve has tightened policy strongly to bring inflation down and u s tightening is being amplified by concurrent foreign tightening fed vice chair lael brainard said in a speech this month we are starting to see the effects in some areas but it will take some time for the cumulative tightening to transmit throughout the economy and to bring inflation down powell is not alone of course larry summers has an op ed in the washington post monday arguing that the fed s critics are wrong and that it will take significantly higher rates to bring down inflation to the federal reserve s two percent target if they believe that interest rates above 4 percent in an economy with 7 percent core inflation will cause a recession serious enough to reduce inflation below the fed s 2 percent target they need to explain why i find it absurd summers writes with his characteristically delicate approach the summers op ed makes the argument that progressive policy goals depend on defeating inflation first regaining price stability at as low a cost as possible is far from sufficient to maximize american economic performance but it is necessary only from a foundation of price stability can we meet the profound challenges of speeding up growth including all americans in prosperity and maintaining american leadership at a dangerous global moment policymakers must not flinch he writes it is all but certain that the federal reserve s federal open market committee on wednesday will announce a 75 basis point raise in its target to a range of 3 75 and four percent powell s challenge on wednesday will be to convince markets that not only is he not going to flinch but that pushing rates even higher is the right thing to do for the economy
