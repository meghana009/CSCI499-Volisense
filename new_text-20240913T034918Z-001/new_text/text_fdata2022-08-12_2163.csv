evaluating the company s financial performance as it measures our ability to generate additional cash from our business operations fcf should be considered in addition to rather than as a substitute for net income as a measure of our performance or net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity additionally our definition of fcf is limited and does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other obligations payments made for business acquisitions amounts spent to buy back shares or pay dividends therefore we believe it is important to view fcf as supplemental to our entire statement of cash flows

emergent biosolutions bayview plant has a contract to bulk produce four covid 19 vaccines that are not yet authorized but waiting in the wings including one from johnson and johnson that appears close the bayview plant was built with government money for just such a pandemic need jerry jackson baltimore sun tns stars and stripes is making stories on the coronavirus pandemic available free of charge see more stories here sign up for our daily coronavirus newsletter here please support our journalism with a subscription baltimore tribune news service the tally of wasted covid 19 vaccine continues to climb at the troubled emergent biosolutions plant in east baltimore and now exceeds a half billion doses according to findings a congressional panel released thursday on the manufacturer once central to the u s coronavirus pandemic response the new total includes an additional 135 million doses dumped over quality deficiencies that were discovered after operators of the bayview facility had pledged to address problems identified by federal regulators and had resumed manufacturing it is deeply disappointing that emergent after collecting millions in taxpayer dollars and having many months to fix the serious manufacturing problems plaguing their baltimore facility has yet to competently perform the essential task they committed to perform said rep james e clyburn the chairman of the select subcommittee on the coronavirus crisis which has been probing the plant s issue for more than a year their continued failure has hampered vaccination efforts in areas of the world where vaccines are still in short supply the south carolina democrat said in a statement emergent executives clearly have a great deal of work to do to eliminate these systemic problems at their company rockville based emergent had been given 163 million in 2015 to build and prepare the baltimore plant to produce vaccine for any pandemic despite early warnings about readiness investigators say officials in the trump administration awarded emergent a 628 million contract to make covid 19 vaccines developed by astrazeneca and johnson johnson the biden administration canceled the deal last year after the u s food and drug administration flagged manufacturing troubles and paused production since then some batches of vaccines have been cleared for use some overseas because astrazeneca hasn t been given authorization for use in the united states the fda asked astrazeneca to move production elsewhere and had johnson johnson take over manufacturing of its vaccine at the plant the one shot johnson johnson vaccine is one of four vaccines now authorized here but it s used far less than the vaccines from moderna and pfizer biontech the novavax vaccine was only recently authorized the congressional subcommittee has been sorting out what went wrong at emergent biosolutions and issued two previous reports the findings released thursday found the total discarded doses is now 525 million due to contamination expiration or other issues previous reports found quality control issues abounded and company officials had sought to hide some problems emergent has said it s been fully cooperating with inspectors and has disputed some of the findings though officials have said they warned federal regulators about the difficulties of making two different vaccines at once on thursday matt hartwig a spokesman said in a statement that the company remains committed to being a trusted partner of the u s and allied governments helping to supply medical countermeasures for biological chemical and nerve agent attacks he noted that johnson johnson was in charge of manufacturing the vaccine at the plant from april 2021 until it stopped in early 2022 hartwig also disputed the number of discarded doses reported by the congressional subcommittee saying it s difficult to estimate dose equivalents for discarded batches while unfortunate a batch of drug substance may test out of specification for a variety of reasons whether during the manufacturing process or after the process is complete rigorous testing and reporting when such events occur is critical and it is what happened in the case of the single batch of j j drug substance found to be out of specification in march 2021 he said to equate these quality control actions with a discarded dose figure displays a lack of understanding regarding the biomanufacturing process emergent continues to produce other vaccines and therapeutics at other facilities for both the government and private vaccine makers one product gaining national attention is the smallpox vaccine acam2000 that emergent has a long term contract to supply to the strategic national stockpile it s now being deployed to counter the monkeypox outbreak though due to significant side effects it s not being as widely used as another vaccine the bayview plant which produces bulk vaccines that are put in vials and packaged at other facilities remains at the center of the covid vaccine controversy in addition to the congressional investigation emergent faces lawsuits by shareholders who say officials made false claims about their capabilities to inflate the stock price the company s stock price had peaked at 134 in august 20202 but plunged after the news broke that the company needed to dump vaccine doses it sank by about half as the lawsuit became known in april 2021 and has hovered in recent months around 30 a share emergent officials previously said the lawsuits are without merit in the congressional committee s latest release officials said there was a batch from the 135 million johnson johnson doses made between august 2021 and february 2022 that failed inspection rendering all the vaccine unusable the vaccine had been sequestered at the time of the committee s last report in may johnson johnson said previously that it was cooperating with the investigators and thursday said it no longer produces vaccine at bayview johnson johnson has provided formal notice of termination of our agreement with emergent due to emergent s continued breaches including its failure to supply drug substance for our covid 19 vaccine the company statement said the quality and safety of our covid 19 vaccine are paramount no vaccine doses containing emergent drug substance produced after the restart of the bayview facility in august 2021 have been released to any market the committee found that emergent officials said they had corrected deficiencies before resuming production in august 2021 but problems persisted the european union south africa and canada also said emergent s processes did not meet quality standards the committee investigation which began in april 2021 has relied on hearings with emergent officials site visits and documents from the company vaccine makers and federal health agencies the latest release said trump administration officials said during testimony that they were unaware of the extent of the company s failures before awarding emergent the vaccine contract though earlier inspections already had warned of substantial evidence of non compliance with good manufacturing processes and mold poor disinfection of plant equipment and inadequate training of bayview employees once again our committees have found evidence that unacceptable and irresponsible business practices by emergent biosolutions have limited our ability to meet the urgent global need for coronavirus vaccines said rep carolyn b maloney chairwoman of the committee on oversight and reform companies benefitting from taxpayer dollars intended to produce vaccines must put the public good first the new york democrat said in a statement by repeatedly failing to meet quality standards even after being notified of serious problems emergent biosolutions has wasted hundreds of millions of vaccine doses and violated the public s trust officials say the emergent investigation continues 2022

article allarity therapeutics inc nasdaq allr is a clinical stage oncology therapeutics company founded in denmark in 2004 by chief scientific officer steen knudsen ph d â it is pursuing a personalized medicine approach to build upon the success of its drug response predictor drpâ companion diagnostic platform to advance oncology therapies oriented towards combination therapies â the company offers a portfolio of three priority drug candidates and plans to pursue a phase ib ii study in metastatic ovarian cancer starting in 4q 22 with both stenoparib and dovitinib â with executive leadership from ceo james g cullem allarity is taking a new approach to oncology drug development that relies on identification of cancer patients likely to respond to a drug based on an individualâ s tumor cell transcriptome â this approach addresses some of the key drawbacks of conventional biomarker approaches which fail to recognize the multifactorial drivers behind cancer and lack clinical validation â allarity therapeutics offers pipeline programs addressing significant markets in metastatic ovarian cancer moc metastatic breast cancer mbc and potentially metastatic renal cell carcinoma mrcc among other indications â we will introduce you to allarityâ s drpâ companion diagnostic platform its combination therapy approach and the drivers for the companyâ s future success â drug response predictor drpâ platform the use of biomarkers predicting patient response is widespread â biomarkers can be based on genetics mutations hormone receptor status presence of enzymes and tumor markers to name a few â most of these approaches are one dimensional fail to recognize cancer as a mechanistically and biochemically diverse disease and lack clinical validation â to address this shortcoming allarity has developed its drpâ platform technology to identify cancer patients that are most likely to benefit from a specific drug â before a drug specific drpâ â biomarker can be used as a companion diagnostic to select and treat cancer patients it must be clinically validated using patient tumor biopsies â the process ensures that the biomarker can identify responder patients and improve their therapeutic benefit as compared to patients not selected by the drpâ companion diagnostic after passing the arduous validation process the drpâ companion diagnostic is ready for use in clinical trials with developmental or approved drugs subject to regulatory requirements and approvals â stenoparib and dovitinib drpâ â s success has propelled stenoparib and dovitinib into their positions as lead candidates in the companyâ s pipeline initially addressing moc in combination â combination therapy has emerged as the leading edge of cancer treatment as it addresses the multifactorial nature of a tumor â by employing drugs that use different mechanisms combination therapy decreases the likelihood that a part of the tumor will escape the action of a drug and proliferate allowing the cancer to return â combination therapies also provide synergies that can increase the success of a treatment regimen when used together that exceed the summed benefit when used alone based on the data generated to date and potential mechanism of action synergy allarity expects to launch a phase ib ii combination study in moc with stenoparib and dovitinib in second line or later patients â the trial should begin in 4q 22 ovarian cancer allarityâ s lead indication for its combination approach is second line or later patients in metastatic ovarian cancer â â ovarian cancer ranks 5th in cancer deaths for women and will affect an estimated 20 000 this year in the united states 1â around the globe it is ranked 8th for women with more than 313 000 new cases in 2020 2â about 90 of ovarian cancer is in epithelial tissue and most of these cases are high grade and advanced â risk factors for ovarian cancer include smoking hormone therapy early menstruation late menopause obesity and family history â symptoms are not obvious but pelvic pain back pain and gastrointestinal related discomfort are associated with the disease â treatment for ovarian cancer includes surgery and chemotherapy as well as newer approaches including immunotherapy and targeted therapy â immune checkpoint inhibitors such as pembrolizumab keytrudaâ are therapeutic options â antiangiogenic agents in the form of monoclonal antibodies and parp inhibitors are also used to treat the tumor â a brilliant cut with multiple clinical stage drug candidates allarity therapeutics avoids being reliant on the success of any single program and presents investors with several opportunities to drive the companyâ s future success allarityâ s lead therapeutic programs benefit from the synergies of combination therapy and the precision medicine approach achieved through drpâ companion diagnostics which identify those cancer patients that will respond best to a therapeutic while bypassing treatment for non responders â next steps for the oncology companyâ s lead programs are the start of a phase ib ii study first identifying the optimal dose of the combination of stenoparib and dovitinib in moc followed by an initial efficacy study â second line metastatic ovarian cancer is a difficult and serious disease with a material unmet need that will be aided by allarityâ s program if successful â these phase ii assets may advance into pivotal trials guided by drpâ companion diagnostics providing additional opportunities in oncology and recognition of this diamond in the

autonomous truck portion of the market formed new oss advisory board comprised of retired high ranking military officials and corporate executives with decades of experience in ai and unmanned

up 7 sequentially and up 23 over the same year ago quarter â stated oss president and ceo david raun â œthe strong growth in q2 was largely attributable to two factors the continued strength of our customer in the media and entertainment space where revenue grew 135 to a record 6 4 million and the exceptional performance of our european unit bressner which continued to leverage strong inventory investments and drive market share expansion resulting in its revenue increasing 31 to 7 6 million â œaligned with our strategy to bring more standard products to the ai transportable market we shipped our centauri product that we announced in april to one of our autonomous truck customers centauri is a pcie gen 4 nvme rugged storage solution offering high capacity in a proprietary compact hot swappable canister which makes it ideal for capturing and transporting the vast amount of data generated in autonomous vehicles â œalso on the technology front we are one of the first developers to ship pcie gen 5 technology this is key to our ai transportable and technology leadership strategy since it doubles the performance of pcie gen 4 our plan includes deploying this next gen technology in multiple additional oss products over the coming quarters including our next innovative product we are planning to announce at the autonomous vehicle technology expo in san jose california in september â œoss is currently supplying compute and or storage solutions to three of the leaders in the level 4 and 5 long haul hub to hub market our products work in conjunction with their software to gather store and or process data from multiple sensors embedded around the vehicle including lidar radar and cameras â œwe believe all three of these customers could end up in our top 10 customer list in 2022 and over time could be some of our largest accounts although our relationship and what we supply varies we continue to learn and lead the market as we define next generation products â œbeyond autonomous trucks we have keen interest and activity with other vehicles including shuttles buses and ships we also continue to see the opportunity for ai transportables to be significant in the armed forces and throughout the military theater such applications take significant time to close and even more time to generate revenue but we are now engaged with multiple high profile programs which include drones aircraft ships and land vehicles â œthese applications are perfect for disruptive solutions from oss where we can provide high performance without compromise in compact rugged form factors we look forward to sharing more on this front as we turn these opportunities into major program wins over the quarters ahead â outlook for the third quarter of 2022 oss expects revenue of approximately 18 5 million which would represent 16 growth over the third quarter of last year q2 2022 financial summary revenue in the second quarter of 2022 totaled 18 3 million up 23 compared to 14 9 million in the same year ago quarter the core oss business revenue increased 18 to 10 7 million in the second quarter representing 59 of total revenue revenue from bressner ossâ european subsidiary increased 31 to 7 6 million which represented 41 of total second quarter revenue bressnerâ s increase was attributable to increased market share made possible by strong sales efforts and strategic inventory buys gross profit in the second quarter increased 548 000 to 5 2 million the gross margin for the core oss business decreased 3 7 percentage points from the same year ago quarter to 33 0 this was largely due to the strength of record media and entertainment revenue which has lower margin bressnerâ s gross margin percentage also decreased slightly to 21 9 in the second quarter compared to 22 6 in the same year ago quarter primarily due to increased material and transportation costs overall gross margin was 28 4 in the second quarter compared to 31 2 from the same year ago quarter the aggregate 2 8 percentage point decrease from the prior year quarter was primarily due to increased revenue from the lower margin media and entertainment customer and strong bressner revenue overall quarterly operating expenses increased 16 to 4 8 million while operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased to 26 2 compared to 27 7 in the same year ago quarter this increase in operating expense was primarily due to the companyâ s investments in pursuing the ai transportable market resulting in increases of 246 000 in marketing and selling expenses 244 000 in r d expense and 173 000 in g a expenses gaap net income totaled 323 000 or 0 02 per diluted share decreasing from net income of 1 7 million or 0 09 per diluted share in the same year ago period that included a one

of 25 from 28 2 million in the first half of 2021 the increase was due primarily to an increase in shipments of product to the companyâ s media and entertainment customer core oss business increased

9 1 million or 32 2 of revenue in the first half of 2021 gross margin for the core oss business decreased to 34 3 as compared to 37 3 in the first half of 2021 this is largely due to the 80 year over year revenue increase from the companyâ s media and entertainment customer bressner s gross margin decreased to 21 5 due to higher transportation and material costs as compared to 23 6 a year ago for the second half of 2022 oss expects a slight improvement in overall gross margin compared to the first half of 2022 total operating expenses increased 12 to 9 3 million this increase is primarily due to an increase of 549 000 in selling and marketing expense resulting from additional marketing trade shows and travel and an increase in r d expense of 656 000 for the development of new standard products for the ai transportables market these increases were partially offset by a decrease of 210 000 in g a expenses operating expense as a percentage of revenue decreased to 26 3 compared to 29 4

measures the company believes that the use of adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization or adjusted ebitda is helpful for an investor to assess the performance of the company the company defines adjusted ebitda as income loss before interest taxes depreciation amortization acquisition expenses impairment of long lived assets financing costs fair value adjustments from purchase accounting stock based compensation expense and expenses related to discontinued operations â â adjusted ebitda is not a measurement of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states or gaap because of varying available valuation methodologies subjective assumptions and the variety of equity instruments that can impact a companyâ s non cash operating expenses the company believes that providing a non gaap financial measure that excludes non cash and non recurring expenses allows for meaningful comparisons between the companyâ s core business operating results and those of other companies as well as providing the company with an important tool for financial and operational decision making and for evaluating the companyâ s own core business operating results over different periods of time â â the companyâ s adjusted ebitda measure may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in the companyâ s industry as other companies in the companyâ s industry may calculate non gaap financial results differently particularly related to non recurring unusual items the companyâ s adjusted ebitda is not a measurement of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to operating income or as an indication of operating performance or any other measure of

barbosa group ceo of natura co declared in my first few weeks as group ceo i have focused mainly on two priorities the first is redesigning natura co s organizational structure to make it lighter and leaner at this stage we have mapped significant savings at the holding company level if the company had implemented those changes last year the impact would have been an annualized reduction of at least 40 in recurring corporate expenses other changes and estimated savings will be announced later the second is a review of the governance model and ways of working within natura co with the holding company strongly concentrated on defining key performance indicators monitoring and tracking the performance of more autonomous brands leading the allocation of resources within the group and continuing to promote our 2030 commitment to life sustainability vision we are confident that a leaner and a more agile structure built on a strong foundation of accountability for results will empower the business units to respond with agility to their current strategic and market challenges at the same time we are strongly focused on improving the fundamentals of our underperforming businesses which we regard as our principal challenge and main upside driver though we expect our businesses revenues to trend better in the second half of the year we believe the challenges in the macro environment will persist and our margins will remain pressured in the short term in this context our clear and immediate priority is to focus on margins and operational cash flow and the teams at all our brands and businesses are mobilized and incentivized on those clear goals performance by business unit natura co latam s net revenue was up 5 6 at cc 0 4 in brl in q2 the natura brand

listen to this article listen to this article some policy experts believe louisiana is one of the better positioned states to take advantage of clean energy provisions in the inflation reduction act that congress is expected to pass this week with 485 billion in new spending offset by 790 billion in revenue and savings the legislation includes the nation s largest ever investment in clean and renewable energy and significant reductions in health care costs for people covered under the affordable care act and medicare the bill is expected to receive final passage in the house friday before heading to the white house for president joe biden s signature with more fossil fuel and petrochemical facilities than most other states louisiana could be at the forefront of significant transformations in energy production and industrial manufacturing that the bill would usher in texas and louisiana will be some of the better positioned states said david dismukes professor of environmental sciences at lsu everybody s kind of got their hand in the pie on this from chemical manufacturers pipeline companies to permitting companies and lawyers after more than a year of wrangling senate democrats surprised capitol hill watchers late last month when they announced a breakthrough in negotiations over the inflation reduction act with sen joe manchin iii d west virginia the moderate has single handedly halted key parts of his party s legislative agenda since democrats took control of congress in 2021 with vice president kamala harris s tie breaking vote the senate passed the bill sunday sending a scaled down yet still transformative version of the bill back to the house for final approval among a long list of energy related provisions the bill most notably extends and expands the investment tax credit and production tax credit on clean energy projects including solar wind hydroelectric geothermal nuclear hydrogen produced by renewables stand alone energy storage such as utility scale lithium batteries and other forms of emission free electricity generation it creates a manufacturing tax credit for equipment such as solar panels wind turbines battery cells and other components produced in the u s extends the carbon capture tax credit to 2033 and lowers the requirements to allow more facilities to qualify the bill expands offshore oil and gas leasing while imposing certain fees for the release of excess emissions industrial facilities outside of the energy sector such as chemical and cement manufacturers can earn tax credits if they use clean energy technologies in their manufacturing processes dismukes said the wide swath of proposed tax credits would be very appealing to louisiana s industrial companies and other sectors that support and do business with those companies there s a lot of different layers in the industry that can benefit from this dismukes said from carbon capture all the way down to storage we re just in a better position to do that compared to other places around the country those tax credits will remain in effect until 2032 or once annual greenhouse gas emissions from the production of electricity in the united states is equal to or less than 25 of current emissions whichever is later companies can receive higher rates on the tax credits if they meet certain wage and apprenticeship requirements if they use materials produced in the u s or by siting projects in low income areas referred to as energy communities rep troy carter sr d louisiana said the energy communities provision of the bill could benefit black households which spend more of their income on energy and experience a median energy burden 64 greater than white households so this is also an environmental justice concern carter said in an email this bill is the most aggressive action in history to combat the existential crisis of climate change which is threatening louisiana s coast people culture and infrastructure the health of many louisiana communities are threatened by the dangerous pollution and toxins from domestic fossil fuel production carter said the tax credits could push louisiana s burgeoning wind power industry over the top an opinion shared by southern renewable energy association director simon mahan the ira will turbocharge the renewable energy industries in louisiana mahan said renewables are inflation busters because the fuel is free by being unaffected by global commodity markets ratepayer s electric bills will be lower and more predictable on the consumer side the bill extends tax credits on purchases of new and used electric vehicles energy efficient appliances home solar panels and other so called green home systems the louisiana mid continent oil gas association has taken a cautiously optimistic position as it reviews the changes that the bill will usher into the energy industry lmoga welcomes the positive progress on gulf of mexico lease sales and the inclusion of provisions that address the energy transition creating more operational certainty for our industry and encouraging continued investment in low carbon solutions such as carbon capture and sequestration lmoga president tommy faucheux said in a statement faucheux said lmoga remains cautious about tax policies that might hinder long term investments but added louisiana and the gulf of mexico are uniquely positioned to provide affordable reliable secure energy to meet american needs while simultaneously reducing our carbon footprint republicans including both of louisiana s senators have criticized the bill claiming it will raise taxes and do nothing to curb inflation in a statement sen john kennedy called it a massive tax and spending bill and sen bill cassidy said it would hurt average americans this legislation does nothing to decrease inflation but raises the tax bill falling on everyday americans cassidy said in a statement the bill raises taxes only on the nation s wealthiest corporations by implementing a 15 tax on the earnings they report to shareholders and a 1 tax when companies buy back their own stock to the benefit of wealthy shareholders and executives this proposed tax policy is specifically geared to target a few dozen large corporations such as amazon exxon mobil bank of america and others that have paid little to no taxes on their profits by exploiting loopholes according to a list compiled by the center for american progress tax policy experts are divided on whether the legislation will reduce inflation a study by the conservative leaning tax foundation warned that the new tax burden on those corporations could indirectly trickle down to hurt workers and average americans manchin who has previously joined with gop senators in halting many other policies proposed by democrats pushed back on the republicans claims telling fox news last week that taxes will not be raised for regular americans how in the world can you be raising taxes when all we re saying is the wealthiest corporations in america 55 of them pay zero to help this great country of ours to defend ourselves manchin said other policy experts agree the bill could reduce inflation by stemming the price volatility of fossil fuels such as natural gas which has been a huge driver of inflation the non partisan research group resources for the future rff conducted modeling that projected a 5 7 drop in retail electricity prices with the average household saving 170 to 220 over the next decade compared to a scenario without the inflation reduction act a study from the committee for a responsible federal budget a bipartisan group of former congressional budget experts reported the bill is likely to ease inflationary pressures over the next decade slashing the federal deficit by 305 billion cutting net taxes by 2 billion and reducing net spending by 15 billion the bill would slash deficits by nearly 2 trillion over the next two decades the report said

executive officer thank you robert and good morning everyone privia health delivered another strong quarter of growth and our highly aligned provider partnership model continues to gain momentum highlighted by our 31 5 growth of implemented providers from a year ago we expect to continue expanding our number of provider partners increase distributed lives and into new markets over the coming quarters while also driving profit margin expansion by leveraging our capital efficient operating structure we are executing on multiple opportunities to extend our market reach drive future growth and positively impact care delivery with continued momentum in existing markets we remain highly confident in our growth outlook for 2022 and beyond as we continue to organize physicians into scaled networks across our country this morning i ll present an overview of key business highlights and then david will discuss our recent financial performance and updated outlook for 2022 before we take your questions privia health is continuing to execute at a very high level practice collections increased more than 67 in the second quarter reaching over 615 million we generated a record quarter of 15 5 million and adjusted ebitda of 55 when compared to the second quarter of last year showing the scale of our operating model while we continue to invest across our enterprise to support this accelerated top line growth this business momentum and high forward visibility into our growth metrics are reflected in our updated financial guidance for 2022 our balance growth is being driven by continued same store growth and strength in ambulatory utilization across all our existing practice locations we generated another solid quarter of new provider additions in existing markets in combination with the sustained high level of provider retention in addition our business development pipeline remains robust as we look to enter many new markets over the next few years on an industry note in early july cms released the proposed 2023 medicare physician fee schedule rule overall we believe the proposals are a net positive for privia in particular cms made a significant endorsement of the medicare shared savings program and some of the changes positively impact both privia providers and their patients cms has been vocal in its support having recently said it wants to use mssp as a chassis for growth and care transformation launched 10 years ago the medicare shared savings program now serves 11 million patients across 525 000 providers the structure of the program has evolved over the last five to seven years into one of the most successful cms and cmmi programs we continue to prove our success in the program by lowering costs and improving outcomes thereby generating shared savings for cms as well as for privia and our provider partners as i noted our business momentum has continued to be extremely encouraging across both existing and potential new geographies our national footprint now includes more than 3 500 implemented providers caring for over 3 9 million patients in more than 890 locations across eight states and the district of columbia our scale and geographic density are also defined by the breadth of medical specialties as i noted last quarter we approached while approximately 60 to 65 of our practice partners are primary care focused including internal medicine family practice pediatrics and ob gyns we actually partner with over 50 specialty types this enables us to offer our primary care providers and our payer partners as well as consumers a broad ambulatory care delivery network that can improve patient outcomes and reduce costs across the value based care spectrum our operating model and strategy have led privia to have one of the broadest most balanced and well diversified balance care value based care platforms in the industry our more than 80 at risk contracts now cover approximately 856 000 attributed lives across commercial medicare and medicaid programs this is up 15 8 from a year ago giving us a lot of momentum and visibility and the remainder of 2022 as you know we take upside and downside risks and many of our payer contracts covering nearly two thirds of our attributed medicare live across our mssp and medicare advantage programs with this thoughtful move the risk continues to provide significant opportunities for top line and ebitda growth as we execute on our goals to earn greater shared savings in the years to come now i ll ask david to review our recent financial results and updated 2022 outlook david mountcastle chief financial officer thank you shawn our operating model again delivered an outstanding performance in the second quarter of 2022 highlighting both the scale of our operations and our continued business momentum our 31 5 growth in implemented providers and 15 8 increase in value based attributed lives combined with solid ambulatory utilization trends led to all of our financial results coming in above expectations practice collections increased to 615 5 million up 67 6 from q2 a year ago care margin increased 36 6 and adjusted ebitda was a record 15 5 million up 54 8 over the same period last year as expected our top line grew slightly faster than ebitda again this quarter due to the new capitated arrangements as well as investment across our business enterprise to support this accelerating top line growth at the same time the operating leverage in our model is clearly apparent as our top line and care margin growth is translating nicely into ebitda growth and margin expansion our adjusted ebitda margin as a percentage of care margin increased 240 basis points from a year ago to reach 20 4 for the first half of 2022 practice collections increased 65 5 to almost 1 2 billion care margin was up 36 5 and adjusted ebitda grew 51 8 to reach 30 3 million for the first half of the year our capital resources continue to be very strong given the cash flow dynamics of our business in june 2022 the company repaid all of its outstanding debt with cash on hand our balance sheet included cash and cash equivalents of 292 2 million and our 65 million revolving loan facility remains in place available and undrawn as of june 30 2022 given our first half performance business momentum and visibility through the rest of 2022 we have a high level of confidence in our updated financial guidance we now expect practice collections gaap revenue and care margin to be at the high end of our guidance ranges we raised our platform contribution guidance to a range of 137 million to 142 million and also raised our adjusted ebitda guidance to a range of 57 million to 60 million an 8 3 increase at the midpoint our year end implemented provider guidance is now expected to be in the mid to high end of our range and our guidance for attributed to lives is now at the midpoint of our range our growth outlook includes only previously announced new market entries and we continue to expect 90 plus of our adjusted ebitda to convert to free cash flow with capital expenditures of less than 1 million in 2022 we remain focused on growing and expanding our business and continuing to execute on our multiple growth initiatives this includes growing existing practices increasing attribution in risk based contracts adding new providers identifying opportunities to expand our platform and opening new markets over time with that operator we are ready for the first question questions answers operator your first question comes from the line of joshua raskin from nephron research your line is now open joshua raskin nephron research analyst hi thanks good morning my question i wanted to follow up on the comment you made about this medicare the physician fee schedule and the proposed changes around the mssp program i m curious do you think they re short term benefits from some of the benchmark changes do you think that helps and then i m curious if you guys are in a position where the changes to the risk score cap actually impact you as well shawn morris chief executive officer hey josh this is shawn good to hear your voice as we without getting into all the details of it as we talked about it s proposed we re going through all this we think it s there are a lot of beneficial things to within the proposed remarks but the biggest thing probably is that it s just as we ve talked a lot about in the past it s a huge endorsement the way cms wants to kind of invest in mssp in these changes and i think some of the ones you mentioned are positive for privia as we ve had one of the largest most successful acos in the country and our experience over the last seven years is it s been very positive and it s continuous and headed in that direction so they ll continue to evolve it and the changes you mentioned are positive for us parth mehrotra president and chief operating officer and josh just to add it s not a program where risk adjustment as a big factor averages scores around one or thereabouts so that s what differentiates us it s relative performance and it s harder to execute so we re pretty happy with how we perform here joshua raskin nephron research analyst ok that s helpful and then if i could follow up i know it s early but i know you guys have a pretty good lead time on implemented providers so i m just thinking just curious on your thoughts going into 2023 you had sort of a big bump at the end of last year i don t know how they ended this year based on guidance seems like a sort of continued steady march upward but i m just curious 2023 how we should be thinking about that and specifically if there are any new market entries that you guys are expecting david mountcastle chief financial officer yeah thanks so obviously we re not giving 23 guidance today what i would say is as we sit at this time of the year pretty much everybody that s expected to be implemented this year is already sold so that gives us a lot of good visibility and that s reflected in the guidance we provided our sales pipeline and execution have been ahead of our expectations this year and we continue to see a lot of momentum so as we close out the year with new providers being added across all of our eight states that gives that will give us very good visibility as we enter 23 and we expect to continue to see that momentum going in the existing markets and then obviously this guidance does not reflect any new markets that we may enter the business development pipeline is pretty robust similar to last year again the timing is uncertain but as and when we execute those arrangements we ll announce them and we ll update the guidance appropriately and that could impact that metric into 2023 joshua raskin nephron research analyst gotcha it sounds like there are a couple of big ones in the pipeline and you re talking sort of similar to what we ve heard in the past but tough to figure out the timing shawn morris chief executive officer thanks jess next question please operator your next question comes from the line of a j rice from credit suisse your line is now open a j rice credit suisse analyst thanks hi everybody maybe i ll just follow up on that last one when you think about 2023 you mentioned some of the you mentioned some in response to josh s questions but what are some of the big puts and takes when you think about the outlook what are the biggest swing factors in your mind as to where we might end up and looking at 2023 for businesses parth mehrotra president and chief operating officer yeah it s parth appreciate the question look again generically speaking the drivers are as we ve stated in the past its growth in our existing markets it s a pretty broad footprint a lot of them left we continue to add new providers so that obviously factors really well a lot of same store growth in the existing providers that are already implemented both on the fee for service book adding attributed lives in existing markets and then moving them further down the spectrum of risk so it s pretty multipronged on the existing base of business and then obviously as we execute on business development and new markets similar to what you saw last year when we announced california montana that accelerates growth even farther so it just depends on where we end this year we re focused on just executing pretty strongly really happy with what we ve done in the first half year positioned us really want to close this year out strong and then we continue to execute here in the next few months and see what 2023 brings the one generic comment we ve obviously given is our long term guidance of 20 practice collections growth and 20 ebitda growth and obviously we are growing much faster than that this year as you can see as a lot of those drivers hit pretty well last year and this year so there ll be some years where we grow faster some slower we re obviously focused on accelerating that growth as much as we can as soon as we can but you ll have variability year over year over the long term 10 plus years at least that s what we see ahead of us as we re in eight states we have 42 to go so lots more to go a j rice credit suisse analyst ok maybe just the follow up question a lot of mixed messages this quarter across providers across people broadly in your space and around utilization trends i just wondered if you could comment both on your risk and your fee for a service business anything to call out and underlying utilization trends that you re seeing are there any areas of surprise or something to highlight parth mehrotra president and chief operating officer sure so to break it out on the fee for service book ambulatory utilization very similar to our comments in the last few quarters have been running ahead of our expectations we think that is good utilization with patients seeing their primary care provider pediatrician and ob gyn in the community that s been running ahead of our expectations our guidance assumes that that normalizes so obviously we re trying to be prudent and it s been tough to predict in and out of covid as has been the case with everybody but we prefer on the side if you re wrong there s an upside and not a downside the inpatient utilization obviously has been also very difficult to predict that impacts a value based book again our guidance and accruals reflect what we see today and we try and again be prudent with our assumptions there s a lot more variability in the inpatient utilization you ve seen that in the comments from others in the industry and again it s a tough tough environment to just predict that so we ll see how it plays out a j rice credit suisse analyst ok thanks a lot shawn morris chief executive officer thanks a j operator your next question comes from the line of lisa gill from j p morgan your line is now open lisa gill jpmorgan chase and company analyst hi thanks very much good morning congratulations on the quarter i m wondering if you can maybe just give a little more detail around the value based care lives that the 15 or 16 growth what areas are you seeing growth that would be the first question and then secondly as we think about the improvement in the adjusted ebitda what are some of the key drivers are you starting to see leverage in the business model or is there something else that you would call out as we think about that that improvement being that the biggest of the line items that you called out for improvements in the back half of the year parth mehrotra president and chief operating officer thanks for the question lisa so on the first question the growth is broad based as you can compare quarter over quarter year over year we are focused and i think that s where we differentiate from a lot of peers we are focused on commercial ma and mssp attribution as well as medicaid so all four buckets are important to us we are trying to add lives across those four there can be some variability quarter over quarter in the mix but ultimately we are focused on the full patient panel which i think really diversifies our book and is a key source of differentiation it s also impacted by which providers we are adding and which markets and what the mix is in that particular geography and that could influence it a little bit quarter over quarter especially as we add new markets and ramp them up but again our focus is on growing all of those four buckets from an attribution perspective and then hopefully moving to increased levels of risk in all of those so that s your first question on the second one again look at we re really proud that the business already operates at a pretty good scale while we are just in a stage if you look at any of our metrics a number of locations that close to 900 number of patients at close to 4 million and 3 500 providers attributed lives over 850 000 and our book of business is at scale and there s a lot of room to grow so where we are at today is a pretty nice point where if we see an acceleration in the top line that is ahead of our expectation you can see that translating into very good operating leverage down the p l which is what we like to see now we obviously don t invest in the business and capitalize on the growth opportunity that s ahead of us like i just mentioned 42 more states to go and so there ll be quarters where we prudently increase the level of investment if we open up new markets and so on so forth and of the guidance but as we see that top line momentum it s all across the p l where we see good operating leverage lisa gill jpmorgan chase and company analyst great thanks for the comments shawn morris chief executive officer thanks lisa operator for our next question it comes from the line of adam ron from bank of america your line is now open adam ron bank of america merrill lynch analyst hey thanks for the question going back to that fee for service revenue and i guess the revenue at the point in the quarter it looks like based on the guidance that you kind of touched on conservatism in the back half but it looks like there s 46 of your practice collections in the second half versus 56 last year and 53 in 2020 so just wondering how that seems very counter to how i would think about utilization trending as people kind of hit their deductible in q4 generally being the highest utilization quarter is anything else you would call out in terms of the slowdown in your expecting parth mehrotra president and chief operating officer no nothing in particular again we are being prudent everything that we see doesn t point to any material difference from how this operated last year and again look we are at the midpoint of the year and we ve guided toward the high end of the range like i said if these trends continue again we ll update our guidance in three months here but nothing that we see is different from what we saw last year adam ron bank of america merrill lynch analyst so you re saying that position utilization is above your expectations but like what specifically makes you think that it s the actual utilization itself that is elevated enough that you re just gaining share on the same store basis and parth mehrotra president and chief operating officer i think that s a good point i think it s a combination of both obviously all our locations are they have some spare capacity and if there s increased demand we are able to absorb it i think we have gained market share at the care center level given the strength of our business and our practices and how they ve come out of covid i think we ve increased patient panels at each provider level in aggregate overall so we see all of that strength playing out and again it s hard to predict some of these trends the overall level of utilization on a per patient basis and then increases in the number of patients at the provider level if they are growing same store growth on top we continue to also see telehealth which is about 10 of the mix it s pretty stable it s in the ambulatory fee for service book again all of those i think both pretty well for how we are set up and if those continue we ll update guidance again in three months adam ron bank of america merrill lynch analyst all right great operator for your next question it comes from the line of richard close from canaccord your line is now open please ask your question richard close canaccord genuity analyst thanks for the questions congratulations i was wondering if you could just provide us an update on the new markets you entered last year west texas and bass i know there s a period of time where you re selling and investing in potential new providers just curious about how that sales process is going now that we call it two plus quarters into it parth mehrotra president and chief operating officer yeah thanks richard appreciate you joining despite your conference all three markets are up and running california west texas and montana as we end each of those with an anchor partner in a group joining us bass medical group in california abilene index in west texas and then great falls clinical surgery partners in montana so all of those are live and we have started our sales effort in all of the markets we have sold our first provider groups in these markets and we are on our way obviously that just takes time to ramp up the effort on the ground but they re going as expected and obviously montana and west texas are smaller towns but we re really excited about california a big state with a big population and we think we can really grow that medical group pretty meaningfully in the years to come so we re really excited about it richard close canaccord genuity analyst and just to follow up shawn on the your comments on the new market potential it seems maybe a little bit more bullish although it was bullish in the first quarter any big changes with respect to the pipeline that you can call out from maybe three months ago shawn morris chief executive officer yeah i mean richard we remain bullish i guess to use your words pipeline s robust it s we ve talked a lot about the core model kind of in position groups we re still very excited about the health system approach so not to get overly specific about what s in our pipeline but it s a good cross section it s geographically dispersed it s across those the two i talk about so if you look at our history these things come in at different times and it s not we re not selling a widget so we were out there selling a solution and they take time but at the same time we re very excited about the pipeline itself richard close canaccord genuity analyst great congratulations thank you shawn morris chief executive officer thanks for joining we know you re busy today richard close canaccord genuity analyst thank you operator your next question comes from the line of whit mayo from svb securities your line is now open please ask your question whit mayo svb leerink partners analyst hey thanks maybe just first on the two new full risk contracts how did those track versus expectations what did mlr look like i don t have your q yet but just maybe any early learnings or observations now that you are sort of six months into standing up a full risk bearing entity shawn morris chief executive officer yeah thanks for the question yeah again yeah we re again we re still really early into those contracts and we re taking a i would say a conservative approach in how we re recording things so at least today we recorded and again you ll be able to see this in our q that 100 of the revenue we ve taken in we ve recorded expense again we re recognizing zero care margin from the business so far really only have about four months of data was some tale out of 12 and so again just sort of taking it pretty conservative at this point but again i think we feel good about the business and again as we get more data from those programs where i think we re looking to see them take off whit mayo svb leerink partners analyst yeah maybe just to follow up are you finding any additional interest from existing affiliated groups today to explore these arrangements i m just sort of curious like how we kind of think about 2023 2024 and perhaps the penetration of new full risk contracts and i have one other follow up sorry parth mehrotra president and chief operating officer yeah it s parth so look i mean at every point very evaluating what part of the book do we move into it enhanced level of risk could be capitation could be just enhancing the level of risk that we take without being capitated and i think that just goes by payer by payer geography by geography and medical group by medical group we re looking for good density in each market in our pools and that s a discussion we continuously have with both providers as well as well as our payer partners so we re going through that discussion right now for 2023 and obviously we will update the one thing i would say is our criteria as we ve been very clear to take on more risk is always to ensure that at a minimum we re not economically and from an ebitda standpoint worse off and ideally we are doing it to enhance the level of ebitda earnings and share savings so that s a fundamental criteria we re not going to do it just to recognize top line practice collections or revenue we ll do it when it makes sense and when we think it is a good financial decision for our physicians as well as the payers and privia whit mayo svb leerink partners analyst that makes sense ar days grew two times faster than revenue can you kind of flesh out what s going on there i presume some of that may be influenced by some of these capitated contracts but i m not sure david mountcastle chief financial officer yeah i would tell you it s a combination of the capitated contracts and if you want to think about how our shared savings accruals work we re at q2 we re at whatever 18 months of accruals related to 21 because again we keep looking at those and then as we look at 22 we put in additional accrual so when we get for example mssp which we re expecting hopefully in q3 maybe early q4 you ll see a bunch of that receivable come down but we re we kind of get to a high point on receivables especially related to shared savings because we ve just got so much accrued in that number as of the end of q2 whit mayo svb leerink partners analyst ok so it s not really a bad number then ok all right david mountcastle chief financial officer no whit mayo svb leerink partners analyst thanks a lot shawn morris chief executive officer thanks whit operator your next question comes from the line of gary taylor from cowen your line is now open please ask your question gary taylor cowen and company analyst hey good morning i just want to ask a question about patient attributed slides small picture question and a big picture one the small picture is just i think the aco lines were down about 4 000 sequentially we had seen a sequential decline there back in my model so just wondering what that small change was and what the bigger picture one is sort of look at this quarter i think gross practice collections are up north of 60 providers year over year providers up like 32 and attributed lives up 16 i don t think that s a long term growth algorithm so i just wanted to see kind of as we think about modeling 23 and 24 and trying to hit that 20 long term guidance on growth practice collections i would imagine practice collection lies and providers are all tying a little closer together than we re seeing right now so just wanted to make sure i m understanding that parth mehrotra president and chief operating officer yeah thanks gary it s parth so on the first question there ll always be some quarter over quarter variability in the mssp book as these are ppo kinds of lives there s also some movement from two ma from the mssp book as those patients can move and then the third factor could be if some patients in the first half just simply haven t come in from coming for their pcp visit cms classifies them as non assignable and you can t count them in the period but when that happens you count them again so again the movement is pretty small and i think that worries us again our guidance range was pretty tight and so i think that s kind of the short term near term question that you had on the longer term question the model is we add providers in existing and then obviously a new market and the attribution then follows so california has a great example that the medical group that we partnered with bass doesn t have a big value based book today not a lot of attribute lives even though it s about 400 providers so the mix of providers matters and the market matters but over time that s a really good market to do a lot of value based care as we know and as we add more primary care providers in california as the existing providers add more patients and attributed lives the attribution follows the provider growth the third aspect then will be the level of shared savings and the profile of the contracts we get into so even with the same attributed lives over the course of two three four or five years you can expect the level of shared savings to increase in the same program and our mssp book is a perfect example in the mid atlantic if you look at the history over seven years publicly available data with cms you can see we ve grown both attribution the level of shared savings and the actual percentage of savings under the benchmark so you can see the value for life or the yield for life increases over time and then obviously in the ma book there s a much more pronounced revenue recognition when you move into capitation and that s what you saw with about 25 000 30 000 lives this year as we entered those contracts so it s a multi pronged answer to bridging top line practice collections to the provider and attribution but that s the algorithm essentially and again that plays out over multiple years so it s tough to pinpoint what happens in one particular year a lot of the growth in california would likely come from the subsequent years even though we entered the market last year hopefully that helps gary taylor cowen and company analyst it does thank you operator for our next question it comes from the line of david larsen from btig your line is now open please ask your question david larsen btig analyst hi congratulations on another very good quarter when we think about 2023 can you maybe talk a little bit about some of your large largest groups i mean how are satisfaction levels what percentage of revenue do some of your largest groups make up and is there any risk that some of those large groups that you re either in the process of implementing or implementing now may for whatever reason switch off of your platform due to like m a activity or anything else just any color around that would be very helpful thank you parth mehrotra president and chief operating officer thanks david it s parth as we showed in slide 5 our satisfaction levels are pretty high one of the highest we ve seen since the beginning patient nps is 84 provider nps is 57 they are tough graders but 57 is pretty high no matter what benchmark you use our attrition is at a record low again close to a record low across all markets give or take and that just is a great metric for us to crack internally we don t disclose it externally but so all of those things point to really good satisfaction ultimately our value proposition is very roi driven the providers are making more take home pay at the end of the day and having pretty robust patient panels we re moving them into value based care and adding a lot of value to their overall practice in the functioning of the practice and efficiency productivity and so on and so forth so we re not worried about m a activity and folks buying out our groups we don t have a very big concentration we had the one group that had left us prior to us going public in 2020 that we had disclosed and again that was if somebody wants to come in and pay a big check we ve said we re not going to chase it but again our practices are joining us in a very self selected manner they are vehemently independent and our health system partners are also very progressive in the way that they are thinking about partnerships with us so that gives us a very diversified book and as we grow there s no really no single practice that really we have any concentration risk from that perspective shawn morris chief executive officer hey david this is shawn i will add a little color we ve over the years we ve talked a lot about physicians are the customers of privia in their care centers and we strive to when you in any business when your customers are referring you other potential customers be that in part through the how we grow that same store growth additional providers in existing markets the addition of doctors and existing care centers and even growing new markets you re on to something special you can always improve but you ve headed in the right direction with that over half of our additions come from doctors referring colleagues to privia and i mean if you think about it and somebody asked a question in the last quarter about how does the inflation factors and is it kind of different will it what do you think from a driving business perspective and any time there are i guess tough things going on in the economy people are looking for partners and solutions to help and we believe that i mean we ve seen it through covid and we believe that s going to continue to play out in the next few years as the economy kind of gets back on its feet david larsen btig analyst great thanks very much and then one more quick follow up for the cap revenue it sounds like you have four months of data i like how you re not assuming any margin there what s the risk of a loss though how do you know you re being sort of conservative enough with that four months of data that you have is that within budget or is it over budget what is that telling you thanks parth mehrotra president and chief operating officer yeah it s parth look i mean when you and the risk business we ve said very clearly it s called risk for a reason that there is always a potential for loss there s a potential to have good savings generically speaking again we re not going to go into any particular contracts or what the data are saying for four months and so on so forth our view has been you enter into these arrangements with the hope that you will do better than when you would just take an upside only risk and you re not on the downside on any hope so our hope is that we underwrite these properly that there is not much potential for downside but anomalies can happen and events can happen that can impact the book again year over year but from a long term perspective we feel pretty good as we are moving into these contracts that we can perform in them and again the diversity of our book also prevents any one particular contract from really impacting the p l in a big way and i think we re differentiated in that respect given we are taking we re doing value based care across commercial mssp ma and medicaid and capitation is just part of the business david larsen btig analyst ok congrats on a good quarter thank you shawn morris chief executive officer thank you operator for your next question it comes from the line of taji phillips from jefferies your line is now open please ask your question taji phillips jefferies analyst hi good morning this is taji on for brian and thanks for taking my question today so first to start i m just curious can you give some color on the factors that drove the beat and specifically clarify operational metrics that came in higher than your original expectations parth mehrotra president and chief operating officer yes sure it s parth look it was pretty broad based which is what we like to see the fee for service book performed ahead of our expectations and the utilization trends were ahead of our expectations as we just stated on the value based side again we are our accruals reflect all the information we have and that s been ahead of our expectations so that s reflected there and then that outperformance is reflected down the p l given the scalability of the business and the inherent operating leverage so as we have been meaningfully profitable in free cash flow positive and we re managing the expense base pretty prudently investing where we need to and some of this outperformance if it happens translates nicely into bottom line metrics so it was fairly broad based all across and that shows our confidence we paid all our debt from that and we feel pretty confident in the future here taji phillips jefferies analyst great thanks parth and then just one more question i was thinking about your specialty offering can you provide some detail on patient demand or specialties that are driving the highest patient demand or healthcare utilization and how that s informing how you target additional providers for inclusion in your network parth mehrotra president and chief operating officer sure so look obviously as shawn stated in his prepared remarks that were fairly broad based with 51 odd specialties on the platform today you know the one differentiation is our specialists are folks that typically take care of the chronically ill we re not going for surgical specialties specifically we do have some and so that is a good reflection of the medical groups we are trying to create very primary care ob speed focused and then surround them with the right specialists in some markets the concentration going to be different with our anchor partner as is the case in florida and with bass in california but over time as those medical groups grow the hope is that that makes normalize and it s very primary care focused so that s point one and again we received early realization all around we have pretty good in network referrals with our high quality lower cost specialists and that benefits our value based book and i think that differentiates us to create a pretty holistic medical group that can perform at a pretty high level across both fee for service and value based arrangements taji phillips jefferies analyst thank you operator for your next question it comes from the line of sandy draper from guggenheim partners sandy your line is now open please ask your question sandy draper guggenheim partners analyst thanks very much actually all my questions have been asked and answered so i ll pass it back to the operator shawn morris chief executive officer thank you sandy appreciate it operator for your next question it comes from the line of jessica tassan from psc your line is now open please ask your question jessica tassan piper sandler analyst hi thanks so much for taking the question so i guess just my first one would be i know you guys said you re booking the full risk lives at 0 care margin but then also that you wouldn t enter these contracts if they were going to make you less well off so just over what time frame parth mehrotra president and chief operating officer yeah thanks for the question jess look we look at data and as and when we feel comfortable that we see the right trends we ll we look for it appropriately you should expect to see that happen over the next few quarters the data does come with a lag and it s not almost immediate so this could flow into next year as well and that s why you do have prior period adjustments in this business when you re taking risks and they could be positive they could be negative in certain cases and that s why it s called risk but again we hope we can manage the book pretty well and we ve entered into these to do well for both our payers as well as our physicians and privia so hopefully over time you ll see that trend jessica tassan piper sandler analyst got it so then just one more on 2022 if the 22 full cap performance does prove to be better than 0 care margin what is kind of the latest possible date that you d expect to reconcile that and the upside on the p l and then just if you could remind us what was capitated revenue in the quarter and that s it for me thanks parth mehrotra president and chief operating officer yeah sure so in the first half part of the question is our guidance assumes the existing accrual that we would book medical expense that equals capitated revenue and that s what s reflected in the guidance we are giving today if it is better or worse we ll update guidance appropriately and that could happen again in subsequent quarters this year so in q3 or q4 when we report q4 or early next year or it could happen afterward if there are any appropriate adjustments so again you ll expect to see that as we close out the year and go into next year and then david can take the next david mountcastle chief financial officer yeah and as you ll see in our 10 q when it gets published later today cap data revenue was 57 7 million for the quarter and 106 1 million for the first six months now value based care equals about 29 6 of our total gaap revenue up from 12 5 last year which we ll see in the q as well jessica tassan piper sandler analyst got it and then just quickly sorry is the sequential increase due to capitated rates or is it due to just an increasing population of lives under full caps parth mehrotra president and chief operating officer yeah it s a combination of all of those we entered one additional capitated contract from what we announced in our press release earlier in the year so it s increased in lives as it s the nature of the capitated arrangement and the top line that we can recognize on a pmpm basis and then it s also reflected in shared savings across the rest of the book in commercial and mssp jessica tassan piper sandler analyst got it thanks so much and congrats on the quarter parth mehrotra president and chief operating officer thank you jess shawn morris chief executive officer thank you operator your last question comes from the line of ryan daniels from william blair ryan your line is now open please ask your question unknown speaker hey good morning guys this is jackson on for ryan daniels congrats on a solid quarter and thanks for taking my last question here so my phone cut out so apologies if you address this already but just looking at your total practice collections for the first half of the year it looks like we re already past the halfway point for the high end of your guidance range for i think it s 2 200 so just curious if you can provide any color on how we should kind of think about the quarterly cadence as it relates to the back half of the year and if we should anticipate any sequential step downs in the third or fourth quarter just any update would be great thanks parth mehrotra president and chief operating officer yeah sure jack i think we did address that one but no worries if your line got cut off so look again we don t expect any deviations from the trend we saw last year we re being prudent it s tough to predict ambulatory utilization as we ve stated and so our guidance assumes that there s some normalization of that trend it s been running ahead of our expectations if the trend continues then we ll obviously update the guidance in three months or so but again we don t see any anomalies from what we ve experienced previously unknown speaker gotcha thanks guys shawn morris chief executive officer thanks parth mehrotra president and chief operating officer thanks operator there are no further questions at this time i would like to turn the conference back to mr shawn morris chief executive officer for closing remarks shawn

includes certain financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states including non gaap sg a non gaap r d non gaap net loss non gaap net loss per share and adjusted ebitda each of which is a non gaap financial measure the company defines non gaap sg a as gaap sg a other than stock based compensation non capitalized transaction costs and forgiveness of ppp loan and non gaap r d as gaap r d other than stock based compensation the company defines non gaap net loss as net loss other than the non gaap cost of revenue adjustment non gaap sg a adjustment and non gaap r d adjustment in each case as described above and defines non gaap net loss per share as net loss other than non gaap adjustments noted above divided by weighted shares outstanding the company defined adjusted ebitda as net loss before interest expense taxes depreciation and amortization stock based compensation change in fair value of debt instruments and warrants and non capitalized transaction costs as the company believes they are not indicative of its core operating performance as noted below none of these non gaap financial measures is a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to any other performance measures derived in accordance with gaap the company believes that presenting these non gaap financial measures provides useful supplemental information to investors about the company in understanding and evaluating its operating results enhancing the overall understanding of its past performance and future prospects and allowing for greater transparency with respect to key financial metrics used by its management in financial and operational decision making the company uses these non gaap measures to help assess its operating performance and operating leverage in its business analyze its financial results establish operational goals develop operating budgets and make strategic decisions the company also believes that the presentation of these non gaap financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in comparing its core business and results of operations over multiple periods with other companies in its industry many of which present similar non gaap financial measures to investors and to help analyze the company s cash performance other companies may calculate non gaap measures differently or may use other measures to calculate their financial performance and therefore any non gaap measures the company uses may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies further there are a number of limitations related to the use of non gaap measures and their nearest gaap equivalents accordingly these non gaap financial measures should be considered as supplemental in nature should not be considered as the sole measure of the company s performance and are not intended to be construed and should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for the comparable or related financial information calculated in accordance with gaap adjusted ebitda

altimmune vipin garg chief executive officer thank you rich and good morning everyone we appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our second quarter 2022 financial results and business update we continued to advance multiple clinical trials for our lead obesity product candidate pemvidutide a glp 1 glucagon dual receptor agonist and are excited about the reporting important data from these trials in the coming months one thing that has become abundantly clear over the last 12 months is that we now have two truly effective drugs to combat the obesity pandemic and with promising additional drugs on the horizon given the increasingly competitive obesity space it s important to highlight the potential differentiating features of pemvidutide first we believe that we have the potential to achieve weight loss equal to or exceeding 20 after only 48 weeks of treatment confirming the benefit of adding glucagon agonism to glp 1 monotherapy we also believe the robust reduction of serum lipids observed in our phase i trial could translate into important cardiovascular benefits with long term use further increasing the value proposition of our drug candidate finally we believe that the absence of dose titration will be viewed as a major advantage in the minds of prescribers and patients simplifying management by avoiding the cumbersome use of dose titration over the first four to five months of therapy we are planning to announce the top line data readout on our phase ib multicenter trial in subjects with obesity or overweight and non alcoholic fatty liver disease or nafld in mid september the key readouts will include assessment of liver fat weight loss serum lipids and safety at 12 weeks of treatment scott harris will join us shortly to discuss our expectations for that readout in addition we are currently executing a 12 week double blind placebo controlled extension to this trial and expect data readout after 24 weeks of treatment in q4 2022 we believe that the 24 week readout will provide valuable information about the weight loss that could be achieved with pemvidutide at one year of treatment our 48 week phase ii momentum trial of pemvidutide in subjects with obesity and overweight is enrolling rapidly approximately 25 obesity study centers are now enrolling in the trial across the united states as of yesterday august 10 we had randomized 167 subjects and we expect to fully enroll the 320 subject trial population by the end of the third quarter a 24 week interim analysis which was initially planned at year end 2022 is now planned for q1 2023 when we expect that approximately 50 of the subjects have been treated for 24 weeks we believe the interim readout on 50 of the subjects in our trial would provide a more meaningful and robust data set in our evaluation of pemvidutide scott harris will talk more about the momentum trial shortly a 12 week phase ib multicenter trial in type 2 diabetics is also ongoing and we expect this trial to provide important information on parameters of glucose control such as hemoglobin a1c in subjects with obesity and overweight who have type 2 diabetes finally we are continuing to enroll in our phase ii multicenter trial of heptcell in subjects with inactive chronic hepatitis b and expect to have a data readout in the second half of 2023 we are excited about the progress of pemvidutide and heptcell and the upcoming results of these ongoing trials with that i will now turn the call over to our chief medical officer dr scott harris to discuss our data and clinical plans scott scott harris chief medical officer thank you vipin and good morning everyone first let me talk about our upcoming readout in our 12 week phase ib multicenter trial of subjects with obesity or overweight and nafld in mid september nafld in this trial was defined as a 10 or greater liver fat content as measured by mri pdff at the conclusion of enrollment the trail randomized and dosed 94 subjects who were randomized 1 1 1 1 to 1 2 milligrams 1 8 milligrams 2 4 milligrams pemvidutide or placebo over 12 weeks of treatment approximately 29 of the subjects participating in the trial have pre existing type 2 diabetes the primary endpoint of this trial is the reduction in liver fat by mri pdff and the key secondary endpoint is weight loss at the end of 12 weeks of treatment we will report consolidated and stratified data in these and other parameters for subjects with and without diabetes the readout in september will also include the effects of pemvidutide on serum lipids laboratory parameters including liver function tests and fasting glucose adverse events including adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation hemoglobin a1c heart rate and blood pressure based on an analysis of the pooled unblinded data the average bmi of participants is approximately 36 with median weight approximately of 101 kilograms and the median age is approximately 49 years with approximately 50 of subjects 53 of subjects being female as you are aware we are conducting a 12 week extension trial for participants who complete the initial 12 weeks of treatment resulting in a total of 24 weeks of treatment the extension trial is now fully enrolled and we expect to readout on these results in q4 2022 the principal readouts will be weight loss and the continued safety of pemvidutide administration the 24 week data may allow us to project the amount of weight loss that could be achieved by pemvidutide at one year of treatment now let me talk about the phase ii momentum trial of pemvidutide in obesity the trial is enrolling approximately 320 non diabetic subjects with either obesity or overweight with at least one obesity related complication across approximately 25 obesity study centers in the united states subjects are being randomized 1 1 1 1 to receive either 1 2 milligrams 1 8 milligrams 2 4 milligrams pemvidutide or placebo administered weekly for 48 weeks as an adjunct to diet and exercise the primary endpoint of the momentum trial is the relative percent change in body weight at 48 weeks compared to baseline with additional readouts including metabolic and lipid profiles cardiovascular measures and glucose homeostasis dr louis aronne from weill cornell medical school a leading authority in obesity in clinical trials is serving as the principal investigator as vipin mentioned enrollment and randomization are progressing rapidly we now plan to perform an interim analysis to assess changes in body weight after 24 weeks of treatment on approximately 50 of expected study participants in q1 of 2023 we are currently randomizing 25 subjects per week and expect to complete randomization of the full 320 study participants next month we are also completing enrollment in our 12 week phase i multicenter trial evaluating the effects of pemvidutide on glucose and control in subjects with type 2 diabetes approximately 48 subjects are planned with readout expected in q1 2023 across the trials that i have described we are rapidly building the safety profile of pemvidutide with unblinded safety data accrued in over 200 subjects receiving one or more doses of pemvidutide in clinical trials expected by year end 2022 and approximately 500 subjects by year end 2023 we are all aware of the recent interim readout on the wegovy select cardiovascular outcomes trial and like most of us who are following this study we believe that a positive effect in cardiovascular outcomes will be demonstrated at the final readout following on this thought however i d like to highlight the robust reductions in serum lipids demonstrated in our first in human clinical trial of pemvidutide where we achieved 20 to 30 reductions in total and ldl cholesterol within 12 weeks of pemvidutide treatment these lipid effects are expected to have important implications for cardiovascular disease such as myocardial infarction stroke and heart failure and they compare quite favorably to the limited 3 reduction in total ldl cholesterol total cholesterol and ldl levels observed in the wegovy step 1 trial at 68 weeks we believe the marked effect on lipids that we demonstrated in our first in human trial speak directly to the superior effects of glucagon and serum lipids and support our belief that we will achieve more rapid and pronounced outcomes when cardiovascular outcomes trials with pemvidutide are conducted we are also making continued progress in the enrollment of our phase ii multicenter clinical trial of heptcell in subjects with inactive chronic hepatitis b and expect the results of this trial in the second half of 2023 recall that the virologic effects of heptcell are being evaluated in chronically infected patients to enable the combination of heptcell with novel direct acting antivirals as part of combination therapy for chronic hepatitis b i will now hand the call over to rich eisenstadt to give an update on our first second quarter financial results rich rich eisenstadt chief financial officer thank you scott and good morning again everybody for today s call i ll be providing a brief update on altimmune s second quarter 2022 financial results more comprehensive information will be available in our form 10 q to be filed with the sec later today altimmune ended the second quarter of 2022 was approximately 184 8 million of cash cash equivalents and short term investments compared to 190 3 million at the end of 2021 we drew down approximately 21 3 million in net proceeds off of our atm during the three months ended june 30 2022 and had approximately 32 9 million in availability remaining under the atm at june 30 turning to the income statement revenue was minimal in the second quarter of 2022 compared to 100 000 in the same period in 2021 our change in revenue for the quarter was primarily due to the discontinuation of development activities for our t covid and nasoshield programs research and development expenses were 16 million in the second quarter of 2022 compared to 13 3 million in the same period in 2021 approximately 10 1 million of this total for the second quarter of 2022 was direct expenses for the conduct of our clinical programs including 8 7 million in direct costs related to development activities for pemvidutide and 1 4 million in direct costs related to development activities for heptcell approximately 1 9 million of expense in the second quarter of 2022 was a non cash expense associated with the achievement of the phase ii development milestone for pemvidutide general and administrative expenses were 4 4 million in the second quarter of 2022 as compared to 3 7 million in the same period in 2021 the increase year over year was primarily attributable to increased labor and labor related expenses including stock compensation expense net loss for the three months ended june 30 2022 was 20 1 million or 0 42 net loss per share compared to 24 8 million or 0 60 net loss per share for the second quarter of 2021 our existing cash not only fully funds us through all of our ongoing clinical trials but we currently estimate that our cash is sufficient to allow us to operate into the second half of 2024 i will now turn back over to vipin for his closing remarks vipin vipin garg chief executive officer thank you rich operator that concludes our final remarks formal remarks and we would like to open the lines to take questions could you please instruct the audience on the q a procedure questions answers operator our first question is from the line of seamus fernandez of guggenheim your question please seamus fernandez guggenheim partners analyst great guys can you hear me ok vipin garg chief executive officer yes seamus fernandez guggenheim partners analyst ok excellent so just a couple of things on time lines and expectations heading into the event obviously you guys are making some very strong statements around what you believe pemvidutide has the capability to do and incorporating that 20 target into the press release i m sure has people paying attention wanted to just get a little bit of incremental color on your conviction around that 20 threshold it would strike us that even if you were to achieve a high teens number at 48 weeks that would still be approaching if not still a best in class result relative to the current two assets so just wanted to get a better sense of what you guys what raised your conviction to kind of put that and really make such a strong statement and again we can certainly see that but i have to imagine that perhaps you re seeing something in the phase i data to imply that things are going quite well separately as we just kind of look at the updates on the timing dynamics where we saw some push out i guess can you talk to us and help us understand what the workup of the patients actually is we actually think it s good that there is a healthy pace but perhaps not too fast of a pace of patient enrollment and while folks may be a little bit disappointed by the timing of the 24 week results i was just hoping you could give us an update on the participation rate from patients going from the 12 week into the 24 week extension in the nafld study and then just the last question the diabetes study can you just remind us what you re hoping to understand in the phase i basically safety portion study in the diabetic patient population is that purely drug drug interaction work or is it possible that we could see treatment related effects in that patient population just to kind of replicate the 29 of patients that are in nafld apologize for the series of questions but just wanted to get those three things out there vipin garg chief executive officer yes absolutely good morning seamus all great questions there s a lot to unpack there so let me just start with in terms of the magnitude of weight loss as we have said all along we agree with you that it s not about just achieving a number it s really looking at the entire package that you re bringing to the table and we ve been emphasizing that it s not just the weight loss it s a lack of dose titration it s our serum lipid profile that we are seeing so all of that will go into finally distinguishing or differentiating pemvidutide from the rest of the field based on what we have seen from our phase i study in australia as you know we were able to achieve approaching 8 to 10 weight loss in about 12 weeks when you compare that to other agents it makes sense that we should be able to reach a number approaching 20 in 48 weeks because we got all of this runway left for the drug to work so that s really where that conviction is coming from we are totally unblinded to the nafld phase i study so none of this is coming from that but we continue to believe that pemvidutide has the potential to be a highly differentiated product in this space your second question relates to scott do you want to take that scott harris chief medical officer yes seamus good morning so you had several parts to your question and let me make sure i touch on all of them and please interrupt me if i haven t we re very confident about the rate of enrollment we have a really great clinical operations group we also have even more important than that some very very experienced obesity study centers they have conducted many trials through the years more recently some of them participated in the step or the surmount or the surpass trials we have a lot of confidence in them and based on that we are really confident about the quality of the data that we re generating in that trial at a very nice rate we haven t commented yet on the rollovers from the nafld 12 week study to the 12 week extension we ll make that announcement in the fourth quarter but we re very happy at this point at the rate of rollover and finally regarding your question of the diabetes study recognize that there are only a limited number of subjects who are diabetic who are participating in the 12 week nafld study doing a committed diabetes study allows us to increase those numbers get more robust readouts and also put some measures into that study that are considered to be more of an industry standard in assessing diabetic patients such as continuous glucose monitoring that would be too difficult to incorporate into a nafld trial i wanted to also just clarify on the statement that vipin made that vipin may have used the word that we are unblinded i want to make it clear that we are still blinded to the 12 week in nafld data so let me just make sure that clarification is heard vipin garg chief executive officer thanks seamus fernandez guggenheim partners analyst thanks really appreciate that and just on the diabetes study can you guys clarify did you increase the number of patients that are going to be participating in that diabetes study and that s the reason that we re going to see those data in the first quarter of next year and the reason is to ensure that you have more robust data or just has enrollment been a little bit more challenging in that study and maybe you could just help us understand why that might be and with that and then i ll drop back into the queue scott harris chief medical officer yes i don t want to talk about our final enrollments seamus let me just say it s a combination of factors that we felt that we were much more comfortable announcing in the first quarter rather than the fourth quarter seamus fernandez guggenheim partners analyst ok got it operator thank you our next question is from the line of yasmeen rahimi from piper sandler go ahead your question please yasmeen rahimi piper sandler analyst good morning team and thank you so much for taking my questions thank you for the quite additional color presented in your press release this morning and your prepared remarks a few questions i m going to go one by one the first question i would like to understand is i know in the past you guys have said that in the nafld study the target diabetic population was 50 and now we re at about 29 so obviously with less number of insulin resistant patients in the study it s going to influence the mean weight loss so just kind of provide us some commentary on what your expectations are in the diabetic and non diabetic population in this nafld study at a week 12 week endpoint so we could address that first and then i have a couple of little follow ups as well scott harris chief medical officer sure very happy to address that yasmeen if you look at the nafld population in general and there are some studies out there they capture this the rate of diabetics in the nafld population is approximately 25 it gets higher in the actual nash population but remember this was the nafld population with some nash patients and not a committed nash trial when we saw our initial enrollment it did look like 50 of subjects who are coming into the trial were diabetics and that s what we had informed investors about but actually we came down to the expected number around 25 and in fact we re 29 so we think that we re right in line with where we should be although the initial estimates were higher we are where we should have landed regarding the mean weight loss i would direct you to focus on the fact that we are reporting out the weight losses in the diabetics and non diabetics separately as well as the consolidated figure i think that s the best way to understand the data because they re separate populations so as i mentioned in my remarks we ll report the weight loss and other data in three subsets of patients or sets of patients the first will be those who don t have diabetes which would be a standard readout the second would be those with diabetes and then finally we ll consolidate but we ll allow everyone to see exactly what the separate effects are of pemvidutide in non diabetics and diabetics despite the ratios yasmeen rahimi piper sandler analyst and then just with various analysts maybe having different views on what s the expected bar in this upcoming 12 week time point for nafld just can you help us understand what is an acceptable range in weight loss in your view that you think you hope to achieve if you could and i m sorry that i keep asking this but we get this question quite a bit from our investors as we head into middle of september data so just give us some color on what you re expecting in terms of an acceptable weight loss range scott harris chief medical officer yes i think that a nice starting point is to look at the tirzepatide or the semaglutide data at 12 weeks yasmeen and realize that those were obesity trials conducted over a baseline of diet and exercise intervention so that automatically gives you about 2 to work with even without drug effects so when you look at the placebo adjusted semaglutide rate it s 4 if you look at the tirzepatide rate the placebo adjusted is 6 clearly to be interesting i think we should be in that range although we think that we have properties as vipin emphasized with glucagon that even if we re kind of somewhere in that range and not exceeding it again that s not our expectation but even if we re just in that ballpark given the other superior properties of pemvidutide the amazing lipid effects that we re seeing and also the absence of dose titration we think that we re extremely competitive we really are looking toward the safety of the compound in this readout we think that that s as important as anything else to move forward and then as you know investors are looking at 12 because they re interested in what s going to happen at 48 weeks and i think that that s really what we re trying to really understand what s going to happen at that point certainly the 24 week data that we re going to generate in the fourth quarter with the extension of this trial is going to be extremely informative and certainly as interesting if not more interesting than the 12 week readout yasmeen rahimi piper sandler analyst and then just a last question can you maybe help us understand what type of safety data you were privy to on a blinded basis as you know the safety data set is going to be critically important as we head into the september readout just in broad strokes what are the type of things that you see on a blinded basis and if you could provide some commentary how satisfied you are with those with the things you re seeing would be great scott harris chief medical officer yes thanks yasmeen well it s well known that as a sponsor being responsible for the safety of study subjects we re always alerted to panic values that would be alt elevations glucose elevations safety severe adverse events serious adverse events and the like we don t see the aggregate data by treatment group at least until the end of the study the same time you do but based on what we re getting the information that we re getting in the trial on those metrics we ve just been very very happy so far so i would say that based on that blinded understanding of the data we re just extremely encouraged yasmeen rahimi piper sandler analyst excellent thank you operator thank you our next question is from the line of roger song of jefferies go ahead please roger song jefferies analyst great thank you for taking the question a couple of questions from us so the first one maybe just be a little bit more specific given you will have your phase ii obesity study readout after the phase i nafld even the 24 week data so maybe just scott you can just contextualize this for us and investors how should we make read through from one to the other from nafld study to obesity given its slightly different population baseline characteristics etc scott harris chief medical officer yes so clearly as you get to 24 weeks with the nafld you get an obesity readout we re going to have to look at that population at 12 and 24 weeks to see if there s any impact on pre existing liver fat on the weight loss it s not something that s been well characterized in the literature our initial impression is that there shouldn t be an effect but we re just going to have to look at the data vipin garg chief executive officer and there are differences in trial design obviously you already emphasized that point but i want to reemphasize that the lack of diet and exercise from one study to the other that also has to be taken into account but we ll be able to sort through all of that once we have the data there s no question that there will be some read through from one study to the other because these are these patients are also obese patients so we re expecting to see significant weight loss in them both at 12 weeks and 24 weeks roger song jefferies analyst great ok great and then so for nafld understanding the primary efficacy endpoint is the liver fat reduction can you just provide some color around the expectation for the liver fat reduction given your phase ia have like a 90 plus liver fat reduction even at the six week endpoint scott harris chief medical officer yes so we re really impressed even though the numbers were small roger in that phase i first in human trial the effects were so consistent it gave us a great deal of confidence in the readout i think once again the more liver fat reduction that you get the greater the effects that we re going to see on nash resolution and fibrosis improvement especially the speed with which we re seeing it because as you recall with the semaglutide trial which did not have a significant effect on fibrosis improvement in their 72 week trial the amount of liver fat they moved was very small only about 34 in 24 weeks and although they had 50 at the end of the year the speed was not enough to see within that same time period of one year a movement in fibrosis we re seeing very robust effects in only six weeks if you place it against other drugs in the class we saw the fxrs coming in in that 40 range we saw madrigal the resmetirom thyroid agonist coming in at about 50 we re seeing the fgf21s coming in about 60 to 70 we like to believe that we re going to be as good if not better than those drugs roger song jefferies analyst excellent thank you yeah that s it on us thank you operator thank you our next question is from the line of mayank mamtani of b riley go ahead please mayank mamtani b riley financial analyst good morning team thanks for taking the question so first just a quick follow up on the nafld study the total enrollment looks higher than i think what you had originally planned can you just maybe comment why is that and then the baseline i think you commented on bmi age proportion of female male but if you are able to give any color on baseline liver enzyme levels like should we see with these nafld studies we ve seen anything ranging from mid 30s to mid 50s to mid 70s iu l so anything you could comment on that would be great and then i have a follow up scott harris chief medical officer yes so mayank we obviously see the 94 subjects as being a real plus the patients who go into the 12 week trial are the same patients who go into the 24 week trial in other words who go on to the extension and you have to understand that when patients came into that first 12 week trial they came with the understanding that they were going to come in for 12 weeks they were offered another 24 weeks but a lot of people didn t have the time or set aside the commitment to go into for a full 24 weeks so that has to be understood nonetheless we re happy with the rollover rate but the 94 patients really allowed us to move a robust number of patients from the 12 week study to 24 weeks so we see that as being a real positive on the readout that we re going to have at 24 weeks in the extension trial so with regards to the liver enzymes we will have that data this is not a nash trial so the level of liver enzyme elevations are not going to be great but we are allowing for some liver function elevations at baseline and we should be able to see a meaningful change in alt for example over the course of treatment of 12 weeks mayank mamtani b riley financial analyst and then having that less proportion of diabetics in the nafld study i m just curious what does that mean to the weight loss contribution because i think it would be helpful to put in context what weight loss we saw in the semaglutide studies type 2 diabetes versus non diabetes patients and maybe from your earlier phase i studies you had any diabetes versus non diabetes patients there scott harris chief medical officer yes so i ll take the second part of the question first our first study was conducted entirely with non diabetics so we can t really use any information from that study to predict what we would see in type 2 diabetics in the upcoming trial readout i would emphasize however that 40 of the subjects who participated in the phase i study were pre diabetics and we saw a reduction in insulin resistance in that population we saw the majority of those patients who are pre diabetics becoming non prediabetic regarding the lower percentage of patients who have type 2 diabetes in this trial i would emphasize again the fact that we re going to read out separately in the three populations the first being the non diabetics so that will compare directly to step 1 which is the semaglutide first pivotal the second would be in diabetics that would compare to step 2 and then a combination although i don t think that the combination is meaningful and that s why the change in the percentage of diabetics is really not meaningful as well because what we re interested in is the separate effects on non diabetics and diabetics with your correct understanding that typically in clinical trials diabetics lose less weight than non diabetics mayank mamtani b riley financial analyst got it and my final question on the 48 week full readout time line just trying to understand that gap between when you have the 24 week interim analysis in first quarter and that 48 week full analysis which i m assuming is going to be at the total sample size of 320 subjects could you just provide what that gap could look like in terms of time lines and just maybe some color on what s the screen failure rate i think you gave a screening number per week of about 25 subjects just curious if you could comment on how that rate is increasing month over month and what s the failure rate look like scott harris chief medical officer yes so to be clear mayank that 25 subjects per week is not a screening rate that s an actual randomization and dosing rate ok those are subjects who are actually being dosed and put into the final data set so based on that we will have dosed our final patient by the end of september the screening rate is obviously higher than that we haven t gone public in what the screen failure rate is but we re very very happy with that but it s obviously a lot higher or somewhat higher than that 25 subjects because of the screen failures we are confident obviously about the readout at 24 weeks in the first quarter and with the completion of the first patients receiving their first dose by the end of september you can estimate where the 48 readout would approximately occur in 2023 mayank mamtani b riley financial analyst got it i ll hop back in the queue thanks for taking our questions operator thank you next question is from the line of jon wolleben of jmp securities go ahead please jon wolleben jmp securities analyst hey good morning and thanks for taking the questions a couple on the nafld study i was hoping you could clarify i might have missed this if diet and exercise instruction is part of this phase i study that wasn t part of your prior phase i and then you mentioned the average baseline weight is about 101 kilograms which is substantially higher than you saw in phase 1 wondering how you re thinking about how that might affect the weight loss you see here versus the prior study and scott you said the study was fully enrolled but just looking for clarity on what percentage of patients rolled over into that 12 week extension scott harris chief medical officer thanks jonathan so you re absolutely correct we did not use diet and exercise in our initial first in human study and we are not using diet and exercise in the current 12 week nafld study so consequently when we look at this we re not going to see the 2 benefit of placebo because remember that the step and the surmount and even the surpass trials were conducted over a baseline of diet and exercise and the reason is is because when a drug is approved for the treatment of obesity in the u s it s approved as an adjunct to diet and exercise so it actually has to be in the study the nafld study was designed without diet and exercise the same as the initial phase i study however the momentum phase ii trial which is committed obesity study follows fda guidance this is designed exactly like step 1 and surmount 1 and with that we do have an intensive diet and exercise program with regards to the higher weight the mean weights or median weights i should say that we saw in the phase i study were approximately 90 to 95 kilograms depending on the cohort so this is somewhat higher but it s not a lot higher our initial evaluations from our phase i study suggested that we did not see an effect of body weight on either our serum concentrations or the amount of weight that people lost but i d also caution that that was a small number of subjects and we ll have to see if that holds true as we go into this readout with a larger number of subjects the extension study is fully enrolled we re happy with the rollover rate we re happy with the additional patients who have gone into the study based following the increase of the size of the base study to 94 we haven t gone public on the percentage of rollover we ll obviously have that data when we announce the 24 weeks but it ll be a very nice data set jon wolleben jmp securities analyst got it thanks again for taking the questions scott harris chief medical officer going into this readout with a larger number of subjects the extension study is fully enrolled we re happy with the rollover rate we re happy with the additional patients who have gone into the study based following the increase of the size of the base study to 94 we haven t gone public on the percentage of rollover we ll obviously operator h c wainwright go ahead please patrick trucchio h c wainwright and company analyst thanks good morning i m wondering in discussing the potential points of differentiation of pemvidutide if you can talk about the expected advantages specifically in type 2 diabetic patients particularly in areas of glucose control and lipid counts relative to other mechanisms in the field and if you could also remind us the proportion of patients with obesity that would also be expected to present with type 2 in the real world setting scott harris chief medical officer thanks patrick so regarding your first question in type 2 diabetes the immediate and i want to stress the word immediate target product profile for pemvidutide is not to have at least like a glp 1 monotherapy acute glucose lowering effects we have balance in the compound between glp 1 and glucagon and we believe that that at the base case is going to be maintaining glucose and we saw that in our phase i study where glucose and hemoglobin a1c were maintained but over the course of time recognize these patients lose weight and it was stressed at the recent ada meeting that the focus in the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes should focus not so much of the focus should change from the treatment or the control of blood sugar to the loss of body weight because the loss of body weight has a much more meaningful effect on their hemoglobin a1c over the course of time than the anti diabetic effect so consequently we re very confident given the amount of weight loss that we re seeing that we re going to achieve drops in hemoglobin a1c over the course of more extended treatment we re fairly confident we ll see that at 48 weeks we re hoping we re going to see it at 24 weeks but it s a shorter period of time with less weight loss we may see it at 12 weeks that would certainly be only a plus that we saw a drop but at the same time our base case is that we won t see necessarily see a drop now recognize that one of the principal factors in blood sugar elevations in type 2 diabetics is insulin resistance and the great portion of that comes from the liver and it s related directly to liver fat and when you see liver fat being decreased as dramatically as we are with pemvidutide and that s due to the glucagon effects we think we re going to see a drop in insulin resistance that s also going to contribute to the blood sugar decreases over time so just to reiterate we do feel confident that this is an anti diabetic drug over say 48 weeks perhaps 24 our base case at week 12 is that we won t see it but because the hemoglobin a1c averages out the blood sugar over 12 weeks even when you don t initially have weight loss but an upside would be that we saw a drop in hemoglobin a1c or fasting blood sugar in the diabetic population regarding the lipids in diabetics it should be clear that diabetics do suffer from the effects of blood sugar and those elevations result in microangiopathies such as diabetic eye disease diabetic kidney disease but the predominant reason for death in type 2 diabetics is serum lipids and consequently drugs that more effectively move serum lipids are going to have better cardiovascular outcomes than those that don t and i want to again contrast the reductions in serum lipids that we saw particularly total and ldl cholesterol in our phase i study at 20 30 and contrast that to the only 3 reductions in total and ldl cholesterol in the step 1 clinical trial and we think that ultimately that s going to have major benefits on cardiovascular outcomes when we conduct those clinical trials regarding your question patrick about the percentage of obese patients who have type 2 diabetes it s about 20 patrick trucchio h c wainwright and company analyst got it that s really helpful and then just another follow up question when you look to the first quarter of next year you re going to have the interim data for momentum you ll also have the phase ib nafld study 12 week and 24 week data and as well the phase i study data in diabetic subjects so additional safety data i m just wondering do you think at that point you would have sufficient data to have a meeting with the fda depending on the outcome of all of these studies to move directly into a phase iii program in obesity or would you anticipate needing the full data set from momentum before you can move ahead to phase iii scott harris chief medical officer yes great question patrick the initial advice that we got from fda and i want to stress initial was that they would like to see the full 48 week data before moving ahead to phase iii but we could certainly look at what we have in the first quarter and see if that discussion should be held again again when we approach them which was at the filing of the ind for obesity and that was we filed that at the end of 2021 we only had phase i data in a limited subset of patients and data prevails at those meetings so when you propose meetings they want to have as much possible so their initial impression and i m not surprised is let s see 48 week data but it s possible with the abundance of data that we re going to be generating in the first quarter that we could have that discussion earlier patrick trucchio h c wainwright and company analyst yeah great thank you very much scott harris chief medical officer yeah operator thank you and we have a follow up question from the line of seamus fernandez go ahead please seamus fernandez guggenheim partners analyst great thanks guys so just two quick follow ups the first question there was a publication from novo nordisk highlighting a relatively robust study of their own glucagon agonist in combination with i believe their glp 1 semaglutide just wondering if you guys could comment whether it be on that study or at least on the safety of pemvidutide as it relates to heart rate elevations i think the triple g agonist at eli lilly in their early phase i data saw substantial heart rate elevations that clearly would require some factors there but it s also our understanding that that also tends to be associated with glp 1 so are you guys seeing anything related to heart rate elevations outside of what we would see normally with the glp 1 in your data sets at all so just wanted to start there just because that has been a critique from novo nordisk but we re not sure if it applies here or perhaps it s even just purely molecule specific and then the second question was just as we think about the possibility of entering larger phase iii it would seem to us the size of the overall obesity efforts likely would have you guys with strong interest from potential partners especially if you can achieve the profile that you re talking about how are you guys thinking about the timing of when you think it s best to engage with potential partners from a strategic discussion perspective scott harris chief medical officer thanks seamus i ll answer the first question and then i ll turn to vipin to answer the second question so as you know in that triple g study the effects on heart rate were striking they announced that with their multiple dosing they saw increases of about 10 beats per minute but actually in their single ascending dose study earlier than that they actually got 30 beats per minute so why is that is that because you simply added glucagon to the molecule well we d say a couple of things about that the first is the amount of glucagon in that triple g as we understand it and i want to emphasize that is small that molecule appears to be tirzepatide slightly lower ratio of gip to glp 1 i think in tirzepatide it s 15 1 it looked like based on the data they presented that s 8 1 but i want to emphasize that the ratio of glp 1 to glucagon that molecule is 10 1 it s only 1 10th the relative amount of activity in that molecule compared to the glp 1 so if there s any effect of that molecule it s the glp 1 and we ve seen those heart rate increases before how do we explain it and why aren t we seeing it with our compound we believe it s probably the pharmacokinetic effects if you look at the time to maximal concentration of that compound as we understand it as presented in graphs at the meeting it looks like it s very short about 12 hours and again i want to say it s about because i m estimating it from slides that they presented without actually seeing the raw data what that means is that when that drug is given there s a surge of drug into the bloodstream with higher peak concentrations and immediate effect contrast that with pemvidutide where we see a maximal concentration that s actually several times greater than that not 12 hours but 70 hours with a lower cmax we ve estimated that our cmax compared to comparative doses of semaglutide is about a third so what we have is an onset that is slower and perhaps more gentle using a non biological term but we think that that accounts for the lack of heart rate increases now we presented that data at the ada meeting that we re not seeing the heart rate increases of semaglutide it s probable that as we go further in development because this is a glp 1 based compound that we ll see some increase but the initial data suggests that it s not going to be significant any more than a glp 1 but again i want to emphasize that we have a small number of patients and we ll just observe that as we go but we think that the heart rate increase that we re seeing with the glucagon containing compound were not due to glucagon we think it was the nature of the pharmacokinetics so for the second question i want to turn that over to vipin vipin garg chief executive officer yes seamus we agree with you that with this kind of data package that we are putting together and if we are able to maintain the profile that we ve been highlighting that we expect and we do try to have we expect to have significant interest strategic interest in this program so we ll explore that right now we are focused on generating this data we think that s what s going to drive the value proposition here seamus fernandez guggenheim partners analyst thanks thanks so much guys operator and we have another follow up question from mayank mamtani go ahead please mayank mamtani b riley financial analyst thanks for taking my follow up and maybe just another kind of follow up a forward looking kind of question like in terms of doing a cv outcome trial do you expect that to be in parallel to your phase iii or more sequentially post phase iii and as you know the reason i ask you this question is with the recent update with the select study but also you re trying to get to weight loss levels comparable to tirzepatide in two thirds of the time so i m just curious as you look forward would doing an outcome study in parallel to doing your phase iii just because longer term these are important to reimbursement and payer dynamics for the market scott harris chief medical officer yes mayank it s a great question i want to emphasize that first that the conduct of a cardiovascular outcome trials will not be gating to approval that we do it in parallel with phase iii or afterwards these drugs are approved without having these trials upfront so we saw that recently with mounjaro tirzepatide i think it s intriguing to think that we could do it in parallel it s not something that we ve carefully looked at we think it s a very nice suggestion and we ll certainly take a better look at it mayank mamtani b riley financial

the proposed pebble mine site pictured in 2014 jason sear kdlg in late july northern dynasty minerals received 9 4 million from a new unnamed investor coming after a series of significant setbacks for the proposed pebble mine this would seem like unusual time for a big investment in may the epa issued a proposed determination to prohibit the discharge of mining materials in the waters around the pebble deposit a decision that would effectively kill the project if it stands and the army corps of engineers denied pebble s permit in 2020 pebble and gov mike dunleavy are fighting to have that permit denial reversed then in july a fire swept through the pebble mine supply camp odds seem slim that the mine breaks ground in the foreseeable future despite all this the new investor signed an agreement for even greater potential investment over a two year period up to 47 million in total according to mike westerlund vice president of investor relations for northern dynasty minerals westerlund said the investor is a private asset management company and that northern dynasty won t provide the investor s name because of the treatment previous partners have faced we found in the past that many of the engo community will use this information to wage public campaigns against our investors which doesn t seem fair to me or reasonable even but they try to pressure them and they try to block them etc and make life unpleasant for them so we re just choosing not to release their name at this time he said westerlund explained that northern dynasty wanted to raise funds without issuing equity because their stock prices are low on july 27 the day mining journal announced the new investment northern dynasty s stock jumped 0 05 to 0 32 per share but this is just a fraction of the company s peak price of more than 20 on feb 17 2011 westerlund said the new investment will help move the permitting forward he added that the investor is aware of the history of public opposition against the mine and the epa s proposed determination released in may they re motivated to put money into the project anyway so the investor believes in the long term value of gold and silver that they see gold and silver being very valuable metals in the future westerlund said westerlund said that with each 9 4 million the new investor commits it will receive 5 of silver and 6 of gold produced over the lifetime of the mine bob loeffler is a research professor of public policy at the university of alaska anchorage institute of social and economic research his work includes studies on land and resource issues he said the investor may believe the reward is high enough to warrant a risky investment i don t know who the investor is loeffler said but clearly some investor thinks the odds are non zero so it s a risk reward and the investor must believe that the reward is high enough loeffler worked for the alaska department of natural resources for over two decades his job at uaa is funded in part by the council of alaska producers a mining trade association loeffler said his professional obligation is to the university not the industry he said pebble seems to be preparing for a long expensive battle over permitting because keeping the pebble mine project alive is critical for the existence of northern dynasty itself northern dynasty has only one asset and that s the pebble project it s not like you know general motors which can say well this particular car isn t selling concentrate on other cars or even a large mining company which might say this particular prospect is becoming expensive i ll concentrate on my other prospects as far as i know their only asset is the pebble prospect so they don t have any alternatives he reflected the epa s proposed determination to nix the mine is not final the agency held public hearings in dillingham newhalen and online in june the written comment period is open until september 6 comments can be submitted online at regulations gov

alberta based real estate development and asset management company today reported results for the second quarter and six months ended june 30 2022 revenue was down 4 to 104 35 million year to date and down 22 in the quarter as a result of the cyclical nature of the real estate industry and timing of sales in the current and comparative periods as a result of significant swings in fair value adjustments management relies on funds from operations ffo as a better reflection of melcor s true operating performance year to date ffo decreased 15 to 22 55 million or 0 69 per share over 2021 and was down 27 to 11 85 million or 0 36 per share in the quarter as a result of lower revenue in our community development division and higher operating and administrative costs revenue in our community development division is impacted by the type of product sold and revenue in our income producing divisions investment properties and reit continues to yield stable revenue and results compared to 2021 in the quarter our community development division sold 116 single family lots and 8 85 acres q2 2021 177 single family lots and 14 16 acres year to date our community development division sold 404 single family lots and 16 43 acres 2021 299 single family lots and 22 69 acres occupancy in our income producing divisions investment properties and reit remained stable over q1 2021 at 85 we have had strong retention in our income producing divisions investment properties and reit at 87 year to date and occupancy has increased 1 since december 31 2021 timothy melton melcor s executive chair and chief executive officer commented we are pleased to present melcor s results for the second quarter of 2022 the community development division had a strong quarter with 116 single family lots sold and 8 85 acres of serviced land sold including both commercial and multi family sites increasing interest rates are negatively impacting real estate markets in general but the alberta economy is benefiting from higher oil and natural gas prices melcor is well positioned to meet demand for serviced residential lots and has the potential to bring on several new phases of development over the next few quarters revenue and occupancy in our income producing divisions were up slightly in the quarter occupancy for ip was 77 for our canadian properties and 81 for us properties leasing activity was strong with 273 154 sf of new and renewed leases in the reit leading to occupancy of 87 at quarter end our property development division transferred one building in jensen lakes crossing st albert ab comprised of 7 049 sf to our investment properties division in the quarter our recreational properties saw later opening dates compared to 2021 resulting in a slight decrease in rounds played however a bump in food and beverage sales lead to a 2 increase in revenue to 4 65 million in q2 2022 and 3 to 4 76 million year to date second quarter results given the longer term nature of real estate development comparison of any three month period may not be meaningful the market continues to be challenged by inflation and rising interest rates in particular the leasing market has seen added supply in some of our core regions and a shift in demand for product with new construction and remote and hybrid work models following the lifting of work from home restrictions occupancy in our investment properties including the reit increased over year end to 85 q4 2021 84 our year to date retention was healthy at 87 strong leasing activity in our property development division continues to drive new development in commercial centres that complement and enhance our communities demand remains strong throughout all regions in our community development division with plenty of activity in sales and construction the us community development model differs from canadian markets with the majority of revenue occurring in a single quarter builders buy lots in bulk to develop themselves and build homes to sell to homeowners these are often referred to as paper lot sales demand for additional lots in our arizona and colorado developments remains high we expect to complete and recognize sales by the end of the year investment properties gla increased slightly as a result of property transferred from property development over the past 12 months revenue from our income properties and reit divisions was up in the quarter compared to q2 2021 our year to date results continue to be impacted by lease termination fees received in our reit division 1 00 million and investment properties division 1 94 million which occurred in early 2021 financial highlights revenue was down 22 to 51 04 million in q2 2022 q2 2021 65 55 million and down 4 year to date as a result of the cyclical nature of the real estate industry and timing of sales in the current and comparative periods lot sales which have a significant impact on quarterly results are uneven by nature and it is difficult to predict when they will close typically we see the most revenue from lot sales in the third and forth quarters as that is when plans typically register these factors have contributed to a year to date decrease of 12 in community development revenue the sale of 5 49 acres of multi family land positively contributed to q2 2022 revenue q2 2021 nil on a year to date basis ffo was down 15 or 3 95 million comparative ffo continues to be impacted by lease termination fees received in both reit 1 00 million and investment properties 1 94 million divisions adjusting out these one time events ffo was down 1 01 million primarily the result of increased consolidated g a which was up 1 47 million over 2021 and timing of sales in community development net income was 25 91 million in q2 2022 compared to 9 01 million in q2 2021 net income is significantly impacted by swings in non cash fair value adjustments on investment properties and reit units the change in the reit s unit price has a counter intuitive impact on net income as an increase in unit value decreases net income these gains are driven by market forces outside of melcor s control and are a key reason we focus on ffo as a truer measure of our financial performance divisional operating highlights the community development division saw healthy sales activity in our canadian markets including satellite communities such as

any other performance measure derived in accordance with gaap or as an alternative to net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our profitability or liquidity adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda per fleet are supplemental measures utilized by our management and other users of our financial statements such as investors commercial banks research analysts and others to assess our financial performance because they allow us to compare our operating performance on a consistent basis across periods by removing the effects of our capital structure such as varying levels of interest expense asset base such as depreciation and amortization and items outside the control of our management team such as income tax rates we view adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda per fleet as important indicators of performance we define adjusted ebitda as our net income loss before i interest expense net ii income tax provision iii depreciation depletion and amortization iv loss on disposal of assets and v other unusual or non recurring charges such as costs and stock compensation expense related to our initial public offering non recurring supply commitment charges certain bad debt expense and gain on extinguishment of debt we define adjusted ebitda per fleet for a particular period as adjusted ebitda calculated as a daily average of active fleets during period we believe that our presentation of adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda per fleet will provide useful information to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations in particular we believe adjusted ebitda per fleet allows investors to compare the performance of our fleets across comparable periods and against the fleets of our competitors who may have different capital structures which may make a fleet for fleet comparison more difficult net income loss is the gaap measure most directly comparable to adjusted ebitda and net income loss per fleet is the gaap measure most directly comparable to adjusted ebitda per fleet adjusted ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to net income loss and adjusted ebitda per fleet should not be considered as an alternative to net income loss per fleet adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda per fleet have important limitations as analytical tools because they exclude some but not all items that affect the most directly comparable gaap financial measure because adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda per fleet may be defined differently by other companies in our industry our definition of these non gaap financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies thereby diminishing their utility the presentation of non gaap financial measures is not intended to be a substitute for and should not be considered in isolation from the financial measures reported in accordance with gaap the following tables present a reconciliation of the non gaap financial measures

this is not the end of inflation it is not even the beginning of the end but it is perhaps the end of the beginning on wednesday the bureau of labor statistics reported something we haven t seen since the depths of the pandemic recession a month without inflation that is the average price of the goods and services consumers buy was no higher actually slightly lower in july than it was in june before i get to what the latest inflation numbers mean two notes on reactions to the report first there is absolutely no reason to question the numbers there were many advance indications that this report and probably the next few reports would show a sharp drop in inflation in fact i wrote about that last week it s not just falling gasoline prices business surveys point to declining inflation and supply chain problems are easing zero was a somewhat lower number than most observers expected but not wildly so second the enraged reaction of republicans to the report came as something of a surprise at least to me not that it happened but the form their outrage took i expected them to accuse the biden administration of cooking the books instead most of the flailing seemed to involve a failure to understand the difference between monthly and annual numbers

the year ended march 31 2022 with the canadian securities regulators the documents are available on sedar at www sedar com or by visiting bengal s website at www bengalenergy ca business overview bengal s producing and non producing assets are situated in australia s cooper basin a region featuring large accumulations of very light and high quality crude oil and natural gas the company s core australian assets petroleum lease pl 303 cuisinier atp 934 barrolka atp 732 tookoonooka and four recently acquired petroleum licenses are situated within an area of the cooper basin that is well served with production infrastructure and take away capacity for produced crude oil and natural gas still in early stages in terms of appraisal and development bengal believes these assets offer attractive upside potential for both oil and gas australia presents a stable political fiscal and economic environment in which to operate and a favourable royalty regime for oil and gas production under the state of queensland regulatory process atps authority to prospect are granted by the state generally for a period of twelve years with one third of the original grant area expiring every four years at the end of the final term of the atp an application can be made to continue a portion of the permit in the form of a pca potential commercial area pcas have a life span of five to fifteen years pca applications include a commercial viability report that indicates that the area is likely to be commercially viable within the applied term this allows for extra time to commercialize the resource these pca s remain a part of the atp until expiry if discovery of oil or gas is made an application for a pl petroleum lease is made to allow for production pls are granted for up to a thirty year term bengal has two pls on the former atp 752 barta block pl 303 and pl 1028 in addition to three pcas pca 206 pca 207 barta west and pca 155 wompi block nubba yilgarn bengal also holds four pls including a pipeline license ppl 138 adjacent to the 100 owned atp 934 australia cooper basin queensland pl303 and pl 1028 cuisinier controlling permit atp 752 30 357 wi a pilot reservoir pressure maintenance scheme was initiated during the prior fiscal year and after resolving mechanical issues water injection activities resumed during calendar q4 2021 this project is located in the southeast quadrant of the cuisinier pool with injection of water taking place at the cuisinier 24 well the broad nature of the cuisinier structure combined with variable flank aquifer pressure support has resulted in pressure depletion within the central portion of the cuisinier pool the injection of produced formation water is anticipated to both increase production in up to four offsetting wells and reduce water handling charges on establishing success of the pilot the joint venture jv will begin a multi phase water injection scheme targeted fracture stimulation and more commercially efficient development drilling since inception 38 600 barrels of water have been injected into the c24 well at a rate of approximately 250 barrels of water per day nearby wells are being monitored for total fluid produced and water cut to help to determine which wells are being affected by the pilot program mechanical issues through commissioning caused periods of downtime however injection was consistent during the current quarter pl 114 wareena pl 157 ghina pl 188 ramses pl 411 karnak ppl 138 pipeline 100 wi the company acquired a 100 working interest in four pls and a natural gas pipeline connected to transportation infrastructure into the eastern australia gas market collectively the assets these non productive pls are highly compatible with and in close proximity to atp 934 bengal continues to integrate subsurface data from the pls to enhance the company s understanding of atp 934 and to finalize the selection of exploration and appraisal drilling locations included in this program is the reinstatement of two gas wells and an existing gas pipeline to produce raw gas into existing infrastructure commercial negotiations planning and execution of the project are well advanced with materials being delivered and fabrication starting the company is investing in a proprietary proof of concept arrangement to allow commercial gas production prior to a pipeline connection the 100 ownership of the assets presents an appraisal and development opportunity that will be operated by the company and is seen to be not only complementary to our proven producing non operated cuisinier asset but also as a key steppingstone for bengal s natural gas platform upon which future exploration growth through atp 934 can be undertaken atp 732 tookoonooka 100 wi in june 2019 the company applied for an amendment to the lwp for the third term of atp 732 permit on october 22 2019 the company received approval from the queensland regulatory authority for an amended lwp for the third four year term commencing april 1 2019 to march 31 2023 the approved lwp was revised to minimum activities of reprocessing seismic and inversion work with an estimated cost of 0 05 million and geological and geophysical investigation at an estimated cost of 0 05 million during the four year term on the caracal 1 well the company conducted an acid treatment to improve well bore inflow with positive results and moderate inflow of very light 53 degree gravity oil from the wyandra zone these results are being evaluated with a plan for fracture stimulation to further enhance productivity being put in place following fracture stimulation the well could commence production using the company s early oil production system with the addition of storage and load out infrastructure the well is currently suspended with shut in pressure data being actively monitored to aid in future stimulation work plan atp 732 reaches the end of its term in march of 2023 and the company has lodged an application over the northern portion of the atp for continuation in the form of a potential commercial area for a further 15 years in addition the company is assessing farm in interest on other 3d defined drilling targets atp 934 barrolka 100 wi atp 934 is the company s 100 owned natural gas exploration block bengal received special amendment approved for atp 934 in march 2021 which relinquished 50 of the existing atp area and extended the term of the atp by entering into an outcome based later work program lwp for another 6 years to february 28 2027 the lwp includes the drilling of up to 3 wells and 260 km2 of 3d seismic atp 934 durham downs east farmout block 40 wi bengal entered into an agreement with santos in july of 2020 to farm in on a portion of the atp 934 block santos carried the drilling costs of one well to earn a 60 operated interest in the atp 934 southern farm out block which represents 57 8 of the total block post april 2020 relinquishment on october 14 2021 santos completed the drilling of the legbar 1 exploration well santos paid 100 of the costs to drill plug and abandon the well and has accordingly earned a 60 working interest in 103 760 km2 gross exploration land while the legbar 1 well did not indicate commercial quantities of hydrocarbons thick high quality reservoir sands were encountered in the primary permian toolachee formation and in the jurassic birkhead zone with evidence of residual hydrocarbon saturation in both zones in addition fluorescence shows and elevated gas readings through the jurassic lower birkhead fm top hutton sandstone indicate oil has passed through the reservoir supporting the search for a valid closure to test this play the findings from the legbar 1 well will help bengal refine its exploration targets going forward both with santos in the santos farm in block and across the balance of atp 934 which is 100 owned by bengal business development the company is in discussions with potential industry and financial partners to fund some of these oil and gas related activities non ifrs and other financial measures non ifrs financial measures within this md a references are made to

2 02 p m edt mr patel hey everyone good afternoon and welcome to the daily press briefing this is vedant patel principal deputy spokesperson here at the department i don t have anything for you at the top today so i am happy to take your questions operator would you mind giving the instructions one more time operator thank you and once again if you have a question please press 1 then 0 on your telephone keypad 1 followed by 0 mr patel let s go to the line of leon bruneau with afp operator okay sir your line is open please go ahead question okay yes hi vedant leon here just a quick question what can you tell us on the record on the iran nuclear deal should we be expecting the united states to they re reviewing the draft could we expect a decision soon an answer to the eu on this on the proposal on the table and to what effect if any does the plot that was unveiled yesterday hurt those prospects or not at all thanks mr patel we and the europeans have made quite clear that we are prepared to immediately conclude and implement the deal we negotiated in vienna for a mutual return to the full implementation of the jcpoa but for that to happen iran needs to decide to drop their additional demands that go beyond the jcpoa ultimately the choice is theirs this administration along with our allies and partners are preparing equally for scenarios with and without a mutual return to the full implementation of the jcpoa the president and secretary blinken will only conclude a deal that we determine is in the national security interest of the united states on the second part of your question i will reiterate what secretary blinken reinforced in his comments our message to iran is very clear we will not tolerate threats of violence against americans and that certainly includes former government officials this administration has been clear that it will ensure iran never acquires a nuclear weapon and we believe the best path to achieving that goal is through diplomacy and as long as we believe pursuing a jcpoa is in u s national security interest we re going to continue to do so let s go to the line of simon lewis with reuters operator please stand by okay your line is open question hi thanks thanks vedant yeah just i wanted to see if the united states has a response or a comment on the decision by latvia and estonia to withdraw from the cooperation group with china that they announced today and i wondered how does that how does that sort of reflect europe s response to the tensions happening in taiwan and do you think this has any any impact on the relationship between between well any is this connected in any way to china s relationship with russia given the invasion of ukraine yeah any comment on those thank you mr patel sure let me try to address that in a couple parts first to the first part of your question we respect and support estonia and latvia s sovereign decision to no longer participate in the 16 1 initiative we will continue to closely support their efforts to make the baltics a more resilient and prosperous region estonia and latvia are important and valued nato allies and key u s partners across a number of issues including through our strong defense ties our strong economic ties as well as the promotion of democracy and human rights beyond our commitments to these same values our free democratic countries produce prosperity that helps both of our economies thrive on the second part of your question relating to china s relationship in europe a pillar of this administration s approach to the prc is aligning with our allies and partners in europe and around the world this administration believes that our likeminded allies in europe and the indo pacific hold similar visions for the future of the international order and can realize our goals most effectively when we work together over the past year we ve seen countries around the world express deep concern about the prc s strategic alignment with russia as well as beijing s support for moscow s war against ukraine as secretary blinken has said before there is a growing convergence about the need to approach relations with beijing with more realism next let s go to the line of ellen knickmeyer with the association press operator please stand by your line is open now question hi thank you for doing this secretary blinken is in rwanda today and it looks like he was quite outspoken about human rights and democracy there he there was some talk of he raised the issue of and i m sorry i m i don t i can t pronounce his last name very well and i m hesitant to try but the texas based rwanda critic of kagame who is in prison there now is the u s treating that person s case with the same immediate concern that it s treating griner and other americans being held in russia has it is it what is it what is it doing now and what has it been doing to gain his release mr patel thanks for your question ellen i believe you re referring to the case of mr paul rusesabagina who as you mentioned is currently being detained in rwanda i will reiterate what the secretary said at his joint press availability today which is that we continue to urge the government to address concerns about the legal protections afforded to mr rusesabagina and his case as well as establish safeguards to prevent similar outcomes in the future more broadly speaking the u s is aware of the appellate court s decision upholding the conviction of mr rusesabagina our concerns over the trial and conviction remain we have also been made aware of some serious health concerns of mr rusesabagina and we re continuing to urge to the government of rwanda ensure that he receive all appropriate and necessary medical care more broadly this department is laser focused and committed to any american citizen who is wrongfully detained abroad we have our team at the state department including led by special presidential envoy for hostage affairs roger carstens who remains in close touch on this issue and it continues to be a top priority let s go to the line of jen hansler with cnn operator one moment please thank you and your line is open now question hi thanks so much for doing the call questions on two topics one the brittney griner and paul whelan proposal has there been any movement on that deal have any u s officials interacted with russian officials since secretary of state blinken s call with foreign minister lavrov and has anyone from the u s embassy been able to visit or speak with brittney griner since her sentencing last week and then on the new start treaty and the impasse over the inspections deputy foreign minister ryabkov seemed to suggest that there was a u s team that intended to go do an inspection without russian approval is there anything you can tell us on that did a team intend to go or go to russia to do an inspection there thank you mr patel so on your first question the u s government continues to urge russia to release wrongful detainees brittney griner and paul whelan the conviction and sentencing by a russian court of brittney griner to nine years in prison further compounds the injustice of her wrongful detention the administration and secretary blinken has spoken to this a number of times has been quite clear that there is a substantial proposal on the table to facilitate their release both the release of brittney griner and paul whelan this proposal has been raised through appropriate channels secretary blinken has been able to raise this directly with his counterpart foreign minister lavrov and ultimately the ball is in russia s court as it relates to any visits our embassy staff were able to be in touch with brittney most recently on the day of her sentencing on august 4th on new start on new start so just to take a little bit of a step back the u s and russia had paused inspection activity due to the covid 19 pandemic since the spring of 2020 both sides have continued to provide data declarations and notifications in accordance to the treaty the u s is committed to implementation of the new start treaty and as president biden has said today perhaps more than any other time since the cold war we must work to reduce the risk of an arms race or nuclear escalation we keep discussions between the parties concerning treaty implementation confidential i will also note that what secretary blinken noted recently that the new start treaty makes the u s russia and the world safer by persevering preserving verified restrictions on our strategic nuclear arsenals and avoiding an arms race operator let s go to the line of camilla schick with cbs news operator one moment please and your line is open now question hi vedant thanks the state department put out a release yesterday ahead of the 10 year anniversary of the abduction and disappearance abroad of american journalist austin tice that release said that the state department will quote continue to engage with the syrian government are you able to say at all whether this engagement with the syrian government is current or not and if it is direct or indirect thank you mr patel thanks for your question so again to take a little bit of a step back austin tice this week will have spent 10 years in captivity in syria we call on the syrian government to ensure austin tice and every u s national held hostage in syria is able to return home we can t get into investigative details but what i will underscore is that the u s government knows with certainty that austin was held by the syrian government and that they have the power to release him we think bashar al assad has the power to release austin tice and we call on syria to work with us to secure his release and bring him home operator let s go to the line of michel ghandour operator one moment please and your line is open now one moment please one moment question inaudible do you have any comments on that and the second question is there any updates on advisor hochstein s mediation between israel and lebanon operator okay sir your first question the line was not open yet so please state your first question question yeah the first question was turkish foreign minister has announced that he met the syrian foreign minister in belgrade in october if you have any comment on that mr patel let me take your second question first michel so the u s remains committed to facilitating negotiations between lebanon and israel to reach a decision on the delimitation of the maritime boundary progress towards a resolution can only be reached through negotiations by the two governments we welcome the consultative and open spirit of the parties to reach a final decision which has the potential to yield greater stability security and prosperity for both lebanon and israel as well as for the region and we believe that a resolution is possible on the subject of the meeting i would refer you to the governments of those entities operator let s go to the line of elizabeth hagedorn operator please stand by to have your line open please stand by question hi operator okay please go ahead question will the u s sorry will the u s be granting iranian president raisi a visa to attend next month s un general assembly thanks mr patel thanks for your question so broadly speaking visa records are confidential under u s law but as host nation of the un the united states is generally obligated under the un headquarters agreement to facilitate travel to the headquarters district by representatives of un member states we take our obligations under these agreements very seriously but again to reiterate visa records are confidential under u s law let s go to the line of said arikat operator please stand by one moment your line is open now question thank you vedant for doing this i have a quick question today the un human rights chief michelle bachelet issued a very strong statement expressing alarm over the death of palestinian children in the past week 19 palestinian children were killed taking the toll this year vedant to about 37 children are you alarmed by the number of palestinian children that are being killed in conflict and have you raised this issue with the israelis or will you raise it with the israelis mr patel thanks for your question said so you saw both secretary blinken and president biden speak to this over the weekend in their comments relating to the ceasefire over the recent gaza conflict so i will reiterate that this agreement brought a welcome respite to israeli and palestinian civilians and allowed deliveries of critical supplies to gaza we express our condolences to the families of civilians who lost their lives and we also support a timely and thorough investigation into these reports of civilian casualties we are grateful for egypt for their role in reaching this agreement as well as to qatar and jordan the palestinian authority as well as the un our team as well played an important role and worked around the clock to support this outcome and we also remain dedicated to our ironclad commitment to israel s security and are fully engaged to promoting calm we continue to work with partners to improve the quality of life for palestinians in the gaza strip palestinians and israelis equally deserve to live safely and securely and to enjoy equal measure of freedom prosperity and democracy let s go to the line of jiha ham of voice of america operator one moment please and your line is open now question hey thank you very much for doing this i have two questions today one on north korea north korean leader kim jong un yesterday declared victory in the battle against the coronavirus in order to lift some of their restrictions so do you have any comments on this do you still assess north korea as preparing its seventh nuclear test and this new announcement may allow do you think north korea to move forward with their plans and my second question is that china has been demanding south korea not to deploy the u s anti missile defense system thaad it is asking south korea to maintain the three noes policy so one of the noes is no additional deployment of thaad so what s your position on the three noes policy and china s strong opposition on thaad thank you mr patel thanks so first on your question about covid 19 look we are very concerned about how covid 19 could affect the north korean people and we continue to support the provision of vaccines to the dprk to this end we strongly support and encourage the efforts of international aid and health organizations in seeking to prevent and contain the spread of covid 19 in the dprk and to provide other forms of humanitarian assistance to vulnerable groups in the country to date dprk has refused all vaccine donations from covax we continue to support international efforts aimed at the provision of critical humanitarian aid to the most vulnerable north koreans should the dprk request vaccines we stand ready to offer them and we urge and reiterate for the dprk to work with the international community to facilitate the rapid vaccination of its population on your the second part of your question the u s assesses the dprk is preparing its punggye ri test site for what would be its seventh nuclear test this assessment is consistent with the dprk s own public statements we are preparing for all contingencies in close coordination with our japanese and rok allies furthermore we are prepared to make both short and longer term adjustments to our military posture as appropriate in responding to any dprk provocation we re concerned by the regime s strengthened rhetoric around its nuclear program a seventh nuclear test since 2017 would constitute a grave escalatory action and seriously threaten regional and international stability as well as security not to mention undermine our planet s nonproliferation efforts such an action would also be dangerous and deeply stabilizing to the region on thaad on thaad we believe thaad is a prudent and limited self defense capability designed to counter dprk weapons programs criticism or pressure on the rok to abandon its self defense is inappropriate the united states and the rok made an alliance decision to deploy thaad to the rok as a purely defensive measure to protect the rok and its people from armed attack and to protect alliance military forces from the dprk s weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile threats let s go to joseph haboush with al arabiya english operator one moment please your line is open question thanks for taking my question i just want to try again on jennifer s earlier question is the u s planning on sending a delegation or has it sent a delegation to inspect russian nuclear weapon sites without russian approval and does the state department condemn russia s suspension of its participation in the new start treaty and just a second one turkey said it was sending a delegation to washington on monday to discuss the sale of f 16s are any state department officials meeting with the delegation thank you mr patel on the second part of your question i have no meetings to preview at the moment and as it relates to your first i will reiterate what i said previously is that we will continue to exercise our on site inspection rights under the new start treaty will also prioritizing the health and safety of personnel conducting and hosting inspection activities we look forward to continuing to implement this important treaty with the russian federation it is an important instrument of stability in the bilateral relationship and i will reiterate again what secretary blinken said which is that the new start treaty makes the u s russia and the world safer let s go to the line of alex raufoglu operator one moment please and your line is open question yes thank you so much vedant for doing this and happy thursday couple of questions on ukraine and russia ukrainian foreign minister called on western countries yesterday to stop issuing visas to russian citizens yesterday das inaudible staff from the visa services bureau confirmed to me that there is no restriction at this point on russian travelers are you considering to review this in response to ukraine s request secondly if there s any comment on your end from latvia parliament yesterday naming russia as a state sponsor of terrorism do you applaud that what is your reaction and lastly there s there are reports that during last couple of weeks russian officials conducted training in iran as part of the agreement on uav transfers from iran to russia any reaction to those reports thank you so much again mr patel sorry about the delay there thanks for your question i will answer the last one first so on the delivery of uavs to russia what i will first say and go back to is as national security advisor jake sullivan told cnn in july the u s government has information indicating iran is preparing to provide russia with several hundred uavs including weapons capable uavs we ve also said that we assess an official russian delegation recently received a showcase of iranian attack capable uavs we can confirm that during the last several weeks russian officials conducted training in iran as part of the agreement of the uav transfers let me be clear we will vigorously enforce all u s sanctions on both the russian and iranian arms trades the kind of transactions you re mentioning are potentially sanctionable under numerous authorities including but not limited to russia specific authorities and our worldwide nonproliferation sanctions we remain incredibly concerned about iran s use and proliferation of uavs they have been used to attack u s forces our partners in the region and international shipping entities we will continue to use all available tools including but not limited to sanctions to prevent deter and dismantle the procurement network that supply uav related material and technology to iran alex would you remind would you restate your other two questions please operator sir please press 1 then 0 to restate your questions one moment please okay your line is open now question yes of course thank you so much yeah other two questions were about first of all reaction to latvian parliament s yesterday s decision on naming russia a state sponsor of terrorism do you applaud that decision and what is your reaction and lastly as you know ukrainian government has been urging calling on western countries in particular g7 countries which the u s is one of them to stop issuing visas to russian tourists and as a state department official confirmed yesterday the russian citizens are still able to obtain those visas are you in a position to give us any detail about whether or not state department is considering to review that policy in response to ukraine s request thank you mr patel thanks for your question so on a potential designation we re just not going to discuss deliberations or potential deliberations on a potential designation from here as a matter of law in order to designate any country as a state sponsor of terrorism the secretary of state must determine that the government of that country has repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism the u s government has already taken a number of significant and effective steps to respond to putin s war of choice from export controls as well as sanctions and economic consequences as well our unprecedented sanctions are having a drastic impact on russia russia s stock market has lost a third of its value inflation has risen 20 percent russia s imports of goods from around the world could fall by 40 percent on your question about any visa ban we ve been very clear that we intend our actions to not harm or have significant impact on the russian people that is not who our disagreement with is on this let s next go to the line of janne pak from u s journal korea operator one moment question in progress beautiful day i don t know because i m late a little bit listening about your statement maybe somebody ask already these question on that but i have two questions for you one is north korea one is china again so north korean leader kim jong un s sister kim yo jong said yesterday the coronavirus was delivered from south korea and she announced that she would take the strong retaliation against south korea what is your comment on this the second one china announced that it would resume trading with north korea which had been suspended trade with china will allow north korea to secure foreign currency can this be seen as a violation of sanctions against north korea thank you mr patel thanks so on covid 19 one of your colleagues did ask that but i m happy to reiterate we are incredibly concerned about how covid 19 could affect the north korean people and continue to support the provision of vaccines to the dprk to date the dprk has refused all vaccine donations from covax we continue to support international efforts aimed at the provision of critical humanitarian aid to the most vulnerable north koreans should the dprk request vaccines we stand ready to offer them on the potential resumption of trade with china the second part of your question let me reiterate what my colleagues here have said before united nations sanctions on the dprk remain in place we will continue to implement them and encourage others to fully implement them including at the united nations and with the dprk s neighbors it is important for the international community to send a strong unified message that the dprk must halt all provocations and abide by its obligations under numerous un security council resolutions as well as engage in sustained and intensive negotiations with the united states let s go to the line of hiba nasr with asharq news operator one moment please your line is open question thanks for taking my question thanks for taking my question my question about austin tice can you confirm that officials from the biden administration met with syrian officials to discuss this matter mr patel again so i am just not going to get into investigative details but i will underscore that the u s government knows with certainty that austin tice was held by the syrian government and that they have the power to release him we call on syria to work with us to secure his release and we believe bashar al assad has the power to release him as the white house has recently said and you heard secretary blinken say this as well the u s government is extensively engaged with syrian officials to bring austin home but that syria has never even acknowledged holding him operator let s go to the line of laurie mylroie from kurdistan24 operator one moment please question thank you very much for taking my question the israeli defense minister today denounced iranian support for palestinian islamic jihad calling it a violent iranian proxy it funds palestinian islamic jihad trains them do you share the israeli views that palestinian islamic jihad is so closely tied to iran that iran can be held accountable for its actions mr patel thanks so much so look the united states is under no illusions about iran s destabilizing actions throughout the region if iran wants to show it can be a responsible actor now is the time for it to play a constructive role in the region next let s go to the line of roj salla with rudaw tv question hi yes thanks operator your line is open question thank you so much for taking my question so turkish defense minister said that a delegation will be visiting u s on august 15 to discuss the f 16 program can you update us on your position on the f 16 program is there any change or do you see a way that turkey and the u s could find a way to resolve the issues around the f 16s mr patel thanks for your question the united states strongly values its partnership with our important nato ally turkey the u s and turkey have a longstanding deep relationship with important defense ties and turkey s continued nato interoperability remains a priority as a matter of policy i m just not going to comment or confirm or get into proposed defense transfers until they have been formally notified to congress and i d refer you to the turkish government for anything additional i think we have time for one final question and so we will close it back out with ellen knickmeyer from the ap operator your line is open please go ahead question yeah thank you i had just wanted to ask you a follow up about the about rusesabagina was there any progress made during blinken s visit about obtaining his release and does the u s plan to move to any of the kind of negotiations or perhaps detainee swaps that are being talked about with whelan and griner in russia mr patel thanks for your question ellen i m going to reiterate again what the secretary said which is that we continue to urge the government to address concerns about the legal protections afforded to him and his case and establish safeguards to prevent similar outcomes in the future we are going to also continue to push for consistent consular access and we remain in close touch with mr rusesabagina s team and the secretary was able to raise this directly with president kagame on his visit as well thanks again everybody for joining today for joining today s press briefing we ll talk to you all again very soon the briefing was concluded at

effective date of june 24 2022 see mineral resource above cautionary note the pea summarized in this news release is considered preliminary in nature contains numerous assumptions and includes inferred mineral resources that are considered too speculative geologically to have the economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves there is no certainty that the results of the pea will be realized no mineral reserves have been estimated for piskanja mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability inferred mineral resources are that part of the mineral resource for which quantity and grade or quality are estimated on the basis of limited geologic evidence and sampling which is sufficient to imply but not verify grade or quality continuity inferred mineral resources may not be converted to mineral reserves it is reasonably expected though not guaranteed that the majority of inferred mineral resources could be upgraded to indicated mineral resources with continued exploration mineral resources are captured within an optimized mine plan within the constraints of a pea and meet the test of reasonable prospects for economic extraction the effective date of the pea is june 24 2022 and a technical report prepared in accordance with national instrument 43 101 standards of disclosure

investors shrugged off the company s notably worse than expected quarterly results what happened you wouldn t expect a company that missed estimates in its latest quarter to jump in price across the subsequent trading days but that s been the situation with opko health s opk shares since the healthcare diagnostics company reported its second quarter results after market hours last friday counterintuitively week to date as of thursday afternoon opko stock was up by almost 10 according to s p global market intelligence so what there was no ambiguity opko fell notably short of expectations for the period a sharp decline in demand for covid 19 testing solutions resulted in revenue tumbling by 30 year over year to land at just under 310 million not to be outdone the company s net income deepened considerably it fell to almost 102 million or 0 14 per share from the year ago quarter s mere 16 million deficit analysts were expecting better performance much better on average they were modeling just shy of 327 million for revenue and a 0 01 per share profit on the bottom line opko s steep drop in the diagnostics segment 53 year over year to just under 187 million was worse than many projected but it wasn t a shock the coronavirus pandemic has shown signs of playing out recently and many people are no longer as concerned about catching the coronavirus relatively high vaccination rates also help meanwhile opko s second most important business pharmaceuticals actually held up rather well yes the segment s take increased only marginally by less than 1 but this occurred despite a steep fall in the company s south american sales due to unfavorable foreign exchange rates all told pharmaceuticals brought in nearly 36 million that s nowhere near enough to make up for the diagnostics decline but it s sufficient to keep hope alive for the company this isn t a one trick pony dependent only on diagnostics it s a company that has a comparatively small yet lively pharmaceuticals operation to fall back on now what nevertheless those top and bottom line developments weren t exactly encouraging investors would do well to watch how opko continues to develop its pharmaceuticals business since the once insatiable demand for covid 19 diagnostics will likely keep fading

democrats have hope for a much needed win in what s been a rough political landscape for the party the inflation reduction act might be the most significant piece of legislation passed under the biden administration it aims to make prescription drugs more affordable and limit climate change among other items republicans charge the act will add to inflation rather than decrease it by forcing companies to enact higher prices and potentially cut jobs in fact the gop plans to use that rationale as its rallying cry for candidates in the upcoming midterm elections but democrats like u s sen debbie stabenow of michigan call the act a win for seniors and a victory for small business owners stabenow says the legislation also proves all democrats in the senate can actually cooperate on an agenda listen stabenow outlines the positives included in the inflation reduction act and what was taken out read excerpts below of stabenow s interview with wdet s quinn klinefelter edited for clarity u s sen debbie stabenow d michigan we pay the highest prices in the world literally about three times more than other countries all you have to do is cross the bridge to canada and your prescription drug prices drop about 40 but yet the drug companies have the highest profits in the world and we re seeing them putting much much more 10 times more in stock buybacks than into research this bill is going to allow medicare for the first time to negotiate the best price they ve been prohibited by law from negotiating even though they re the largest purchaser in the country medicare is gonna be able to negotiate the best price which will bring prices down in addition if you have diabetes there s going to be a cap on your out of pocket costs every month to 35 a month which is huge about one out of three people on medicare are diabetic so this is a very big deal and then keeping the cost increases to the rate of inflation or less otherwise the drug companies will be penalized so altogether this is going to lower costs and it s about time quinn klinefelter wdet news it s called the inflation reduction act some republicans are arguing that the new business taxes in the act will force companies to raise prices and maybe cut jobs or limit creating new ones how do you answer that this bill does not raise taxes on small businesses or anyone making under 400 000 a year which is not exactly a small amount of money but if you are a multi billionaire and you ve been avoiding paying any taxes you re going to have to pay your fair share this is very important we basically are tackling costs for people around prescription drugs and electric bills and other areas and then we are focusing on climate change which is hitting all of us right in the face and one of the things that motivates me is that we know now the great lakes are warming faster than the ocean and we are seeing all the effects around michigan in fact lake superior is one of the five fastest warming lakes in the world which is very frightening this bill is going to incentivize key manufacturing more electric vehicles more solar and wind bringing the battery production back to the united states which is a lot of jobs it s going to support farmers being able to do things that will lessen carbon pollution and keep the carbon in the ground so it s healthy soil but not in the air keep methane emissions out of the air which are very dangerous for creating greenhouse gas we expect in the next eight years this bill is going to reduce the amount of pollution the amount of carbon emissions by 14 which is huge so we all have to lean in on this and this is the first major step of doing that i ve heard some automakers say they fear the tax credits for the electric vehicles in particular for those buying them might not be as effective as some had hoped because they depend on buying vehicles with batteries made in the u s and so many components are not built here right at the moment and that could perhaps limit how much of a credit a customer can actually get is that a legitimate concern i ve been working very closely with the automakers so my one real disappointment is that the way this has been approached and this is really u s sen joe manchin d west virginia who was a driver on this bill he was not a supporter of electric vehicles and basically he designed a credit that is going to make it very difficult when it s fully implemented for the auto companies to be able to offer that to customers for at least five years or so so we all want to have these batteries produced in the united states we want to get off of any materials from china that s what the tax credits for manufacturing are all about but for consumers we re going to see a window of next year when the consumer credits will be fully available up to 7 500 to purchase an all electric vehicle but after that once these very very limited provisions kick in it s going to cause the credit to not be available for a few years that seems to be a phrase that comes up quite often lately especially among democrats we could have done this except for sen manchin or maybe sen kyrsten sinema d arizona right in a 50 50 senate where it s basically a tie and in this area we didn t have any republicans with so we had to have every single democrat but we got it done the new act would not only offer different services for medicare but also help people with disabilities but i ve had some disability advocates who are questioning why the home and community based services that were initially in the build back better plan were left out of the inflation reduction act can you say why that happened well i strongly support the home and community care provisions i ve been a co sponsor for years and i m leading efforts on home health care right now this is a situation where we could not get the support of sen manchin we needed 50 votes and he did not support putting in this package so this is unfinished business it definitely needs to get done and governing and in politics it is the art of the possible and so we re doing what is possible this is really really important bringing down prescription drug prices for anyone who s on medicare which includes people with disabilities is really really important the other care provisions are also important we re going to have to go back and get those done at a later point manchin was against home based community services for the disabled he did not want to include it in this legislation photo credit elise amendola ap trusted accurate up to date wdet strives to

the same publication that named him person of the year last year time magazine has now published an opinion piece about how we all need to look beyond elon musk and stop thinking that he is the singular visionary he s convinced many he is the time piece by canadian tech writer paris marx argues that among musk s other less awesome qualities he s been a bit of naysayer and spoiler for public transit and any infrastructure projects that might actually be feasible if they don t fit his notion of what the future should look like in particular marx concludes that musk s hyperloop proposal was specifically designed to derail and maybe halt california s high speed rail project even though musk and his companies never had any real plans to build a hyperloop from san francisco to los angeles or anywhere at all he has a history of floating false solutions to the drawbacks of our over reliance on cars that stifle efforts to give people other options marx writes marx is also the author of a book the road to nowhere what silicon valley gets wrong about the future of transportation and in it he quotes musk via his biographer ashlee vance about his hope of influencing ca legislators the piece is part of a recent spate of negative press about musk that seems to be a collective rethinking of how he s been so publicly lionized for being rich and smart and beyond reproach we ll set aside musk s infuriating battle with alameda county to get the fremont tesla plant back open in violation of covid safety protocols and the multiple claims about racism and sexual harassment being tolerated on the floor of the plant the great musk backlash started in earnest this spring when after launching a hostile takeover of twitter musk began trolling the company mid stream in a merger process about the number of spambots on the platform seemingly in an effort to back out of the deal that he himself proposed and signed without many caveats tesla s stock price took a hit in the process and with it musk s net worth and then we had the may arrival of sexual misconduct charges from a spacex flight attendant who claimed musk exposed himself during a massage which musk dismissed out of hand as some sort of democrat party dirty tricks campaign using the term elongate as a pun ny joke after twitter filed suit against musk in delaware chancery court musk has been fairly well dragged in the press and on social media though not by his most loyal fanboys over this whole seemingly not well thought out business debacle as lawyers for twitter were able to point out in a response to a counterclaim last week by musk the source for musk s claims about spambots was allegedly a publicly available tool called botometer that itself had deemed musk s own twitter account a likely bot new york magazine has a whole package of articles this week on musk none of which is super flattering with lane brown writing in the intro piece had always been sui generis but is when he became the elon musk we know today a master of atoms bits and bullshit who begs our awe skepticism and irritation in ever shifting proportions and whose record breaking fortune may be only the tenth most interesting thing about him there s another ny mag piece about how the boring company another of musk s seemingly joking business ideas that came out of nowhere in response to his hatred of la traffic is his biggest boondoggle jalopnik made hay last year over the opening of the boring company s first working hyperloop tunnel a 1 7 mile hole in the ground underneath the las vegas convention center in which 11 tesla model 3s are now able to drive at a maximum speed of 35 miles per hour which is about 10 mph less than the top speed of a 1908 ford model t this is because when musk dreamed up the hyperloop as a thought experiment a decade ago he was reacting to the relatively slow and expensive technology being employed in california s many billion dollar behind schedule and over budget high speed rail project how could it be that the home of silicon valley and doing incredible things like indexing all the world s knowledge and putting rovers on mars would build a bullet train that is both one of the most expensive per mile and one of the slowest in the world musk wrote back in 2012 about the high speed rail project his idea pods that would whisk people in four meter wide vacuum tubes at speeds up to 700 miles per hour sound fantastical well it was and musk admitted at the time while we are not developing a commercial hyperloop ourselves we are interested in helping to accelerate development of a functional hyperloop prototype jalopnik followed up with vance who said there s no part of me that believes elon was trying to kill public transport so people would stay in cars and vance thinks the whole thing was something musk just blurted out versus a truly intentional spoiler for a real project in the time piece marx makes a link between musk s far fetched proposals and fixation on mars to the science fiction of decades past and how ursula k le guin dismissed much of it imperialistic and promoting the notion that space and the future are synonymous they are a place we are going to get to invade colonize exploit and suburbanize le guin believed that science fiction wasn t about the future but about our present dreams and fantasies and problems arise when we succumb to wishful thinking and escapism and our science fiction gets megalomania and thinks that instead of being fiction it s prediction megalomania is certainly one thing even musk probably wouldn t deny being vulnerable to marx concludes for years elon musk sold us fantasies to distract from the reality of the future he s trying to build and to get people to accept his growing belligerence what we really need right now is not more cars colonization dreams and technokings but a collective project to improve the lives of billions of people around the world while taking on the immediate challenges we face regardless of whether it generates corporate profits that s something elon musk can never deliver related botometer that musk used to make counterclaim about twitter spambots once deemed musk himself a likely bot top image elon musk is seen at the 2022 met gala celebrating in america an anthology of fashion at the metropolitan museum of art on may 2 2022 in new york city photo

vast swathes of the country are now extremely dry and few will complain if the rain forecast next week lasts a fortnight experts are still haggling over when exactly we will have reached the textbook definition of drought but it could come as soon as today 12 august when the national drought group is scheduled to meet the effect of the lower than average rainfall this spring and summer is already abundantly clear for all farming sectors in affected areas with cattle and sheep eating into this winter s fodder supplies and some of next year s cropping plans in jeopardy see also editor s view my pick for the next pm teddy roosevelt about the author andrew meredith farmers weekly editor andrew has been farmers weekly editor since january 2021 after doing stints on the business and arable desks before joining the team he worked on his family s upland beef and sheep farm in mid wales and studied agriculture at aberystwyth university in his free time he can normally be found continuing his research into which shop sells london s finest scotch egg contact email andrew meredith markallengroup com twitter read more articles by andrew meredith globally the warmest seven years on record have all been since 2015 and farmers in the us are also seeing crop yields dwindle last year s well publicised drought in california cost the golden state us 1 7bn in direct and indirect costs and caused nearly 162 000ha of farmland to be fallowed this makes what we ve experienced so far in the uk seem relatively mild although the last period of prolonged dry weather was only in 2018 how frequently do we have to experience these conditions before they start being expected and planned for rather than battled against during the event as someone said to me recently it is near impossible to prepare for a water shortage once you re in one it is the work of many years to try to mitigate some of it at thame sheep fair in oxfordshire last week the sun again blazed overhead as ewes ran through a ring surrounded by bone dry grassless fields so it was with some surprise that i watched the hammer fall at good prices for many pens with values within touching distance of last year s high levels clearly there is still plenty of grass in the north and west and a good trade must mean there is a healthy balance between supply and demand some farmers without grazing will also no doubt be banking that it is cheaper to buy stock now and feed them than wait for it to rain and watch the price go up we all to a certain extent have to be optimistic about the weather or there would be many a year where money was put at risk by turning the ram in with the ewes or buying seed to push in the ground yet alongside optimism there also has to be realism this year has not been as bad as 1976 but just as a dry 1975 laid the ground for that terrible following year so too could this year if we don t get substantial replenishment this autumn and winter and that is why nfu president minette batters has been absolutely right to call this week for a radical rethink on how we maintain water supplies this spring and summer should live long in the memory not as an aberration but as the point at which water management moved up the agenda to become a continual priority come rain or shine just as farmers cannot create the deep rooted herbal ley they should have grown after their existing sward has died off government can t magic up a new network of reservoirs or a national water grid only once supplies have run low it is at moments like this that the lack of a coherent food strategy becomes so painfully obvious liz truss has pledged to unleash british farming if she becomes the next prime minister if she wins and truly means it then throwing her weight behind a proper water security plan would be an excellent place to start

a 1930s musical soundtrack fades down and a group of actors begin taking turns behind a microphone at the shea theater in turners falls massachusetts reading complaint letters from almost a hundred years ago they were written by customers of montgomery ward a full service mail order catalog the amazon of its time and brought to life by evan gregg whose family he said never throws anything out dear mister ward the title of the performance as well as the book of collected missives it s based on tells the stories of people who lived in a time between two world wars in mostly rural parts of the country they used the montgomery ward catalog to buy what they likely couldn t find locally gregg said like sturdy boots tractors fashionable clothes toys and car parts courtesy evan gregg one of the more humorous complaint letters to the montgomery ward catalog brought to life in a book and staging by evan gregg his grandmother verna gregg worked for montgomery ward for 10 years starting in 1932 she saved and retyped dozens of complaints montgomery ward had a well known money back guarantee and of course sometimes things didn t arrive as expected such was the case for m p mcintyre who wrote to montgomery ward from great falls montana dear sir i have tried every way i know how to make the horse collar you sent me work on my model t ford but it don t seem to fit quite right mcintyre wrote am returning at your expense and will you kindly send me the carburetor at the same time and price which is after all what i ordered in the first place another letter from mrs eric akron address not included was about the cow she and her husband owned dear company i imagine this letter will make whoever reads it laugh as the very idea of such a thing made me laugh too she wrote mr akron has been trying to convince me and the neighbors that a few years ago you used to carry a cow tail in stock for just such cows which he says was made with some kind of a clamp to clamp on to the stub of the cow jill kaufman nepm evan gregg who lives in western massachusetts found a stash of old complaint letters to montgomery ward saved by his grandmother who worked at the catalog in the 1930s gregg brought them to life in a book and a staging called dear mister ward the letters were collected by gregg s grandmother verna gregg who worked in the complaint department at montgomery ward for 10 years starting in 1932 she saved dozens of them gregg said people wrote to say they received the wrong item or something didn t fit one letter complained something was broken even years after it was purchased when the younger gregg found them stashed away among his parents belongings he said the tone of the letters struck him they are complaining about certain things but they re doing so in a very familiar kind of playful way gregg said there s no attacking there s no accusations really courtesy evan gregg starting in 1932 verna gregg worked in the complaint department of montgomery ward s catalog division she saved dozens of letters from customers in the rural midwest her family kept them and her grandson evan gregg has turned the collection into a book and a staged reading called dear mister ward he s not sure why his grandmother saved these specific letters i always knew she had a wicked sense of humor and was always interested in the stories of other people gregg said i m not sure if she had a historical context in mind or just some cheap laughs at dinner parties a letter signed a w w may have been among the cheap laughs dear sirs may i make a complaint here is the scratchy problem the letter began it seems that the paper in your general catalog is getting harder stiffer glossier more polished and less absorbent in every issue that you put out why is this if you only knew the letter continues how people use the catalog after its intended usefulness has been achieved a w w wondered why the catalog couldn t serve two useful and pleasant purposes it s evident from a recorded interview with verna gregg before she died in 1990 that she was proud to work at montgomery ward i found that when you got a complaint that montgomery ward s would really turn over backward to have a satisfied customer verna gregg said she went on to describe a letter from someone whose engagement had been called off he d bought an engagement ring and his girl broke up with him and so he had to return the engagement ring verna gregg said on the recording the short of it went the actual letter is that i have no use for an engagement ring when i am not engaged and do not anticipate any such action for some time the gal and i can t make a go of it so i m looking for other diversions the customer wondered if he could exchange the ring for a radio phonograph the price was the same at 39 95 not all letters were complaints or casual inquiries including one evan gregg chose not to include in the performance it came from a woman in mound city south dakota courtesy evan gregg evan gregg who lives in western massachusetts found a stash of old complaint letters to montgomery ward saved by his grandmother who worked at the catalog in the 1930s gregg brought them to life in a book and a staging called dear mr ward there s one letter where someone is writing for the medicine to get rid of it when you re in the family way gregg said she says that she can t have a baby right now you can t tell a lot of context from the letter he said and he doesn t know how the company responded during the early days of covd 19 gregg connected deeply with the letter collection they were written from far flung rural locations places of isolation gregg said and they echoed the situation we were all living through there s this sort of calling out from the wilderness that really stuck with me gregg said i read them over and over again until i finally decided to share them with people now using letters that included a town or address gregg is attempting to build family trees

commercial operations in late 2026 the contracted price under the cppa is more favourable than the fixed auction rate originally awarded in 2018 and is a key accomplishment as northland progresses hai long towards financial close in addition the ppas with taipower are not affected by the signing of the cppa and provide a backstop to the cppa with the cppa signed the company is focused on securing non recourse project level debt financing while securing financing terms are still subject to several macro factors there is currently strong lender interest from various global and local financial institutions in lending to the project for the long term nordsee offshore wind cluster in january 2022 northland and its german partner rwe renewables gmbh rwe announced the formation of a 1 333mw nordsee offshore wind cluster partnership the cluster encompassing nordsee two 433mw nordsee three 420mw and nordsee delta 480mw to further enhance the size and scale of the cluster and to realize additional synergies northland and rwe agreed to include a fourth project resulting in the total size of the cluster growing to over 1 5gw the fourth project godewind which is now included in the cluster will have production capacity of 225mw and is within proximity to the remaining projects the transaction is pending formal closing the projects are expected to be developed and managed on a

president construction effective august 12 2022 management thanks mr melin for all of his contributions and wishes him all the best for the future second quarter results summary offshore wind facilities electricity production increased 15 or 103gwh compared to the same quarter of 2021 primarily due to higher wind resource and fewer unpaid curtailments related to negative prices in germany partially offset by higher uncompensated grid outages at the german facilities sales of 246 million increased 20 or 41 million compared to the same quarter of 2021 primarily due to higher market prices at our offshore wind facilities most notably at our gemini facility and higher production across all facilities the continued strength in energy prices across europe resulted in the apx exceeding the sde for gemini allowing for the realization of 21 million of higher revenues in the quarter these higher revenues were partially offset by foreign exchange rate fluctuations which reduced sales by 22 million compared to the same quarter of 2021 adjusted free cash flow and free cash flow are largely hedged and were therefore unaffected by foreign exchange movements the final revenues realized for 2022 will depend on the average apx market price over the course of the year which is currently estimated at 266 mwh as at june 30 2022 excluding p i costs adjusted ebitda of 141 million increased 24 or 28 million compared to the same quarter of 2021 primarily due to higher wind resource across all three facilities higher apx at gemini and fewer unpaid curtailments related to negative prices in germany partially offset by higher uncompensated outages at the german facilities and foreign exchange rate fluctuations an important indicator for the offshore wind facilities is the historical average of the power production of each offshore wind facility where available the following table summarizes actual electricity production and the historical average high and low for the applicable operating periods of each offshore facility three months ended june 30 2022 1 2021 1 historical average 2 historical high 2 historical low 2 electricity production gwh gemini 444 385

production for the period since the commencement of commercial operation of the respective facility 2017 for gemini and nordsee one and 2020 for deutsche bucht and excludes unpaid curtailments onshore renewable facilities electricity production was 96 or 285gwh higher than the same quarter of 2021 due to the contribution from the spanish portfolio acquired in august 2021 and higher production from the canadian onshore wind facilities partially offset by lower solar resource sales of 131 million were 125 or 73 million higher than the same quarter of 2021 primarily due to the contribution from the spanish portfolio and taking into account the 150 increase in 2022 posted pool prices in the current regulatory period in spain these regulatory amendments effective retrospectively from january 1 2022 are pending governmental approval and are expected to result in higher merchant revenue exposure for 2022 as a result of an increase in the posted pool price from 49 mwh to 122 mwh thus allowing generation facilities to realize higher sales in the current year adjusted ebitda of 107 million was higher than the same quarter of 2021 excluding the contribution from the spanish portfolio production sales and adjusted ebitda in the second quarter would have been 11 4 and 5 higher respectively compared to the same quarter of 2021 primarily due to a higher wind resource at the canadian wind facilities partially offset by lower solar resource efficient natural gas facilities electricity production increased 30 or 161gwh compared to the same quarter of 2021 due to the effect of a planned maintenance outage last year at north battleford and partially offset by the effect of kirkland lake operating under an enhanced dispatch contract edc compared to a baseload ppa for the same periods last year sales and adjusted ebitda of 103 million and 88 million respectively increased 24 or 20 million and 74 or 38 million compared to the same quarter of 2021 primarily due to higher production at north battleford and thorold and also from kirkland lake s management fee the increases were partially offset by the sale of iroquois falls utilities sales and adjusted ebitda of 70 million and 29 million respectively increased 33 or 18 million and 38 or 8 million compared to the same quarter of 2021 largely due to rate escalations driven by a producer price index increases positively affecting ebsa s 2022 financial performance in december 2021 northland restructured and upsized ebsa s long term non recourse financing the ebsa facility resulting in 84 million of incremental cash proceeds to northland net of closing costs the upsizing of the ebsa facility was completed on the basis of growth in ebsa s projected ebitda growth for 2022 based on increases in the rate base net upsizing proceeds in excess of ebsa s expansionary capital expenditure needs of 17 million are included in adjusted free cash flow and free cash flow for the first six months of 2022 consolidated statement of income loss general and administrative g a costs of 20 million in the second quarter increased 34 or 5 million compared to the same quarter of 2021 primarily due to higher personnel and other costs supporting northland s global growth in line with management s expectations development costs of 15 million are in line with the same quarter of 2021 net finance costs of 77 million in the second quarter increased 3 or 2 million compared to the same quarter of 2021 primarily due to an increase in debt associated with the acquisition of the spanish portfolio partially offset by the scheduled repayments on facility level loans fair value gain on derivative contracts was 235 million in the second quarter primarily due to net movement in the fair value of derivatives related to commodity interest rates and foreign exchange contracts foreign exchange loss of 35 million in the second quarter was primarily due to unrealized losses from fluctuations in the closing foreign exchange rates net income of 268 million in the second quarter increased by 274 million compared to the same quarter of 2021 primarily due to the factors described above partially offset by 91

kirkland lake that followed the restructuring and upsizing of its credit facility completed during the quarter and other operating optimizations 26 million increase in operating results at gemini primarily due to higher apx and higher wind resource and 10 million increase in operating results primarily due to rate escalations at ebsa and higher wind resource at canadian renewable facilities the factors partially offsetting the increase in adjusted ebitda include 17 million decrease in operating results due to loss in contribution as a result of the expiry of the ppa and subsequent sale

including the realized gains from the sale of two of the company s efficient natural gas assets along with the continued strength in european power prices management is revising its stated financial guidance for 2022 for adjusted ebitda adjusted free cash flow and free cash flow per share for 2022 adjusted ebitda is now expected to be in a range of 1 25 billion to 1 35 billion 1 15 billion to 1 25 billion previously adjusted free cash flow per share is now expected to be in the range of 1 85 to 2 05 1 65 to 1 85 previously and free cash flow per share is now expected to be in the range of 1 40 to 1 60 1 20 to 1 40 previously these ranges factor in higher expected debt repayments on certain european facilities pending successful completion of refinancings that are currently in progress and targeted to be completed later in 2022 the revised guidance ranges may be subject to further upside should power prices in europe continue to trade at elevated levels for the remainder of 2022 particularly as it relates to northland s offshore wind facilities northland s financial position continues to be strong and the company remains well positioned to fund its growth objectives northland expects to be able to refinance any material maturities due in the next five years moreover over 95 of total debt is non recourse to the company northland also has access to a 807 million undrawn corporate revolving credit facility with approximately 1 0 billion of total available liquidity as of august 11 2022 which can be utilized to fund growth projects that ultimately advance to financial close borrowings under the credit facilities are revolving such that they are ultimately repaid from project financings at financial close corporate and or project level financing optimizations and or sell downs at or before financial close northland s adjusted free cash flow finances growth expenditures and corporate costs that support growth and new initiatives with a focus on its bbb stable credit rating from s p and fitch northland considers it preferable to employ low cost corporate credit to fund investments in its capitalized growth projects most of which are targeted for financial close in either 2022 or 2023 to the extent there is excess adjusted free cash flow generated by the company through financial and operational outperformance these additional cash flows will be used fund capitalized growth projects thereby reducing the need for corporate debt or equity funding northland also intends to execute a selective sell down strategy of partial interests of certain of its development projects on or before financial close to allow the company to i manage jurisdictional exposures ii crystallize some development profit prior to construction as a result of the de risking of the project iii enhance our adjusted free cash flow and liquidity position and iv increase project returns amongst other considerations the company will assess each opportunity individually and

all the best for the future second quarter results summary offshore wind facilities electricity production increased 15 or 103gwh compared to the same quarter of 2021 primarily due to higher wind resource and fewer unpaid curtailments related to negative prices in germany partially offset by higher uncompensated grid outages at the german facilities sales of 246 million increased 20 or 41 million compared to the same quarter of 2021 primarily due to higher market prices at our offshore wind facilities most notably at our gemini facility and higher production across all facilities the continued strength in energy prices across europe resulted in the apx exceeding the sde for gemini allowing for the realization of 21 million of higher revenues in the quarter these higher revenues were partially offset by foreign exchange rate fluctuations which reduced sales by 22 million compared to the same quarter of 2021 adjusted free cash flow and free cash flow are largely hedged and were therefore unaffected by foreign exchange movements the final revenues realized for 2022 will depend on the average apx market price over the course of the year which is currently estimated at 266 mwh as at june 30 2022 excluding p i costs adjusted ebitda of 141 million increased 24 or 28 million compared to the same quarter of 2021 primarily due to higher wind resource across all three facilities higher apx at gemini and fewer unpaid curtailments related to negative prices in germany partially offset by higher uncompensated outages at the german facilities and foreign exchange rate fluctuations an important indicator for the offshore wind facilities is the historical average of the power production of each offshore wind facility where available the following table summarizes actual electricity production and the historical average high and low for the applicable operating periods of each offshore facility three months ended june 30 2022 1 2021 1 historical average 2

attributed to paid curtailments 2 represents the average historical power production for the period since the commencement of commercial operation of the respective facility 2017 for gemini and nordsee one and 2020 for deutsche bucht and excludes unpaid curtailments onshore renewable facilities electricity production was 96 or 285gwh higher than the same quarter of 2021 due to the contribution from the spanish portfolio acquired in august 2021 and higher production from the canadian onshore wind facilities partially offset by lower solar resource sales of 131 million were 125 or 73 million higher than the same quarter of 2021 primarily due to the contribution from the spanish portfolio and taking into account the 150 increase in 2022 posted pool prices in the current regulatory period in spain these regulatory amendments effective retrospectively from january 1 2022 are pending governmental approval and are expected to result in higher merchant revenue exposure for 2022 as a result of an increase in the posted pool price from 49 mwh to 122 mwh thus allowing generation facilities to realize higher sales in the current year adjusted ebitda of 107 million was higher than the same quarter of 2021 excluding the contribution from the spanish portfolio production sales and adjusted ebitda in the second quarter would have been 11 4 and 5 higher respectively compared to the same quarter of 2021 primarily due to a higher wind resource at the canadian wind facilities partially offset by lower solar resource efficient natural gas facilities electricity production increased 30 or 161gwh compared to the same quarter of 2021 due to the effect of a planned maintenance outage last year at north battleford and partially offset by the effect of kirkland lake operating under an enhanced dispatch contract edc compared to a baseload ppa for the same periods last year sales and adjusted ebitda of 103 million and 88 million respectively increased 24 or 20 million and 74 or 38 million compared to the same quarter of 2021 primarily due to higher production at north battleford and thorold and also from kirkland lake s management fee the increases were partially offset by the sale of iroquois falls utilities sales and adjusted ebitda of 70 million and 29 million respectively increased 33 or 18 million and 38 or 8 million compared to the same quarter of 2021 largely due to rate escalations driven by a producer price index increases positively affecting ebsa s 2022 financial performance in december 2021 northland restructured and upsized ebsa s long term non recourse financing the ebsa facility resulting in 84 million of incremental cash proceeds to northland net of closing costs the upsizing of the ebsa facility was completed on the basis of growth in ebsa s projected ebitda growth for 2022 based on increases in the rate base net upsizing proceeds in excess of ebsa s expansionary capital expenditure needs of 17 million are included in adjusted free cash flow and free cash flow for the first six months of 2022 consolidated statement of income loss general and administrative g a costs of 20 million in the second quarter increased 34 or 5 million compared to the same quarter of 2021 primarily due to higher personnel and other costs supporting northland s global growth in line with management s expectations development costs of 15 million are in line with the same quarter of 2021 net finance costs of 77 million in the second quarter increased 3 or 2 million compared to the same quarter of 2021 primarily due to an increase in debt associated with the acquisition of the spanish portfolio partially offset by the scheduled repayments on facility level loans fair value gain on derivative contracts was 235 million in the second quarter primarily due to net movement in the fair value of derivatives related to commodity interest rates and foreign exchange contracts foreign exchange loss of 35 million in the second quarter was primarily due to unrealized losses from fluctuations in the closing foreign exchange rates net income of 268 million in the second quarter increased by 274 million compared to the same quarter of 2021

adjusted ebitda 42 million increase in contribution from a management fee from kirkland lake that followed the restructuring and upsizing of its credit facility completed during the quarter and other operating optimizations 26 million increase in operating results at gemini primarily due to higher apx and higher wind resource and 10 million increase in operating results primarily due to rate escalations at ebsa and higher wind resource at canadian renewable facilities the factors partially offsetting the increase in adjusted ebitda include 17 million decrease in operating results due to loss in contribution as a result of the expiry of the ppa and subsequent sale of iroquois falls in april 2022 and 3 million increase in g a costs and growth expenditures to support global growth

outlook with the strong financial performance experienced through the first six months of the year including the realized gains from the sale of two of the company s efficient natural gas assets along with the continued strength in european power prices management is revising its stated financial guidance for 2022 for adjusted ebitda adjusted free cash flow and free cash flow per share for 2022 adjusted ebitda is now expected to be in a range of 1 25 billion to 1 35 billion 1 15 billion to 1 25 billion previously adjusted free cash flow per share is now expected to be in the range of 1 85 to 2 05 1 65 to 1 85 previously and free cash flow per share is now expected to be in the range of 1 40 to 1 60 1 20 to 1 40 previously these ranges factor in higher expected debt repayments on certain european facilities pending successful completion of refinancings that are currently in progress and targeted to be completed later in 2022 the revised guidance ranges may be subject to further upside

credit to fund investments in its capitalized growth projects most of which are targeted for financial close in either 2022 or 2023 to the extent there is excess adjusted free cash flow generated by

change in its executive team with the departure of morten melin executive vice president construction effective august 12 2022 management thanks mr melin for all of his contributions and wishes him all the best for the future second quarter results summary offshore wind facilities electricity production increased 15 or 103gwh compared to the same quarter of 2021 primarily due to higher wind resource and fewer unpaid curtailments related to negative prices in germany partially offset by higher uncompensated grid outages at the german facilities sales of 246 million increased 20 or 41 million compared to the same quarter of 2021 primarily due to higher market prices at our offshore wind facilities most notably at our gemini facility and higher production across all facilities the continued strength in energy prices across europe resulted in the apx exceeding the sde for gemini allowing for the realization of 21 million of higher revenues in the quarter these higher revenues were partially offset by foreign exchange rate fluctuations which reduced sales by 22 million compared to the same quarter of 2021 adjusted free cash flow and free cash flow are largely hedged and were therefore unaffected by foreign exchange movements the final revenues realized for 2022 will depend on the average apx market price over the course of the year which is currently estimated at 266 mwh as at june 30 2022 excluding p i costs adjusted ebitda of 141 million increased 24 or 28 million compared to the same quarter of 2021 primarily due to higher wind resource across all three facilities higher apx at gemini and fewer unpaid curtailments related to negative prices in germany partially offset by higher uncompensated outages at the german facilities and foreign exchange rate fluctuations an important indicator for the offshore wind facilities is the historical average of the power production of each offshore wind facility where available the following table summarizes actual electricity production and the historical average high and low for the applicable operating periods of each offshore facility three months ended june 30 2022 1 2021 1 historical average 2

attributed to paid curtailments 2 represents the average historical power production for the period since the commencement of commercial operation of the respective facility 2017 for gemini and nordsee one and 2020 for deutsche bucht and excludes unpaid curtailments onshore renewable facilities electricity production was 96 or 285gwh higher than the same quarter of 2021 due to the contribution from the spanish portfolio acquired in august 2021 and higher production from the canadian onshore wind facilities partially offset by lower solar resource sales of 131 million were 125 or 73 million higher than the same quarter of 2021 primarily due to the contribution from the spanish portfolio and taking into account the 150 increase in 2022 posted pool prices in the current regulatory period in spain these regulatory amendments effective retrospectively from january 1 2022 are pending governmental approval and are expected to result in higher merchant revenue exposure for 2022 as a result of an increase in the posted pool price from 49 mwh to 122 mwh thus allowing generation facilities to realize higher sales in the current year adjusted ebitda of 107 million was higher than the same quarter of 2021 excluding the contribution from the spanish portfolio production sales and adjusted ebitda in the second quarter would have been 11 4 and 5 higher respectively compared to the same quarter of 2021 primarily due to a higher wind resource at the canadian wind facilities partially offset by lower solar resource efficient natural gas facilities electricity production increased 30 or 161gwh compared to the same quarter of 2021 due to the effect of a planned maintenance outage last year at north battleford and partially offset by the effect of kirkland lake operating under an enhanced dispatch contract edc compared to a baseload ppa for the same periods last year sales and adjusted ebitda of 103 million and 88 million respectively increased 24 or 20 million and 74 or 38 million compared to the same quarter of 2021 primarily due to higher production at north battleford and thorold and also from kirkland lake s management fee the increases were partially offset by the sale of iroquois falls utilities sales and adjusted ebitda of 70 million and 29 million respectively increased 33 or 18 million and 38 or 8 million compared to the same quarter of 2021 largely due to rate escalations driven by a producer price index increases positively affecting ebsa s 2022 financial performance in december 2021 northland restructured and upsized ebsa s long term non recourse financing the ebsa facility resulting in 84 million of incremental cash proceeds to northland net of closing costs the upsizing of the ebsa facility was completed on the basis of growth in ebsa s projected ebitda growth for 2022 based on increases in the rate base net upsizing proceeds in excess of ebsa s expansionary capital expenditure needs of 17 million are included in adjusted free cash flow and free cash flow for the first six months of 2022 consolidated statement of income loss general and administrative g a costs of 20 million in the second quarter increased 34 or 5 million compared to the same quarter of 2021 primarily due to higher personnel and other costs supporting northland s global growth in line with management s expectations development costs of 15 million are in line with the same quarter of 2021 net finance costs of 77 million in the second quarter increased 3 or 2 million compared to the same quarter of 2021 primarily due to an increase in debt associated with the acquisition of the spanish portfolio partially offset by the scheduled repayments on facility level loans fair value gain on derivative contracts was 235 million in the second quarter primarily due to net movement in the fair value of derivatives related to commodity interest rates and foreign exchange contracts foreign exchange loss of 35 million in the second quarter was primarily due to unrealized losses from fluctuations in the closing foreign exchange rates net income of 268 million in the second quarter increased by 274 million compared to the same quarter of 2021

escalations at ebsa and higher wind resource at canadian renewable facilities the factors partially offsetting the increase in adjusted ebitda include 17 million decrease in operating results due to

outlook with the strong financial performance experienced through the first six months of the year including the realized gains from the sale of two of the company s efficient natural gas assets along with the continued strength in european power prices management is revising its stated financial guidance for 2022 for adjusted ebitda adjusted free cash flow and free cash flow per share for 2022 adjusted ebitda is now expected to be in a range of 1 25 billion to 1 35 billion 1 15 billion to 1 25 billion previously adjusted free cash flow per share is now expected to be in the range of 1 85 to 2 05 1 65 to 1 85 previously and free cash flow per share is now expected to be in the range of 1 40 to 1 60 1 20 to 1 40 previously these ranges factor in higher expected debt repayments on certain european facilities pending successful completion of refinancings that are currently in progress and targeted to be completed later in 2022 the revised guidance ranges may be subject to further upside should power prices in europe continue to trade at elevated levels for the remainder of 2022 particularly as it relates to northland s offshore wind facilities northland s financial position continues to be strong and the company remains well positioned to fund its growth objectives northland expects to be able to refinance any material maturities due in the next five years moreover over 95 of total debt is non recourse to the company northland also has access to a 807 million undrawn corporate revolving credit facility with approximately 1 0 billion of total available liquidity as of august 11 2022 which can be utilized to fund growth projects that ultimately advance to financial close borrowings under the credit facilities are revolving such that they are ultimately repaid from project financings at financial close corporate and or project level financing optimizations and or sell downs at or before financial close northland s adjusted free cash flow finances growth expenditures and corporate costs that support growth and new initiatives with a focus on its bbb stable credit rating from s p and fitch northland considers it preferable to employ low cost corporate credit to fund investments in its capitalized growth projects most of which are targeted for financial close in either 2022 or 2023 to the extent there is excess adjusted free cash flow generated by the company through financial and operational outperformance these additional cash flows will be used fund capitalized growth projects thereby reducing the need for corporate debt or equity funding northland also intends to execute a selective sell down strategy of partial interests of certain of its development projects on or before financial close to allow the company to i manage jurisdictional exposures ii crystallize some development profit prior to construction as a result of the de risking of the project iii enhance our adjusted free cash flow and liquidity position and iv

the uk s national hydrological monitoring programme provides a stream of monthly data its bulletin for july is due out on this coming friday recent ones have referenced a general shortage of rainfall since last autumn and a trend of dry spring months in recent years the bulletin for june published early last month included a sentence which has turned out to set the scene for what has unfolded in much of england and wales with river flows groundwater levels and reservoir stocks widely below average and current outlooks favouring a continuation of this situation there is a heightened risk of impacts on agriculture the environment and water supplies in the coming months hot dry weather in early july further adds to this prospect it said reservoir stocks in wales it added were the lowest recorded for the month of june and all this before the heatwave which smashed records in wales england and scotland while the benefits of the dry and hot weather for holiday makers and families with children during the summer break are welcome the countryside is under stress as is much of western europe notably france a major food producer a spokesman for the uk centre for ecology and hydrology one of two organisations which compiles the monthly bulletins told the local democracy reporting service that the impacts of these drought like conditions in the uk included a reduction in soil quality peat and moorlands drying out habitat loss wildfires tree and vegetation death even localised extinctions some trees may even shed whole branches as a defence mechanism according to an expert at the royal botanic gardens kew london kevin martin head of tree collections at kew said this was known as summer or sudden branch drop many species can suffer from this he said including beech oak cedar sweet chestnut and horse chestnut mr martin said trees had various mechanisms to cope with prolonged dry conditions such as dropping leaves earlier than normal and relying on stored energy from spring and early summer he said they could also control water loss by closing stomata minute pores in their leaves when it came to unusual heat mr martin said trees had different traits depending on their natural distribution those which dealt with more regular heat stress normally had leaves with thicker and hairy undersides and branches in a layering formation to protect the inner shaded section with mass tree planting government policy in wales and the uk mr martin said kew gardens which has a collection of 14 000 trees was observing which species were better suited to hot dry conditions and which were not i would say trees which come from the mediterranean zone and eastern asian area are best adapted to deal with heat and drought stress he said species which were becoming unsuitable he added included silver birch and common beech asked if trees which were less suited to prolonged dry and hot conditions recovered quickly when rainfall returned and temperatures decreased he said unfortunately not the damage caused by the current conditions will have long term impact mr martin said this was particularly in terms of damage caused to the tree vascular system which carries water water and minerals from the roots to the leaves and photosynthesised food back down farmers union nfu cymru said the negative effects of the current conditions probably outweighed the benefits although it stressed there were large regional variations a union spokesman said there was more certainty in terms of harvesting wheat and corn but that soil moisture reduction could impact yield quality he said it was very unlikely that anyone will be able to get crops planted back in the ground at present and that the current conditions were of particular concern to horticultural growers with potatoes among the crops affected the main concern for livestock farmers at present is the welfare of their animals said the spokesman grass growth was a major concern for many areas of wales with many farmers likely to use winter forage early the spokesman said some farmers who relied on boreholes and natural springs may have to start getting water from elsewhere he added that farmers in wales were working towards an nfu cymru net zero target by 2040 a core element of which was to become more efficient many farms would like to store more water and it s important that planning systems enable this to happen he said tom rees of pembrokeshire farms 1 200 acres three quarters of which is for combined crops such as wheat barley and oil seed rape apart from 50 acres of potatoes the rest is woodland and grass it has been very very dry since almost this time last year apart from sporadic downpours last september and october he said however he said the conditions have been very favourable for his arable crops thanks to just enough rain top ups coming at the right time the harvest has been unprecedented it s never as been as early as this before said the 34 year old the yield doesn t doesn t seem to be too bad we re also getting high quality straw in large volumes the overall rainfall shortage has badly affected his potatoes though the farm s irrigation ponds ran dry in june although there is still a couple of feet of water in them to support ducks and other wildlife mr rees said rainfall normally recharged the ponds but not in recent weeks i should think the water table is out of sight he said he said he expected to get 15 to 18 tonnes of potatoes per acre this summer compared to 25 tonnes in a normal year shoppers may start seeing smaller potatoes carrots and onions on the shelves in the coming months mr rees said the next oil seed rape crop needed planting shortly and that rain was needed to boost low soil moisture levels that s really important he said there s quite a shortage of oil seed crops ukraine was a massive exporter of sunflowers for sunflower oil high pressure systems have dominated the weather in much of the uk and western europe of late bringing bone dry conditions and heatwaves the jet stream a west to east river of air five to seven miles above the earth s surface which tends to usher in unsettled weather has largely passed to the north this in itself is not unusual for the summer the met office said the jet stream in the northern hemisphere largely exists due to a difference in heat between cold air on the northern side towards the arctic and warm air to the south the met office said the seasons also affected the position of the jet stream in winter there is more of a temperature difference hence the jet stream is stronger and flows across the uk as temperatures in the arctic are rising faster than elsewhere in the world could this mean that the jet stream itself will move north in the summer because the temperature difference needed in its formation moves in that direction it is a theory which has received attention met office climate scientist adam scaife said it was correct that the jet stream had moved north this summer and that the arctic was warming around three times faster than the rest of the planet but he said these two things were not connected it s not that it s impossible but the early studies were very speculative he said i would not attribute this summer to the warming of the arctic he said the latest evidence was that if anything the jet stream should move south in response to arctic warming prof scaife also said there were also effects on our summers connected to the atlantic ocean he added that once the jet stream did move small scale weather patterns helped to keep it locked in which helped to explain why we get persistent wet or dry summers the met office said fierce heatwaves have occurred this summer in china and parts of the usa particular the south west as well as western europe it said many of these events were connected by a naturally occurring pattern in the atmosphere known as wavenumber 5 pattern it said it was monitoring this pattern very closely what is the role of climate change in all this the met office asked in a blog the extreme temperatures that we have been experiencing in the uk are unprecedented in recorded history it said in a climate unaffected by human influence climate modelling shows that it is virtually impossible for temperatures in the uk to reach 40c the persistent dry conditions were compounding localised effects it said when the sun shines on the ground dry soils cannot release energy through evaporation of moisture which means that more of the sun s energy goes into heating the air further amplifying the temperatures in the uk it said the wavenumber 5 pattern climate change and soil moisture feedback had come together in the uk and made temperatures of 40c possible rivers in wales are feeling the strain the wye and usk foundation which restores and protects the ecology and fisheries of the wye and usk rivers said low water levels were combining with higher than normal evaporation rates this concentrated river nutrients whatever their source and could in turn provide ideal conditions for algae to bloom and deprive aquatic life of vital oxygen the environmental charity said high water temperatures stressed fish making them more vulnerable to illness a spokeswoman said some sections of river have even dried up extinguishing any aquatic life which would have existed before she said the whole of wales and its river courses are suffering at present with some in more difficulty than others the ongoing low levels of precipitation across wales in june and july have meant that no area is operating at normal water levels at present she said low water levels also posed problems for agriculture and industrial sectors which abstracted water from rivers the river ecosystem once stressed by low water levels and the knock on effects that these have in a heatwave will take substantial time to recover without sustained precipitation and more moderate temperatures she said

a plurality of americans say immigration is making the country worse off the polling data reveals a large 28 point shift since late 2019 in public judgment about the value of the government s decades long policy of pulling economic migrants into americans society thirty five percent of the respondents said immigration makes the united states worse off while 31 percent said immigration makes the u s better off according to the july 23 26 poll of 1 500 citizens the number of americans who believe that immigration has made the united states worse off has nearly doubled in less than three years while the percentage who thought it made america better off dropped by nearly a quarter noted andrew arthur a former immigration judge who now works with the center for immigration studies he added what could account for that change the most obvious explanation is migrant surge that has created a national security and humanitarian catastrophe at the southwest border in a prior yougov poll in september 2019 the worse off number was 19 percent and the better off number was 43 percent the 2019 to 2022 turnaround adds up to a 28 point shift in views in both polls 37 percent picked not sure or doesn t make much difference the same pro american shift is seen in other polls as biden open the southern border to a huge wave of roughly two million migrants that wave is pressuring down americans wages pushing up their rents and reducing workplace investment for example gallup reported on february 8 that just 27 percent of americans want immigration raised while 38 percent want migration reduced that is a 12 point shift since january 2019 when those numbers were almost level at 30 percent and 29 percent an april 2021 survey by the pro migration bipartisan policy center found a 19 point shift from a 2020 poll the share of adults who say immigrants hurt the united states long term economic recovery from covid 19 has increased from 25 to 40 15 since may of 2020 the center said the help numbers dropped from 28 percent to 23 percent the yougov poll showed that hispanics split evenly 32 percent for better off and 30 percent for worse off yougov s top line numbers also show the deepening polarization between president joe biden s corps of pro migration progressives and the gop s expanding base of american solidarity voters for example yougov asked respondents if they would support more immigration even if it means it is harder for other workers to get raises fifteen percent of all respondents said they would strongly back wage cutting migration that 15 percent included 23 percent of democrats 28 percent of liberals and 23 percent of voters who backed biden in 2020 in contrast wage cutting migration is backed by just nine percent of republicans eight percent of conservatives and seven percent of trump s 2020 voters on the other side of the issue 23 percent of all respondents strongly oppose wage cutting migration that strongly oppose group included just 20 percent of democrats nine percent of liberals and 12 percent of biden voters but it also included 40 percent of trump voters 39 percent of republicans and 38 percent of conservatives the strongly numbers are politically important because they suggest that the issue shapes the voters voting choices if gop dares to try there is plenty of opportunity for the gop to grow the strongly oppose numbers by pushing a pocketbook message against immigration to the somewhat oppose and somewhat support subgroups for example the potentially gettable somewhat support group includes 24 percent of all respondents 24 percent of independents and 20 percent of democrats the weak somewhat support cohort could also be shifted by a pocketbook pitch that group includes 21 percent of all voters 29 percent of democrats and 18 percent of independents but threats from deep pocketed donors have caused gop leaders to deny any recognition of migration s pocketbook costs the leaders defensiveness coexists with their eagerness to talk about the pocketbook damage of inflation and wages for example gop s chairwoman ronna mcdaniel conspicuously dodged any mention of migration s pocketbook costs in her august 10 article touting the gop s 2024 convention in wisconsin from skyrocketing prices to rising violent crime and deadly drugs pouring through an open border to indoctrination in our kids classrooms democrats have let the american people down at every turn republicans offer a different vision we want to cut your taxes not raise them and we will unleash american energy to drive down costs at the pump we will always support our police hold criminals accountable and give law enforcement the tools they need to keep our communities safe we want parents to have a role in their kids education and to ensure that young students aren t bombarded with radical and inappropriate curriculum but she did include a pro migration dog whistle to her party s donors above all republicans celebrate america because we understand that this nation is and always will be the shining city on the hill that the rest of the world looks to as an example of freedom and opportunity in the yougov poll the respondents income did not shape the strongly answers to the question about wage cutting migration for example people who earn under 50 000 per year split 15 percent strongly support vs 25 percent strongly oppose when asked about wage cutting migration the support and opposition numbers were exactly the same among the americans who earn 100 000 or more but the poll showed sharp divisions between blue collar and white collar respondents wage cutting migration was strongly supported by 9 percent of white k 12 graduates and by 16 percent of white college grads it was strongly opposed by 29 percent of white k 12 graduates and 21 percent of white college graduates the poll did not provide enough detail to show if some of the white college graduates would be swayed to back the gop in exchange for a promise to curb the fortune 500 s visa programs that are gutting segments of the white collar professional sector some gop legislators have begun defending white collar americans from the fortune 500 s use of visa workers extraction migration the policy of extraction migration is central to the u s economy the policy extracts human material migrants from poor countries and uses them as workers renters and consumers to shift vast wealth from ordinary people to billionaires and wall st since at least 1990 the d c establishment has extracted tens of millions of legal and illegal migrants plus temporary visa workers from poor countries to serve as workers managers consumers and renters for various u s investors and ceos this policy of labor inflation makes it difficult for ordinary americans to get married advance in their careers raise families or buy homes extraction migration slows innovation and shrinks americans productivity partly because it allows employers to boost stock prices by using cheap stoop labor instead of productivity boosting technology migration undermines employees workplace rights and it widens the regional wealth gaps between the democrats big coastal states and the republicans heartland and southern states the flood of cheap labor tilts the economy towards low productivity jobs and has shoved at least ten million american men out of the labor force an economy built on extraction migration also drains americans political clout over elites alienates young people and radicalizes americans democratic civic culture because it allows wealthy elites to ignore despairing americans at the bottom of society the economic policy is backed by progressives who wish to transform the u s from a society governed by european origin civic culture into a progressive directed empire of competitive resentful identity groups we re trying to become the first multiracial multi ethnic superpower in the world rep rohit khanna d ca told the new york times in march 2022 it will be an extraordinary achievement we will ultimately triumph he boasted the progressives colonialism like economic strategy kills many migrants it exploits the poverty of migrants and splits foreign families as it extracts human resources from poor home countries to serve wealthy u s investors this migration policy also minimizes shareholder pressure on u s companies to build up beneficial and complementary trade with people in poor countries business backed progressive advocates hide this extraction migration economic policy behind a wide variety of noble sounding explanations and theatrical border security programs so progressives claim that the u s is a nation of immigrants that migration is good for migrants and that the state must renew itself by replacing populations many polls show the public wants to welcome some immigration but they also show the deep and broad public opposition to labor migration and the inflow of temporary contract workers into jobs sought by young u s graduates this third rail opposition is growing anti establishment multiracial cross sex non racist class based bipartisan rational persistent and recognizes the solidarity that american citizens owe to one another

democrats say their package will lower healthcare costs boost clean energy while republicans warn of irs overreach and inflation senate majority leader chuck schumer points to the inflation reduction act as one piece of a larger set of recent democratic legislative victories photo ting shen bloomberg news washington democrats expected passage of their climate healthcare and tax billdraws a clear line with republicans headed into the midterms with the parties now laying out competing economic visions for voters who will decide control of the house and senate democrats say the inflation reduction act provides much needed investment in cleaner energy and lowers healthcare costs while the gop says the bill will pinch small businesses while subsidizing electric cars for wealthy americans and do nothing to cut households bills the senate passed the package sundayalong party lines and house democrats are expected to approve it friday sending it to president biden s desk one source of uncertainty is the fbi s search of former president donald trump s mar a lago residence with political strategists cautioning it is too early to predict how that could affect midterm races the climate tax and healthcare legislation offers tax incentives for reducing carbon emissions seeks to allow medicare to negotiate the price of some prescription drugs allots roughly 80 billion to

extreme positions and fielding extreme candidates said tom perez former democratic national committee chairman and co chairman of the super pac american bridge 21st century democrats spent us into inflation then raised taxes in a recession and sent an army of irs agents to harass your business for good measure said jack pandol spokesman for the senate leadership fund a super pac run by allies of senate minority leader mitch mcconnell r ky democrats have been fighting an uphill battle to keep control of congress with nonpartisan groups predicting double digit pickups by republicans in the house but the recent supreme court ruling ending federal abortion rights along with several recent policy victories appears to have energized voters and improved democrats prospects earlier this month kansas voters soundly rejected a proposed state constitutional amendment that would have ended protections for abortion the white house plans to put president biden vice president kamala harris and cabinet officials on the road to promote the string of legislative wins officials said thursday the parties are now neck and neck in public polling over who voters want in control of congress closing a two point advantage for republicans that stood for much of the past year according to aggregator five thirty eight typically democrats need to be ahead in this measure by several percentage points to win the chamber election watcher dave wasserman pointed to special elections tuesday night when republicans won house seats in minnesota and nebraska but the margin was narrower than expected there s still time for things to snap back before november but we re no longer living in a political environment as pro gop as november 2021 tweeted mr wasserman the u s house editor of the nonpartisan cook political report meanwhile democratic senate candidates are polling better than mr biden in battleground races dimming republicans once bright hopes of taking back control of the now 50 50 chamber it is unknown how this week s search of mr trump s home might affect the midterms some republican strategists privately predict that while it could have an impact on gop voter enthusiasm which they say is already high it is unlikely to replace the economy as the central issue for voters it s something that everyone will continue to talk about it s an issue that generates clicks but the fundamentals of this election remain the same the economy is in shambles democrats are at fault and voters want change said one gop strategist working on senate races democrats too dismissed the idea that the drama surrounding the search would dominate voters decision making in november sean hannity isn t going to be with us newsflash said mr perez in a reference to the pro trump fox news political host of the fbi action he said i don t see any impact of that i mean the folks who are against us were always going to be against us in an interview on msnbc monday mr schumer said that voters had been wondering whether democrats could get anything done if they keep control of congress i think the last six weeks and particularly this recent bill answer with a resounding yes he said in an interview thursday on sirius xm radio he predicted that the democrats would pick up two or three senate seats if the election were held today allowing them to pursue spending programs left out of their bill such as child care mr schumer has said that he would force republicans to vote again on capping insulin costs at 35 a month most senate republicans voted to strip a provision out of democrats bill that would have capped costs at 35 for patients with private insurance after the senate parliamentarian ruled that it didn t comply with senate rules for advancing legislation under the reconciliation process the cap remains in the bill for medicare recipients republican sen ron johnson of wisconsin who voted to strip out the insulin price cap complained it was a gotcha vote as under senate rules the provision shouldn t have been included in the legislation the dems wanted to break senate rules to pass insulin pricing cap instead of going through regular order tweeted mr johnson who is running for re election in a state mr biden won in 2020 they put this in a bill it wasn t allowed in all for show sen ron johnson who is up for re election in wisconsin has criticized democratic efforts to cap the price of insulin saying it is all for show photo tom williams zuma press senate democrats used a process called reconciliation to pass the package with just a simple majority rather than the 60 typically required under reconciliation provisions have to be closely tied to the federal budget democratic super pacs issue advocacy groups and candidates already are airing ads focused on the insulin cap in battleground states nevada arizona georgia and north carolina in both english and spanish republicans for their part see the broad expansion of the irs as a key election issue some republicans have tried to link it to the fbi s search of mar a lago as another example of the biden administration s overreach if they will weaponize the fbi to go after president trump they will surely weaponize the irs s 87 000 new agents to go after you tweeted rep andrew clyde r ga in ohio where democratic rep tim ryan is vying with republican author j d vance for an open senate seat the candidates clashed this week over the bill s electric vehicle tax credits and irs measures i don t buy that anything that s good for joe biden is actually good for people that i m hoping to represent mr vance said on fox business democrats have rejected calls and laws that would make sure those irs agents don t go after small and medium size businesses in my state this is a disaster a political nonprofit group affiliated with the senate leadership fund launched a 3 8 million ad campaign in ohio that blames mr ryan s support of democrats legislative agenda for sending inflation through the roof and raising gas and grocery prices on ohioans one nation also is funding similar ads in battleground states arizona nevada new hampshire and georgia attempting to tie the reckless reconciliation package to inflation mr ryan defended the reconciliation bill in a statement saying the bill will bring down inflation and slash the deficit cut healthcare costs for working ohioans and create new good paying jobs in the electric vehicle industry he said mr vance is showing yet again that he neither knows what s been happening in ohio nor does he care enough to find out write to lindsay wise at

by frank pallotta cnn business in november 2019 disney debuted disney kicking off the so called streaming wars and prompting companies across the media world to spend billions of dollars to launch services to take on netflix netflix was seen as the existential threat to the legacy media industry so following its lead on subscriber growth was the strategy the only one practically everyone on wall street and in media board rooms cared about pandemic lockdowns exacerbated the urgency now that war to win over subscribers at any cost is over disney is hiking prices after losing a ton of money on its various streaming services netflix recently jacked up prices and is cracking down on password sharing warner bros discovery cnn s parent company is scrapping films and series left and right and reversing its controversial everything under one streaming roof strategy all three services are expanding their ad supported offerings streaming itself isn t going anywhere it s the present and future of hollywood but the spend now ask questions later days look to be coming to an end as these services mature and media companies cleave to what makes money the streaming wars are over because subscriber growth has come to a halt michael nathanson a media analyst at moffettnathanson told cnn business you re fighting a war in a land that has no more resources in it disney announced thursday that disney added 14 4 million subscribers in the third quarter exceeding expectations the company s other big news was that it would be raising the price of its ad free service by 3 per month after it lost more than 1 billion in the quarter on streaming despite disney s growth in the third quarter the company announced it was revising its long term forecasts for the platform disney is just one of many streaming providers that have revised their strategic plans lately david zaslav ceo of warner bros discovery has canceled multiple big budget projects for hbo max while also reiterating that he s not trying to win the streaming spending war zaslav s strategy is the opposite of the approach taken by his predecessor jason kilar whose focus was to put as much content as possible on hbo max no matter the consequences netflix s growth has stalled after it lost subscribers two quarters in a row its stock has fallen roughly 60 so far this year and in a bid to course correct the platform is transforming itself from a streaming revolutionary to a new age legacy media company next year it s debuting a lower priced ad supported option something it said it would never do and clamping down on password sharing something it previously said helped it grow when the streaming wars officially kicked off in late 2019 early 2020 the major services outlined their five year goals matthew ball ceo of epyllion an investment and advisory firm and former amazon studios executive told cnn business we re halfway there now and thus executives must confront whether their targets are achievable or even desirable and this is leading to many strategy changes as it should so streaming is evolving but if the streaming wars phase is coming to an end what s next the rumble of the bundles nathanson believes that the next phrase of the streaming revolution will be one of consolidation and bundling services can get together to form new services or do what disney is trying to do and bundle the heck out of two or three other services he said as we saw in pay tv bundles work you have your broadband your phone and your video with one place and that worked for awhile this is why it s no coincidence that even though disney raised prices across many of its tiers it didn t touch its premium disney bundle which consists of disney hulu and espn and remains 19 99 this move appears to be disney s way of pushing consumers to sign up for its entire slate of services rather than just one warner bros discovery is also going down the consolidation path the company announced last week that the long awaited merger of its services hbo max and discovery will debut in the us next summer so if the first phase of the streaming revolution was the streaming wars the next phase could be dubbed the rumble of the bundles as for ball he believes big media companies will do what they ve always done operate in multiple different media categories for years hollywood has been primarily focused on streaming video but they re now shifting elsewhere he said more gaming sometimes blockchain nft experiential exhibits etc the streaming wars are dead long live streaming with streaming transforming into something new consumers are in for a shock to the system streaming trained millions of viewers around the world to expect a lot of ad free content for an inexpensive price but that expectation was unsustainable according to nathanson wall street just paid people for subscribers and because it paid people for subscribers companies did not care about the economics he said they were willing to do whatever they could to chase subscribers in other words the grow at any cost strategy could never last and now we re at a point where companies and wall street are looking at balances sheets and focusing on profitability and revenue as much as scale and the truth is that even though the streaming wars are ending and consumers are paying the price there s really no place else for any of them to go streaming is here to stay it s the focus of hollywood and how millions watch tv shows and films that s not changing even if the dynamics and strategies of the businesses behind them are video remains the most popular leisure activity in the world ball said streaming may change but consumers will adapt they love video too much the cnn wire 2022 cable news network inc a warnermedia company
