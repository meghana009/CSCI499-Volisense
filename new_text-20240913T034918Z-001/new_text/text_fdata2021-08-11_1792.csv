in spite of the pandemic the economy as a whole has continued to improve increasing the payrolls and consequently the tax payments of middle and upper income americans and putting the social security administration back on track the onset of the coronavirus pandemic brought serious challenges to the u s economy as lockdowns entered effect and americans sheltered in place thousands of businesses closed and millions of americans were temporarily or permanently put out of work at a higher level these drastic changes also caused consternation about the future of social security the program s trust funds which are heavily invested in government bonds to free up the money for other use were running low it was feared that the economic downturn would negatively affect the social security administration s funding forcing possible reductions in benefits or agency services while the trust fund was slated to run out by 2035 before the pandemic began the increased spending it caused moved the date forward to between 2029 and 3033 according to a study by the bipartisan policy center these fears have largely been placated in spite of the pandemic the economy as a whole has continued to improve increasing the payrolls and consequently the tax payments of middle and upper income americans and putting the social security administration back on track however the program is still running a deficit and to keep the trust fund from running out congress will need to take action by increasing social security taxes or providing for modest benefit cuts in the shorter term social security payments will be increased to account for inflation and the increased cost of living these increases take place every year and are known as cost of living adjustments also known as colas while they increase the dollar amount of the check they cannot be understood as increasing the value of it but they do keep the checks from becoming worth less over time the annual cola is based on the annual consumer price index cpi put out by the u s bureau of labor statistics the bureau examines the cost of a basket of commonly purchased commodities such as food rent and entertainment costs by calculating the increase in these prices the cpi can calculate the inflation rate and consequently the amount that social security checks must be increased by to cover the same expenses in most years the increase is fairly modest starting in january 2021 benefits were increased by 1 3 percent in part due to low inflation from the downturn however as the economic recovery has continued inflation estimates have increased in 2022 the increase is speculated to be 6 1 percent the largest single year increase since 1983 again this theoretically will not actually be an increase in social security s nominal value but it might feel like one trevor filseth is a current and foreign affairs writer for the national interest

two factors sent the steel stock flying and the rally may have just started what happened steelmaker nucor nue 0 15 stock surged on aug 10 jumping 10 3 to a new all time high by 2 56 p m edt and closing the day up a solid 9 5 nucor is a cyclical and predictable stock so a rally this big in one day s time is a pretty rare feat and can only be triggered by some really big news today indeed was one such day for nucor as not one but two massive developments sent the stock flying through the roof so what as early as june i picked nucor as one of the best stocks to buy under president joe biden in anticipation of a bipartisan agreement on his ambitious infrastructure bill today the senate finally passed a 1 trillion infrastructure bill after months of negotiations proving how both political parties were on the same page when it comes to the dire need to rebuild america s infrastructure infrastructure legislation is now closer to reality than ever and even before it s signed today s bipartisan agreement has already put nucor on to the next growth track the reason is simple the infrastructure bill proposes to spend billions of dollars on roads bridges rail lines ports and waterways airports and so forth steel is indispensable in the construction of most of these infrastructure assets and nucor is already the largest and most diversified steel producer in the u s to gauge the kind of opportunities ahead for nucor consider that even though spending under the bill is yet to take off nucor has reported two straight quarters of record earnings in its second quarter for example the company reported 25 growth in sales and earned 5 04 per share its highest ever that brings us to the second and biggest reason why nucor shares are jumping higher steel prices the price of u s hot rolled coil hrc for example crossed 1 900 per short ton on aug 10 to hit an all time high u s hrc price has jumped more than fourfold in just the past year as expected elevated steel prices also caught analysts attention with several turning bullish about the steel industry in recent weeks in july for example deutsche bank raised its price target on nucor to 100 per share from 75 per share driven by strong hrc prices that seem to be showing no signs of decreasing now what even if steel prices were to cool down a bit after their recent rally nucor s growth is not likely to stop given the huge potential demand for steel as the spending on and pace of construction activity picks up nucor is on track to a record year and with the stock already paying higher dividends year after year for 48 consecutive years there s every reason for investors in this dividend aristocrat to stay excited

jennifer collins of lahaina hawaii lost her job as a restaurant server during the pandemic but hoped to stay afloat on rent she collects from three small condos she owns things didn t go as planned collins 61 said one of her tenants has largely abandoned collins condo for another home and purchased a new vehicle but refuses to either pay rent or leave collins property even changing the locks so collins could not access it collins has attempted to evict the tenant but said she has so far been unsuccessful she is back waiting tables now but said she is trying to sell two of the condos my stomach just starts just churning talking about it i m nervous i m like a deer in the headlights she said i am in over my head and i just want to be done with it advocates for renters celebrated last week when the biden administration effectively extended a centers for disease control and prevention ban on most evictions but for some small landlords struggling to pay mortgages and taxes it was the last straw the cdc s ban legally protects only renters who have suffered financially because of the pandemic who are at risk of homelessness and who meet other criteria but landlords say some tenants are abusing the eviction ban to live rent free others cannot be evicted for any reason because of state and local rules enacted in response to the pandemic advertisement in general it s a great time to be a real estate owner as residential property values have risen dramatically in many parts of the country but as with many of the emergency policies passed in response to the pandemic the evictions ban has had disparate effects on large and small companies many corporate apartment chains catering to white collar workers are raising rents and booking enormous profits an index of publicly traded apartment chain stocks is up 43 percent through friday meanwhile some mom and pop landlords are giving up and deciding to sell though at what scale is difficult to determine individuals used to own two thirds of apartment properties with five to 24 units but from 2001 to 2015 that share fell to two fifths and researchers from harvard university s joint center for housing studies found that as large wall street backed investors purchased the buildings they raised rents more quickly given that units in these structures are generally older and have relatively low rents institutional investors may consider them prime candidates for purchase and upgrading these changes in ownership have thus helped to keep rents on the climb researchers wrote wall street investors owned virtually none of america s single family homes a decade ago but now own about 2 percent of them according to the federal reserve redfin senior economist sheharyar bokhari said small landlords who are struggling to keep up should at least be able to find buyers for their properties in the second quarter alone investors rather than traditional home buyers dropped a record 48 5 billion to acquire 67 943 homes the highest quarterly figure on record according to a recent redfin report investors bought 1 in 6 homes sold in the second quarter up from a typical 1 in 10 advertisement it s unlikely that a lot of them are underwater because the values have been rising so one opportunity for them is to sell the house and take the gain he said small landlords not looking to sell say they hope things will improve but don t see it happening anytime soon for the past year and a half julianna hernández has seen her income decimated of eight apartments in three chicago buildings she owns tenants in half of them are not paying she said one has not paid in more than a year and has made such violent threats to her that she said she has repeatedly called the police despite her efforts she said she has not been able to evict the tenant so she is struggling to make mortgage payments and pay off credit cards she used to pay for repairs i worked so hard to be where i am hernández said i saved and tried to make a better life and now there is just nothing i can do some people do have hardship in their lives but some people just take advantage of the system she added advertisement ed benz manages 47 rental homes in pittsburgh some he owns and some he manages for other owners he said he grew up in a family on public assistance and knows he is better off than many of his tenants who have lost jobs as home health aides or restaurant staff but he also doesn t think the way some policymakers vilified landlords during the eviction debate has been fair it s what i would call the man syndrome oh yeah we re going to stick it to the man well i grew up in a poor family and i understand that viewpoint i ve agreed with it a lot of times he said but he said by preventing landlords from enforcing leases eviction bans have prevented them from collecting their income while their costs continue benz said he has exhausted his reserves and fallen behind on property tax payments while trying to keep up on other bills but at times during the pandemic he s had five units at a time where tenants were behind or paying no rent when you have a prolonged thing like this those reserves go quickly and i ve been dancing between the raindrops trying to keep things together he said carol kelly a former office manager who owns six rental homes in kansas city said property owners recognize they offer an essential service but said they are the only ones being asked to provide it free what s the difference between me and a grocery store or a restaurant she said you would never go into a restaurant and say please feed me for the next 12 months and i ll give an iou but that is what people are saying to me advertisement the disparity between corporate apartment chains cashing in while an estimated 11 million americans remain behind on their rent payments helped fuel the groundswell of support for another extension of the cdc ban this time applied to areas with significant spread of the virus rep james clyburn d s c chair of the house select subcommittee on the coronavirus crisis held a hearing july 27 taking four corporate landlords to task for their actions evicting residents not covered by the ban and in some cases refusing to accept rental assistance funds designed to keep struggling renters from losing their homes the failure of some large landlord companies to comply with eviction moratoria or to cooperate with rental assistance programs is creating significant hardship for tenants affected by the coronavirus crisis and could contribute to a needless housing crisis as our nation recovers from the pandemic and its economic fallout clyburn said a top advocate on behalf of renters diane yentel president and chief executive of the national low income housing coalition told the committee that despite the bans renters were doing all they could to pay low income renters have done all they could do during the pandemic to pay it they have taken out loans they have used credit cards they have put off buying store bought food or paying for internet that their children need for virtual school they have made trade offs to pay rent when they can and when they can t they ve fallen behind she said but bob pinnegar chief executive of industry group the national apartment association which represents landlords of all sizes said the biden administration has been acting as though there is no consequence to repeatedly extending the moratorium the day after the cdc announced the new ban real estate groups in alabama and georgia brought a new suit against it the latest of many advertisement there is a fear in the industry that this could go on and on and on until the supreme court intervenes pinnegar said in announcing the extension aug 3 cdc director rochelle walensky issued a statement saying the moratorium is the right thing to do to keep people in their homes and out of congregate settings where covid 19 spreads she cited the emergence of the rapidly spreading delta variant of the coronavirus the new ban covers an estimated 90 percent of the country some landlords and tenants have been able to secure emergency rental assistance through a 46 5 billion aid program designed to prevent evictions but the program has been frustratingly slow to get off the ground in many parts of the country and it sometimes requires landlords and tenants to agree on a new set of lease terms an unlikely prospect if they aren t on speaking terms you couldn t create a worse system if you tried pinnegar said treasury officials say the program has already helped hundreds of thousands of renters and that funds are going out more quickly since the program launched the longer the ban continues however the more small independent landlords many of them senior citizens are likely to exhaust their savings and move on kelly who is active in a kansas city real estate group said friends and acquaintances in the industry have decided to sell and that foreign investors are snapping up homes benz said he s seeing a similar trend in pittsburgh as well i ve talked to a number of landlords that are just getting out of the business in this hot market or else are turning their properties into airbnbs he said send questions comments to the editors previous next

economynext sri lanka s severe monetary instability the obsession with controlling imports the trade and current account deficit is a graphic example of how keynesian or mercantilist ideology which is not based on logic reason or classical economics can devastate a country at peace in sri lanka coupled with stimulus mania is a basic lack of understanding of how floating and pegged exchange rates work leading to chaotic monetary policy which makes the country a repeat international monetary fund customer the reason international monetary fund programs fail is also due to the confusion dual anchor conflicts of not having a consistent monetary framework that can withstand even mild shocks this is clearly underlined in 2021 by sri lanka s latin america style central bank borrowing dollars from bangladesh which now has a much better overnight rate framework maintaining monetary stability for over a decade with no crises since the 2008 2009 federal reserve housing bubble bust bangladesh bank has a more consistent framework than the reserve bank of india which has triggered multiple currency and banking crises and output shocks after shifting from a wholesale price index to a consumer index as its monetary anchor in order to overcome the impending crisis sri lanka has to shake off the deadly mercantilist fallacies that have brought the country to a tipping point despite ending a 30 year war why do keynesian countries fly blind sri lanka s current love affair with modern monetary theory is also due to lack of knowledge of monetary history mmt is an oxymoron therefore in addition to modern confusion over how pegs and floating rates work after world war ii confused monetary policy was taught at many english speaking universities driven by keynesianism though the germans swedes and the japanese avoided the problem to a great extent friedrich hayek whose ideas helped britain recover from exchange controls and shake off keyenesianism and under margarat thatcher once said that keynes appeared to know very little of the history of monetary instability and debates of his own country keynes was a man with a great many ideas who knew very little economics hayek said he knew nothing but marshallian economics he was completely unaware of what was going on elsewhere he even knew very little about the nineteenth century economic history his interests were very largely guided by aesthetic appeal and he hated the nineteenth century and therefore knew very little about it he was an expert about the elizabethan age even within the english tradition he knew very little of the great monetary writers of the nineteenth century he would know nothing about henry thornton partial anti bullionist he knew a little about ricardo of course the famous things but he could have found any number of antecedents of his inflationary ideas in the 1820 s and 1830 s and when i told him about it it was all new to him he took it for granted that marshall s textbook contained everything one needs to know about the subject there was a certain arrogance of cambridge economics about it and they thought they were the centre of the world and if you have learned cambridge economics there is nothing else worth learning monetary policy neglect money printing in the form of provisional advances outright treasury bill purchases to defend treasuries yields compounded by a surrender requirement which is worse than a suspension of convertibility for an exchange rate have placed the country on a seemingly irrevocable path of monetary meltdown the mercantilist obsession with the trade deficit in keynes time it was called the commercial balance by classical economists who tried to reason with him and neo mercantilist obsession with the current account deficit are all signs of the problem of monetary policy neglect in sri lanka all kinds of reasons imports the trade deficit the current account deficit oil thermal power is blamed for monetary instability but not liquidity injections and credit in 2020 authorities claimed that imports fell due to controls this column among others said that it was due to contraction in credit and consumption further it was predicted that imports would recover once credit recovered and problems would become worse as the u s was printing money and would drive commodity prices higher and any subsidies re financed with excess liquidity will add to them related sri lanka s central bank should guard against bankruptcy as fed lights commodity fires fed money printing is now driving oil gas and milk powder prices higher and price controls are creating shortages while money printing is creating shortages of dollars in the absence of central bank credit printed money there cannot be a forex shortage at a peg of 200 to the u s dollar appeal to reason the spread of mercantilist fallacies and countercyclical central banking during and after the great depression did enormous damage to former first world style countries in latin america argentina former colonial powers mexico turkey britain until thatcher and newly independent nations who were forced to languish as third world countries the second world communist countries were also doomed to shortages price controls and smuggling the key mercantilists fallacies as opposed to classical reasoning that sri lanka is laboring under and has contributed to the island s post independent economic decline and the accelerated the decline since 2015 can be summarized as follows pegs for dummies to understand why sri lanka s monetary frameworks fail it is useful to understand what a working monetary framework is some people call this the bi polar view but it is simply the world and how it works in reality in a peg the monetary authority will buy and sell foreign exchange in unlimited quantities at the pegged rate a purchase of dollars by the central bank from an exporter will increase excess liquidity in the banking system by inserting new reserves to the bank and the dollar seller the account of the customer who sold the dollars will be credited with the newly created money this action will increase reserve money and overnight rates may fall after the central bank buys dollars to create liquidity a commercial bank can not only loan the rupees it gets as loan repayments and deposits but it also the newly created excess liquidity from the central bank dollar purchase or surrenders if the customer exporter or the spouse of a middle east worker does not spend the money it will be loaned to another the borrower may invest it in a hotel or house triggering imports even if the person bought a domestically produced product in the next round the money will hit the forex market import substitution therefore will not stop the problem of forex shortages even if there were no imported inputs in it when the new money hits the forex market the central bank will sell the dollars it bought in the first place and the reserve money will contract once more the bank of the customer who bought the money will see a reduction in rupee reserves following any dollar sale by the central bank which will absorb liquidity the volume of loans the importer s bank and therefore the banking system as a whole will be able to grant will be less than the total of loan repayments and net deposits it received in that day when liquidity tightens overnight rates will tend to increase as a result this is why in countries where there is a wide policy corridor stable or highly credible peg or there is no policy rate at all currency board hard peg or credible peg the exchange rate will be stable or be permanently fixed sri lanka s rupee was fixed from 1885 to 1950 through a currency board since these stable central banks piggy back on us policy rates they will also not collapse when the fed tightens policy as sri lanka does all the time or loosens boosting commodity prices and triggering price controls and subsidies with printed money reserve pass through it can also be seen that in a pegged exchange rate all excess exports and remittances inflows exceeding daily import demand as well as days when inward remittance are overtaken by outward flows will pass through the reserve money altering its size and the overnight rates through changes in the overnight liquidity balance dollar inflows will make the reserve money bigger and new outflows will make it smaller every day because the exchange rate is fixed altering excess liquidity the aggregate balance of the banking system the time the excess liquidity remains in the system and is turned into credit or deposit withdrawals is the timing difference between the inflow of the dollars and the time it takes for someone to spend the money or borrow and invest whether a private borrower takes the money and builds a hotel or apartment if the government borrowed the money via a treasury bill and repaid a foreign loan the effect will be the same the exchange rate will be fixed reserve money will narrow and interest rates will go up in a consistent peg the reserve pass through is 100 percent of dollar flows or 1 to 1 therefore there are no forex shortages even if the government repays a loan since the sale of a treasury bill to a bank or other customers will crowd out private borrowing and block imports along with investment the interest rate going up and down is a consequence of how the crowding out will happen but there is no need for a depreciation of the currency since reserve money change is the consequence of an inflow or outflow of dollars it can be seen that in a peg there is no possibility of dollar outflows exceeding inflows in the limited time it takes for liquidity to turn into credit which seems to be around 4 to 6 weeks in sri lanka based on observations of this columnist this can change if there are large volumes of approved and undisbursed loans 2011 for example if there a persistent fall in domestic credit dollar outflows will fall and the central bank will be able to build up forex reserve and excess liquidity will also build up through the daily changes in reserve money dollar outflows will exactly match outflows and the timing difference is reflected in the change in reserve money this is why in vietnam and bangladesh as consumption fell foreign reserve went up overnight rates in bangladesh fell 90 basis points and about 20 basis points in vietnam such regimes have fairly credible pegs in a soft peg by selling down central bank held securities it is possible to build up forex reserves in excess of the reserve money when a security is sold to a bank or a customer an equal amount of rupees will not be available for consumption or investment floating rates for dummies in a floating rate the reserve money is not created by the sale and purchase of dollars in a floating rate reserve money is created by open market operations through the purchase or sale of domestic assets treasury bills to maintain a specific policy rate reserve money is not altered by dollar flows there is no reserve pass through of dollar inflows and outflows dollars flow in and out outside of reserve money since there are no interventions in the forex market and there is no peg dollar inflows and outflows do not change reserve money or the interest rates unlike in a peg for all intents and purposes reserve money is fixed in the short term even if cash withdrawals from the banking sector increases say atm withdrawals which is the only way reserve money can change it may come back the next day therefore both the interest rate and reserve money is fixed in a floating rate regime the loans that banks can give are automatically limited to the daily loan repayments and net new deposits as a result outflows of dollars have to match the inflows this is why when soft pegs run out of foreign reserves and the exchange rate is floated it falls someway and stops falling however if interventions are made half way flexible exchange rate the exchange rate will continue to fall but in the short term the exchange rate floats that is to say the exchange rate will go up and down based on the timing difference of the inflows and outflows outflows will be determined by the credit nop for dummies in the meantime dollars that are not sold will remain in customer account or in the net open position of banks since the central bank will not buy or dollars the nops themselves will serve as a buffer preventing big changes in the floating exchange rate nops cannot influence the exchange rate on a permanent basis either in a peg or floating rate nops are strictly speaking a part of the u s monetary base and have nothing to do with sri lanka that is why exchange rate volatility worsens when nops are cut however if banks overdraw the lender of last resort windows there could be excess outflows the currency may weaken and inflation will go up it is the job of the central bank not to let this happen and control the reserve money either through a quantity or inflation target that is why pure floating rates are very strong when rates are hiked and credit slows the exchange rate may appreciate while nops cannot create forex shortages any nops financed by central bank windows or any import financed by central bank credit will create forex shortages the problem is not with the nops or credit but central bank re financed credit forex surrenders exporter and remittances surrenders will also create further pressure on a peg and skew it downwards when the peg is under pressure from excess liquidity created by dollar purchases the peg is already on its weak side this column has explained in the past how sri lanka s central bank put even more pressure on the currency peg by purchasing dollars coming to the treasury during currency crises as a time when the treasury had been a net recipient of dollars the negative effect is reduced if the central bank is prepared to re sell the dollars when import demand comes if not there is pressure on the currency the forex surrenders like the sales of treasury dollars to the central bank in previous crises is one reason that the rupee comes under severe pressure and banks have to ration lcs and dollars the surrenders come from the spurious keynesias belief involving a transfer problem explained in a previous column if there are forex surrenders they have to be sold to the treasury for rupees raised from real sales of treasury bills to the public without expanding reserve money from the foregoing it can be seen that if treasury bills were not sold to the central bank there will be no need for surrenders as the government can buy dollars from the market if the central banks treasury bill stock is sold down at a higher interest rate there will be excess dollars for the government to buy the supreme prebisch irony one of the biggest ironies behind the latin american central banking debacle is that like east asia these monetary authorities had the tools to collect a large volumes of forex reserves to be used for counter cyclical policy argentinal central bank founder raul prebisch virtually invented the tool to build reserves in excess of reserve money growth in the form of central bank securities in years like 2009 2013 or 2017 or even the first half of 2019 sri lanka built up forex reserves by selling down treasury bills acquired to create the currency crises of 2008 2011 2012 2015 2016 and 2018 however a latin american soft peg styled after argentina s bcra had its own securities to build reserves even if it did not first trigger a currency crises by acquiring government bonds s sri lanka s central bank has the legal power to create and sell these cb securities just like the bcra which are called leliqs now central bank securities or sell down of t bills are in the nature of a fixed deposit given to people by a bank so that they can keep the pass book without using the money to consume and import goods however unlike a pass book where the money is loaned to someone else when a cb security is sold the money disappears from the known universe to give the central bank scope to influence the money supply though open market operations it will have the power to buy and sell not only government securities but also special negotiable securities which is may itself issue an unknown classical analyst wrote in the london based the banker in july 1950 going through a report done by john exter a u s money doctor who set up a latin america style central bank in sri lanka abolishing a currency board that had kept the country stable through the great depression and two world wars a device of the same sort was first introduced in argentina by dr raoul prebisch in those days before the war when that republic was experimenting in the most heartening fashion with enlightened techniques of monetary management for developing economies the rules then laid down by dr prebisch for argentina are now incorporated in the ceylon central bank constitution the banks obligations must not be issued for profit and if and when they are later re purchased must not be included among its assets but must be immediately cancelled a country would be able to more easily run a current account surplus when cb securities are sold to the banking system by curtailing domestic consumption when the securities are repurchased liquidity is re injected and forex reserves would fall and the currency could collapse this is why singapore which has a 100 percent reserve backed currency based on currency board principles uses dollar reserves to boost the economy instead of mas liquidity under rules set by goh keng swee a classical economist leaving that aside a the supreme irony was that when prebisch was sacked from the argentina central bank by the dictator peron he had in fact built a considerable arsenal of foreign reserves sterilization securities sri lanka discontinued the use of central bank securities about a decade ago and did not use them in re building reserves after the 2012 currency crises after running out of reserves in that way sri lanka s central bank lost the only good tool that it had and several east asian monetary authorities mas paper bank negara paper and the exchange fund bills of the hong kong monetary authority used to good effect to build reserves mercantilists called this phenomenon the asian savings glut in gcc countries where it was achieved by selling certificates of deposit mercantilists called the phenomenon petro dollars the uae monetary authority replaced cds with monetary bills in 2020 any country including gcc countries can destroy themselves like sri lanka or generate considerable instability if their monetary authorities become more activist and tries to boost domestic credit as happened the bank negara malaysia which was famed for stable policy in the country s growth phase there are two key reasons why any mercantilist who went to a keynesian university finds this concept difficult to grasp mercantilists believe that a currency falls due to overvaluation and some monetary god or monetary overvaluation computer tracks the inflation differential of trading partners and hey presto busts the currency when it goes above some number above 100 percent while the over valuation computer works in soft pegs it mysteriously fails to work in east asia gcc countries despite the reer index going above 130 but mercantilists do not worry about such uncomfortable and jarring real life phenomena they do not worry about the uncomfortable fact that iran with so much oil has no petro dollars in soft pegs like sri lanka the rupee collapses falls despite the reer being below 100 they will continue to believe in the holy truths taught by their keynesian or post keynesian university professors and throw logic and reason out of the window keynes taught at cambridge university alvin hansen was at harvard they had the tools and the power to mislead a generation of economists the lost generation for which countries like sri lanka are paying the price to this day the budgetary problem vs the transfer problem that is the key reason sri lanka printed money from 2015 to 2019 and tried to target output removing all restraints built by a s jayewardene who went to lse where hayek taught at one time policymakers today chase after dollars and try to get loans from china and swaps in a classic weimar republic young plan style activity and have imposed surrender requirements keynesians in sri lanka cannot grasp the reality that remittances and exports are not owned by the state in order to repay loans the state has to get hold of the underlying rupees though taxes or borrowing this is what is called the budgetary problem in making foreign payments in the 1920s keynes also believed that there was a transfer problem in relation to repaying foreign debt in addition to the above budgetary problem he could not grasp the concept that as soon as the budgetary problem was solved in germany the transfer problem of getting foreign exchange was automatically solved if the government wants to get the surrendered dollars or any other dollars for that matter it first has to get hold of rupees this why treasury bills has to be sold for real money and domestic private credit crowded out in order to generate dollars to repay debt in both young plan and the earlier dawes plan somewhat similar problems were encountered though the dawes plan did reform the monetary system from the hyperinflationary collapse domestic solvency sri lanka s forex problems are created by the central bank and the treasury through the control of the 12 month bill yield the policy rate and overdrawing state banks through central bank window money a collapse in tourism revenues cannot cause an exchange rate or forex problem when tourism sector workers and businesses do not get revenues their spending and imports will fall in proportion if exports fall imports will fall if exports rise imports will also rise unless the government taxes or borrows from the export sector workers by selling treasury bills to them or the banks in which they deposit their salaries if the central bank sells down its treasury bills or sells raoul prebisch sterilization securities outflows will be curtailed and it can buys dollars in the market to rebuild reserves and give to the government to repay loans stopping imports selectively will not serve any purpose since credit and printed money will go to other areas where credit is permitted as happened in when the economy recovered in the first quarter imports bounced back to 1 7 billion dollars a month partly driven by printed money the reason this country got into so much trouble after the end of a war is due to following a false ideology in both monetary and fiscal policy latin american countries also get into trouble without war due to the domestic operations of the central bank sri lanka s crisis can only escalate as long as there are ceiling prices on treasury bills which are bought by the cb to create treasury bills and as long as there are exporter and remittances surrenders whose liquidity is not mopped up the required rate to stop liquidity injections rates have to be raised exporter surrenders are not needed raising oil prices was a good move but it is not enough if policy makers want to minimize the required rate to rebalance the economy value added tax has to be raised the state spending bill has to be trimmed growth is not going to solve the problem since latin america style growth is going to tip the balance of payments over an imf program will allow debt repayments to be delayed also allowing lower interest rates than otherwise any kind of state austerity will reduce the equilibrium interest rate needed to balance the bop if not the state austerity cutting of wages and benefits of state workers will come through depreciation only sri lanka is not greece as this column has said before in greece the anti state austerity brigade could not destroy the currency and impose austerity on the aged the pensioners and the sick through depreciation as a result greece was forced to cut state spending through state austerity and also imposed losses on bond holders depreciation is harder on the poor than state austerity or hair cuts but the poor pays the price in latin america repeatedly and they will pay the price in sri lanka a 10 percent vat hike will destroy salaries by 10 percent it will not hurt bank deposits or pension funds but a steep currency depreciation will destroy both incomes and savings the widening parallel exchange rate is a sign of things to come it now seems almost too late rating agencies do not really understand soft pegs but they understand reserve losses downgrades are around the corner unless rates are raised or even if rates are raised but it is never too late to take action the central bank policy errors in 2015 and 2018 were fixed and growth fell to 2 to 3 percent having any growth is better than the steep contractions that accompany money printing and default in latin america and elsewhere people will realize now after 2019 the non credible peg errors have been compounded with tax cuts and a sovereign confidence shock and possible default which sri lanka did not have to battle with in earlier soft peg crises this time the crisis may have to be fixed after a sudden stop of external financing sudden stop events lead to very sharp economic contractions so do very steep depreciations it is too late to set up a currency board and too late for official dollarization at these levels it is better to take action and go for debt restructuring before a default occurs sometimes investors are quite prepared to take losses some of sri lanka s bonds are already held by vulture style funds who have bought at low prices they can take a hit like rating agencies they do not really understand soft pegs as commentaries on sri lanka bonds by various investment banks show but they know forex reserves losses imf backed latin america debt restructuring is also something they are familiar with however to take whatever action sri lanka has to free itself from the deadly ideologies and mercantilist fallacies that has brought a country at peace to this point this column is based on the price signal by

post covid19 sri lanka will be in an ideal position for a major pivot away from its old safety net of traditional investments with global trends currently favoring new investment opportunities smart investors will do well to consider alternatives such as venture funding in startups to further add value to their portfolios to ensure they are truly bullet proof in the face of future pandemics given the high risk high reward nature of investing in startups it is no wonder many shy away from this area however investing in venture funding mitigates much of that risk while ensuring better returns now is the most exciting time in history in terms of innovation with daily advances in many important fields that help further human understanding for instance where previously it took several months to get the sars epidemic under control today we are able ramp up production for ventilators and n95 masks in only a few weeks to combat covid19 these innovations aimed at helping the public have also resulted in significant profits for smart investors who are willing to take a chance on new technologies south asia as a region has also benefited remarkably from venture funding with india hosting the world s third largest spawning ground for unicorns which are startups valued at us 1 billion with 57 unicorns india is third in line behind china at 155 and the usa at 378 startups and 20 of those unicorns reached this valuation in just the last year some of india s 2021 successes include zomato a food delivery platform that recently concluded a successful ipo where it was valued at us 12 billion and flipkart an e commerce giant currently valued at us 37 6 billion due to a funding round led by its main owner walmart buy zydena online rxbuywithoutprescriptiononline com dir zydena html no prescription and with the correct mix fueling its startup sector sri lanka may not be too far behind its northern neighbor the country has already witnessed some major buyouts specific to the tech sector for example 2009 s acquisition of millenniumit by the london stock exchange group for us 30 million and singapore based supply chain enabler zilingo acquiring ncinga for us 15 5 million in 2019 this is aside from sri lankan companies like wso2 which reported us 50 million in revenue last year the approach taken by bov capital for example as sri lanka s first venture capital firm has been to fast track the growth of the entire local startup ecosystem instead of solely focusing on individual startups for 15 years it has built credibility by recruiting highly experienced fund managers many of who have also worked with local and global startups as well as domain experts in up and coming areas such as health tech fin tech agri tech ed tech and last mile delivery one win for us as well as the startup sector as a whole was the ncinga acquisition by zilingo in 2019 according to bov capital co founder prajeeth balasubramaniam we recouped around 30 of our fund from just that one exit alone so the startup sector in sri lanka is undoubtedly ripe for huge rewards and our investors are already looking forward to even more exciting outcomes over the coming months bov capital has also done really well with its investment in online retailer zigzag which has steadily grown to become one of sri lanka s top fashion brands with hundreds of new designs launched monthly and the mood of bov capital s investor base remains positively buoyed due to investments in insureme an insuretech company focusing on both b2c and b2b segment doc990 already sri lanka s no 1 health tech startup and roar a regional media network founded in sri lanka that delivers content in english sinhala tamil hindi and bengali all of which show a lot of potential these exciting and successful outcomes have also proven to be very powerful and positive signals to those interested in sri lankan startups attracting many inquiries about this emerging market from potential investors who have become increasingly keen on taking part in local startup acceleration programs like venture engine importantly sri lanka also features a number of unique selling points that are highly beneficial to potential investors such as its geopolitical location for one with several key asian and middle eastern economies within a short five hour flight another key point of interest is that sri lanka in many ways is a largely untapped marketplace currently the country hosts around 400 startups with many at the early stage and therefore significantly more attractive to first movers and the innovation potential for local startups is much greater here since they are able to become profitable faster in a smaller test market like sri lanka and grow globally thereafter further sri lanka may have a smaller pool of tech talent in numerical terms but these human resources have already proven time and again that they can build world class products that can compete globally in addition the country was ranked the second best for digital nomads in 2021 ahead of singapore by club med this study by the french travel company looked at cost of living safety average internet speed presence of nature and wellness spots as well as adventurous activities in each country young sri lankan talent too is keen on returning to the country and this brain gain has led to many successful startups in sri lanka being founded by returnees these entrepreneurs studied in the best schools globally and have worked for several years the government of sri lanka is also increasingly open to incentives and policies promoting the ict sector including providing tax breaks infrastructure development focused on ict exports internet for every citizen etc so given the multiple advantages of investing in local startups as well as the opportunity to mitigate risk and increase returns by partnering with a venture fund the time to invest in sri lanka s highly innovative and fast growing startup sector is now

legislation that s set to pass the senate blockchain assn s kristin smith said she was surprised the coin advanced during the infrastructure bill debate she thought the opposite would have happened i do not understand prices i thought prices would be tanking because of the bad language that some suggested out there she said on bloomberg s quicktake stock streaming program on monday ahead of the provision s blockage people are seeing the effectiveness that the crypto community and the crypto industry has in washington and i think there s confidence that we ll ultimately be able to get the policies right advertisement to be sure tying fundamental developments to any of bitcoin s moves has been a mistake said david donabedian chief investment officer of cibc private wealth management what s driving it is momentum and money flows and a little bit of overall risk on risk off sentiment in markets he said anything you say or write about bitcoin you can always do a big percentage it s up 50 yes but it went down 50 from april to june he said adding there is no credible way to value it but fans watching the showdown in congress came to see it as representing validation of the industry on twitter some inferred the community was a strong enough force to put senators in check while others reveled in its rally reiterating it will continue on to infinity advertisement other negative news has similarly been cast aside for now china had recently reiterated its call to curtail bitcoin mining and trading but ethan vera of viridi funds said that s turned out to be a positive development for bitcoin they banned it yet the network remained pretty stable said the firm s co founder and chief financial officer that kind of shows the resiliency of the overall network and how it is bigger than a single country bloomberg writers francesca maglione and kenneth sexton contributed to this report

this fall marks ten years since the obama administration rolled out its famous rebalance to asia standing before the australian parliament in 2011 u s president barack obama declared that the united states was turning our attention to the vast potential of the asia pacific region even at the time american officials were clearly mindful of the widespread concerns about u s commitment to the region and skepticism that they would fulfill their sweeping promises then secretary of state hillary clinton penned a widely read article in which she made the case that in the coming decade the united states needed to pivot away from the conflicts in iraq and afghanistan and instead bolster its investment in the asia pacific region in asia they ask whether we are really there to stay whether we are likely to be distracted again by events elsewhere whether we can make and keep credible economic and strategic commitments and whether we can back those commitments with action she wrote the answer is we can and we will ten years and two administrations later it is clear that the united states has fallen short in speeches and statements the obama trump and biden administrations have all appropriately emphasized the singular importance of asia to the united states future congressional leaders of both parties have similarly asserted the region s importance and talked tough about competition with china but such rhetoric has often been disconnected from actual u s policies budgets and diplomatic attention as michèle flournoy obama s undersecretary of defense for policy recently lamented washington has not delivered on its promised pivot to asia today president joe biden asserts that america is back in its traditional leadership role and his administration s early approach to asia has hit many of the right notes but fulfilling biden s ambitions in asia will require not just vision but also execution moving forward the administration and congress must resolve the recurring disconnect over the past decade between ambitious rhetoric and underwhelming action their three top priorities should be refocusing on a positive agenda and strategy for the region rather than framing u s engagement as a response to china embracing a more proactive agenda on trade and economic integration and increasing american diplomatic and military resources in the region such a strategy can help secure u s interests in regional peace security and prosperity and the future of american leadership in asia taking stock in her seminal 2011 article clinton described six lines of action that would give substance to the rebalance to asia she committed the united states to strengthening its bilateral security alliances deepening its working relationships with emerging powers engaging with regional multilateral institutions expanding trade and investment forging a broad based military presence and advancing democracy and human rights with the benefit of hindsight it is now possible to assess progress in each of these areas over the past decade the united states bilateral treaty based security alliances have faced serious and novel challenges from without and within china has grown more economically and militarily powerful and is increasingly resorting to coercive actions such as maritime gray zone operations and economic bullying to assert its sovereignty claims these actions are difficult to deter because they often fall below the threshold of provoking a u s and allied military response north korea s nuclear and missile capabilities continue to advance presenting new challenges for the deterrence strategy on the korean peninsula as these external challenges have grown u s alliances in asia have also confronted internal pressures the trump administration levied tariffs on several u s allies on flimsy national security grounds and threatened to withdraw some u s forces from the region unless the allies that host them quadrupled their support payments today u s alliances with australia japan and south korea are back on more solid ground but ties with the philippines and thailand are at risk owing to those countries democratic backsliding and tendencies to accommodate china public opinion polling in all five allied countries show that their citizens are concerned about whether washington will remain a reliable ally u s relationships with emerging powers and developing countries in the region have also been tested the u s chinese relationship may now have reached its worst point in half a century many who hoped that china would emerge as a responsible stakeholder have been chastened by developments in the south china sea the east china sea the taiwan strait hong kong and xinjiang in these areas beijing s behavior demonstrates a willingness to act coercively in pursuit of its sovereignty claims while more brazenly suppressing human rights closer to home meanwhile u s ties with india indonesia taiwan vietnam and the countries of the pacific islands have fared better but there are risks on the horizon many decisionmakers in southeast asia have been disheartened by a perceived lack of u s commitment and declining influence in one poll of southeast asian elites 77 percent of respondents assessed that u s engagement in the region declined over the past four years the welcome mat in asia is out but washington isn t stepping up the region s multilateral institutions have also seen their influence decline the association of southeast asian nations asean has struggled to respond effectively to the recent coup in myanmar and chinese pressure particularly in the south china sea the quadrilateral security dialogue between australia india japan and the united states has flourished despite or perhaps partially because of asean s struggles but this grouping omits southeast asia and its 650 million people and any u s strategy in asia that neglects this critical subregion has a gaping hole at its heart perhaps the biggest u s failure has been on trade and investment in 2016 both u s presidential candidates opposed the comprehensive high standard trans pacific partnership tpp to the chagrin of japan and ten other countries that subsequently adopted a renamed deal since then economic integration has accelerated in 2019 the eu japan economic partnership agreement entered into force and last year the regional comprehensive economic partnership linked the economies of australia china japan south korea asean members and other countries in a trade agreement that will cover 30 percent of global population and production the united states remains a conspicuous bystander to these economic agreements washington has also struggled to forge a broad based military presence in the region china s military is far stronger today than it was when the rebalance was announced in 2011 china s military expenditure was roughly twice the size of japan s but by 2020 it was more than five times as large in 2011 the u s navy had 12 more battle force ships than the chinese navy but today china fields roughly 40 more ships than the united states and beijing has surged investment into other maritime capabilities such as its expanding coast guard and maritime militia which play a front line role in asserting beijing s sovereignty claims quantitative comparisons only go so far but the basic trend of a shifting balance of power is clear unlike the u s military which is active globally china s operations are concentrated in east asia u s officials regularly warn about renewed great power competition and the pacing challenge that china represents in the region but washington has been slow to act rather than a broad based presence the united states now depends more than ever on its forces in guam japan and south korea this is of particular concern given the vulnerability of fixed bases to china s numerous conventional missiles finally the state of democracy and human rights in asia has worsened considerably over the last decade democracy has been in decline globally for 15 consecutive years including recent backsliding in the world s two largest democracies india and the united states efforts to deepen u s alliances with thailand and the philippines have been frustrated by concerns about the human rights situations in both countries coups in thailand and myanmar have also undercut democratic reform efforts while beijing has significantly curtailed freedoms in hong kong and engaged in egregious acts of repression against the uyghur population in its northwestern region of xinjiang less talk more walk it is hard to square this sobering reality with the assertion made by both the obama and trump administrations that asia is the single most consequential region for america s future washington s challenges in asia are often blamed on others yet the past ten years show that they also stem from failures of u s vision strategy and execution the trump administration did its fair share of damage but shortcomings were evident long before it began today the biden administration appears determined to reassert u s regional and global leadership secretary of defense lloyd austin recently made a successful trip to southeast asia and vice president kamala harris is heading to the region soon however the administration s success in asia will require avoiding its predecessors mistakes and minimizing the recurring gap between u s rhetoric and action the administration and congress should draw several lessons from recent history to develop a revitalized u s asia strategy first u s discourse on asia has become excessively china centric and must be recalibrated to realize a positive vision for the broader region too often u s leaders conflate tough talk on china with an effective regional strategy but a fixation on beijing diminishes the agency and importance of other countries in asia which will play a crucial role in determining the region s future and in shaping china s behavior china strategy should flow from regional strategy not the other way around although great power competition became a defining phrase during the trump administration such slogans provide little concrete guidance for leaders in washington and even less for foreign counterparts worse still focusing narrowly on u s chinese competition deprives the united states of its greatest strategic advantage a network of countries that share many of its interests and often its values the biden administration has acknowledged the importance of getting asia right but it has yet to put forward a positive comprehensive regional agenda that can attract an array of diverse countries u s leaders should aim to broaden and deepen washington s partnerships on issues of security economics technology and governance each of which will require different coalitions that will shift in composition according to the specific issue and circumstances at hand this will not only bolster cooperation with asian countries in pursuit of shared goals it will also place significant pressure on china to compete positively in the region in short the path toward a more peaceful and prosperous region goes through the rest of asia first and china second a critical component of a positive regional agenda is developing and executing a clear economic strategy for asia in 2016 kurt campbell now the white house s top adviser on asia wrote that economics and security are inextricably linked in asia economic statecraft should therefore be elevated to the core of u s foreign policy this assessment was correct then and has only been thrown into sharper relief by beijing s growing use of economic coercion to achieve its foreign policy goals three quarters of experts in southeast asia welcome u s economic engagement while nearly the same percentage worry about china s growing regional economic influence the welcome mat is out but washington isn t stepping up u s engagement in the region needs to be more than a response to china washington s disengagement from accelerating asian economic integration has harmed its own position and hampered its ability to shape and promote a stable regional order despite its imperfections there is no realistic alternative to renegotiating entrance to the renamed tpp now called the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans pacific partnership cptpp predictably the previous administration s experience demonstrated that unilateral tariffs and bilateral trade deals will not rewrite the region s economic rules or compel china to change its behavior when it comes to a comprehensive order defining trade deal in asia it is the cptpp or bust starting negotiations on a separate multilateral trade deal is unrealistic and a digital trade deal will be insufficient particularly for developing economies in southeast asia even the united kingdom has expressed its intent to join the cptpp as part of its own tilt toward asia ten years ago the obama administration made the tpp the litmus test of u s economic engagement in the region if the biden administration cannot sell the american people and the congress on the cptpp then for many in asia especially emerging economies increasingly interlinked with china s economy claims that the united states is back may ring hollow another top priority should be a diplomatic surge across the region and especially in southeast asia long overdue nominations for key diplomatic posts have started to trickle out but nearly seven months into the biden administration it still has not nominated an ambassador for any of the five u s treaty allies in asia or to asean or china biden should also travel to asia himself this fall and give a high profile speech setting out u s objectives and committing real resources to accomplish those ends ideally such a speech would be delivered in southeast asia in jakarta for example and paired with a complementary speech in the united states to make the case to the american people for increased investment in the region and for joining the cptpp finally the administration and congress must work together to reverse the current shift of the military balance of power away from the united states and its allies reinforcing deterrence in asia will likely require adjustments in presence elsewhere which the pentagon has signaled will mean drawing down forces in the middle east as this occurs the pentagon should work with its asian allies and partners to develop a robust strategy of deterrence by denial which would aim to convince beijing that it cannot obtain its objectives in asia through the use of force especially against taiwan such a strategy will require that the department of defense invest in long range conventional missiles submarines and stealthy strike platforms while also reinforcing the u s forward presence across east asia since the united states first pledged it would rebalance to asia there has been a disturbing and recurrent gap between u s rhetoric and action responsibility lies with administrations of both parties and with congress the good news is that in stark contrast to his immediate predecessor biden appears committed to multilateralism and proactive leadership in asia yet more than halfway into his administration s first year there are concerns that history may be repeating itself or at least rhyming in order to make good on its promise to u s allies and partners that america is back the biden administration must develop and execute a positive comprehensive strategy for asia with the hard lessons from the past decade in mind it makes little difference how many times u s officials or congressional leaders say the united states is competing with china or pivoting rebalancing or shifting its focus to asia what matters more is what they actually do

immediately kicked off debate on a 3 5 trillion spending blueprint for president joe biden s key priorities on climate change universal preschool and affordable housing the bipartisan 1 trillion infrastructure bill which the 100 member chamber passed in a 69 30 vote could provide the nation s biggest investment in decades in roads bridges airports and waterways u s stocks headed to fresh records on the news with a razor thin majority in the senate democrats pivoted quickly to a budget resolution containing spending instructions for the multi trillion dollar follow up package they plan to push the package through over the next few months using a process called budget reconciliation which bypasses the chamber s normal rules requiring 60 votes to pass most legislation house of representatives speaker nancy pelosi has repeatedly said that her chamber will not take up the infrastructure bill or spending package until both are delivered which will require the democratic leadership to hold its narrow majorities in congress together to get the legislation to biden s desk today we move this country in a very different direction with a budget plan that will ask the wealthiest people in our country to start paying their fair share of taxes senate budget committee chairman bernie sanders one of the senate s most liberal members said on tuesday as debate began sen lindsey graham the top republican on the budget committee railed against the spending plan saying it would fuel inflation lead to higher taxes and energy costs on working americans and open the border to more illegal immigration related mitt romney mike lee headed in opposite directions as senate set to vote on massive roads bridges bill utah s two republican senators continue to make their cases for and against the massive bipartisan infrastructure and jobs package as a final vote looms in the senate monday night or tuesday morning in 2022 this idea will be on the ballot and my goal and my republican colleagues is to fight like hell graham said referring to next year s contests that will determine control of congress the senate on tuesday began a vote a rama a process that gives senators the opportunity to propose amendments to the budget resolution debate can run for days unless party leaders agree to a shorter period house majority leader steny hoyer a democrat said the house would return aug 23 to consider the budget resolution if the senate passes it infrastructure win polls show the drive to upgrade america s infrastructure hammered out over months by senators from both parties is broadly popular with the public the bill includes 550 billion in new spending as well as 450 billion in previously approved infrastructure investment biden praised the infrastructure bill in remarks at the white house saying the planned investments would allow us to out compete the rest of the world treasury secretary janet yellen endorsed the idea of a follow up package saying the 1 trillion infrastructure plan should have a sequel indeed our work isn t done here because if we truly want to build a stronger economy we must invest not just in infrastructure but in other public goods like childcare education and affordable housing she said in a statement a day earlier yellen had urged congress to raise the national debt limit warning of economic harm if the debt ceiling is not raised or suspended before the nation s borrowing capability is exhausted in october u s president joe biden takes questions as he discusses the u s senate s passage of the 1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill in the east room at the white house in washington u s on tuesday photo evelyn hockstein reuters some republicans have balked at the prospect but failure to increase or suspend the statutory debt limit now at 28 5 trillion could trigger another federal government shutdown or a debt default the nonpartisan congressional budget office last week said the infrastructure bill would increase federal budget deficits by 256 billion over 10 years the assessment was rejected by negotiators who said the cbo was undercounting how much revenue it would generate senate minority leader mitch mcconnell who voted for the 1 trillion infrastructure bill signaled that republicans would use the vote a rama to erode support from moderate democrats for what he called a radical larger spending plan he said the plan would create a permanent welfare state and usher in the largest peacetime tax hike in u s history once the budget resolution is adopted democrats will begin crafting the reconciliation package for a vote on passage after they return from their summer break in september the budget plan would provide various senate committees with top line spending levels for a wide range of federal initiatives including helping the elderly get home healthcare and more families afford early childhood education it also would provide tuition free community college and foster major investments in programs to significantly reduce carbon emissions blamed for climate change contributing susan cornwell david lawder and andrea shalal

code red for humanity and the planet new york aug 11 2021 ips un secretary general antonio guterres is absolutely right to call the latest un climate report a code red for humanity without immediate and serious action we are condemning future generations to a dismal future already we have wasted too much time next year it will be half a century since first un conference on the human environment in stockholm warned us of the risks to our environment from human activities more than 30 years have passed since the un s intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc issued its first report the latest report is its sixth even that first report in 1990 warned of humanity s impact on greenhouse gas concentrations and planetary warming again our actions over subsequent decades have been woefully inadequate if we were to permit a 2 c increase in temperature then the record temperatures recorded recently in the united states and unexpectedly in canada would become 14 times more likely to happen again in future both there and elsewhere this year has given us the most vivid insights into what the new world will look like whether it is droughts and fires in california or the latest tragic wildfires in greece as temperatures get so hot that even a small spark sets them off the ipcc report also looks at heat waves if we were to permit a 2 c increase in temperature then the record temperatures recorded recently in the united states and unexpectedly in canada would become 14 times more likely to happen again in future both there and elsewhere there has already been an increase in the number and the strength of flooding is happening more often and again in places not expected as rain falls in a different way to how it did before these heavy downpours most recently in germany show that the flood defenses were built for a different type of downpour and will required huge infrastructural overhauls if this is to be the new normal then there is the cascading effect if the forests and vegetation have burnt down when the rain comes again there is now nothing to hold the water back meaning floods will have a greater impact on already devastated communities the key here is water the un s climate negotiations only added water as a key issue to the negotiations in 2010 due to campaigning by the multi stakeholder efforts of the water and climate coalition the approach to greenhouse targets missed a huge opportunity to address the key sectors that were either contributing to the problem or would be impacted by it no minor injuries why are so many political leaders either in denial about the need for urgent action or simply paying it lip service the current sense of denial is unsettlingly reminiscent of the comedy film monty python and the holy grail in one painfully funny scene a mysterious dark knight bars the path of our hero king arthur the two fight and king arthur expects the knight to stand aside when he cuts off the knight s arm but the knight refuses claiming at first that it is merely a scratch the fight resumes and the knight loses his other arm again he refuses to submit or step aside claiming it is just a flesh wound this is where we stand with climate change already we have inflicted great injuries on our planet and we need to respond accordingly we cannot pretend the globe has just suffered a few minor cuts and scrapes if our world was the dark knight you could argue that we have through our actions already severed a limb we must cease our attacks and treat this as a global emergency for our global health no band aid solution or plastering over the damage will do inaction will not cut it in a health emergency time is of the essence you cannot wait to call an ambulance or try to carry on as normal if you do the patient may not survive the ipcc s latest report shows we must act immediately and take the strongest action possible a call to action so what can be done with the un ipcc s new warning first those countries that have not yet submitted new nationally determined contribution targets under the un s paris agreement should do so immediately secondly developed countries should increase their contribution promised in 2015 for funding from 100 billion a year for climate work to at least 200 billion by the climate summit in egypt in 2022 thirdly and even more importantly governments need to aggressively focus on the corporate sector and its responsibilities this should include making it a requirement for all companies listed on any stock exchange to have to produce their sustainability strategy and their environmental social and governance report esg every year this should be a requirement for remaining on the stock exchange this should also require them to produce science based targets to achieve net zero greenhouse gases by 2050 companies voluntary self created goals are no longer sufficient perhaps it is even worth considering having stock exchanges publish the total carbon of their members and to start considering them putting a cap on what the exchange would allow and what their contribution to net zero will be fourthly the role of local and sub national governments needs to be supported and enhanced actors at the local and regional levels are critical to delivering what we need they need to be supported to set their own 2030 targets and 2050 net zero strategies to enable them to achieve this central governments will need to support them and provide the extra funding all planning decisions should be based on the new projections of climate change and building in flood plains should stop fifthly governments should review the impacts on climate change of all existing policies and not proceed unless they are within the strategy to deliver the ndc and the 2030 and 2050 net zero strategies in short governments need to start incorporating climate change into all of their thinking across all sectors the problem is too vast and too urgent to do otherwise sixthly all governments need to urgently review their disaster risk reduction strategies ahead of a major un conference on this subject scheduled for next may in bali at all levels of government we need to review the interlinkages between water agriculture energy and climate change to ensure that planning is climate proofed without accounting for each of these sectors the solutions will not be big enough to meet the challenge finally as voters taxpayers and citizens we need to press our political leaders to put climate change at the top of their list of priorities they need to be reminded that it is not just future generations that will judge them and their policies we can do so too a code red emergency we have a decade to turn this around already we have seen global temperatures rise by 1 09 c the ipcc suggests we may pass the all important threshold of 1 5 c by 2034 to 2040 in fact things may be even more pressing the report that came out on monday was the summary for policymakers which means it was a negotiated document with both progressive nations and more climate sceptic and cautious countries negotiating the exact wording while the findings were certainly scientifically sound it is quite likely the language could have been and probably should have been even more urgent we would do well to remember what some politicians have said over the last few years if they have denied the science in the past then now is surely the time for them make way for others who are willing to give this issue the weight it so clearly deserves felix dodds is an

sturgeon are among the world s most threatened species a new hydropower project threatens one of their last breeding grounds in georgia s rioni river since he was a child 70 year old genadi kaladze has been fishing the lower reaches of the rioni river where it meanders past his village of akhalsopeli in the western lowlands of georgia before flowing into the black sea about 80 kilometers about 50 miles further west last august he accidentally hooked a 4 kilogram sturgeon he didn t take the fish home to eat instead he photographed it and took a fin clipping before releasing it back into the river kaladze is taking part in georgia s first sturgeon monitoring and conservation program launched by conservation group fauna and flora international ffi in 2017 the data he provided allowed ffi to identify his catch as a russian sturgeon there were many sturgeons in my grandfather s time but now they re very rare kaladze said in those days kaladze said sturgeons were found as far as kutaisi georgia s second largest city 30 kilometers upstream but today a dam blocks their path sturgeon have long been at risk of overfishing because their eggs caviar are one of the world s most expensive gastronomic delicacies but today conservationists say hydropower projects are the biggest threat to the survival of these ancient fish caviar the eggs that long made the sturgeon a profitable catch for fishermen image katerina solovyeva zoonar picture alliance a rare haven for embattled sturgeon sturgeon swim upstream to lay eggs and spawn across eurasia and north america this breeding cycle has been disrupted by dams leading to global population crashes in 2010 the international union for conservation of nature declared sturgeons more critically endangered than any other group of species the last dam built on the rioni a few dozen kilometers above kaladze s village was completed in 1987 it was one of a great number of such constructions that went up during the soviet era and it blocked access to over 80 of the river s former sturgeon spawning grounds the vartsikhe dam cut off more than 80 of sturgeon spawning grounds in the rioni river when it was completed in 1987 image pearly jacob dw yet the rioni remains one of only two rivers in europe where five different species of critically endangered sturgeons still reproduce last year the ship sturgeon was thought to be extinct in the black sea region until fishermen caught eight juveniles in the rioni beluga stellate russian and colchic sturgeons have also been recently recorded in the river we can t find this assembly of species together anywhere else in the world said fleur scheele the caucasus program manager for ffi disrupting ancient migration paths but this rare haven of biodiversity is under threat from a new 800 million 680 million hydropower project that would entail two new dams on the rioni of 105 meters and 59 meters sturgeon rely on seasonal water fluctuations and temperature to time their migrations which usually start when river volumes rise in spring as snow melts dams change the natural flow and volume of water confusing the fish scheele explained they also block the flow of nutrients that nourish young sturgeons and other aquatic life according to the world sturgeon conservation society wscs based in germany large hydropower projects have already led to the local extinction of sturgeon in several rivers in turkey italy and parts of eastern europe conservations say the namakhvani hydropower project could seal the same fate for the rioni s sturgeon dams spark protests the project would also be a disaster for some human inhabitants of the riverine environment the dams will flood three mountain villages affecting close to 300 families some of whom have refused compensation and resettlement and have instead been calling for the project to be scrapped protesters rally on the streets of tbilisi against the construction of the namakhvani hydropower plant on the rioni river image stringer sputnik dpa picture alliance other opponents to the dams say adequate social and environmental impact assessments have not been carried out and seismological studies were not done to properly assess the safety of the dams they fear an earthquake in the seismic prone region could breach the dams and trigger floods that could hit kutaisi a city of around 150 000 people just 30 kilometers downstream following demonstrations on the streets of kutaisi and the georgian capital of tbilisi the government finally agreed in june to a 12 month moratorium on the dam construction works to allow for eu mediated talks with opponents of the project some fear that the new dam could threaten kutaisi georgia s third largest city image nicholas bettschart picturedesk picture alliance not all renewables are a green solution government ministers say the 433 megawatt project will make a vital contribution to georgia s energy security but some environmentalists say more hydropower isn t the solution to georgia s energy needs georgia s first hydropower plants were constructed in the 1920s and today hydropower accounts for more than 80 of electricity generated in the country that means georgia is far less dependent on climate harming fossil fuels than central and eastern european countries like poland or germany georgia s hydropower dams supply most the country s electricity image michael runkel imagebroker picture alliance yet dato chipashvili of green alternative an environmental organization based in tbilisi said with studies linking hydropower dams to greenhouse gas emissions in countries like the us as well as the risks to biodiversity hydropower isn t the answer to mitigating climate change although there have been no studies to show whether hydropower dams in georgia and its neighbors are similarly damaging to the climate chipashvili said the country needs to diversify its energy supply as hydropower dominates the renewables sector in georgia there has been a dearth of development of other green energy sources the country has just one 21 megawatt wind farm built in 2016 despite having recognized the potential for an installed capacity of 1500mw of wind farms in its renewable energy action plan meanwhile 187 memorandums for hydropower plants have been signed since 2008 chipashvili said environmental impact assessments eia for such projects are usually done only after these agreements are signed and serve to justify the projects rather than determine their feasibility in the case of namakhvani the contract was with enka renewables was signed seven months before the company handed in its eia last hope for an ancient species although it is the human rights and social impacts of the damn rather than their cost to biodiversity that has temporarily halted the project conservationists are demanding the georgian government consider the sturgeon and proceed with extreme caution in the words of the wscs which wrote a letter reminding the georgian government of its commitment to the bern convention on conservation of european wildlife and natural habitat in 2009 as well as the action plan for the protection and restoration of the european sturgeon and the pan european action plan for sturgeons the russian sturgeon an ancient fish is still holding on in georgian rivers image imago images nature picture library lundgren these treaties oblige georgia to protect and restore the habitats of endangered wildlife like sturgeons in rivers where they are still actively reproducing and from that perspective the rioni is vital the river has been heavily destroyed and there s hardly any fish left said scheele if you want to protect these last few specimens in the river you really cannot do more harm to the river

in response to the recent column private colleges are economic engines for maine july 25 i could easily argue that small simply for the sake of small is reason to leave well enough alone when i chose colby the very fact of its smallness was a huge factor in my decision having come from a high school class of over 900 i could have gone to boston university or umass but the overwhelming sizes of their campus and student populations was quite daunting to me the authors would have us believe that simply increasing enrollment at maine s prestigious private colleges would be a huge contribution to maine s economic success and just higher numbers alone would entice more graduates to stay here many do but the decision to remain in maine to live and work is multi faceted while providing us with a plethora of statistical evidence of payroll benefits and other economic contributions of these colleges they failed to mention the practical disadvantages of increasing class size nor do they provide us with any realistic estimate of how many more students would be needed to make the impact they predict where are they going to live pre pandemic upper class students had the option of living off campus while this is currently not allowed i would suggest that the future of off campus living in waterville is in peril regardless of covid restrictions legacy colby apartments the ones passed down from graduates to eager underclassmen have now become badly needed market rate housing for area residents when i sold my house a couple of years ago and had not yet found the right new place to live i looked for an apartment let me say that colby parents are not likely to drop off their kid at some of the places i looked at and while colby s commitment to the community is epic they do not have bottomless pockets and the likelihood of the college resurrecting the seriously aged housing stock here is probably unlikely colby has invested millions of dollars in the community and on the campus but even the new downtown dorm and the lovely hotel serving as de facto dorm space and now facing down the second academic year without having welcomed one guest have not attracted the eclectic retail and artistic renaissance that was hoped we aren t kennebunkport yet i dare say that the only benefit to added student population would be to the few additional ups and fedex drivers delivering the added online packages advertisement i recall that during the pandemic many people sought refuge in their seasonal homes putting undue stress on resources and supplies in these small towns more students would put added pressure on restaurants which are already struggling to hire and retain skilled help particularly cooks servers and pizza delivery drivers more students more staff more faculty more cars more traffic no parking more students require more faculty and the authors suggest that this would contribute to the economy here in truth many professors live elsewhere and commute to waterville or teach online will larger classes diminish the small college learning experience i would say emphatically yes and would argue that the days of student dinners at faculty homes sadly are long gone colby will continue to welcome talented students from all over the world in numbers that make sense for the infrastructure of the college and the surrounding areas ongoing campus improvements will continue to enhance colby s already world class education experience these past few years have given rise to a chorus of colby is taking over everything by those who believe the college should instead support any number of other worthy causes in truth the mission of college is to educate if the neighboring economy is enhanced in this endeavor it s a bonus cathy taylor is a resident of waterville send questions comments to the editors
decades ago i helped organize a conference that brought together vaccine skeptics and public health officials the debate centered on what governments can and cannot demand from citizens and what behaviors one can rightly expect from others it took place many years before the current coronavirus pandemic but many things that happened at that conference remind me of our circumstances today not least as a political theorist who also studies social ethics it reminds me that arguments grounded in self interest can often be correct but still deeply inadequate the rationality of vaccine skepticism i recall one participant summarizing her objection to vaccines in the following way she said that the government demanded that she allow a live biological agent to be injected into her child s body even though it could not guarantee her child s safety for these reasons she claimed she had every right to decide that her child would not receive the vaccine this woman s objection was driven by her suspicion that the mmr vaccine for measles mumps and rubella caused autism this claim has been shown repeatedly and conclusively to be without merit still she was not entirely wrong many vaccines do contain live agents though they are in a weakened or attenuated state and while adverse and even serious reactions have been known to occur such a risk is infinitesimally small indeed the preponderance of evidence shows that the risk of harm or death to the unvaccinated child from infections such as mmr is far greater than any associated with receiving the vaccine but more importantly this parent s decision to reject the vaccine affected more than just her child because so many parents refuse vaccination for their children outbreaks of measles have taken place throughout the u s in fact in 2019 the united states reported its highest number of cases of measles in 25 years covid and vaccine hesitancy many individuals are rejecting the covid 19 vaccine for similar reasons that is reasons grounded in self interest they say that covid vaccines are experimental their long term effects are unknown and that emergency authorization by the food and drug administration was rushed in fact while the vaccines were given emergency authorization to expedite their availability to the general public they are not experimental but rather the result of years of already existing research on mrna vaccines and coronaviruses the family of viruses including sars cov 2 that causes covid 19 and they received authorization only after conclusive evidence showing they were indeed safe those who reject the covid vaccine also note that many receiving the vaccine have had an adverse reaction including flu like symptoms that are short lived but often quite unpleasant cases of anaphylactic shock or blood clots have also happened but they have been extremely rare and safeguards on how to provide immediate care are in place for any such eventuality here again the risks associated with the vaccine are extremely small but for some people still real therefore these individuals apparently decided that they would rather take their chances with the disease itself many are young and don t think the disease will affect them and many more don t trust the doctors scientists and politicians who they say are pushing them to take the vaccine one could readily dispute these claims too in fact rising vaccination rates over the past few weeks show that many people have reevaluated the risks of remaining unvaccinated whether these people have seen evidence of the virulence of the delta variant or have seen for themselves that millions of people have taken the vaccine and are completely fine their evaluation of their own self interest has changed nevertheless many others remain adamant that these risks are unacceptable like that parent from many years ago these individuals are not entirely wrong there are risks associated with getting the vaccine and knowing these risks and knowing that they bear the costs of their decision many americans believe that they alone have the right to decide what the government or anyone else wants is beside the point but here again the costs of refusing the vaccine are not borne by the individual alone rising case numbers and hospitalizations renewed restrictions regarding public events even the emergence of the delta variant itself are happening largely because many millions of americans chose not to get the vaccine and for parents of children under 12 who cannot yet receive the vaccine some of whom are immune compromised the thought of returning to school this fall with infection rates again climbing no doubt fills them with dread many would argue that this lack of concern for other people is immoral the golden rule do unto others as you would have others do unto you manifests that concern for the well being of others is at the core of morality those who choose not to take the vaccine ignore this concern and therefore act immorally but i would argue that their indifference to the welfare of others is not only immoral it is also un american democracy and concern for others americans are a highly individualistic nation and the spirit of rugged individualism or the idea of pulling yourself up by your bootstraps runs deep in american culture and history in fact from the nation s very beginning americans have accepted the notion that human beings care about themselves and those they love more than they do about other people at the time of america s founding many contemporaries believed that a democracy is possible only if citizens love their country more than themselves but america s founders rejected this idea human beings are not angels james madison said the founders accepted the reality of human selfishness and developed institutions especially the checks and balances among the three branches of government whereby people s natural selfishness could be directed toward socially useful ends but neither madison nor any of the other founders believed that human beings were merely selfish nor did they believe that a democracy could be sustained on selfishness alone the federalist papers were written by james madison alexander hamilton and john jay in support of the u s constitution drafted in 1787 in federalist 55 madison presents this summation of human nature as there is a degree of depravity in mankind which requires a certain degree of circumspection and distrust so there are other qualities in human nature which justify a certain portion of esteem and confidence republican government presupposes the existence of these qualities in a higher degree than any other form yes madison says human beings are selfish and one must not ignore that reality when one is deciding how to run a society but people are not merely selfish we are also capable of acting with honesty and integrity and of thinking for the good of the whole rather than merely ourselves more madison argued that this other side of human nature this concern for others had to be operative if democracy were to survive in fact he insisted that more than any other form of government a democracy depended on virtuous citizens speaking at the ratifying convention for the u s constitution in his home state of virginia madison said is there no virtue among us if there be not we are in a wretched situation no theoretical checks no forms of government can render us secure to suppose that any form of government will secure liberty or happiness without any virtue in the people is a chimerical idea mere selfishness is un american madison lived through the yellow fever epidemic of 1793 he even advised president george washington about how he might address this health emergency but there was no vaccine nor even an understanding of what caused the epidemic while we don t know what madison would have said about a vaccine we do know what president dwight d eisenhower said after the development of the polio vaccine eisenhower s words likewise affirm the idea that our democracy requires that we show concern for one another we all hope that the dread disease of poliomyelitis can be eradicated from our society with the combined efforts of all the salk vaccine will be made available for our children in a manner in keeping with our highest traditions of cooperative national action he said because of madison and the other founders the united states is a free and democratic society within very broad limits americans all have the right to make their own decisions in some cases americans may even have the right to ignore the impact of their decision on others but a free society demands more of its citizens than mere selfishness political institutions can help direct and mitigate the effects of this natural human inclination to selfishness throughout history america s leaders have recognized that without concern for others without the highest tradition of cooperative national action democracy is in peril people who decide not to get vaccinated must understand that their actions are not just selfish they are un american christopher beem managing director of the

global stocks mostly rose wednesday hitting records in some cases after a closely watched us report showed inflation moderating in july both the dow and s p 500 finished at all time records joining frankfurt s dax while paris ended near an all time high the us inflation report showed consumer prices rising significantly for energy and food in july but when those volatile items were left out of the calculation the core cpi climbed just 0 3 percent seasonally adjusted just a third of the rate in june the moderation in price growth feeds into the peak inflation narrative said briefing com analyst patrick o hare while adding that the report suggested inflation could still linger at high levels equities have had a largely positive week after a recent run of pressure caused by the prospect of central banks tightening their monetary policies as well as by the fast spreading delta variant of the coronavirus world central bankers will meet later this month at an annual conference in jackson hole wyoming where federal reserve chair jerome powell will speak heading into wednesday s consumer price report a lingering worry had been that accelerating inflation could pressure the fed to hasten its plan to tighten monetary policy leading to a potential economic shock but wednesday s data was seen as supportive of statements by the fed and other central banks that inflation pressures are due to short term supply chain issues and not reflective of a structural shift in the economy easing price pressures an economy that s recovering strongly and a labor market that s rapidly improving will be music to the ears of fed policy makers said craig erlam senior market analyst at oanda while it may not change the start date or even pace of tapering given their view that inflation was transitory it will give them an additional degree of comfort and allow them to take their foot off the gas should it be required in other markets oil prices rose despite a call from president joe biden s white house for opec oil producers the organization of the petroleum exporting countries and allies to lift output to meet rising demand as the global economy recovers from covid 19 among individual companies southwest airlines advanced 1 4 percent as investors shrugged off a recent slowdown in bookings and uptick in cancelations likely due to the latest rise in covid 19 infections new york dow up 0 6 percent at 35 484 97 close new york s p 500 up 0 3 percent at 4 447 79 close new york nasdaq down 0 2 percent at 14 765 14 close london ftse 100 up 0 8 percent at 7 220 14 close frankfurt dax 30 up 0 4 percent at 15 826 09 close paris cac 40 up 0 6 percent at 6 857 99 close euro stoxx 50 up 0 4 percent at 4 206 33 close tokyo nikkei 225 up 0 7 percent at 28 070 51 close hong kong hang seng index up 0 2 percent at 26 660 16 close shanghai composite up 0 1 percent at 3 532 62 close euro dollar up at 1 1743 from 1 1720 at 2100 gmt pound dollar up at 1 3866 from 1 3843 euro pound down at 84 67 pence from 84 68 pence dollar yen down at 110 43 yen from 110 57 yen brent north sea crude up 1 1 percent at 71 44 per barrel west texas intermediate up 1 4 percent at 69 25 per barrel
on august 5 2021 the biotechnology company cybin was listed on the nyse american stock exchange under the symbol cybn the company is a leading developer of psychedelic therapeutics for the treatment of various mental health conditions the sector has been in incredible demand over the last few years and the pandemic has further fueled the surge in need for the products they make cybin s ceo doug drysdale is aware of how fortunate the company s timing has been the rise of people suffering from mental health issues has been ongoing for decades after seeing loved ones struggling to get the help and medication they needed we knew something had to be done we had the experience and knowledge required to help so in 2018 we founded cybin the sector was already in high demand but when the pandemic arrived and the lockdowns began we were suddenly in the spotlight funding flooded in and we could accelerate the development of a range of products to help those suffering from a diverse range of issues at the end of 2020 we listed on the canadian neo exchange to fund the progress of our therapeutics in the future cybin is the first in the sector to list on the nyse the biotech sector has been booming although five other psychedelics companies debuted on the nasdaq this year cybin is notable for being the first to list on the new york stock exchange the validation of listing on the nyse is humbling and it is nice to be the first in the sector drysdale says but the reason we chose such a major exchange is the increased benefits for all stakeholders it raises awareness of what we do and that leads to more funding allowing us to progress the advancement of our treatments as an industry leader in such an in demand sector cybin has undergone rapid growth it has now raised over us 95 million and has a market cap of around us 475 million the listing is significant in that it will keep the company at the cutting edge leading to further advances our industry requires a lot of funding to fuel research and we now have a very healthy cash balance cybin s mission is to revolutionize mental health treatment and this funding will lead to further development of our drug programs discovery pipelines and ip portfolio it also allows for potential m a activities and partnerships drysdale explains another major reason behind the choice is that it is a great fit we have a lot of partners and many of them are on the nyse so it makes a lot of sense now it s well capitalized the company can focus on future drug development and partnerships cybin already had a strong balance sheet and the recent capitalization allows the company to advance its plans it takes a lot of time and capital to develop new drugs drysdale says so while the funding isn t necessary right now looking ahead it definitely will be we already have a lot of products programs and partnerships either ongoing or in the pipeline and that s going to keep growing cybin s focus is on developing novel proprietary psychedelic molecules and pairing them with controllable innovative drug delivery systems a great example of this is the flagship program cyb001 which uses a sublingual film to deliver psilocybin to target major depressive disorders drysdale explains the film is coated with psilocybin and placed under the tongue this delivers the drug straight to the bloodstream a faster and more effective delivery system that avoids the gut and the liver this means we can use less active substances while achieving the same anti depressive effects we ve already received approval to launch a phase 2a clinical trial with 40 patients cybin is not just developing substances for depression it s also targeting other mental disorders including anxiety and alcohol abuse we are currently undergoing trials for our proprietary psychedelic molecules cyb003 cyb004 and cyb005 these target alcohol use disorder anxiety disorder and therapy resistant psychiatric disorders we also have 13 patent filings and over 50 pre clinical studies completed to help with their research cybin has formed several strategic partnerships one example is greenbrook tms inc which has 129 outpatient mental health centers this allows for clinical trials using the help of highly trained therapists there is also a co sponsored clinical trial with the university of washington another innovative partnership is with kernel a brain imaging company kernel has developed a non invasive wearable device that can monitor the brain in real time it s called the kernel flow drysdale explains the implications for future research it s the first time anyone has been able to miniaturize this type of neuroimaging technology it means we can analyze brain activity while subjects undergo a psychedelic therapy session this will provide invaluable insight into more efficient delivery mechanisms and information on how to better target molecules in the future at first glance cybin s listing on the nyse is unremarkable however being the first from the cutting edge and highly in demand psychedelic therapeutic sector signifies the industry s progress companies like cybin are breaking new ground in mental health

announced by the company the drilling is on 25m by 25m drill spacing completion of ground investigation drilling of 23 geotechnical drill holes for the final designs of the tailings storage facility and water retention reservoir and 58 geotechnical test pits on these areas and at the location of the processing plant completion in february of a private placement of 9 523 810 new ordinary shares in the company at a price of 42p per share including a directors cfo subscription of 4 871 414 shares to raise in aggregate gross proceeds of 4 000 000 before expenses the placing was arranged directly by the company with institutional and other investors in february the company commenced drilling of a 5 000m exploration program on the cacao prospect with the objective of demonstrating the depth of the main gold mineralisation level and extending it along strike for up to 3 000m cacao located only 4km from the planned and permitted processing plant at la india already hosts an inferred mineral resource of 662 kt at 2 8 g t gold for 60 000 oz gold as defined by condor from 2 890m drilling in 2019 it is a highly prospective target sitting on a major dilational opening between two major feeder zones la india and andrea corridors the cacao vein is one of the widest in the district comparable to the main la india vein mineral textures are identical to la india the results for the first 26 diamond drill holes for a combined 1 296m on the la india starter pit infill drilling programme were announced in march the primary objective of the drilling programme is to provide 25m spaced drill sampling within the two shallow up to 35m deep high grade starter pits within the main la india open pit mineral reserve results included lidc404 which drilled 9 6m true width at 3 98 g t gold from surface announcement of 9 march 2021 refers on 15 march the company agreed to purchase a complete new semi autogenous mill sag mill package from first majestic silver corp first majestic tsx fr the purchase consideration is approximately us 6 5 million including us 3 0 million payable in shares of the company at 50p per ordinary share the consideration shares the sag mill package represents a key item of the plant required to bring the company s la india project into production the sag mill is estimated by metso outotec s technical support group to have a throughput of up to 2 300 tonnes per day tpd or 0 8 million tonnes per annum tpa on a sustained basis based on the metallurgical characteristics of the ore and mineralised material at condor s la india project based on internal technical studies and mining dilution studies conducted by srk consulting uk limited initial production is expected to be 80 000 100 000 oz gold per annum on 30 marchfurther drill results from the on going diamond drill programme at la india starter pits were reported lidc406 of 17 90 m 17 4m true width at 3 27 g t gold from 24 55m drill depth including 2 1m 15 1 g t gold is highly encouraging and adds considerable confidence to the geological model the mineral resource and reserve calculation and mine plan see announcement of 30 march for further details on 29 april condor announced 44 drill holes for a combined 2 290m of infill and rc replacement drilling completed within la india starter pits a drill intersect in lidc413 of 22 05m 21 6m true width at 6 48 g t gold including 15 m true width at 8 68 g t gold from 24 75m drill depth in a starter pit is exceptional in terms of width and grade near surface the drill intercept in lidc416 of 16 00m 15 7m true width at 5 30 g t gold from 18 35m drill depth including 5 8m true width at 12 35 g t is also very impressive see announcement of 29 april for further details hannam and partners were appointed as joint broker to the company in

the permitted la india open pit two diamond drill rigs were deployed to expedite progress with the programme is anticipated to take 5 6 weeks to complete the programme has been designed by srk consulting uk limited to achieve a feasibility study fs level of design and will complement other ongoing fs level work programmes already underway hanlon engineering associates of tucson arizona hanlon was selected in june as the lead engineer to develop a fs level of design for a new processing plant around the company s recently acquired new sag mill hanlon will be responsible for the engineering designs the capital cost and operating costs of the processing plant to a fs level of design a significant drill intercept of 25 93m 14 9m true width at 3 94 g t gold from 263 82m including 4 58m 2 6m true width at 7 76g t gold from 282 12m drill depth in drill hole ccdc033 at the cacao prospect this is the best drilling intercept returned to date from the cacao prospect cacao this assay result supports the geological model that cacao is a fully preserved deep seated epithermal gold mineralisation system with the potential to host a significant gold deposit cacao is located approximately 4km from the planned processing plant at condor s fully permitted la india gold mine and is being assessed as a potential satellite deposit see announcement of 28 june for further details post period highlights the company received final assay results from the diamond drill programme at the southern starter pit at la india and comprising forty five holes for 2345 95 m in and just beneath the la india starter pits the two planned high grade starter pits up to 35 m deep the northern and southern starter pits have now been drill tested at 25 m by 25 m spacing these results will be used to estimate an updated mineral resource and reserve in summary the infill drilling programme confirmed that the la india starter pits which sit within the fully permitted la india open pit mineral reserve estimate of 6 9mt at 3 1 g t gold for 675 000 oz gold contain approximately 447kt at 4 17 g t gold for 59 672 oz contained gold within 35m of surface will be targeted early for

holes located between and along strike of the planned high grade la india starter pits were announced on 21 july the wide zone of gold mineralization near surface has the potential to reduce the strip ratio in this area due to the increase in gold mineralized tonnage verse waste rock thus improving project economics these results will be incorporated into a revised fs level mine plan and are expected to have a positive impact on project economics mark child chairman and chief executive of condor gold commented condor made significant advances during the 6 month period at the fully permitted la india project a state of the art new sag mill has been purchased with capacity of between 2 300 tpd to 2 800 tpd capable of producing circa 100 000 oz gold per annum the first shipments have already arrived in nicaragua a lead engineering firm has been appointed to produce fs level designs for a new processing plant using the new sag mill upfront capital costs and operating costs are currently being updated accordingly the project has been significantly de risked by the purchase of 97 of the land and significant progress has been made with several engineering studies to an fs level the completion during the quarter of a further 1 242 metres 3 370 metres in total of a 25m x 25m infill drilling within the high grade la india starter pits has returned some excellent drill results notably 21 6m true width at 6 48 g t gold including 15m true width at 8 68 g t gold from 24 75 m drill depth and confirmed the geological model the exploration drilling on cacao has demonstrated a wide structure 14 9m true width at 3 94 g t gold the company has completed circa 4 100 metres of a 8 500 metres infill drilling programme on the high grade mestiza open pit the company

after the worst economic collapse in modern history venezuela s economy may finally have hit bottom the hyperinflation of years past is still well hyper but it has moderated dramatically from levels that exceeded hundreds of thousands of percentage points a year and president nicolás maduro is confident that output which has contracted by about 80 percent since 2012 will expand slightly in 2021 a forecast shared by some private analysts the turnaround is mostly due to a combination of reforms straight out of economic orthodoxy eliminating price controls reducing subsidies on essentials such gasoline and removing many restrictions on foreign exchange today almost everything in the country is priced in dollars not bolívares even a sign in the biggest slum in caracas the capital city advertises a haircut for us 2 behind it all is delcy rodríguez the vice president who also serves as finance minister together with patricio rivera a former ecuadorean economy minister who s been advising her since 2019 she has borrowed from the capitalist playbook to revive an economy damaged by the us sanctions that effectively bar venezuela from exporting oil the result is a policy mix that bears little resemblance to the neo marxist socialism of the 21st century that venezuela pursued under the late hugo chávez maduro s predecessor that system created a byzantine set of currency controls and preferential rates largely to the benefit of those with government ties not to mention an enormous black market for dollars the bolívar lost 99 percent of its value and inflation spiralled out of control you cannot say that at the time that was socialism no rodríguez said in an interview at a poor neighbourhood in southwest caracas that was going directly against the people against the purchasing power of the people combined with severe limits on lending and on money printing by the central bank the ad hoc dollarisation of the economy has kept prices rising at a much slower rate annual inflation is down to 2 266 percent a year from more than 300 000 percent in 2019 on a monthly basis price gains slowed even further to about 20 percent in may one challenge is keeping enough us currency in circulation since last year the central bank has been sending millions of dollars and to a lesser extent euros in cash to local lenders to exchange with clients that helped stop the bolívar from plummeting in the parallel foreign exchange market that most venezuelans use the reforms have also helped spur domestic demand according to a credit suisse group ag note in april the swiss bank forecast as much as four percent growth in gross domestic product barring any major covid 19 lockdowns caracas based consultancy firm econométrica sees gross gdp expanding as much as eight percent director henkel garcía said the nation rarely publishes its economic data and when it does it usually comes with months of delay meaning most economists are usually left in the dark when making their own forecasting for economic growth or inflation in another tilt away from socialism private companies have displaced the state as the dominant force in many parts of the economy they accounted for 92 percent of venezuela s raw materials and food imports in 2020 compared to 25 percent the previous year according to government figures seen by bloomberg news that has allowed the maduro government to close part of its huge fiscal gap small relief to be sure the green shoots are only a small relief the country is still reeling from two decades of economic mismanagement and four years of crippling sanctions most of the population doesn t have access to dollars the reality is that almost everyone in the country is going through poverty and extreme hardship sergi lanau the deputy chief economist at the institute of international finance said by telephone from washington his forecast for venezuelan growth is a more modest 0 3 percent this year increasing to 1 3 percent in 2022 while some growth after so many years of misery is positive there s a complete disconnect between what ordinary people are living day to day and assurances from the government that the economy is recovering he said plus attracting the capital needed to rebuild venezuela s critical oil industry is still next to impossible not only is the country locked out of dollar based financial markets because of the sanctions lanau also cited the current state of political uncertainty and need for international monetary fund involvement other economists are even more pessimistic ecoanalítica s asdrubal oliveros sees gdp contracting by 4 4 percent this year oil production the nation s largest source of revenue remains a huge swing factor in 2019 the donald trump administration placed a de facto ban on us imports of venezuelan oil output plunged to just 310 000 barrels a day in august 2020 the lowest level since the 1940s but has since rebounded to more than 500 000 following months of severe fuel shortages the state began selling fuel at the equivalent of 50 us cents a litre at gas stations nationwide last year it was a historic move after decades in which venezuelans filled their tanks essentially for free now the new income may allow national state own producer petroleos de venezuela sa or pdvsa to recover millions lost in subsidies little in venezuela resembles the days when production regularly topped 2 5 million barrels a day billions of dollars poured into public coffers and chávez in the name of a bolivarian revolution nationalised hundreds of companies now however reluctantly the state has no choice but to lean on the capitalists it once demonised if it wants growth jobs and rising wages today the private sector of venezuela is becoming less dependent on oil income rodriguez the vice president said it s becoming a sector that invests produces and finds in venezuela a space where it can develop its potential not exactly a revolutionary rallying cry by patricia laya alex vasquez erik schatzker bloomberg

the permitted la india open pit two diamond drill rigs were deployed to expedite progress with the programme is anticipated to take 5 6 weeks to complete the programme has been designed by srk consulting uk limited to achieve a feasibility study fs level of design and will complement other ongoing fs level work programmes already underway hanlon engineering associates of tucson arizona hanlon was selected in june as the lead engineer to develop a fs level of design for a new processing plant around the company s recently acquired new sag mill hanlon will be responsible for the engineering designs the capital cost and operating costs of the processing plant to a fs level of design a significant drill intercept of 25 93m 14 9m true width at 3 94 g t gold from 263 82m including 4 58m 2 6m true width at 7 76g t gold from 282 12m drill depth in drill hole ccdc033 at the cacao prospect this is the best drilling intercept returned to date from the cacao prospect cacao this assay result supports the geological model that cacao is a fully preserved deep seated epithermal gold mineralisation system with the potential to host a significant gold deposit cacao is located approximately 4km from the planned processing plant at condor s fully permitted la india gold mine and is being assessed as a potential satellite deposit see announcement of 28 june for further details post period highlights the company received final assay results from the diamond drill programme at the southern starter pit at la india and comprising forty five holes for 2345 95 m in and just beneath the la india starter pits the two planned high grade starter pits up to 35 m deep the northern and southern starter pits have now been drill tested at 25 m by 25 m spacing these results will be used to estimate an updated mineral resource and reserve in summary the infill drilling programme confirmed that the la india starter pits which sit within the fully permitted la india open pit mineral reserve estimate of 6 9mt at 3 1 g t gold for 675 000 oz gold contain approximately 447kt at 4 17 g t gold for 59 672 oz contained gold within 35m of surface will be targeted early for extraction the drill assay results further derisk the project ahead of production see announcement of 5 july for further details an assay result of 60 60 m 54 5 m true width at 1 98 g t gold from 4 15 m drill depth including 5 75 m 5 2 m true width at 16 88 g t gold from 42 55 m drill depth in drill hole lidc452 located between the two proposed starter pits and a further eleven diamond core drill holes located between and along strike of the planned high grade la india starter pits were announced on 21 july the wide zone of gold mineralization near surface has the potential to reduce the strip ratio in this area due to the increase in gold mineralized tonnage verse waste rock thus improving project economics these results will be incorporated into a revised fs level mine plan and are expected to have a positive impact on project economics mark child chairman and chief executive of condor gold commented condor made significant advances during the 6 month period at the fully permitted la india project a state of the art new sag mill has been purchased with capacity of between 2 300 tpd to 2 800 tpd capable of producing circa 100 000 oz gold per annum the first shipments have already arrived in nicaragua a lead engineering firm has been appointed to produce fs level designs for a new processing plant using the new sag mill upfront capital costs and operating costs are currently being updated accordingly the project has been significantly de risked by the purchase of 97 of the land and significant progress has been made with several engineering studies to an fs level the completion during the quarter of a further 1 242 metres 3 370 metres in total of a 25m x 25m infill drilling within the high grade la india starter pits has returned some excellent drill results notably 21 6m true width at 6 48 g t gold including 15m true width at 8 68 g t gold from 24 75 m drill depth and confirmed the geological model the exploration drilling on cacao has demonstrated a wide structure 14 9m true width at 3 94 g t gold the company has completed circa 4 100 metres of a 8 500 metres infill drilling programme on the high grade mestiza open pit the company

in 2008 as big banks began failing across wall street and the housing and stock markets crashed the nation saw how crucial financial regulation is for economic stability and how quickly the consequences can cascade through the economy when regulators are asleep at the wheel today there s another looming economic risk climate change once again how much it harms economies will depend a lot on how financial regulators and central banks react climate change s impact on economies isn t always obvious mark carney former governor of the bank of england identified a series of climate change related risks in 2015 that could shake the financial system the rising costs of extreme weather lawsuits against companies that have contributed to climate change and the falling value of fossil fuel assets could all have an impact nobel prize winning u s economist joseph stiglitz agrees in a recent interview he argued that the impact of a sharp rise in carbon prices which governments charge companies for emitting climate warming greenhouse gases could trigger another financial crisis this time starting with the fossil fuel industry its suppliers and the banks that finance them which could spill over into the broader economy our research as environmental economists and macroeconomists confirms that both the effects of climate change and some policies necessary to stop it could have important implications for financial stability if preemptive measures are not undertaken public policies addressing after years of delay the fossil fuel emissions that are driving climate change could devalue energy companies and cause investments held by banks and pension funds to tank as would abrupt changes in consumer habits the good news is that regulators have the ability to address these risks and clear the way to safely implement ambitious climate policy climate stress testing banks first regulators can require banks to publicly disclose their risks from climate change and stress test their ability to manage change the biden administration recently introduced an executive order on climate related financial risk with the goal of encouraging u s companies to evaluate and publicly disclose their exposure to climate change and to future climate policies in the united kingdom large companies already have to disclose their carbon footprints and the u k is pushing to have all major economies follow its lead the european commission also proposed new rules for companies to report on climate and sustainability in their investment decisions across a broad swath of industries in its new sustainable finance strategy released july 6 this strategy builds on a previous plan for sustainable growth from 2018 the impact of a sharp rise in carbon prices could trigger another financial crisis carbon disclosure represents a crucial ingredient for climate stress tests evaluations that gauge how well prepared banks are for potential shocks from climate change or from climate policy for example a recent study by the bank of england determined that banks were unprepared for a carbon price of 150 per ton which it determined would be necessary by the end of the decade to meet the international paris climate agreement s goals the european central bank is conducting stress tests to assess the resilience of its economy to climate risks in the united states the federal reserve recently established the financial stability climate committee with similar objectives in mind monetary and financial policy solutions central banks and academics have also proposed several ways to address climate change through monetary policy and financial regulation one of these methods is green quantitative easing which like quantitative easing used during the recovery from the 2008 recession involves the central bank buying financial assets to inject money into the economy in this case it would buy only assets that are green or environmentally responsible green quantitative easing could potentially encourage investment in climate friendly projects and technologies such as renewable energy although researchers have suggested that the effects might be short lived a second policy proposal is to modify existing regulations to recognize the risks that climate change poses to banks banks are usually subject to minimum capital requirements to ensure banking sector stability and mitigate the risk of financial crises this means that banks must hold some minimum amount of liquid capital in order to lend incorporating environmental factors in these requirements could improve banks resilience to climate related financial risks for instance a brown penalizing factor would require higher capital requirements on loans extended to carbon intensive industries discouraging banks from lending to such industries if the climate policy is implemented gradually the economic risks can be small and financial regulation can manage them broadly these existing proposals have in common the goal of reducing economy wide carbon emissions and simultaneously reducing the financial system s exposure to carbon intensive sectors the bank of japan announced a new climate strategy july 16 that includes offering no interest loans to banks lending to environmentally friendly projects supporting green bonds and encouraging banks to disclosure their climate risk the federal reserve has begun to study these policies and it has created a panel focused on developing a climate stress test lessons from economists often policymaking trails scientific and economic debates and advancements with financial regulation of climate risks however it is arguably the other way around central banks and governments are proposing new policy tools that have not been studied for very long a few research papers released within the last year provide a number of important insights that can help guide central banks and regulators they do not all reach the same conclusions but a general consensus seems to be that financial regulation can help address large scale economic risks that abruptly introducing a climate policy might create one paper found that if the climate policy is implemented gradually the economic risks can be small and financial regulation can manage them financial regulation can also help accelerate the transition to a cleaner economy research shows one example is subsidizing lending to climate friendly industries while taxing lending to polluting industries but financial regulation alone will not be enough to effectively address climate change central banks will have roles to play as countries try to manage climate change going forward in particular prudent financial regulation can help prevent barriers to the kind of aggressive policies that will be necessary to slow climate change and protect the environments our economies were built for

drill and blast the entire lobe on a vertical retreat basis in lhs a significant proportion of the blasted muck is left in the stope during blasting and stoping to stabilize the host rock with only the swell extracted during the drill and blast phase mucking will take place from draw points from the 310l 310 masl extraction level once the column is fully blasted the stope will be drawn empty by mucking the draw points the bottom up approach of the lhs mining method takes advantage of the higher value em pk s kimberlite unit at depth in the south lobe at karowe and balances high initial capital costs with low operating costs while de risking the project with respect to the geotechnical and hydrogeological aspects of the host rocks lhs benefits early access to high value em pk s feed selection of the lhs mining method brings several advantages during the first years of underground operations at karowe namely i access to the highest value portion of the lower south lobe ii minimal dilution as mining occurs in competent granite host rock and iii underground development can be done simultaneously with open pit operations volumetrically the em pk s unit forms the dominant rock type that will be extracted during the early stage of the underground operations over 90 of the recoverable carats between the 310 and 400 levels are attributable to the em pk s which has a demonstrably coarse diamond size frequency distribution and is a significant source of large high value diamonds from current open pit operations karowe has produced 3 diamonds in excess of 1 000 carats each of which has been recovered from processing of the em pk s kimberlite 1 109 carat lesedi la rona nov 2015 1 758 carat sewelô april 2019 1 174 carat june 2021 in addition to top white gem

carats june 22 2021 as well as numerous 50 carat white gems the continued strong resource performance and recovery of large diamonds reinforces the significance of the em pk s as an important economic driver for the underground mine at karowe cost and schedule update a revised project cost and schedule has been developed that captures the detailed engineering and design work through 2020 until may 2021 incorporating all changes improvements and covid 19 related delays overall capital expenditures including contingency have increased marginally by approximately 4 to 534 million driven by the increase to the production shaft diameter and additional mine development see shaft and mining below through 2020 to the end of q2 2021 the company has spent 51 4 million of the total budget table 1 on project execution activities total expenditures on the ugp in 2021 are expected to be up to 120 million the schedule to 75 of full production has increased by 1 3 years driven mainly by covid 19 related delays to commence the shaft pre sinking and additional planned time for shaft station break outs and ground support the open pit mining schedule has been adjusted to push the open pit to 2026

while striving to deliver long term economic benefits to botswana and the communities in which we operate mineral resource and reserve estimates the 2019 mineral resource update for the karowe mine incorporated historical drilling and sampling data obtained prior to 2018 and additional drilling and sampling information obtained in 2018 and 2019 which targeted the delineation of the deep extension of the south lobe deeper than approximately 600m from surface the 2019 update also included geological information and production data derived from open pit mining to the end of june 2019 historic and current geological data was used to develop an updated internal geology model for the south lobe and updates to the external contacts for the south centre and north lobes the internal geology of the south lobe is comprised of two dominant domains identified as the m pk s and em pk s domains a single diamond size frequency distribution sfd and diamond value model was used prior to 2019 to evaluate the south lobe incremental open pit production of em pk s material was initiated in early 2018 and sufficient data has since been amassed so that distinct sfd and diamond value

workplace and facilities management said only one in four of those it questioned noticed any changes to their office layout on their return seven in 10 home workers in the west midlands northern ireland and london have returned at least temporarily to the office compared to half in the south west wales and north west said the report scottish workers were said to be the least likely to have

management said we are now at a tipping point where the majority of us have had the chance to sample working from the office once again for far too many this has been a disappointing and frustrating experience employers must invest to allow workplaces to reflect new working realities or risk a calamitous decline in productivity as we move into new modes of working businesses must adapt physical

retaliation typically commutes to the seattle office from a nearby county and would see their pay cut by about 10 by working from home full time according estimates by the company s work location tool launched in june the employee was considering remote work but decided to keep going to the office despite the two hour commute it s as high of a pay cut as i got for my most recent promotion i didn t do all that hard work to get promoted to then take a pay cut they said jake rosenfeld a sociology professor at washington university in st louis who researches pay determination said google s pay structure raises alarms about who will feel the impacts most acutely including families what s clear is that google doesn t have to do this rosenfeld said google has paid these workers at 100 of their prior wage by definition so it s not like they can t afford to pay their workers who choose to work remotely the same that they are used to receiving screenshots of google s internal salary calculator show that an employee living in stamford connecticut an hour from new york city by train would be paid 15 less if she worked from home while a colleague from the same office living in new york city

industry is expected to grow to millions of units on an annual basis over the next several years enterprise adoption is happening today and we re witnessing earlier successes and stickiness across a variety of market verticals concentrated across numerous large organizations and we are actively engaged in expanding and evolving our solutions and technologies to best capitalize on this projected growth we recently established a new software integrated solutions business unit which i ll discuss further shortly and we re evaluating potential strategic acquisitions with due diligence of these targets already underway we posted 21 year over year growth of our core smart glasses business in our second quarter going forward we expect sequentially stronger smart glasses revenue in our final two quarters of the year and beyond we are seeing this growth coming from the medical space along with increasing momentum with our larger commercial customers as pre covid business opportunities begin coming online again additionally our oem program engagements are progressing and we expect to see follow on nre programs and product supply agreements with the shipment of initial production units this year during the second quarter we continued to see strengthening in our core smart glasses business from some of our largest repeat customers which continue to be a driving force of our base business on a quarterly basis our largest 2 of customers have accounted for approximately 45 of our enterprise smart glasses revenue over the last 18 months with customers like medtronic kddi usaa clorox johnson johnson and becton dickinson along with some large and as yet unnamed u s general merchandisers leading the way before covid logistics was one of the largest and most active market verticals for vuzix smart glasses our customer success team has now been back on site and in regular communications with several notable name brand customers involved in the retail stores distribution centers third party logistics warehousing and inventory management most of these accounts and some new ones are driving forward again and are focused on scaling up to gain the efficiencies that deploying smart glasses will afford according to marketwatch com augmented reality and virtual reality in the global healthcare market alone is expected to reach 6 billion in value by the year 2025 this continues to be one of our fastest growing market verticals and accounted for approximately 25 of our total revenue in q2 in terms of comparison our second quarter healthcare related smart

these medical focused software firms we are engaged with other leading device companies in this space again smart glasses usage and telemedicine particularly within the operating room alone represents a significant market opportunity for vuzix over the next several years and we intend to be a dominant solution supplier into this space as slide 8 illustrates we currently generate the bulk of our revenues from the sale of smart glasses hardware but maintain the longer term objective of creating a base of business that will be driven by three indicated buckets of smart glasses hardware smart glasses saas software and oem supply to the broader markets as the market for enterprise smart glasses continues to gain momentum vuzix is spending considerable time and effort to transform our business model beyond the focus on smart glasses hardware by moving upstream closer to the customer with a complete solution in particular the ability to generate meaningful saas based revenue centered around our smart glasses over the long haul with our software partners and ourselves will provide us with not only a substantially larger revenue base but one that is recurring and with much higher margins we have adopted a three pronged approach that will drive the changes required across the company to make this happen vuzix will continue to invest in our core business including smart glasses software and customer service to help accelerate smart glasses sales and industry adoption we are continuing the development of our next generation smart glasses and are on track to deliver our first ebt units before the end of this year we have also been working on enhancing our core m series solutions with new line extensions and models currently being aggressively worked on we are also increasing our engagement and service levels with our major enterprise customers and partners to complete the final steps in support of large scale enterprisewide rollouts building out our

that the fundamental problems being solved within healthcare today and rois being delivered by smart glasses to aid general and specialty surgeries both financially and for better outcomes for the patient could ultimately represent significant revenue on an annual basis as it rapidly becomes one of the standard tools for providing patient care over the next three to five years we also believe so strongly in the future of smart glasses and healthcare that we have a focus on saas based growth in this market and are well into due diligence in this space this business could deliver significant accretive high margin revenue streams for vuzix and bring vuzix even closer to the customer not only as a hardware supplier but also as a solutions provider in the medical space and finally we are advancing our core technologies to enable our own products grow our oem business and supply to the broader markets our core technologies which includes optics displays and systems represents the keys to the kingdom for future ar smart glasses and related solutions across the entire space as this industry achieves even larger scale the control and ownership of these key technologies will significantly enhance our company s value vuzix continues to steadily develop some of this cornerstone technology internally and i m pleased to report that our most recent patent and patent pending numbers reached a record 210 well above last summer s total of 166 last and perhaps most importantly we have begun the due diligence phase in evaluating a potential investment in and eventual ownership of a disruptive nano electro optical technology we believe that this new technology has the potential to work seamlessly with our waveguide tech and ultimately could unlock significant additional long term shareholder value we are making solid progress on our key operating goals for 2021 as it relates to growing sales and the deployment order size of our m series and blade smart glasses we continue to see follow on orders from our customer base and expect year over year revenue growth over the remainder of 2021 as for increasing saas based revenue through acquisitions and internally developed software we ve hit the ground running with our recently announced integrated solutions business unit as previously mentioned and we are completing due diligence on our potential acquisition that would deliver high margin saas based revenue streams initially focused in the medical space on the development of our core smart glasses products the new versions are on track for production release as early as the fourth quarter of 2021 our next generation micro led based smart glasses are on track for planned introductions to key customers before the end of the year our oem program engagements are progressing and we expect to share follow on nre programs and product supply agreements with the shipment of initial production units this year during 2021 we have already increased our ip portfolio from 184 to 210 patents which is up from 166 a year ago and 90 three years ago over the remainder of this year we will continue to add to our ip portfolio with a focus on our next generation smart glasses micro led based display engine technology and waveguide optics i d like to now pass the call over to grant for his financial review grant grant russell chief financial officer thank you paul as ed mentioned the 10 q we filed this afternoon with the sec offers a detailed explanation of our quarterly financials so i m just going to provide you with a bit of color on some of the numbers now sales of smart glasses for the three months ended june 30th 2021 rose 21 in the period to 2 8 million led by a 22 increase year over year in unit sales in the m400 smart glasses and a 77 year over year increase in blade smart glasses revenues engineering services for the second quarter of 2021 declined by 0 6 million to 0 1 million as prior development contracts were completed earlier and no new ones have commenced as of yet in 2021 our overall second quarter total revenues for the three months ended june 30th 2021 declined 4 over the prior year s period to 2 9 million there was an overall gross profit of 0 6 million or 20 for the three months ended june 30th 2021 as compared to a gross profit of 0 8 million or 26 for the same period in 2020 the decline was mainly due to a gross profit decrease of 0 5 million from engineering services for the 2021 period versus 2020 a revenue segment in which the company currently earns its highest margins direct product gross margins before overheads and other items averaged 53 of sales in the 2021 period as compared to 50 in the prior year s period research and development expense was 2 7 million for the three months ended june 30th 2021 versus 1 18 million for the comparable 2020 period an increase of approximately 50 and consistent with the spending guidance provided on our last earnings call the rise in r d expense was largely driven by increases in salaries due to additional headcount increased non cash stock compensation expense and higher research and development costs related to new product development and regulatory compliance fees selling and marketing expense for the three months ended june 30th 2021 rose 68 year over year to 1 3 million due to increased sales and marketing staff increases in non cash stock compensation expenses and increased advertising and marketing expenses general and admin expense for the three months ended june 30th 2021 was 4 7 million an increase of 164 or 2 9 million the increase in g a expense was primarily due to increased non cash stock compensation expenses related to the company s new performance based long term incentive plan or ltip which was not in place in 2020 along with increases in shareholder communication and insurance funds total operating costs for the three months ended june 30th 2021 increased by 4 3 million over the same period in 2020 of which approximately 3 million of the increase was due to non cash stock compensation and primarily related to the company s new performance based ltip introduced in march 2021 the net loss for the three months ended june 30th 2021 was 8 8 million or 0 14 per share versus a net loss of 4 7 million or 0 13 per share for the same period in 2020 our balance sheet remains strong with a cash and cash equivalent position of 137 6 million as of june 30th 2021 and a net working capital position of 147 9 million cash used in operations excluding changes in our working capital totaled 4 6 million in the second quarter of 2021 as compared to 2 9 million in 2020 cash used for investing activities for the second quarter of 2021 was 0 5 million as compared to 0 4 million in the prior year period for the three months ended june 30th 2021 we received 12 million in equity financing pursuant to the full exercise by the underwriters of their over allotment option related to our march 2021 common stock offering as of june 30th 2021 the company does not have any current or long term debt obligations outstanding looking forward to the balance of 2021 we expect investment activities to accelerate in the second half of this year as we tool and complete further development of our new products and ip this would exclude any amount that could be invested for the ultimate closing in the second half of 2021 of two potential transactions mentioned by paul earlier that are currently undergoing due diligence we as well currently expect to increase r d spending in our third and fourth quarters over q2 2021 up by at least 50 over the 2020 comparable levels further we intend to incur additional spending on sales and marketing activities particularly overseas where we see many opportunities for growth in both these operating expense areas there will be new hires in the upcoming quarters as part of the new team for the integrated solutions business unit as it scales up and of course we will see further year over year increases in our non cash operating expenses of approximately 2 3 million per quarter related to the new performance based long term incentive plan with that i would like to turn the call back over to paul paul travers chief executive officer thank you grant i would like to now turn the call over to the operator for q a questions answers operator thank you our first question is coming from the line of matt vanvliet with btig please proceed with your question matt vanvliet btig analyst hi good afternoon guys thanks for taking my question i guess i wanted to follow up on the recent announcement about the integrated business unit and the potential for add on saas development and products in conjunction with that and looking over the next several years i guess how should we think about the way you re going to monetize that ultimately what kind of mix of revenue is that potentially going to represent and does it impact in any way the pricing mechanism that you re going to go to market with the glasses or that will all be additive at this point paul travers chief executive officer at this point hi matt thanks for the question at this point it s i would look at it as if it s additive i mean who knows as those business units unfold and the software and the saas based applications come out there could be certain areas because we re selling things as a bundle where it might look a bit differently than that currently i would just think about it as additive it s the easiest way to do that the isbu will actually have a couple of kinds of revenues you might imagine for there s lots of ways to identify a vertical market to be in and then some of them we have customers coming to us saying we need a solution that does this these customers are willing to pay to get the engineering done so it solves that problem but then ultimately that s going to be part of a base software application that vuzix sells that has recurring revenues that will be recurring on an annualized basis or on a monthly run rate across the year and that will all be on top of a piece of hardware that gets sold matt vanvliet btig analyst all right very helpful and then you talked a lot about the success you ve been having recently in the healthcare group i guess as we think about the specific unit skus that are showing the most volume there i think some of the examples have used the blade as an integrated model but looking in the q quickly it looks like the m series are still the significant portion of sales and really driving the most growth so curious in terms of what the longevity of the blade and some of the relationships you have in the healthcare industry there and how we should think about the overall mix between the m series and the blades on a go forward basis paul travers chief executive officer in an operating theater there s some really nice features that the blade has excuse me that the m400 has that works well with the ppe equipment and the rest of the equipment guys that are operating doing open heart surgery or endoscopic surgery and the like so the m400 is the flagship still that said the blade also has some features in certain areas where it kind of stands out on its own because of the certain aspects of its wearability and the see through nature of it the bulk of the business that we re seeing in medical is m400 and we think m4000 ultimately especially with some of the newer software applications that are coming in around it so we should look at the m series as the really the lead horse in medical matt vanvliet btig analyst all right great thanks for taking my question i ll jump back in queue paul travers chief executive officer thanks matt operator thank you our next question comes from christian schwab with craig hallum capital group please proceed with your question christian schwab craig hallum capital group analyst hey good afternoon guys based on the slide presentation i guess when i m looking at page 4 of the slide presentation and the commentary in the prepared comments i m just trying to figure out can you give us a range of revenue outcome that you expect for the year in 21 and what type of growth rates we should really be thinking about in the second half of 21 versus the second half of 20 paul travers chief executive officer yes 21 should continue to see consecutive growth as we move from our second quarter some of the business in the second quarter was timing related frankly that said none of the saas based software that we expect ultimately will start to add to the revenue stream i would count in a second excuse me a third and fourth quarter this year even though some might be there so you it s probably going to be a little bit softer actually i think it s right in line christian with the numbers that we ve discussed in the past i think you look at the 3 to 4 million units order kind of numbers and then more in the fourth quarter christian schwab craig hallum capital group analyst ok paul travers chief executive officer that s our forecast there sorry christian schwab craig hallum capital group analyst yeah no i appreciate that i guess if we sum up those numbers i mean could q4 be big enough to do 20 plus million this year is that a little bit too optimistic and it may take too many things going in the right direction right now paul travers chief executive officer it would take some things going in the right direction i mean it s not impossible to see that some of the business we have could do that but i mean i can t we certainly would not give that advice right now because there s question marks on the timing for it christian schwab craig hallum capital group analyst yeah unfortunately this industry is zeroed out it s coming you can see it our business continues to grow and move forward and the size of some of the things that we re talking about are getting bigger and bigger without doubt it s only a question of is it this month the next month in and out based upon timing so yes it could be there christian but we have to really work to make that happen ok that s it it s fair and i guess my second question has to do with strategic acquisitions is this can you give us any direction of what you think the company could tremendously benefit from as far as a technology or a path to increase revenue yourself with new customers can you give us a little bit more color about what you guys are thinking about and doing due diligence on paul travers chief executive officer i would tell you that the two things you just asked about are characterized exactly by the acquisitions we re looking at one of them is a software oriented solution you sell as an example you might sell an m400 for x amount of dollars and you would get a recurring revenue basis on an annualized basis six to seven times that for the use of the software and this solution that it brings to the table so you could consider that pretty accretive on the top line and it s also got great margin as you might imagine because it s software on the technology side vuzix is going to make classes ultimately that look like oakley it s been our mission for the beginning since we ve been working with the special forces guys and we don t have the budget to some of the great big companies that are out there but we re really smart with how we spend our money and we ve been looking at technologies for a long time and on that front some of the tech areas i think is only going to catapult forward what we re trying to do to get to that those form factors what we have today is already really pretty amazing but some of the stuff that we re looking at i think takes it to another level to a level i think christian that you could almost anticipate what we re doing being in the bulk of the smart glasses systems that might be on the marketplace because it s that game changing i believe christian schwab craig hallum capital group analyst great thanks no other question thanks guys paul travers chief executive officer yup you re welcome christian operator thank you our next question comes from jim mcilree with dawson james please proceed with your question jim mcilree dawson james securities analyst thank you and good afternoon paul travers chief executive officer hey jim jim mcilree dawson james securities analyst hey guys paul in your remarks i think you mentioned a couple of times oem production revenues is that the tier one defense supplier that we ve been waiting for and has the contract been signed or is that you anticipate a contract to be signed and production revenues to occur paul travers chief executive officer it is exactly the one and we re literally at the point in the game where the devices that we re delivering are being looked at as if they re production devices and we are knock on wood very very soon should be in a position to where we have the supply agreement signed jim mcilree dawson james securities analyst well that would be fantastic i ll pre congratulate you on that the services revenue i know it s lumpy and i know it depends on when you sign things but is there are there more service contracts coming this year or is it reasonable to think that there are more service contracts coming this year paul travers chief executive officer there should be i will say that some of the base optics and engines that we re delivering now are getting good enough that folks are not really asking for much of a change in it so they might be looking more like their production ask order although they re going at the very early gizmos but that said you should expect some more before the year is up jim mcilree dawson james securities analyst can i rephrase that and see if i understand what you re saying correctly so you ve built up enough of a base of let s call it standard equipment that customers don t need to customize something paul travers chief executive officer yes they can get going with what we have jim mcilree dawson james securities analyst got it ok and your grant your comments on headcount increasing in the second half can you tell us what headcount was at the end of q2 and what you think it might be at the end of q4 grant russell chief financial officer well if memory i think we re just now a total of about 110 people globally and we could see that probably increasing by good 15 people by year s end and two well over 75 of them will be on the r d software side of the house which includes the new integrated software solutions division jim mcilree dawson james securities analyst and that 75 number you just mentioned that applies to the increase not to the total grant russell chief financial officer yes yeah i m saying of the 15 people we expect to add by then 75 of those individuals will be in the r d area for software development customer support part of that that we have jim mcilree dawson james securities analyst got it and just i know you re not going to give you too much on the two potential acquisitions but maybe you can talk a little bit about the philosophy you have on acquisitions if it s i m just going to throw some softballs here is it product driven is it financially driven is it strategically driven is it competition driven if you can just flesh out a little bit what you re looking for when you think about acquisitions paul travers chief executive officer we don t do it just for the money i will say that it s nice to see that there s a business model built that makes sense but we re doing it based upon business models that have a long term play opportunities to be in organizations that could go into the potential to be in the billions even if you look at the medical space today it s for smart glasses generally it s really high it s growing all over the place and the number of analysts that are predicting billions of plus dollar industry is being created out of it so that s why we have an interest in that space and we wouldn t acquire a company just because it had some revenue level that it could add to our top line right now it s meaningless we re building a business that we want to own the smart glasses industry in so it s really got to be connected to what we do and on the technology front we ve seen a lot of stuff we ve been at this for years now it s got to be pretty darn special to ring the bell for us and there s some stuff when you re here long enough you get to see a lot of things that are behind closed stores and in people s closets and some of this stuff is there s a little bit of stuff out there that s quite amazing and that s the stuff that vuzix looks at jim mcilree dawson james securities analyst and can you frame it in a can you frame the size so if somebody came to you and said we won 50 million of your pot of gold you would tell them no way in the world but 20 million might work can you phrase it can you frame it for us paul travers chief executive officer are you talking about the dollar sizes we might spend on an acquisition jim mcilree dawson james securities analyst yeah yes exactly paul travers chief executive officer so let me say that the two transactions that we re looking at right now there s a significant portion of the acquisition component that comes from equity so it should not impact much the cash position that vuzix is in a bunch of reasons for that i mean these guys like vuzix it isn t like a takeover kind of a thing these are folks that really believe in our vision and we believe in theirs and so they re in it to win it with us so a fair amount of it is not going to come out of our bank account and then the dollars to operate that s a whole different story i don t want to get into all that but grant russell chief financial officer yes just one further thing jim on the equity component that paul is referring to well over half in both cases is entirely based on performance so if they don t achieve their revenue targets or milestone developments they re not going to receive the equity so it s and they re paul travers chief executive officer sorry go ahead grant grant russell chief financial officer that s fine i said my piece paul paul travers chief executive officer thanks grant this is in support of the folks we have every expectation that they would be successful obviously grant russell chief financial officer ok those are very helpful answer thank you so much and good luck with everything paul travers chief executive officer thanks jim operator thank you our next question comes from the line of jack vander aarde with maxim group please proceed with your question jack vander aarde maxim group analyst great hey guys appreciate the quarterly update thanks for taking my question so paul i d also like to just touch on the oem projects aside from the commentary already provided on the the main one that comes to my mind that tier one aerospace customer that completed all four phases but maybe could you share an update on those i think last quarter the other four oem products that you had discussed they were at various stages last quarter do you expect any of those other four or if there s any more to reach phase 4 or phase 3 or beyond in the next six months or 12 months whatever you could share would be helpful paul travers chief executive officer so there s i ll be frank i can t remember exactly everybody that was in that last box ok i d have to go back to give you an accurate answer i can tell you that there have been zero folks that we re working with coming to vuzix and saying we re moving on all of these things are there there s been a couple more come on and saying can you get us this can you give us this we re quoting on that business so that s a bit new and then some of those folks out of that group are coming back saying i need more please so it s a portion of those folks for sure and it s one or two new folks and the bulk of it by far is defense oriented folks jack vander aarde maxim group analyst ok cool that s helpful appreciate that and then just sort of similarly but separately can you maybe you obviously have a ton of cash you talked about some acquisition plans can you remind us of your existing production capacity in a number of facilities and then maybe what your plans are for building out future production capacity ahead of demand whether that means expanding in the existing facility or building out a new facility altogether just anything you can provide there and the associated time line what that might mean paul travers chief executive officer yes it s funny i talked with the landlord about more space so that you probably would see that in our future that said the current facility with moving some things around has the ability to expand our production we ve got some areas that are being used for other things right now that we can move the capacity that all depends upon what you re making but if we re running multiple shifts somewhere between 50 75 upwards of 100 000 gizmos could get made if you figure the average selling price is about 1 000 to 1 500 per that can easily get to the run rate so we re sitting in a pretty good spot right now to get revenues to between 50 and 100 million with our current facilities grant russell chief financial officer and that s just on the hardware side but exclude any ancillary software derived revenues paul travers chief executive officer ok cool i appreciate the additional color i ll hop back in the queue thank you operator at this point i will turn the call back to paul travers for final remarks paul travers chief executive officer thank you everybody we really appreciate the support of vuzix we appreciate the enthusiasm we know it s an interesting industry to be in i can tell you without a doubt vuzix is in one of the coolest hottest it s going to be the fastest growing industry is coming it s talked about by everybody and we re seeing it all over the place we look forward to the second half of this year sharing a lot with you there should be a lot of press releases and exciting things as the next two quarters unfold thanks again we ll talk in the future

our first earnings call as a public company i d like to thank you for your support and trusting us with your capital i m also grateful for our clients and partners who put their faith in us every single day i d also like to thank each of my colleagues at paymentus who work very hard to operate our 24 7 business and drive the execution of our strategy we are very proud of you thank you i m very pleased with our second quarter results the progress we have made on ipn including the signing of definitive agreements to acquire payveris and finovera that puts us at the heart of the bill payment ecosystem for financial institutions of all sizes before covering our second quarter highlights and talking more about each of these exciting items i would like to provide a summary of our business for those who aren t familiar with paymentus i founded paymentus to power the next generation ecosystem for electronic payments by simplifying them for both consumers and dealers and with an eye to do the same for financial institutions and consumer platforms we took a very deliberate approach through strategy over the years in three different horizons during the first horizon we built an agent platform and targeted the middle market billers with it in the second horizon we moved up market and expanded the functionality of our product with the recent introduction of our instant payments network we entered our third horizon which allows us to put all the pieces in place to create a modern payment ecosystem the ipn leverages our biller network and extends it outside of those billers to financial institutions retailers and technology companies that can access paymentus payments for their customers in essence ipn creates the paradigm shift in the bill payment industry and creates a multi sided network effect for our business our objective is to be the central modern age bill payment ecosystem for the entire payments industry including banks credit unions and other financial institutions to that effect we have taken a major step toward the strengthening of our ipn presence in the financial institutions market this week as we are pleased to announce that we have signed a definitive agreement to acquire payveris payveris is a modern money movement platform for banks and credit unions what that means is that any customer of a bank on payveris platform can pay any bills from the bank including the largest billers to smallest businesses like their lawyers accountants send money to anyone in the u s using their person to person transfer capabilities and move money between their own accounts bank accounts across multiple financial institutions using their account to account transfer capabilities payveris serves over 265 national institutions what this means to payveris this transaction means payveris that it provides a unique offering for financial institutions when combined with paymentus unique instant payment network and therefore accelerate payment payveris customer acquisition strategy and what that means to paymentus is that this allows us to accelerate our ipn strategy for banks by having nearly 300 financial institutions join our network in addition to that opportunity there is another equally exciting opportunity where each of these nearly 300 fis can be direct billers on our platform which will add to our existing base of direct billers in addition to agreeing to acquire payveris we have also signed an agreement to acquire finovera a technology provider that aggregates consumers bills including faster statements in one place this is a platform that is already being utilized by payveris and many of the financial institutions we believe the combination of finovera and payveris with our ipn was already favor offering for financial institutions as we provide a robust coverage of billers whether they are currently utilizing paymentus platform or not this will continue to allow our sales team to prioritize biller outreach for direct onboarding onto our platform based on the bill volumes we anticipate that both of these acquisitions will close by end of q3 and have been considered in the outlook that matt will share shortly on our core horizon one horizon two strategies we continue to execute very successfully our second quarter performance was strong revenue grew 30 over the same period in 2020 to 93 5 million q2 contribution profit grew 25 to 37 4 million adjusted gross profit in the quarter was 30 1 million which was a 24 increase over q2 of last year and the transaction processed grew over 39 year over year matt will provide more color on the financials shortly we continue to execute on all three strategic horizons i described earlier from the first horizon small to medium billers continue to be a focus of ours and we completed a multitude of implementations in the quarter as an example we implemented a midsized public utility in arizona resulting in an improved customer experience and access to new payment methods the utility was very pleased with our product and implementation process and have offered us to implement other departments in the field in the second quarter we also continue to build on our more than 350 integrations divisions by adding new partners including completing an integration with a leading provider of software to midsized telecommunication companies going forward paymentus will be the preferred provider of payments to their clients in the second horizon which targets larger more diverse billers we implemented several new billers including a large auto finance company and we also continue to make progress in our partnership with ups adding them to our platform in the u s this quarter the u s is an addition to other countries around the world already live for ups on our platform we are excited about this partnership and how we look ups and paymentus can co create a leading experience for business clients beyond the implementations we also have the opportunity to expand at existing clients this growth occurs as clients migrate additional divisions to acquire companies and convert them to us all by adding new payment types and features such as autopay beyond new implementations we also have the opportunity to expand at existing clients two examples of expansion are a large utility with over 2 million customers which added advanced payment methods like paypal to provide their customers with more choices and a software utility which moved its autopay payments to paymentus to improve its customers experience by combining one time and recurring payments under paymentus platform in addition to new sales and the same store sales expansion we completed several key renewals including extending our relationship with the leading provider of insurance to the jewelry industry through the addition of ipn we ended our third horizon with a focus of building out our partner network ipn expands our reach beyond billers to fis technology partners and retailers who originate transactions that we process paypal one of our founding ipn partners continues to focus on introducing enhanced bill payment functionality across its platform we are also really excited about ipn across other ipn partners and especially our extended reach to nearly 300 financial institutions with the payveris transaction in summary i m very pleased with the financial results of this quarter and the progress we have made through the acquisition of payveris and finovera to move closer to our original long term vision to be that ecosystem for consumers dealers financial institutions and partners with that i will turn the call over to matt to talk more about our financial results matt matt parson chief financial officer thanks dushyant let me start by also adding my thanks to our shareholders clients partners and employees you all are the reason for the strong q2 financial results that i have the privilege of sharing today as a quick reminder today s discussion includes non gaap financial measures please refer to the tables in our press release for reconciliation from non gaap items to the most directly comparable gaap financial measure before i talk about the second quarter s financial results and our outlook for 2021 let me remind you about our business model as dushyant we get paid when our clients get paid so the key indicator to measure the performance of the business is the number of transactions processed for the vast majority of our clients transaction fees are the same regardless of the payment amount for example we would receive a 1 50 for a utility payment of 50 and the same 1 50 for a payment of 275 interchange fees may vary by bill or industry and type of payment among other things but in most cases we have caps on interchange and payment amounts to help us manage the costs these transaction fees can be paid by the biller the consumer or a combination of both and we generally do not charge for implementation or customization fees for our platform so professional services revenue is minimal now turning to the quarter we processed 64 2 million transactions representing a year over year increase of approximately 39 this transaction growth drove a 30 3 increase in revenue over the same period in 2020 which resulted in revenue of 93 5 million as we ve explained before as we see larger as we sign larger and larger billers we anticipate the mix shift of fees will continue contribution profit for q2 was 37 4 million a 24 increase over the same period last year adjusted gross profit for the second quarter was 30 1 million and this was an increase of 24 from q2 of 2020 contribution profit growth and adjusted profit growth can vary more than revenue growth due to the change in interchange cost as a reminder there are certain external factors that impact interchange such as the average payment amount in a particular month or quarter for example hot summers or cold winters may increase utility bills which increases our interchange cost and we also have property tax payments that see large amounts twice per year adjusted ebitda was 8 3 million which represents a 22 2 margin on contribution profit the 5 decline in adjusted ebitda from the second quarter of 2020 is due to cost increases related to being a public company as well as increased investments in r d and sales and marketing the adjusted ebitda margin for q2 was higher than anticipated as a result of the higher contribution profit than anticipated for q2 and the fact that travel and concerts did not start back as soon as we thought as well as the ongoing tightness in the u s labor market making hiring more challenging than expected operating expenses rose 7 8 million to 24 8 million for q2 of 2021 r d expense increased 1 9 million or 32 4 as we continue to invest in new features and functions in our payments platform and we build out ip with additional partners over half of the operating expense increase or 4 million was in g a and was driven by public company cost as well as continuing to build out the public company infrastructure sales and marketing increased 1 9 million or 24 5 as we ramped up selling activity relative to the same time last year in the middle of the covid uncertainty our gaap net income and eps for q2 was slightly lower than we anticipated due to one time discrete tax items that arose as a result of going public these two one time tax items totaled approximately 2 million or about 1 million each as a result of these two discreet one time items that hit gaap tax expense in our q2 our effective tax rate for the quarter was approximately 86 excluding these two discreet one time tax items our net income for the quarter would have been 2 6 million as of june 30 2021 we had 266 4 million of cash and cash equivalent on our balance sheet now from our q2 results let s turn to our 2021 full year outlook inclusive of our payveris and finovera acquisitions our revenue outlook for 2021 is in the range of 378 million to 382 million which represents growth between 25 and 27 year over year for contribution profit our full year outlook is between 152 million and 154 million or approximately 26 to 28 growth for both revenue and contribution profit we expect q4 to see almost all the benefit due a full quarter of payveris as you may recall we typically see the highest average payment amounts of the year in q3 as a result of the summer heat combined with some semi annual per year tax payments in fact in q3 of 2020 we actually saw a slight sequential reduction in contribution profit while we do not anticipate a sequential reduction this year we do anticipate similar factors that will influence our q3 results for full year 2021 we also see adjust ebitda in the range of 25 million to 28 million with an adjusted ebitda margin of 16 5 to 18 5 on contribution profit this margin is a bit higher than we previously anticipated for factors mentioned including travel and concerts not ramping back as quickly as originally anticipated as well as ongoing tightness in the u s labor market making hiring more challenging than in the past several quarters with respect to taxes we do not anticipate any further impacts on the one time discrete items or any other one time discrete items this year however as a result of the items mentioned for q2 we expect that our full year effective tax rate for 2021 will be approximately 47 on a normalized basis going forward we would anticipate that our effective tax rate would be approximately 30 assuming no changes to current u s federal tax laws or rates and this is due to fact that a large majority of our revenue is in the u s so it represents the u s federal statutory rate combined with various state income taxes i ll now turn the call back over to dushyant for a closing comment dushyant sharma founder and chief executive officer thank you matt look overall we are very pleased with the financial and strategic progress we have made this quarter especially in the expansion of our ipn ecosystem deeper into the financial institutions market we continue to execute across our three horizon strategy and drive organic growth with payveris and finovera we ll continue to accelerate the breadth of our ipn offering we ll now open the call to questions questions answers operator certainly the first question is from the line of ashwin shirvaikar with you may proceed ashwin shirvaikar citi analyst hey thanks it s ashwin shirvaikar from citi dushyant sharma founder and chief executive officer hey ashwin matt parson chief financial officer hi ashwin ashwin shirvaikar citi analyst hi dushyant hi matt and paul great results congratulations on the results as well as on your first public call here i was wondering if you could address on a quantitative standpoint sort of 3q versus 4q cadence matt you ve qualitatively addressed some elements of 3q but if you could talk about what to expect both from a top line perspective as well as contribution perspective matt parson chief financial officer yes sure happy to thanks for the question ashwin so as i said and just to give a little more color on that because of the semi annual tax payments that we have as well as the sometimes seeing cold winters hot summers q1 and q3 are typically higher average payment amounts versus q2 and q4 and so as a result of what i said in the prepared remarks we would anticipate that that will continue this year that we ll see higher average payment amounts in q3 and so from a contribution profit perspective it would be more challenged than say q3 or q4 would be not bad but definitely more pressure on the contribution margin contribution profit line items simply because of the higher average payment amount in q3 on a top line revenue basis we continue to drive additional transactions we re a if you look at the number of transactions that we had in q2 we re over a 250 million transaction run rate annualized for q2 we certainly expect that goes to continue through some of the same store sales items that dushyant talked about as well as additional implementations of new billers one thing one other thing i ll point out there is we did see if you look at the over performance on both the top line as well as contribution profit we had a couple of on same store sales we saw some expansion faster than we had anticipated as well as some implementations that went live a little bit earlier than we planned and modeled for and so that s what drove our over part of what drove our overdues in q2 that doesn t necessarily translate to q3 and q4 because we just kind of pulled the timing forward on some of those things and so it doesn t necessarily translate into overdues in q3 and q4 because we ll still have that revenue in those periods but hopefully that gives you some flavor and certainly happy to go into any more detail you need there ashwin shirvaikar citi analyst no understood got that and then the second question if i could the two acquisitions if you can talk a little bit about the financial contribution into the outlook especially to finovera if you could kind of talk about maybe a better drill down into the 15 000 billers do these give you i mean actually utilities credit cards wireless all listed but is there a particular end market that you didn t have before that then gives you a good step up into matt parson chief financial officer great thanks i ll take the first part and then i ll pass it over to dushyant on the second part so we are not breaking out any of the financial specifics of the acquisitions neither of them are super material to our overall position as we said we re going to we expect to close them by the end of q3 so we d really only be talking about q4 impact for this year and it s not material to our full year results what we expect to see it s really about and don t get me wrong they ve got some nice business and nice customers but we re really excited about the strategic aspect and what this drives for our business going forward and so with that i ll turn it over to dushyant to talk a little bit more about that piece dushyant sharma founder and chief executive officer sure ashwin from our perspective we re trying to build a modern age ecosystem for bill payments and the main thing these acquisitions add for us no 1 starting with payveris we got hundreds of financial institutions onto our platform we are able to reach all the banks we didn t have before not only from the perspective of originating the payments to our ipn so each of these banks and credit unions could potentially be a direct bill on our platform in case of finovera finovera is actually a company that has built a technology platform that aggregates bill data for all major billers on most major billers in the country that includes credit cards that include banks large telecommunication companies and so on utility etc and what this gives us is basically an ability to capture the bit of data for the customers the billers we don t have while we are in the process of prioritizing a sales process to reach out to those billers and onboard them on our platform so i d say in some ways there s a network effect where you re trying to monetize the transactions for the billers you don t have while you re in the process of trying to encourage those billers to move to our direct platform does that makes sense ashwin shirvaikar citi analyst got it got it yes that makes sense thank you thanks again appreciate it matt parson chief financial officer thanks ashwin operator thank you mr shirvaikar the next question comes from the line of dave koning with baird you may proceed dave koning baird analyst yes hey guys and great job matt parson chief financial officer thank you dushyant sharma founder and chief executive officer thank you david dave koning baird analyst yes sure and so i guess my first question just think about the growth is obviously tremendous in terms of number of transactions can you just kind of remind us how to think about like how much is just from new signings and then how much is kind of existing client growth when we just look at the 39 transaction growth and maybe how do we see that over the next couple of years matt parson chief financial officer yes great question and so none of that is really from new signings in the sense that if you recall our business model provides very good short and medium term visibility and so far as we ve got the timing of sale with the customer and then we have the implementation timeframe and that can take anywhere from a few months to a year depending on the size and the complexity of the customer and so we ve got a lot of visibility of what comes out in the short and medium term and so when we see the results of the transaction growth in q2 it s almost extensively driven by same store sales expansion and implementation go lives with customers that were already contracted several months earlier and in the implementation pipeline i ll turn it over to dushyant to talk a little bit about our sales performance in the quarter but that really is contributing to where we go next year if you think about the remainder of this year pretty much any growth that we see is gong to be coming out of the implementation of pipeline and same store sales growth but dushyant you want to talk about our sales performance a little bit dushyant sharma founder and chief executive officer yes by the way we had a great quarter from a sales performance standpoint i m very pleased wit it we are on target for the year and as matt said the results of that sales performance you will see in coming quarters as opposed to immediately next quarter as we bring that volume up on our platform and get those customers live but very good performance from a sales perspective matt parson chief financial officer and i ll just sorry i should ve said this the first time i spoke but the thing i would add just slightly to that too is what i said it was in part a response to ashwin s question a contributor to the almost 40 transaction growth that we saw in the quarter was really some of the items as far as same store sales as well as implementations happening sooner than we had kind of modeled and anticipated which is great our implementation team is doing a great job our customers are excited about working with us and so we ve been able to move up in the current quarter that doesn t necessarily mean we ll continue every implementation is different but we had a great result this quarter in being able to get customers live dave koning baird analyst great thanks and maybe just a quick follow up it looks like so in the first half of the year ebitda adjusted ebitda was 17 18 million or so and it looks like full year you re guiding 25 to 28 which would mean maybe 10 in the back half why is the back half lower is that just ipo costs and just sales efforts and all that stuff just maybe walk through that matt parson chief financial officer yes absolutely so that s one it s a variety of things one is in q1 we did not have a public company calls we had some legal fees and accounting fees starting to flow through but the bulk of those hit in q2 along with d o insurance etc then so that s one continuing to operate as a public company we also we think that obviously it depends on what happens with delta variant etc but we do think that there will be some pickup in travel accounts that s happening as we get later in the year back to normal if you will on that and we continue to look to hire folks and continue to drive hiring as we re very excited about the opportunity and then i think the last thing is in particular in q4 the results of the two acquisitions certainly have an impact in what we think is going to happen on ebitda for this year dave koning baird analyst got you thanks great job matt parson chief financial officer thank you dushyant sharma founder and chief executive officer thanks dave operator thank you mr koning the next question is from the line of tien tsin huang with j p morgan you may proceed tien tsin huang j p morgan analyst thanks so much good afternoon congrats on the ipo on the first call and the great results a lot of my question s asked but i want to ask dushyant on payveris just is there any way to maybe frame how many users or deposit accounts they currently power or have access to among the universe and just that the game plan to speed some of these banks on to ipn now that you own this asset is there an expedited way to move them on and the last question just the direct biller opportunity for these banks any idea on how many bills these banks might represent overall sorry to ask several but mostly around just the opportunity around payveris dushyant sharma founder and chief executive officer yes no first of all thank you so much for the kind words tien tsin we re not disclosing numbers at this point but i definitely can talk to the strategic side of it as you can imagine these are when you combine hundreds of financial institutions that includes credit unions and banks of different sizes you have a decent scale and the capability they have built in terms of a full service platform for banks for all money movement feeds from bill payments to p2p to a2a we feel that actually helps us get to other cohort of banks rather quickly now we continue to hear the feedback from the banks whether of all sizes including some of the largest banks that the legacy mainframe based systems they ve had some suppliers have ve had they haven t delivered the analytics aspects they re looking for we believe the ipn combined with some of the technologies we acquired here allows us to get after that market rapidly and in terms of the direct biller opportunity we are each of these financial institutions is actually sizable in terms of the number of payments we receive in that amount so it s not insignificant so we feel very good about it tien tsin huang j p morgan analyst yes sounds like a great way to get a one too many model onto the banks thanks for your thoughts dushyant sharma founder and chief executive officer thank you operator thank you mr huang there are no additional questions waiting at this time i would like to pass it back to the management team for any closing remarks dushyant sharma founder and chief executive officer well thank you so much for taking the time and it was a pleasure to walk you through our results and performance for the second quarter we would like to wish you all the very best to you and your families and please stay safe thank you operator duration 34 minutes call participants paul seamon vice president of

shipping segment and upward pressure both on rates and asset values turning to corporate following the close of the sale of hygo and gmlp to nfe which closed on april 15 we have booked a book gain of 575 million the book gain records a 18 6 million shareholding in nfe at an nfe share price of 35 38 following the proceeds from the nfe transaction we now have cash and marketable securities of approximately 1 billion our cash balance for the quarter ended up 287 million and we re currently in discussion with key relationship banks for new and refinancing term sheets in excess of 500 million that if concluded would release more than 250 million in additional liquidity to golar i ll now turn the call over to eduardo to take us through the second quarter results eduardo maranhao chief financial officer golar management ltd thank you karl and good morning everybody i m super excited to provide an update on our financial results for the second quarter of 2021 this has been a fantastic quarter for us as we have managed to close both the hygo and gmlp transactions on april 15 but we have also continued to observe great commercial and operational performance from our flng segment if we turn to slide number 5 we can see that the group had a very solid performance in q2 total operating revenues this quarter were 104 million or approximately 2 above than the second quarter of 2020 the greatest portion of our revenues came from our flng segment where operating revenues from the hilli which includes the base tolling fees increased from 54 million in q1 to 56 million in q2 this could be resulted as a this could be attributed to a result of our over production in the quarter this number does not includes the brent oil linked component which further enhanced this figure by another 3 million in the quarter and we will continue to record those gains as a realized gain on derivative instruments revenues from shipping were 42 million which was down from the 63 million which we observed on q1 but in line with the numbers of the same quarter of last year this has been a result of the seasonality in the market which has pushed overall time charter equivalent rates down from the previous quarter overall adjusted ebitda for the group was 67 million and in line with the same number of the last quarter of the same quarter of 2020 the main contributor to that has been the flng segment with 45 million from the hilli while shipping added 27 million to that figure continuing on the segment corporate and others which includes our business activities of vessel management and other corporate overhead costs recorded a slightly higher number this quarter with 5 million this was a result of one off redundancy costs following the sale of hygo and gmlp as alluded by karl before we recorded a record net income of 470 million in this quarter compared to 25 million in q1 total gain on disposal from the sale of hygo and gmlp to nfe contributed to 574 million and unrealized gains from the hilli brent oil derivative added another 71 million to that figure that has been further offset by a provision of tax liabilities which we have accounted in this quarter and also unrealized mark to market losses from our nfe shares as of the end of june the carrying value of our nfe stake was equivalent to 35 38 per share so as explained by karl before we ended the quarter with a total net debt of 2 billion and from a liquidity point of view we had total cash reserves of 287 million out of which 207 million was unrestricted cash we have also continued to receive term sheets from key relationship lenders for new and replacement debt facilities in excess of 500 million if we continue the presentation and turning over to slide number 7 i will give you further information related to the performance of the flng hilli so the hilli delivered continues to deliver an amazing performance with 100 of commercial uptime she has completed its 59th cargo during this quarter it contributed in total of 45 million in ebitda in q2 with further upsides to be captured our oil linked fee benefits from a high brent price and our expectation is to generate an additional 9 million in the next quarter which is up from the 3 million we recorded in q2 we have also agreed with perenco to increase utilization production in 2022 by 200 000 tons with the option to further increase it by 400 000 tons from 2023 to 2026 i will now turn the call back to karl so he can talk in more details about these arrangements karl fredrik staubo chief executive officer golar management ltd thank you eduardo turning to slide 8 one of the more exciting developments during the quarter was our announced capacity increase for hilli hilli has since delivered and contracted for 1 2 million tons per year of its total 2 4 million tons per year liquefaction capacity the announced increase in capacity will see volumes increase from next year by 17 or 0 2 million tons per year to a total of 1 4 million tons in addition perenco has committed to a drilling campaign of two wells to three wells and been given an option to declare an additional 0 4 million tons every year from 23 to 26 increasing total annual production in that period to 1 6 million tons per year the tariff on the incremental production over and above the existing 1 2 million tons will be linked to ttf delivering on golar s express target to increase gas price exposure and there will be no changes to the tariff on the existing 1 2 million tons golar will incur no capital expenditure to facilitate the capacity increase and only minor adjustments to opex hence the majority of cash flows will flow to free cash flow in which golar has an economic interest of approximately 89 in the oil derivative and 87 in the increased capacity production hence the built in ebitda growth for hilli between 22 and 26 consists of our brent linked revenue which can add 40 million on current forward curves if you however believe that the current brent price will prevail the same number increases to 155 million the increased production will based on ttf forward curves add around 113 million but if you instead believe that the current ttf will prevail that can increase to 373 million so to put those numbers into perspective the base remaining ebitda for hilli is 751 million on forward curves we will see an increase of around 153 million or on current rates for the same volumes you will see an increase of 528 million there s significant embedded upside explaining this in some more granularity on slide 9 both oil and ttf gas prices are currently in backwardation with forward pricing lowered in current spot prices on the left you can see the sensitivity where the hilli brent link as mentioned is worth 40 million on the forward price and 155 million on current brent around 71 a barrel the sensitivity to be aware of here is that a 1 change in brent price equals 3 million change in ebitda for hilli on an annual basis on the right you can see the ttf price on the same sensitivity for 2022 on the forward curve we book an incremental earning of 26 million if current spot prevails the same number is 49 million for 23 to 26 it s 87 million versus 324 million so the point is that there s significant embedded upside in our existing assets turning to slide 10 gimi is now 72 technically complete on track and on budget we have booked 10 7 million man hours and the fifth and final drydock is now complete we are as we ve been all along expected to sail away from singapore during the first quarter of 2023 and we will start to be commissioning revenues from the second quarter of 23 before we start the full contract for 20 years with bp with a total backlog of 4 3 billion in q4 2023 turning to page 11 we continue to view the underlying macro as highly supportive of our strategy to move further into upstream the combination of economically attractive gas fields and our low cost flng solution produces a backdrop where we create an attractive risk reward considering where lng prices are trading today and where they have been trading historically further progress have been made on our announced initiative to increase our gas exposure we have added to our upstream lng team with very experienced personnel from nov and shell we re currently exploring several fields already producing associated gas as well as stranded gas opportunities and we will update the market when we are making further progress on these projects on the tolling side of our flng business we continue to work with existing and prospective clients on attractive growth projects and we have seen specific commercial and technical discussions with an existing client for use of a 5 million ton mark iii new building design turning to page 13 and switching gears to shipping as mentioned our shipping tce for the quarter came in at 46 700 a day and we expect q3 to be more or less in line at 47 000 this is a result of taking too much charter coverage into 2021 but we are seeing an increasing spot exposure both for the reminder of 21 and significantly increased into 2022 as mentioned we used the countercyclical strength to fix one of our ships on a five year charter during the quarter increasing our backlog to 259 million also as announced during q1 we repaid 60 million in upfront debt repayments in return for a total debt reduction of 102 million on four of our ships turning to slide 14 the lng market both the commodity itself and shipping freight rates has witnessed a real upturn in the first half of the year from a shipping perspective china s considerable growth in imports as well as higher prices in asia is pulling tonnage demand higher as witnessed by the 15 growth in ton miles compared to the first half of 2020 although the lng prices remained high it s been somewhat volatile benefiting an active trading environment which again benefits shipping another interesting factor we re paying attention to is the steep rise in asset values as steel prices and reduced shipyard availability start to reflect on lng newbuilding quotations lng carriers was quoted at around 180 million newbuild price around 12 months ago and it s now up to around 210 million for new orders placed today we see early signs of these trends also creeping across to second hand values across lng shipping turning to page 15 we don t only see the market being strong at the moment we see that we have fundamental support for continued strength of lng freight rates from a volume perspective we see the geographical imbalance between growth in supply which is primarily taking place in the atlantic and growth in demand which is still focused in the asia pacific and we only see that continuing to materialize over the next five years driving ton miles as we have previously alluded to the shipping market is also likely to face a capacity constraint due to new emission regulations that will impact in particular the older part of the fleet on steam propulsion the increased obsolescence of tonnage built in the 1990 s and earlier coupled with limited additional orders should together with an expanding lng trade translate into tight shipping market balance going forward based on the current positive market outlook for lng carriers we have reengaged initiatives to refinance our shipping fleet non recourse to golar and evaluate alternatives for a separation of our shipping segment turning again to the last section of the presentation today corporate and strategic focus on slide 17 we ve laid out the earnings power of golar s existing asset portfolio to start up on the top line you can see that our last 12 month adjusted ebitda for shipping is a 119 million this assumes 48 400 in average tce the 10 000 change in the tce across our shipping segment will increase or decrease ebitda by 32 million hence if you mark to market the fleet to the current one year tce there is 140 million upside to the ebitda generation of our shipping fleet which we then could see come in at around 262 million on hilli our pro rata last 12 months ebitda was 84 million as we have spent some time on the presentation today we have significant oil upside currently generating cash plus the agreed train 3 production with perenco adding around 70 million of incremental ebitda based on current ttf and current brent pricing that will then increase our pro rata ebitda from around 84 million to 154 million gimi remains on track to start its 20 year contract in october 2023 and will then add pro rata of ebitda of 151 million netting off corporate investments we will then see an ebitda based on last 12 months plus the contracted ebitda of gimi at around 340 million but with embedded upside included in our asset portfolio we can easily see this increase by more than 200 million to weigh into the 500 million if you compare that to our contractual debt position of around 2 2 billion remaining capex of around 400 million and cash and liquid assets of around the 1 billion and then the market cap of 1 2 billion you will see that we re currently trading on an ev ebitda to last 12 months adjusted ebitda of eight times or five times if you include the embedded upside in the asset portfolio we believe trading between five times and eight times is a significant discount to where we can monetize 10 year 20 year cash flows to bp and also this is also before pricing in any growth across golar s platform so we remain optimistic and encouraged by the supporting fundamentals across shipping and flng and we believe we are now at the very healthy capital structure with a significant capital buffer of around 1 billion turning to slide 18 for a summary and outlook as announced we have increased the capacity utilization for hilli which will then add anywhere between 113 million in ebitda backlog on current ttf or 373 million on the current price we re progressing with an existing customer for the contract over 5 million ton mark iii new building and we have expanded our flng team and are currently evaluating several integrated flng projects on the shipping side we see term rates higher than spot rates supporting further fundamental strength we have an increasing spot exposure across our asset portfolio and we see asset values rising on the back of a stronger freight market and higher new building prices on corporate and investments our adjusted ebitda came in at 67 million our net income following the sale of nfe was 471 million which equates to a big equity of 17 a share we have a strong cash and liquid asset position of approximately 1 billion and we will focus our efforts on refinancing our upcoming convertible bond maturity and further group simplification by separating flng and shipping that concludes the prepared remarks of today s call and i would like to hand it over to the operator for any questions questions and answers operator and your first question comes from the line of ben nolan from stifel your line is open please ask your question ben nolan stifel analyst hey good morning so i ll start i guess well boy there is a few things let me start with the mark iii that you talked about and the potential development there can you maybe frame in how far those conversations are at the moment or when you would think is a natural progression toward something more definitive karl fredrik staubo chief executive officer golar management ltd sure so i think there s a couple of things when you talk about these type of things it s always dependent on the charter taking a binary sort of yes no decision at the end of the day but i think there are a number of factors supporting why both the charter us and every other stakeholder in the project would see benefits in progressing this as quickly as possible i think number one and the most important driver right now is of course the gas price there is a lot of money left on the table for every day you wait second it s the cost of building a mark iii and when you see steel prices going the way it s going and yard activity sourcing significant orders for fairly large complicated vessels like large container orders and then waiting one day with an investment decision is more than one day of delay due to the lack of yard capacity lastly i think in the search for alternative liquefaction solutions i think we have proven that the cost point the carbon footprint and the operational track record of our flng technology is more competitive than other solutions and we are confident that such studies have now been concluded and therefore can open up for the next phase which then should be in everybody s interest to move ahead as quickly as possible ben nolan stifel analyst okay so is this something that i guess obviously maybe at somewhat out of your control but is it something that you see as a 2022 kind of event is that a fair framework karl fredrik staubo chief executive officer golar management ltd yes i would say within the next six months to 12 months maybe six months more than 12 months there we should be able to see some significant progress and be able to update the market on significant progress ben nolan stifel analyst perfect thanks karl so and then my second question relates to the five year contract and really actually just contracting in general first i guess any context on the kind of rate that you can get on a five year contract and then is this something that you re looking to do on other ships specifically the one i was thinking of is the tundra i mean is there any room for that to be contracted as an fsru on a long term basis karl fredrik staubo chief executive officer golar management ltd sure so there is a couple of things in those questions so when it comes to the five year charter to be specific that is for a carrier and not to a tundra as an fsru one of the reasons why we decided to do it is that when you have a meaningful shipping fleet it s helpful to tie in some of the ships especially if you can do it way above or well above all in cash breakeven doing a five year term on one ship also helps with our discussions with the bank in where and how you can potentially refinance the shipping fleet non recourse to golar to prepare the shipping fleet for a separation from our flng business so the driver of why we decided to fix was that we could it helps refinancing it s also been attractive rate compared to what we have made on the ships historically and we are generating decent free cash flow to equity on that charter when it comes to tundra we are increasingly confident that we will find work for her as a fsru there are several projects where the specifics on tundra is interesting tundra has a very high throughput and 170 cube storage instead of 160 cube so she is very well suited for certain projects and if we were to do a shipping spin that would likely not include tundra but we would like to keep tundra until we have fixed her and then look at alternatives for her that s how we see it ben nolan stifel analyst perfect all right thank you operator and your next question comes from the line of chris tsung from webber research your line is open please ask your question chris tsung your line is open please ask your question mike webber webber research analyst hey guys good morning this is mike webber actually on for chris how you doing karl fredrik staubo chief executive officer golar management ltd hey hi mike mike webber webber research analyst okay good so i just wanted to follow up on the carrier spend specifically so refinancing the carriers presumably the idea there to just get them under a single facility to make it easier spend but even delevering those carriers for a while leverage levels we would assume to be relatively flat all things considered on a refinance basis karl fredrik staubo chief executive officer golar management ltd yeah i think that s a fair assumption we re down to around 108 in that per tfde i think if you went to the leasing market you could probably get proceed slightly above that if you go for a normal bank financing it s slightly below that but it s variations around that number and so it s really up to the sort of final structure that we see most suitable whether it sort of makes sense to do a bank package or whether you go with the combination bank lease or full lease so dependent on exactly what structure we could look like there could be fairly minimal further deleveraging needed but on a stand alone basis we can refinance the fleet non recourse without any further cash injection mike webber webber research analyst okay that s helpful and so i mean it s always been one of the complicating kind of impediments to spinning the carriers given the idea all else equal what kind of timeline you d be looking at to do that karl fredrik staubo chief executive officer golar management ltd i think this year has obviously seen quite a lot of changes across the company portfolio with the nfe transactions concluded i think we now sort of freed up time to take a thorough look at this again and to be fair i think we it was quite public that we were very close to solve this around two years ago it s then been sort of parked for a bit but now we will reengage any and all such discussions i think to be fair there s a lot of corporate activity that s happened across the lng space with gas flow private and the large corporate transaction in selling of hygo and gmlp so we re encouraged to see that across lng and we believe that there are some opportunities worth exploring and with the rates where they are it s difficult for investors to obtain pure play shipping exposure you can of course buy flex but that s already gone more than three times we re encouraged to see that because that makes way for we think more shipping exposure pure play shipping exposure mike webber webber research analyst sure and acknowledging that you have a number of options in this regard is the idea are you still primarily pursuing scenarios that involve a specific counterparty involved in a carrier fleet or just something where it could be spun out of the public markets karl fredrik staubo chief executive officer golar management ltd no it could easily be the latter i don t think we re obviously exploring a couple of alternatives and what we think would be the best solution but stand alone without any other involved partners is certainly on the table as well mike webber webber research analyst sure and then my follow up on the hilli you did a good job of laying out the different scenarios for adding additional volumes there in the deck just curious in terms of the term i know my understanding has always been a volume based contract to begin with you guys are kind of playing with the volume a little bit now and i know some of that is contingent on perenco s inland or not inland in country i guess drilling activity has there been any conversations or substantive conversations around extending the term of that of the underlying contract on that asset at least for the base the baseline volumes or is that something you would expect to be more relevant after you figure out toggling to utilize more trains three and four karl fredrik staubo chief executive officer golar management ltd i think the fair thing to say there is that we have been extremely clear with the market and equally clear with perenco that we are not talking about extension before we see expansion so there is only one word starting with an e that we have been open to discuss we concluded the expansion now in july so up until now that s completely off the table for us i think from here onwards it s obviously the door is more open than it has been in terms of extension but back to the slide that we presented in the deck and how we see flng economics on slide 11 our primary target would be to deploy hilli on the gas field that we control ourselves but we would certainly be open to find solutions with partners in general and we d like to work with perenco so that could be an option as well but it has it needs to come down to what the contract structure looks like look like we are of course encouraged that perenco will now drill another two wells to three wells because dependent on the gas flow and the reserves of those wells i think there are some additional conversations that very quickly will start to esclate but i think we also tried to mention during the call that we ve made some we think very good hires in strengthening our upstream team and we re already seeing some of the benefits of that and there are some quite interesting fields that we think we could redeploy at hilli on as well mike webber webber research analyst got you okay i ll save my follow up thanks guys appreciate that karl fredrik staubo chief executive officer golar management ltd thanks operator thank you and your next question comes from the line of chris wetherbee from citi your line is open please ask your question james citi analyst hey guys james on for chris just wanted to follow up on the line of questioning around the spin how does essentially the new regulation sort of play into that is there any timing aspect around that or milestones we should be aware of or is this essentially all out there areas which is something you re ignored and just progressed as you see fit just kind of want to understand if there is anything to be aware of there karl fredrik staubo chief executive officer golar management ltd sure so the new regulation will come effective from 1st of jan 23 we see that mainly affecting steam carriers which we see as a big benefit because they represent just over 40 of the fleet on the water and if 40 is either obsolete or need to slow down that will have a very positive supply effects we only have one steamer left in our fleet which is the arctic other than that we re in the tfde s which should be far less affected other than fleets through positive support for rates so we are welcoming that change and i m looking forward to it i think in terms of triggers we have previously looked to do shipping spins with partners and i think it s fair to say that if we do it again we will be open to do it with partners but we will not expose ourselves to a situation where we re reliant on them and when the debt level per ship is down to the level we re at now we believe it s fully doable to do this on a stand alone basis should we wish to do that as well james citi analyst got it but given the strength of that catalyst is it possible or do you think it might make sense to wait a little bit or wait till the back half of 22 or maybe even into 23 or is it just something where you don t think that it ll actually or you expect sort of whatever you re going to get forward to reflect that and it shouldn t be much of a concern one way or the other just trying to understand your view for the outlook versus the timing of the spin timing karl fredrik staubo chief executive officer golar management ltd we agree that as a shareholder holding lng shipping into that time period is probably one of the more interesting that s been through the history of lng carriers however we don t necessarily see a spin as a sale as long as you spin it and maintain the equity then we think that s really doable so if you want to think about it today you own one golar lng share which has flng exposure and shipping exposure what we see is that we struggle to get the efficient pricing because people that want the shipping exposure don t necessarily won t be flng and vice versa hence for us what we re considering is just to get the shipping fleet into a separate exposure and then potentially to handout the share in the shipping venture and then instead of holding one flng share with two exposures you will have one glng share which is an flng company and then another share which is a shipping company james citi analyst got it all right and then sort of a separate item just understanding how you might possibly structure another flng deal you guys have sort of benefited a lot from the flexibility provided by the liquidity you ve gained so potentially like how would you think about funding an flng project would you take on a partner initially would you think about some other source just trying to understand how you re thinking about the structure of potential deal whenever it does come about karl fredrik staubo chief executive officer golar management ltd there you need to distinguish between tolling arrangements so that s a deal similar to bp so if we were to do sort of a repeat of gimi building against long term contract we would like to do a newbuild and would expect to get yard financing so the equity requirement during construction would be significantly lower than the sort of pay as you go structure that we have on gimi and also have on hilli and we think we have sufficient cash and marketable securities to fund our share of such a project when it comes to integrated and if we were to purpose build an flng we would likely require partners but we are also looking into alternatives for redeployment of hilli in 2026 when it turns off it s existing contract and then of course the capex has been taken and we ve already amortized a very large portion of the debt by that time so then it should be very limited equity need in order to redeploy her on a separate entity and we also think we can do that from our own balance sheet so that s how we think about it at the moment james citi analyst great thank you karl fredrik staubo chief executive officer golar management ltd thanks operator our next question comes from the line of randy giveans from jefferies your line is open please ask your question randy giveans jefferies analyst how are you gentlemen how s it going karl fredrik staubo chief executive officer golar management ltd hey randy randy giveans jefferies analyst question on the term sheets you received for the new refinancing facilities in excess of 500 million liquidity release of 250 million there i guess what assets will be used for collateral and what are the hurdles or maybe timing to get this closed karl fredrik staubo chief executive officer golar management ltd sure so we have been looking at some alternatives on how we can free up additional liquidity at fairly attractive terms and we do believe we have some under levered assets so on those term sheets that relates in part to tundra which currently has around 107 million of that we have some letter of credits which are cash back that could be released and we are also having a very sort of under levered position in nfe where we have 100 million against our shareholding there so that s some of the venues that we are exploring in addition to those i think it s fair to say that gimi is under levered we have 700 million of debt against the 4 3 billion backlog project i think as we have seen increased capacity utilization of hilli neither train 3 or the oil derivative has any leverage against it and neither does our avenir shareholding so those are some of the venues that we are exploring we are of course price sensitive when discussing these alternatives but we do see the need or we should see the benefit in raising some extra liquidity if we can do it at attractive terms now that there is significant potential growth pipeline across flng in particular and these integrated upstream alternatives randy giveans jefferies analyst okay and then i guess if that does conclude would that be the way to repay the converts without selling nfe shares at these relatively low prices karl fredrik staubo chief executive officer golar management ltd yes so as we write in the report we are and we tried to be very consistent on this since the nfe transaction was announced we will we were not out of the lockups that s expired on july 15 we ve always said that we will be sensitive to golar share price and nfe share price and near term funding needs at golar when deciding on what to do with our shareholding in nfe and at current levels we find it best to tap these alternative sources to address the upcoming convertible bond as opposed to having to do anything within our nfe holding randy giveans jefferies analyst got it i guess last question on slides 8 and 9 there is pretty significant upside or downside to the train 3 ebitda contribution so and it looks like it s entirely linked to ttf are you going to hedge any of this or do you have a floor ebitda contribution that you expect for next year karl fredrik staubo chief executive officer golar management ltd i think it s fair when it s linked to ttf neither us nor perenco would accept to do that at a loss so the contract is structured in a way where we can t lose money on the incremental production on ttf but we both wanted to be aligned and we have for a long time as you know for it to increase the capacity utilization of hilli but also to increase the gas exposure so yes there is a floor it s impossible to lose money on that but there is significant upside we don t have any current plans to hedge it out because we like the dynamic of what we re seeing in the lng market then if you look at the hedging curve it s so backwardated up you re probably better off staying spot randy giveans jefferies analyst got it that is it for me thanks so much karl fredrik staubo chief executive officer golar management ltd thanks operator and your next question comes from the line of sean morgan from evercore your line is open please ask your question sean morgan evercore analyst hey guys so it looks like the priority right now in terms of additional developments on the flng side will be mark iii newbuild does this have any implications for the gandria and the future of the gandria is there a kind of a market preference for kind of bespoke builds for specific projects or do you think that the conversion for the gandria would still make sense given the right project karl fredrik staubo chief executive officer golar management ltd it can certainly make sense i think what we re trying to say in this report is that we re making progress both on we tried to say that we separate our flng the way we think about the flng in tolling and then integrated on the tolling side the most advanced and most likely near term discussion is the newbuild mark iii and in that you re absolutely correct but we are absolutely making progress when it comes to integrated as well and for integrated gandria is a solution that could be deployed there are some benefits using gandria we obviously have a very large study done on her in relation to referred to in our discussion back in the onelng days she could be somewhat quicker to deploy given that the hole is already there but we will remain open to both but if you have to ask about timeline i would say that the mark iii is significantly more likely near term than anything with gandria and currently gandria is sitting outside of singapore and has no debt against her and probably a scrap value of around 20 million but we think a worth as a sourcing of a mark iii design i m sorry mark i design significantly more than that sean morgan evercore analyst okay and what would the capacity be for the gandria if you were to do the conversion compared to the mark iii i think its five for the mark iii it s a smaller there will be a smaller solution similar to hilli karl fredrik staubo chief executive officer golar management ltd yeah about a full quarter of hilli and gimi so sean morgan evercore analyst all right okay thanks a lot karl fredrik staubo chief executive officer golar management ltd thank you operator thank you and your next question comes from the line of ken hoexter from bank of america your line is open please ask your question ken hoexter bank of america analyst great good afternoon good morning just on the hilli the 100 upside congrats on keeping that fully running and operating is there any scheduled drydocking we should be aware of or anything that slows performance and then the agreement on the third train how did the discussion the discussions progress on the fourth train and the potential to get that up and running let me just stop there thanks karl fredrik staubo chief executive officer golar management ltd okay so just to start off on the latter train 4 so perenco is now proving or drilling up two wells to three wells they have an option from 23 to 26 on doing another 0 4 million tons but it really depends on the gas flow and the reserves for those incremental wells currently we do not expect utilization of train 4 during the current contract period just on the back of what s known to be the reserves at the current location or hilli but that could obviously change when you do actual drilling and see the flow and can measure the reserves so i think for that one i would say it s unlikely that we could do train 4 during the existing contract period but it s subject to the outcome of perenco s drilling campaign that s now coming up sorry the other half of your question was ken hoexter bank of america analyst just a simple one is that you ve had the 59 loads is there anything that disrupts that going forward any type of drydocking that has to occur any downtime karl fredrik staubo chief executive officer golar management ltd there is no current there will be no drydocking for the remainder of the contract period there are some scheduled maintenance windows and every time we have shut down to do those and ramp back up again it s been done successfully at either the they ve sort of budgeted time or quicker so we are very happy with that and we don t foresee any shutdowns or downtime which is not scheduled and there are certainly no drydocks ken hoexter bank of america analyst perfect and then for the gimi is there any impact in that you ve had on covid on construction on downtime are there i guess any constraints on or penalties on delivering late or anything just on the timing of that delivery karl fredrik staubo chief executive officer golar management ltd i think it feels like the 11 months of fm was enough of covid effect on that one so that we certainly felt but on a slightly more serious note we obviously keep monitoring the situation i think the fifth and final drydock is now complete we ve booked around 10 7 million of the working hours to date and the project is progressing according to the timeline the only sensitive the covid sensitivity going forward is the availability of sourcing some workers or non singaporean workers and you need to get those into singapore if the situation worsens or became more problematic in singapore we need alternative plans to source such workers and we are working with keppel keep in mind keppel capital is a 30 shareholder here so we were aligned with keppel to find solutions to source such workers elsewhere so i would say the situation is pretty much under control to the extent you can keep the covid situation on the large construction project under control there is around 2 500 people working on the vessel every day and for now we haven t had any significant covid outbreaks across the workforce ken hoexter bank of america analyst great color and eduardo it s a great rundown great slides on running through the updates on each of the different parts and the simplification of it just one last one for me just you ve mentioned the monetizing the potential monetizing of the nfe stake is there it sounds like you don t have any plans i mean we passed the july 15 date it sounds like you want to keep that maybe just give us your thoughts on given the simplification of the structure what are your thoughts on the stake there karl fredrik staubo chief executive officer golar management ltd i can start and then maranhao can chime in because he s obviously intimately familiar with hygo but we when we sold gmlp and hygo to nfe that in itself injects around 0 5 billion of ebitda into nfe around 300 million of which generated from gmlp and hygo in sharp growth with significant terminals under construction or in development in brazil which will see a significant ramp up of volumes over the coming months and quarters so what we see is that if you add the tools for trade if you like from gmlp the embedded growth of hygo and top that with the existing asset portfolio of nfe we think that it s an extremely attractive play we are of course disappointed by how the share price has evolved since the transaction was announced on january 13 but we remain encouraged to see that the industrial and strategically important terminal that nfe is building will get into fruition if you add the fast lng solution where we re working together with nfe we think if they can obtain that integrated model there is some very significant potential in that share and that s why we re encouraged to keep it but maranhao knows far more about the brazilian terminals and the ins and outs of that than i do eduardo maranhao chief financial officer golar management ltd yeah if i may just add a couple words here on the on how we see their performance on the recent terminal developments i think we remain extremely confident on their ability to deliver on the on their business plan in special with the continuation of the projects that we had ongoing in brazil i think the various terminals in different jurisdictions we have seen significant progress since we announced the transaction and we remain in close dialog and as i said really confident on nfe s ability to deliver on that so having said that we really believe that the market does not fully value everything that nfe has been delivering so far and we have been addressing alternative ways to further provide ample liquidity to golar to address our upcoming refinancing needs as we have explained in the presentation ken hoexter bank of america analyst great appreciate the time guys thanks guys operator and your next question comes from the line of liam burke from b riley your line is open please ask your question liam burke b riley analyst thank you hi karl hi eduardo how are you karl fredrik staubo chief executive officer golar management ltd hi liam eduardo maranhao chief financial officer golar management ltd hey how are you there liam burke b riley analyst karl could you go back to the mark iii and how you envision the contract pricing of the project it will be tied to ttf or is it tolling or is a combination of the two karl fredrik staubo chief executive officer golar management ltd on the mark iii we re currently discussing the contract arrangement as a sort of fixed price tolling similar to what we have on gimi when it comes to the pricing of the mark iii itself so the capital expenditure we expect the fixed price epc contract liam burke b riley analyst okay great and the returns or the attractiveness of these projects or the flng projects are pretty nice do you see any competition on lower cost alternative or lower priced alternatives here karl fredrik staubo chief executive officer golar management ltd i think it s fair to say that there is like three four people that have done flngs it s shell prelude you got the exmar tango you have the petronas units and you have us and then of course nfe is working on their fast lng solution i think if you take if you exclude nfe for a minute but on the cost per liquefaction i think we re highly competitive if not the most competitive when it comes to operational track record we have a better track record than any of the ones mentioned with 100 uptime since delivery and from an opex point of view that s also attractive so i think at the end of the day if you look at flng economics again as highlighted on slide 11 in the deck and you will see that it s far more important well we are competitive on all these parameters but the most important thing is that you have a reliant service we re able to capture the upside when gas prices are as they are now or even better if they are like they were last winter so at the end of the day i think our price point and our operational track record is the real attractiveness and when it comes to nfe i don t think they have an ambition to produce lng for others but rather use for their own takes so we don t see them as a competitor on tolling business liam burke b riley analyst great thank you karl operator and there are no further question at this time please continue karl fredrik staubo chief executive officer golar management ltd thank you all for dialing into the call again sorry for
