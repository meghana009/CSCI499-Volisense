revisions to stock based compensation and related expenses non gaap financial measures we report our financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america or gaap however management believes that in order to properly understand our short term and long term financial and operational trends investors may wish to consider the impact of certain non cash or non recurring items when used as a supplement to financial performance measures in accordance with gaap these items result from facts and circumstances that vary in frequency and impact on continuing operations in this release hubspot s non gaap operating income operating margin subscription margin expense expense as a percentage of revenue net income operating and free cash flow are not presented in accordance with gaap and are not intended to be used in lieu of gaap presentations of results of operations free cash flow is defined as cash and cash equivalents provided by or used in operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and capitalization of software development costs plus repayments of convertible notes attributable to debt discount we believe information regarding free cash flow provides useful information to investors in understanding and evaluating the strength of liquidity and available cash provides a comparable framework for assessing how our business performed when compared to prior periods which excluded repayments of our convertible notes attributable to debt discount from operating cash flow with the adoption of accounting standards update asu 2020 06 on january 1 2022 there are no longer repayments of convertible notes attributable to debt discount management believes that these non gaap financial measures provide additional means of evaluating period over period operating performance specifically these non gaap financial measures provide management with additional means to understand and evaluate the operating results and trends in our ongoing business by eliminating certain non cash expenses and other items that management believes might otherwise make comparisons of our ongoing business with prior periods more difficult obscure trends in ongoing operations or reduce management s ability to make useful forecasts in addition management understands that some investors and financial analysts find this information helpful in analyzing our financial and operational performance and comparing this performance to our peers and competitors however these non gaap financial measures have limitations as an analytical tool and are not intended to be an alternative to financial measures prepared in accordance with gaap in addition it should be noted that these non gaap financial measures may be different from non gaap measures used by other companies we intend to provide these non gaap financial measures as part of our future earnings discussions and therefore the inclusion of these non gaap financial measures will provide consistency in our financial reporting management may however utilize other measures to illustrate performance in the future investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these non gaap measures to their most directly comparable gaap financial measures a reconciliation of our non gaap financial measures to their most directly comparable gaap measures has been provided in the financial statement tables included above in this press release these non gaap measures exclude stock based compensation amortization of acquired intangible assets acquisition related expenses non cash interest expense for the amortization of debt issuance costs gain on termination of operating leases loss on disposal of fixed assets loss on early extinguishment of 2022 convertible notes gain or loss on strategic investments gain or loss on equity method investment and account for the income tax effects of the exclusion of these non gaap items we believe investors may want to incorporate the effects of these items in order to compare our financial performance with that of other companies and between time periods stock based compensation is a non cash expense accounted for in accordance with fasb asc topic 718 we believe that the exclusion of stock based compensation expense allows for financial results that are more indicative of our operational performance and provide for a useful comparison of our operating results to prior periods and to our peer companies because stock based compensation expense varies from period to period and company to company due to such things as differing valuation methodologies and changes in stock price expense for the amortization of acquired intangible assets excluding backlog acquired intangible assets amortized as contra revenue is excluded from non gaap expense and income measures as hubspot views amortization of these assets as arising from pre acquisition activities determined at the time of an acquisition while these intangible assets are evaluated for impairment regularly amortization of the cost of purchased intangibles is a non cash expense that is not typically affected by operations during any particular period valuation and subsequent amortization of intangible assets can also be inconsistent in amount and frequency because they can significantly vary based on the timing and size of acquisitions and the inherently subjective nature of the degree to which a purchase price is allocated to intangible assets we believe that the exclusion of this amortization expense provides for a useful comparison of our operating results to prior periods for which we have historically excluded amortization expense and to our peer companies which commonly exclude acquired intangible asset amortization it is important to note that although we exclude amortization of acquired intangible assets from our non gaap expense and income measures revenue generated from such intangibles is included within our non gaap income measures the use of these intangible assets contributed to our revenues earned during the periods presented and will contribute to future periods as well acquisition related expenses such as transaction costs and retention payments and disposition related income such as proceeds from sale of assets are transactions that are not necessarily reflective of our operational performance during a period we believe that the exclusion of these expenses and income provides for a useful comparison of our operating results to prior periods and to our peer companies which commonly exclude these expenses and income in june 2020 the company issued 460 million of convertible notes due in 2025 with a coupon interest rate of 0 375 in august 2020 the fasb published asu 2020 06 which was adopted on january 1 2022 asu 2020 06 simplifies the accounting for convertible debt and other equity linked instruments and eliminates requirements to separately account for liability and equity components of such convertible debt instruments consequently our convertible notes are accounted for as a single liability and the discount created by the recognition of a component of the convertible debt in equity is eliminated the issuance cost of the debt is amortized as interest expense over the remaining term of the debt we believe the exclusion of this non cash interest expense provides for a useful comparison of our operating results to prior periods and to our peer companies prior to january 1 2022 the difference between the fair value and carrying value of debt conversion settlements was recorded as a loss on early extinguishment of debt within interest expense upon the adoption of asu 2020 06 no loss is recognized strategic investments consist of non controlling equity investments in privately held companies the recognition of gains or losses can vary significantly across periods and we do not view them to be indicative of our fundamental operating activities and believe the exclusion of gains or losses provides for a useful comparison of our operating results to prior periods and to our peer companies we made a contribution to the black economic development fund the investee managed by the local initiatives support corporation and have committed to make additional capital contributions we account for this investment under the equity method of accounting the proportionate share of our equity method investee s net earnings have been excluded in order to provide a comparable view of our operating results to prior periods and to our peer companies we believe this activity is not reflective of our recurring core business operating results gain on termination of operating leases results from early lease terminations and related improvement reimbursements from landlords being recorded as income loss on fixed assets result from the disposal of property and equipment associated with early lease terminations as we generally fulfill our obligations for the full lease term and use these assets for their full useful lives we believe these activities are not considered reflective of our recurring core business operating results as such we believe the exclusion of these transactions provides for a useful comparison of our operating results to prior periods and to our peer companies the effects of income taxes on non gaap items reflect a fixed long term projected tax rate of 20 to provide better consistency across reporting periods to determine this long term non gaap tax rate we exclude the impact of other non gaap adjustments and take into account other factors such as our current operating structure and existing tax positions in various jurisdictions we will periodically reevaluate this tax rate as necessary for significant events such as relevant tax law changes and material changes in our forecasted geographic earnings mix view source version on businesswire com

by scott disavino and laura sanicola reuters this winter the u s northeast faces its highest energy costs in more than 25 years due to tight heating oil supplies and fierce global competition for liquefied natural gas lng cargoes throughout 2022 consumers have been socked with higher costs for everyday items including groceries and gasoline the winter could bring more pain with heating costs nationwide set to soar as much as 28 from last year according to the u s energy information administration s eia winter fuels outlook during long cold winters the u s northeast consumes more oil and gas for heat than most of the country especially the six state new england region residents of massachusetts maine vermont new hampshire connecticut and rhode island paid about 36 more for gas and 58 more for power than the rest of the nation over the past five years federal government data showed exacerbating those high energy costs new england lacks enough gas pipeline capacity to meet all its heating and power generation needs on the coldest winter days so new england power generators rely more on heating oil and lng than other parts of the country and prices for those already expensive fuels spiked this year after russia s feb 24 invasion of ukraine as global supplies ran short due to supply disruptions and sanctions on moscow residential consumers in new england are expected to pay an average of 26 3 cents per kilowatt hour for electricity and 19 90 per thousand cubic feet for gas in january 2023 up more than 15 from last year and the most on record for both during january according to eia data going back to 1997 while most u s regions are somewhat insulated from elevated global prices by access to central continental gas production new england remains an energy island analysts at investment banking advisory evercore isi said referring to the limited capacity of the region s gas pipes the worse conditions get for europe the more exposed new england will be to elevated gas prices and lng cargo shortages this winter u s pipeline gas costs about 6 per million british thermal units far cheaper than in europe where gas is trading around 39 to attract lng cargoes but lng accounts for about 5 of new england s gas supply so power generators there are competing with global markets for the fuel since the region is reliant on imported lng during the winter months we can expect to see price volatility when global events impact demand for this fuel said matt kakley spokesperson at iso new england which operates the six state region s power grid with lng fetching such high prices in europe new england imported just 16 6 billion cubic feet bcf of gas as lng during the first seven months of 2022 down from a five year 2017 2021 average of 28 6 bcf during that time one billion cubic feet is enough gas to supply about five million u s homes for a day generally new england uses very little oil to produce electricity but during extreme cold snaps it can surge to more than 25 of power generation however oil inventories at power plants were just 40 full at the start of november according to iso new england down sharply from about 53 at this time last year weekly distillate oil stocks in new england which include oil stored at power plants hit a 22 year low of 2 8 million barrels in july but have since climbed to 3 6 million barrels by the end of october according to eia data the iso said it expects to have enough fuel supplies for mild to moderate winter conditions but if the weather turns extremely cold kakley said there are procedures to expedite supply deliveries to the region and the grid can ask the public to conserve energy controlled power outages would be a last resort in an extreme situation and not something we are anticipating kakley said there have never been region wide controlled outages in new england reporting by scott disavino in new york and laura sanicola in washington editing by david gregorio

this long exposure image shows the bank of japan s headquarters in tokyo on oct 27 photo afp i am writing this article in tokyo judging from my walks around the city during the past week and despite the fact everyone is wearing face masks it s like covid has vanished subways and trains are jam packed and shopping areas are full of people however the pandemic has left some scars many shops have gone under including my favourite 50 year old sushi restaurant the return to business as usual for japan didn t stem from tourist spending but rather from the financial strength of domestic consumers even before covid first emerged tourism income accounted for just 2 of japan s gdp moreover 81 of that was derived from domestic tourists foreign visitors played a relatively insignificant role in helping revive japan s economy the quick return to normalcy is due to the bank of japan s boj ultra easy monetary policy the price to pay is of course the rising rate of inflation which is the highest now in 33 years people who live on pensions are complaining about their weakening purchasing power soon the boj will have to strike a balance between maintaining economic momentum an economic issue and the livelihoods of people with fixed incomes a social issue what is happening in japan does not represent the real picture of the world economy in my view it shows the pent up demand after a long period of covid related fear with new cases dropping from a high of 220 000 per day to below 30 000 a day early last month the japanese are ready to spend and get their lives back i am afraid this might be a short term blip as the global economy is slowing down faster than many expected in the united states home prices are falling faster than in 2006 which led to the housing loan crisis in 2008 personal computer shipments are projected to fall 10 20 this year while smartphone sales are tipped to decline 10 many experts say this economic slowdown will be furious but fast as the fed has front loaded its interest rate hiking strategy historically the us central bank would raise rates by 25 basis points bps at a time but for a year or two however this year fed chairman jerome powell has adopted a new strategy of front loading rate hikes to bring down inflation as fast as possible as such hikes of 75bps have become the new standard and we could see a repeat of this at the fed s upcoming meeting by the time this article is published the fed funds rate could already have been raised to 4 0 unfortunately a by product of this bold strategy will likely be a sharp contraction of the global economy in the first half of 2023 there is a 100 consensus among analysts that the us economy will enter a recession next year this almost certain global economic slowdown could signal a death blow for the already ailing world financial system which is loaded with problems and on the brink of going under we could see the collapse of commercial and investment banks which could trigger a financial crisis similar to the great depression of the 1930s or the subprime debt crisis of 2008 the main feature of a financial crisis is of course the collapse of the financial system without a functioning one businesses and consumers will not have enough access to liquidity which in turn would cause bankruptcies and massive lay offs us unemployment rates were 25 during the great depression and 9 25 in 2009 the initial cause of the former was a stock market crash which saw the dow jones index drop nearly 13 in a day the crash led to the insolvency of the us banking system with 40 or about 9 000 banks out of business by 1933 the worst thing about this crisis was that the associated economic policy especially then president franklin d roosevelt s new deal programmes was unable to resolve the problem of chronic unemployment the crisis was ultimately ended by world war ii the world faced more financial upheaval in 2008 after lehman brothers filed for bankruptcy due to investment losses related to its subprime mortgage debt in september 2008 that debt was estimated at us 600 billion fortunately this crisis was relatively well managed by the fed only 489 banks went under the fed immediately injected 600 billion to offset the liquidity loss from the subprime mortgage bad debt even with such immediate and bold measure however the us economy still shrank 2 6 while the jobless rate had risen to 9 25 in 2009 and it wasn t only the us economy that suffered global gdp growth also contracted 1 3 in 2009 the current financial crisis if it pans out as feared will be totally different from those two examples it will be on a much larger scale and comprise a multitude of financial problems however we wouldn t expect spectacular market crashes or surprise bankruptcies things will happen more gradually with small problems popping up around the world it s more like the story of the four boiling frogs we won t know the water is too hot until we are suddenly boiled alive the first frog is the downturn in the cryptocurrency market it peaked in november 2021 with a market cap of 3 048 trillion by the end of this september it had been clipped to 0 972 trillion this 2 076 trillion investment loss as of now is 3 5 times higher than all the subprime debt write offs luckily this loss has been spread over many investors rather than a single investor like lehman brothers so there is no big bang but rather a slow painful effect on millions of investors the second frog would be russia s foreign debt of 450 billion as most of russia s foreign reserves of 540 billion have been frozen it has been forced to default again the banks claim they only hold 120 billion of russian debt and can tolerate the loss the third frog is ballooning private debt estimated by the international monetary fund at 156 of global gdp before the 2008 financial crisis the ratio was 139 this could lead to widespread defaults the fourth and largest frog to be boiled is the global bond market with an estimated value of 124 trillion making it three times larger than global stock markets at present bonds have lost an average of 10 2 of their value causing net sales of 175 5 billion in the first nine months of this year sooner or later the bond market will run into major problems are banks heading to bankruptcy not immediately but they re on the right track shares of many major banks are trading well below their book values deutsche bank and the bank of china are being traded at 29 of their book values while credit suisse cs is faring worse at 23 and is in desperate need of capital goldman sachs estimates cs will need a capital injection of 8 billion before 2024 to survive it really doesn t matter which big banks fall first because the rest will follow suit like a pack of dominoes just as they did the last two times

s is home to thousands of advisors that can meet your specific needs based on the methodology outlined below smartasset identified these financial advisor firms as among the top 5 financial advisor firms in the u s rank financial advisor assets managed 1 714 587 898 072 2 173 418 270 044 3 46 803 858 104 4 94 617 046 882 5 19 851 537 239 methodology to find the top financial advisors in the u s we first identified all firms registered with the sec in the country next we filtered out firms that don t offer financial planning services those that don t primarily serve individual clients and those that have disclosures on their record the qualifying firms were then ranked according to the following criteria aum firms with more total assets under management are ranked higher firms with more total assets under management are ranked higher individual client count firms that serve more individual clients as opposed to institutional clients are ranked higher firms that serve more individual clients as opposed to institutional clients are ranked higher clients per advisor firms with a lower ratio of clients per financial advisor are ranked higher firms with a lower ratio of clients per financial advisor are ranked higher years in business firms that have been in business longer are ranked higher firms that have been in business longer are ranked higher fee structure firms with a fee only as opposed to fee based compensation structure are ranked higher these stats are updated annually and accurate as of may 25 2023 this list may include firms that have a business relationship with smartasset in which smartasset is compensated for lead referrals such relationships have no impact on our rankings and firms are included and ranked based strictly on the above criteria smartasset is not a client of the aforementioned firms smartasset did not receive compensation for including any of the firms on the aforementioned list why work with an advisor we believe it s more important now than ever to review your retirement plan with a fiduciary financial advisor here s why the pandemic has shown us just how quickly decades of planning investing and saving can be completely upended this could mean your current financial plan might leave you without enough money to last your retirement additionally emotionally charged decisions to sell off large quantities of stocks or other investments now lock in your losses removing any chance for future growth research suggests people who work with a financial advisor feel more at ease about their finances and could end up with about 15 more money to spend in retirement 1 consider this example a recent vanguard study found that on average a hypothetical 500k investment would grow to over 3 4 million under the care of an advisor over 25 years whereas the expected value from self management would be 1 69 million or 50 less in other words an advisor managed portfolio would average 8 annualized growth over a 25 year period compared to 5 from a self managed portfolio 2 a 2020 northwestern mutual study found that 71 of u s adults admit their financial planning needs improvement however only 29 of americans work with a financial advisor 3 assuming 5 annualized growth of 500k portfolio vs 8 annualized growth of advisor managed portfolio over 25 years the hypothetical study discussed above assumes a 5 net return and a 3 net annual value add for professional financial advice to performance based on the vanguard whitepaper putting a value on your value quantifying vanguard advisor s alpha please

million divested non core assets with the sale of hudbay s lordsburg property during the third quarter of 2022 and the sale of its equity interest in fireweed metals corp in november 2022 prioritized copper world activities to focus on completion of the pre feasibility study receipt of state level permits and conducting a bulk sample program to de risk the project in 2023 while deferring the definitive feasibility study to 2024 announced disciplined capital allocation approach with the introduction of three prerequisites for sanctioning copper world including a prudent financing strategy with multi faceted financial targets focused on a minimum cash balance a stated maximum leverage limited non recourse project level debt and committed financial partners we are realizing the benefits from our recent brownfield investment program with steady quarterly copper production increases in peru growing quarterly gold production in snow lake and two consecutive quarters of positive cash flow generation this year said peter kukielski president and chief executive officer we have reaffirmed consolidated production and cash cost guidance and in light of continued inflationary cost pressures at our operations we have taken many steps to reduce our discretionary spending this year as we focus on deleveraging and disciplined capital allocation this will allow us to be able to continue to deliver copper and gold production growth over the next several years while prudently advancing our leading organic copper growth pipeline summary of third quarter results consolidated copper production in the third quarter of 2022 was 24 498 tonnes a 5 decrease compared to the second quarter of 2022 due to the planned closure of 777 in june 2022 partially offset by higher copper grades in peru consolidated gold production was 53 179 ounces a decrease of 9 compared to the second quarter due the closure of 777 in june and slightly lower gold grades in peru partially offset by significantly higher lalor gold grades and higher gold recoveries in snow lake and peru consolidated zinc production in the second quarter was 9 750 tonnes lower than the second quarter primarily due to the closure of 777 and one off production interruptions in snow lake during the quarter hudbay anticipates stronger production in fourth quarter and has reaffirmed its 2022 production guidance for all metals consolidated cash cost per pound of copper produced net of by product creditsi in the third quarter of 2022 declined to 0 58 compared to 0 65 in second quarter of 2022 this significant improvement was primarily a result of lower onsite costs in manitoba partially offset by higher onsite costs in peru higher treatment and refining charges and freight costs in peru and manitoba and lower consolidated copper production with the closure of 777 consolidated sustaining cash cost per pound of copper produced net of by product creditsi was 1 91 in the third quarter of 2022 compared to 1 87 in the second quarter this slight increase was primarily due to higher sustaining capital expenditures partially offset by lower cash costs described above and lower royalties both measures are tracking well with respect to the 2022 guidance ranges and the company is reaffirming its full year consolidated cash cost and sustaining cash cost guidance consolidated all in sustaining cash cost per pound of copper produced net of by product creditsi was 2 16 in the third quarter of 2022 12 higher than 1 93 in the second quarter of 2022 primarily due to higher corporate selling and administrative expenses and accretion and amortization of decommissioning and community agreements cash generated from operating activities in the third quarter of 2022 increased to 172 5 million compared to 165 6 million in the second quarter of 2022 the increase is primarily the result of an increase in non cash working capital operating cash flow before change in non cash working capital was 81 6 million during the third quarter of 2022 compared to 123 9 million in the second quarter of 2022 this decrease was primarily the result of lower zinc sales volumes lower realized prices for

per share of 32 1 million and 0 12 respectively in the previous quarter during the third quarter of 2022 hudbay recorded a non cash gain of 6 4 million related to the quarterly revaluation of the flin flon environmental provision in response to changes in real long term discount rates a 6 7 million revaluation gain of the gold prepayment liability and a 6 0 million gain on the disposal of plant and

ounces of gold 564 299 ounces of silver and 437 tonnes of molybdenum production of copper and molybdenum was higher than the second quarter of 2022 due to higher copper grades and higher molybdenum recoveries partially offset by lower throughput due to a planned semi annual mill maintenance program during the third quarter production of gold and silver was lower in the third quarter compared to the second quarter of 2022 due to lower grades partially offset by higher recoveries as previously disclosed full year production in peru is expected to benefit from higher grades in the fourth quarter of 2022 as such full year production of all metals remains on track to achieve guidance ranges for 2022 total ore mined in the third quarter of 2022 increased compared to the second quarter of 2022 due to higher amounts of ore mined from pampacancha the constancia mill performed well during the third quarter with ore milled only 0 3 lower than the second quarter despite the planned maintenance shutdown described above milled copper grades increased in the third quarter in comparison to the second quarter of 2022 due to higher than planned grades from constancia milled gold grades decreased in the third quarter of 2022 mainly due to temporarily lower gold grades from pampacancha combined mine mill and g a unit operating costsi in the third quarter of 2022 were 13 06 per tonne 9 higher than the second quarter of 2022 primarily due to continued inflationary pressures on fuel consumables and energy costs hudbay expects to complete a four day mill shutdown at constancia in november 2022 to advance maintenance activities that were originally planned for the first quarter of 2023 as a result of ongoing inflationary cost pressures and the additional mill maintenance in the fourth quarter full year unit operating costs in peru are expected to be near the top end of the 2022 guidance range peru s cash cost per pound of copper produced net of by product creditsi in the third quarter of 2022 declined by 8 to 1 68 compared to 1 82 in the second quarter primarily due to higher by product credits and higher copper production although copper cash cost is expected to continue to decline in the fourth quarter with higher anticipated copper production and contributions from precious metals by product credits full year cash cost in peru is expected to exceed the upper end of the 2022 guidance range by approximately 5 primarily due to the inflationary cost environment peru s sustaining cash cost per pound of copper produced net of by product creditsi in the

sustaining cash cost per ounce of gold produced net of by product credits were introduced in 2022 and do not have a published comparative for 2021 during the third quarter of 2022 the manitoba operations produced 40 457 ounces of gold 9 750 tonnes of zinc 2 196 tonnes of copper and 152 770 ounces of silver production of all metals was lower than the second quarter of 2022 primarily due to the planned closure of 777 in june 2022 however gold production from snow lake increased by 8 compared to the second quarter of 2022 due to higher lalor gold grades and increased gold recoveries at both stall and new britannia full year production of all metals in manitoba is on track to achieve guidance ranges for 2022 after 18 years of steady production at 777 in flin flon the final reserves were depleted in june 2022 closure activities in flin flon including the zinc plant were substantially completed in the third quarter with most of hudbay s employees and equipment of value transitioned to the snow lake operations to support lalor s ramp up strategy of 5 300 tonnes per day in early 2023 777 was decommissioned in early august with the removal of shaft conveyances and hoist ropes and securing of the shaft and all other openings to underground the flin flon mill was safely placed on long term care and maintenance during the third quarter a key focus area for the snow lake operations during the third quarter was integrating the flin flon employees and equipment to be able to transition away from the use of contractors in the future lalor s ore production during the quarter was impacted by an underground scoop tram fire as well as an unplanned manitoba hydro power outage due to the failure of a remote transmission line supplying power to the town of snow lake and the company s property both of which occurred in september the two day power outage affected operations at lalor the new britannia and stall mills and the snow lake camp required several days to fully restore power ventilation and water services to the underground operations at lalor once production activities resumed priority was placed on mining the higher value gold and copper gold zone ore to maintain throughput at new britannia mill lalor completed a scheduled maintenance program at the end of the third quarter and into the beginning of the fourth quarter to replace surface ore chutes and complete other pre winter maintenance activities lalor s ore production is expected to return to 4 650 tonnes per day in the fourth quarter and is on track to ramp up to 5 300 tonnes per day in early 2023 ore mined at lalor decreased by 16 in the third quarter of 2022 compared to the second quarter of 2022 due to the above noted transition and production interruptions impacting operations mined gold zinc and copper grades were 23 7 and 1 higher respectively compared to the second quarter the combined snow lake mills processed 11 less ore in the third quarter compared to the second quarter of 2022 mainly due to the above noted production interruptions impacting lalor and the milling operations stall recoveries were consistent with the metallurgical model for the head grades delivered the new britannia mill achieved consistent production in the third quarter averaging approximately 1 440 tonnes per day metal recoveries have now stabilized near targeted levels for the mill additional improvement initiatives will continue to be advanced in the upcoming quarters with a focus on reducing reagent and grinding media consumption that has contributed to higher operating costs than planned these initiatives require minimal capital expenditures and will further improve overall metal recoveries and copper concentrate grades combined mine mill and g a unit operating costsi in the third quarter significantly increased compared to the second quarter of 2022 reflecting the standalone cost structure of lalor compared to the second quarter which included operating costs for both lalor and the lower cost 777 mine unit operating costs were also impacted by higher contractor costs during the transition period higher costs at new britannia and continued inflationary cost pressures looking ahead to the fourth quarter of 2022 hudbay expects combined unit operating costs to remain elevated due to ongoing inflationary cost pressures and the removal of the lower cost flin flon operations as such hudbay expects the full year combined unit costs in manitoba to exceed the upper end of the 2022 guidance range by approximately 5 cash cost per ounce of gold produced net of by product credits in the third quarter was 216 higher than the second quarter of 2022 primarily due to lower by product credits as gold revenue continues to increase and become the largest contributor to total manitoba revenue gold cash costs were also impacted by higher treatment and refining charges partially offset by lower mining milling g a and zinc refining costs due to the closure of 777 and the zinc plant year to date cash cost per ounce of gold produced net of by product credits of 136 continues to track below the 2022 guidance range and as such we reiterate the guidance range for the full year sustaining cash cost per ounce of gold produced net of by product credits in the third quarter was higher than the second quarter of 2022 primarily due to the same factors affecting cash cost and higher cash sustaining capital expenditures partially offset by lower royalties focused on operating efficiencies and cost reductions hudbay continues to believe that long term supply and demand fundamentals for copper remain strong as global mine supply will be unable to meet demand from global decarbonization initiatives however in 2022 the company has faced higher input prices in a period of declining copper prices significantly squeezing margins while hudbay benefits from its consolidated cash costs being positioned in the first quartile of the global cash cost curve the focus continues to be on maximizing operating efficiencies and discretionary cost reductions in this challenging environment in light of this environment hudbay has taken several steps to reduce discretionary spending by 30 million for the remainder of 2022 and is targeting more than 50 million in discretionary spending cuts as part of the 2023 budget process including reducing 2022 arizona spending by 10 million with lower exploration evaluation and growth expenditures deferring plans for early development of the 1901 deposit resulting in savings of 5 million of manitoba growth spending in 2022 and additional amounts that were previously planned to be accelerated into 2023 without impacting the ability to achieve the 2026 production start as laid out in the current mine plan deferring 15 million of 2022 growth spending in peru and manitoba relating to mill recovery improvement programs and other capital projects evaluating low capital alternatives to installing a pebble crusher in peru saving approximately 22 million of growth capital in 2023 delaying the expected completion of the copper world definitive feasibility study to 2024 in order to reduce expected arizona growth expenditures in 2023 and prioritize the completion of the pre feasibility study and state permits in 2023 as mentioned in more detail below rationalizing the company s non core asset portfolio with the divestment of its 100 interest in the lordsburg property in new mexico which was acquired through the mason acquisition in 2018 to american copper development corporation and the sale of its equity interest in fireweed metals corp which was received in 2018 in exchange for the sale of hudbay s tom and jason project in yukon committed to deleveraging and disciplined capital allocation with a focus on generating positive cash flow and strong returns on invested capital hudbay is committed to deleveraging and disciplined capital allocation the company improved its net debt position by 70 7 million over the past two quarters to 897 1 million at the end of september 30 2022 hudbay has repaid 38 of the gold prepayment liability during 2022 and the remaining 80 3 million valued at gold forward prices as at quarter end will be repaid before the end of 2023 as part of hudbay s disciplined financial planning approach to copper world the company has introduced a three prerequisites plan 3 p including specific leverage targets that it would need to achieve prior to making an investment decision in the project permits receipt of all state level permits required for phase i plan completion of a definitive feasibility study with an internal rate of return of greater than 15 prudent financing strategy multi faceted financing strategy including a committed minority joint venture partner a renegotiated precious metals stream agreement optimized for the current project net debt to ebitda ratio of less than 1 2 times a minimum cash balance of 600 million and limited non recourse project level debt of up to 500 million the opportunity to sanction copper world is not expected until late 2024 based on current estimated timelines the decision to sanction copper world will ultimately be evaluated against other competing investment opportunities as part of hudbay s capital allocation process advancing several initiatives to de risk copper world hudbay continues to advance pre feasibility activities for phase i of the copper world project which is expected to include conversion of the remaining inferred mineral resources to measured and indicated and optimization of the layout and sequencing of the processing facilities in addition to evaluating other upside opportunities the process plant pre feasibility level engineering is at 85 completion and geotechnical and hydrogeological site investigation activities have been completed pre feasibility engineering design and metallurgical test work activities are on track to be completed before the end of 2022 with the results expected to be published in a study in the first half of 2023 copper world requires state and local permits for phase i which consists of a 16 year operation on private land claims on september 21 2022 hudbay submitted the application for an aquifer protection permit to the arizona department of environmental quality adeq and on october 21 2022 the company submitted the application for an air quality permit to the adeq hudbay expects to receive these two remaining state permits by mid 2023 the other key state permit the mined land reclamation plan was received in july 2022 upon receipt of the state permits for phase i the company expects to conduct a bulk sampling program at copper world in the second half of 2023 to continue to de risk the project by testing grade continuity variable cut off effectiveness and metallurgical strategies in high grade near surface areas of the peach elgin and west pits hudbay has re evaluated the timing of the definitive feasibility study for copper world and intends to prioritize the completion of the pre feasibility study state level permits bulk sampling program and a minority joint venture partner process in 2023 to significantly de risk the project and defer the definitive feasibility study activities and expenditures to 2024 exploration update initial mineral resource estimate for llaguen on november 2 2022 the company announced an ni 43 101 initial mineral resource estimate for the llaguen copper molybdenum porphyry deposit in the otuzco province in northern peru the llaguen project is 100 owned by hudbay and is near the highly populated city of trujillo in close proximity to existing infrastructure water and power supply the company optioned the property from vale in 2017 and has since completed an exploration agreement with the local community conducted additional geological mapping and geochemical sampling and completed a 28 hole confirmatory drill program during 2021 and 2022 the initial resource estimate was developed based on hudbay s confirmatory drill program and a 23 hole historical drill program completed by vale from 2006 to 2008 the initial mineral resource estimate at llaguen includes 271 million tonnes of indicated resources at 0 42 copper equivalentii and 83 million tonnes of inferred resources at 0 30 copper equivalentii the global mineral resource estimate contains a higher grade portion of 113 million tonnes of indicated resources at 0 60 copper equivalentii and 16 million tonnes of inferred resources at 0 52 copper equivalentii the methodology followed to estimate the mineral resources at llaguen is identical to the approach used by hudbay to estimate mineral resources at its constancia mine in peru llaguen project mineral

in the future peru regional exploration hudbay controls a large contiguous block of mineral rights with the potential to host mineral deposits within trucking distance of the constancia processing facility including the past producing caballito property and the highly prospective maria reyna property in august 2022 the company executed a surface rights exploration agreement with the community of uchucarcco that allows for exploration of the maria reyna and caballito properties shortly after the agreement was completed hudbay commenced baseline environmental and archaeological activities and its geological team commenced surface investigation activities field evidence confirms that both caballito and maria reyna host sulfide and oxide rich copper mineralization in skarns hydrothermal breccias and large porphyry intrusive bodies manitoba regional exploration hudbay continues to conduct drilling activities in the snow lake area and compile results from ongoing infill drilling at lalor and 1901 which will be incorporated into the annual mineral resource and reserve estimate update in the first quarter of 2023 assay results from recent confirmatory drilling at the tailings facility in flin flon indicate higher zinc copper and silver grades than predicted from historical mill records while confirming the historical gold grade the company plans to complete metallurgical test work on the flin flon tailings to assess the processing viability hudbay also intends to evaluate the opportunity to reprocess the tailings at the anderson facility in snow lake given significant amounts of gold have been deposited over many decades the company is in the process of planning a winter drill program to test the down dip gold and copper extensions of the lalor deposit in 2023 which will be the first time the company has completed step out drilling in the deeper zones at lalor since 2009 arizona regional exploration following the substantial completion of the infill drilling to support the pre feasibility study for the copper world complex in july the company reduced the number of drill rigs at site to three recent drilling has confirmed the continuity of the mineralization between the bolsa and east deposits and extended the size of the mineralized envelope which remains open in several directions and at depth nevada regional exploration a conductivity resistivity ip ground survey commenced in october 2022 at the mason valley properties located on hudbay s private land claims near the mason project this work in combination with a re interpretation of geological data from past operating mines and previous exploration data will be used to finalize a drill plan to test high grade skarn targets in 2023 appointment of chief financial officer on

measures adjusted net earnings loss adjusted net earnings loss per share adjusted ebitda net debt cash cost sustaining and all in sustaining cash cost per pound of copper produced cash cost and sustaining cash cost per ounce of gold produced and combined unit cost are non ifrs performance measures these measures do not have a meaning prescribed by ifrs and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers these measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with ifrs and are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under ifrs other companies may calculate these measures differently management believes adjusted net earnings loss and adjusted net earnings loss per share provides an alternate measure of the company s performance for the current period and gives insight into its expected performance in future periods these measures are used internally by the company to evaluate the performance of its underlying operations and to assist with its planning and forecasting of future operating results as such the company believes these measures are useful to investors in assessing the company s underlying performance hudbay provides adjusted ebitda to help users analyze the company s results and to provide additional

manitoba operations including severance past service pension costs disposals of certain non current assets and inventory supplies write downs as well as non cash impairment charges related to an updated flin flon closure plan and lower long term discount rates in the fourth quarter of 2021 none of which management believes are indicative of ongoing operating performance and therefore are adjusting items in the calculations of adjusted net earnings loss and adjusted ebitda in the first and second quarter of 2022 hudbay recorded a non cash gain of 79 9 million and 60 7 million respectively mostly related to the quarterly revaluation of its flin flon environmental provision which was impacted by rising long term risk free discount rates with the closure of 777 mine and flin flon operations in the second quarter of 2022 and given the long term nature of the reclamation cash flows quarterly revaluation of the corresponding environmental provision remains highly sensitive to changes in real long term risk free discount rates and as such the company expects to continue to experience quarterly environmental provision revaluations which is not indicative of its ongoing operating performance this item has been included prospectively in the calculation of adjusted earnings the following tables provide detailed reconciliations to the most comparable ifrs measures

forward looking statements these forward looking statements are based upon dhc s present intent beliefs or expectations but forward looking statements are not guaranteed to occur and may not occur actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by dhc s forward looking statements forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks uncertainties and other factors some of which are beyond dhc s control for example ms francis s statement regarding the strong leasing results and roll up in rents from 2022 third quarter leasing activity in dhc s office portfolio segment may imply that future leasing results in dhc s office portfolio segment will continue to be positive and that such positive leasing results will improve the financial performance of dhc s office portfolio segment however dhc s ability to realize positive leasing activity and occupancy depends on various factors including market conditions and tenants demands for dhc s office portfolio properties the timing of lease expirations and dhc s ability to successfully compete for tenants among other factors as a result dhc may not realize positive leasing activity or occupancy in future periods ms francis s statement regarding year over year and sequential increases in dhc s same property office portfolio segment cash basis noi may imply that dhc will continue to realize these improvements and that its office portfolio segment cash basis noi will increase in future periods however dhc may not be able to maintain these or other improvements with respect to its office portfolio segment and office portfolio segment cash basis noi may not improve or may decline ms francis s statements regarding the continuing recovery at dhc s shop segment with occupancy growth in dhc s shop segment and expected future occupancy and rate growth due to strengthening demand for senior living and resulting stabilization may imply that dhc s senior living communities will continue to recover and realize occupancy and rate growth in future sequential quarters from its shop segment however the projected future demand for senior living may not be realized and dhc s operators may not successfully compete for any such demand that may occur or otherwise further dhc s shop segment is subject to various risks many of which are beyond its control including the continued impacts of and market reaction in response to the covid 19 pandemic high inflation rising interest rates geopolitical risks or other economic market or industry conditions including a possible recession as a result dhc may not realize any such occupancy or rate growth in future periods and dhc s occupancy and or rates may decline and ms francis states that dhc has sufficient liquidity to execute on its business plan and position dhc for long term sustainable growth however if economic conditions worsen or if dhc and its managers and tenants otherwise fail to profitably operate their businesses or dhc incurs unexpected capital expenditures dhc may be required to utilize all or a significant portion of its cash and cash equivalents to fund its business and operations in addition pursuant to dhc s credit agreement the borrowing capacity under its revolving credit facility will be reduced to 586 4 million in january 2023 and as such dhc will be required to repay 113 6 million under its revolving credit facility by that time if dhc is unable to refinance or replace its debt as it matures its liquidity may decline therefore dhc may not be able to maintain sufficient liquidity or execute on its business plan and position itself for long term sustainable growth and dhc s financial results and condition may be adversely impacted as a result the information contained in dhc s

shares during the quarter said john fortson president and ceo commenting on the business segments fortson said in performance chemicals all three businesses posted record sales as demand was strong for our high value derivatized products that deliver the unique performance characteristics required by our customers in performance materials increased global auto production drove sales up 22 7 compared to the prior year performance chemicals sales in the performance chemicals segment were a record 337 1 million up 30 3 from prior year industrial specialties and pavement technologies both had record quarters with sales up 35 2 and 20 6 respectively versus the prior year quarter industrial specialties growth was driven by continued strength in the oilfield adhesives and agricultural chemicals markets while pavement technologies growth was driven primarily by higher volume as a result of increased technology adoption and a strong paving season engineered polymers sales were also a record rising 31 4 driven by higher prices which offset elevated energy and raw material costs volumes improved primarily in strategic growth markets such as automotive where customers are increasingly using engineered polymers caprolactone products in paint protection films and specialty materials for electrical vehicle batteries and footwear apparel sales across our performance

million up 22 7 compared to the prior year quarter segment ebitda of 61 2 million was up 8 5 versus the prior year period segment ebitda margin was 42 2 versus 47 8 as increased input costs outpaced prices during the quarter in the third quarter improved auto component supplies in all regions and china government automotive incentives drove stronger global auto production resulting in higher sales of our activated carbon products to the automotive sector and we continued to experience high demand for our carbon in non automotive applications allowing us to increase prices said fortson margins in performance materials were lower compared to the prior year due to significant increases in input costs such as a key raw material that increased over 60 during the year and began impacting margins noticeably in q3 in contrast to the process purification markets pricing for the auto market is typically set annually early in the year liquidity other the closing of ozark materials on october 3rd was funded using a combination of revolver borrowings and cash on hand which will be reflected in q4 share repurchases for the quarter were 49 3 million and 139 2 million year to date and

prepared in accordance with u s generally accepted accounting principles gaap and has provided a reconciliation to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap on the following pages these financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap investors should consider the limitations associated with these non gaap measures including the potential lack of comparability of these measures from one company to another we believe these non gaap financial measures provide management as well as investors potential investors securities analysts and others with useful information to evaluate the performance of the business because such measures when viewed together with our financial results computed in accordance with gaap provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our historical financial performance and projected future results ingevity uses the following non gaap measures adjusted earnings loss is defined as net income loss plus restructuring and other income charges net acquisition and other related costs debt refinancing fees litigation verdict charges pension and postretirement settlement and curtailment income charges and the income tax expense benefit on those items less the provision benefit from certain discrete tax items diluted adjusted earnings loss per share is defined as net income loss per diluted share plus restructuring and other income charges net acquisition and other

provision benefit from certain discrete tax items in each case on a per share basis adjusted ebitda is defined as net income loss plus interest expense net provision benefit for income taxes depreciation amortization restructuring and other income charges net acquisition and other related costs litigation verdict charges pension and postretirement settlement and curtailment income charges

financing arrangement and restricted investment net debt ratio is defined as net debt divided by last twelve months adjusted ebitda inclusive of acquisition related pro forma adjustments ingevity also uses the above financial measures as the primary measures of profitability used by managers of the business in addition ingevity believes adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are useful measures because they exclude the effects of financing and investment activities as well as non operating activities gaap reconciliation of 2022 adjusted ebitda guidance a reconciliation of net income to adjusted ebitda as projected for 2022 is not provided ingevity does not forecast net income as it cannot without unreasonable effort estimate or predict with certainty various components of net income these components net of tax include further restructuring and other income charges net additional acquisition and other related costs litigation verdict charges debt refinancing fees additional pension and postretirement settlement and curtailment income charges and revisions due to legislative tax rate changes additionally discrete tax items could drive variability in our projected effective tax rate all of these components could significantly impact such financial measures further in the future other items with similar characteristics to those currently included in adjusted

by michael s derby new york reuters federal reserve chair jerome powell acknowledged on wednesday the u s central bank s latest ethics stumbles and said it was working hard to make sure it meets its new very stringent standards the public s trust is really the fed s and any central bank s most important asset powell said at a news conference after the end of the central bank s latest policy meeting citing the new ethics standards imposed on policymakers earlier this year powell said anytime one of us one of the policymakers violates or falls short of those rules we do risk undermining that trust powell spoke in the wake of the latest developments in a controversy that s dogged the fed for little over a year now in september 2021 financial disclosures showed active trading by the dallas and boston fed presidents leading both men to retire early later that month after powell failed to express confidence in their leadership fed second in command richard clarida resigned early this year amid questions about his own trading announced last year and implemented this year the fed imposed a new ethics code that highly limited what officials senior staff and their families can invest in and when they can move money but even with those new standards atlanta fed president raphael bostic said last month that he had accidentally violated the ethics code officials were operating under before the new rules came into force which banned ownership of bank stocks and prohibited trading around monetary policy meetings and periods of market stress bostic then restated his disclosures and the fed asked its in house inspector general ig watchdog to look into the matter the fed got another black eye from a new york times report in october that found that st louis fed president james bullard spoke last month behind closed doors to a banking group skirting rules that caution central bank officials from doing exactly that the st louis fed said it heard the criticism and would weigh changes for future appearances in his news conference on wednesday powell said that bostic s challenges were uncovered as part of the regional fed leader s efforts to make sure his personal financial situation was meeting the requirements of the new ethics code powell did not comment directly on bullard s appearance before the bankers group the fed chief said officials had a discussion at the start of this week s two day policy meeting on the importance of holding ourselves individually and collectively accountable for knowing and following the high standard that s set out in our existing rules with respect to both personal investment activities and external communications we do understand how important those issues are powell said and added we recommitted to each other to this institution to hold ourselves to the highest standards and avoid these problems ig report what happens next on the ethics front is unclear while clarida and powell were both cleared by the ig of deliberately violating central bank financial rules powell also had some accidental investment changes during prohibited periods a separate report looking into what happened at the regional banks has not yet been released a spokesperson for the watchdog recently declined to say when that report might be released the report is highly anticipated in large part because robert kaplan a former top leader at goldman sachs had bought and sold to the tune of many millions of dollars a wide range of stocks and other investments kaplan did not reveal in his existing disclosures the full scope of that trading and had spurned requests to do so reporting by michael s derby editing by leslie adler and paul simao
there is no sense that inflation is coming down i have a table of the last 12 months of readings there s really no pattern there we re exactly where we were a year ago i would also say that it s premature to discuss a pause it s not something that we re thinking about that s not a conversation to be had we have a ways to go the last thing i would say is that i want people to understand our commitment to getting this done and to not make the mistake of not doing enough or the mistake of withdrawing our strong policy and doing that too soon it wasn t supposed to be like this of course the market had anticipated the 0 75 percentage point rate hike the fed delivered but it had also baked in a more cautious stance from the fed advertisement bulls wanted to hear the fed acknowledge that the rapid pace of tightening since march was starting to deliver the economic slowdown it is designed to produce and hear powell say that he was starting to lift his foot off the accelerator the fed s official statement appeared to deliver with new language in the third paragraph of the statement delivering the whiff of a pivot that market bulls wanted the committee anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 per cent over time it read in determining the pace of future increases in the target range the committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation and economic and financial developments the pivot calls came thick and fast on twitter coolabah capital founder and the australian financial review columnist christopher joye rightly pointed out the similarities between the fed s lag language and that of the reserve bank of australia s statement on tuesday following its 0 25 per cent rate rise the board recognises that monetary policy operates with a lag and that the full effect of the increase in interest rates is yet to be felt in mortgage payments advertisement but a fed decision day is always a two part act the statement and then the chairman s press conference and powell seemed determined to snuff out any sense of a pivot by subtly changing his message the pace of rate rises was important while the fed was trying to catch up after its horrible error of thinking inflation was transitory powell effectively said but now you need to stop worrying how quickly we are raising rates and start focusing on how high we ultimately need to take them and how long they will need to stay there the question of when to moderate the pace of increases is now much less important than the question of how high to raise rates and how long to keep monetary policy restrictive powell justifiably said this was not a new message and the fed s past two statements had made it clear slower rate rises would eventually be required he said this slowing down would be considered as soon as the next meeting or the one after that but that underplays the hawkishness of his message during the press conference powell is seeing no signs that the rate rises he s pushed through have dented inflation and no signs of any real weakness in labour markets he described as overheated advertisement us rates will peak higher than expected although powell repeatedly acknowledged the pain that rate rises would cause on main streets of america the risk of stopping now before inflation has really even started to fall would be a mistake in one particularly startling moment of the press conference powell declared that the fed had the tool presumably rate cuts and quantitative easing to deal with the problems that might be caused if it overtightens and causes a deep economic slowdown which is surely clear evidence of powell s bias here steve chiavarone senior portfolio manager at federated hermes described powell s message as a devil s bargain for markets size of rate hikes will likely fall but terminal rate is likely higher the implication is a greater number of smaller rate hikes that is not dovish the question economists will have to work out now is whether their projections of the terminal rate need to go higher advertisement before the fed s decision on wednesday the market was expecting the fed would eventually take rates as high as 4 95 per cent after powell s press conference bond markets were inferring the terminal rate could be 5 1 per cent powell was asked whether interest rates would need to get above inflation to bring that latter down and danced around the question the fed wants real rates that is rates adjusted for inflation to be positive at some point but that was not powell s single and only touchstone it feels like 5 per cent is now a reasonable working estimate of the terminal rate but as powell suggested today the other question investors need to consider is how long rates might need to stay at that level to get inflation down towards the fed s 2 per cent target over the medium term based on powell s press conference are economists hoping for fed rate cuts late in 2023 likely to be proved wrong that s a question that will be hotly debated in the coming weeks for now though investors would do well to focus on what s actually happened in the past eight months and what that means for their portfolios the fed has now taken official rates from zero at the start of march to 3 75 per cent with blistering speed there have only been five 0 75 per cent rate hikes in the past 30 years and four of them have occurred in 2022 the impact of this is not showing up yet not in the labour market not in consumer spending and not in corporate earnings which have remained robust as companies have maintained profit margins near historic highs advertisement but as powell has made clear interest rates have a ways to go and robert almeida portfolio manager and global investment strategist and boston based mutual fund giant mfs investment management says that has real implications for investors already nursing serious losses what s clear is that central banks must continue raising the cost of capital that will be done not only through hiking policy rates but also by balance sheet reduction aggregate demand is too high and can only be reduced by squeezing out the market inefficiencies built up over the last decade the pain for company earnings is not behind us but ahead of us and given powell seems determined to raise rates higher than even he previously expected in the coming months almeida argues investors need to be watchful for companies whose margins and even business models could start to crack the all time high profit margins achieved in 2018 were eclipsed in 2022 due to covid era stimulus and the use of greater levels of financial leverage now growth and revenues are fading but the costs of labour and debt are rising combined with forced capital investment in greener technologies profit margin expectations will need to be reset in the process weak companies will be exposed and above average profit margins will no longer be abundant but scarce we think that scarcity will inflate the value compounders and reward the skilled and patient investor

karowe mine of qualities that can directly enter the manufacturing stream are being sold to hb at prices based on the estimated polished outcome of each diamond the estimated polished value is determined through state of the art scanning and planning technology with an adjusted amount payable on actual achieved polished sales less a fee and the cost of manufacturing following the extension of the hb agreement in 2021 all 10 8 carat non gem quality diamonds and all diamonds less than 10 8 carats in weight which did not meet the criteria for sale on clara are being sold as rough through the quarterly tender in the agreement extension payment terms were amended to better reflect the timing of mine production and the manufacturing process this unique pricing mechanism delivers regular cash flow for this important segment of our production profile for the three months ended september 30 2022 the company recorded revenue of 27 1 million from the hb agreement inclusive of top up payments of 9 0 million as compared to revenue of 50 5 million in q3 2021 inclusive of top up payments of 2 7 million the decrease in revenue in q3 2022 versus the comparative quarter can be attributed primarily to the number of high value diamonds delivered to hb in q3 2021 four pink diamonds and two type iia top white gem diamonds 393 5 carats and 257 5 carats for which an initial mpv payment was received in q3 2021 in addition more carats were delivered to hb in the comparative quarter 6 258 carats vs 2 412 carats despite the overall decrease in revenue recognized in q3 2022 diamond market fundamentals continued to support healthy prices as steady demand and some inventory shortages were reported natural variability in the quality profile of the 10 8ct production in any production period or fiscal quarter results in fluctuations in recorded revenue and associated top ups between periods is expected during q3 2022 7 1 weight percentage specials of total carats recovered was consistent with the karowe resource model as a result of the sales agreement with hb the company also participated in polished diamond price increases during q3 2022 as rough diamonds sold to hb in previous quarters were polished and sold in q3 2022 estimated top up payments of 9 0 million q3 2021 2 7 million were included in revenue for the quarter at september 30 2022 a number of higher value and more technically complex stones that take longer to manufacture had not fully completed the manufacturing and sales process these stones were delivered to hb in 2021 and the first nine months of 2022 as these stones finish the manufacturing process and are sold the company may record additional revenue in the form of top up payments from these sales clara sales platform clara lucara s 100 owned proprietary secure web based digital sales platform continues to gain scale and interest interest in clara continues to grow as the benefits of purchasing rough diamonds in an innovative way become evident in q3 2022 four sales q3 2021 four sales took place with a total sales volume transacted of 8 3 million a 26 increase from the 6 6 million transacted in q3 2021 as karowe goods were supplemented by growth in supply from additional sources the number of buyers on the platform remained stable during the quarter with the company maintaining a waiting list to manage supply and demand additional supply is required to meet existing demand and drive the platform s growth and the company continued trial sales on the clara platform with a third party producer in q3 2022 the company intends to continue to seek additional supply in 2022 both from third party producers and the secondary market karowe underground expansion update the karowe ugp is expected to extend the mine life to at least 2040 with initial underground carat production predominantly from the highest value em pk s unit and is forecast to contribute approximately 4 billion in additional revenues using conservative diamond prices the updated estimated capital cost for the karowe ugp is 547 million including contingency and reflects expected pricing changes following execution of the main sink contract in q2 2022 mine ramp up is expected in 2026 with full production from the karowe ugp expected in h2 2026 the company is using a combination of cash flow from operations and project debt for the investment in the karowe ugp which is fully financed during the three months ended september 30 2022 a total of 23 9 million was spent on the karowe ugp development primarily in relation to ongoing construction activities and procurement of long lead items including main sinking of the production shaft commenced at the end of september while main sinking in the ventilation shaft continued as main sinking activity ramped up in the ventilation shaft during the third quarter several operational issues arose resulting in sinking rates achieving less than plan due to longer cycle times in response to the operational challenges and longer duration cycle times changes and mitigations were actioned during the quarter observed cycle times and sinking rates are improving the start of main sink activity in the production shaft was delayed due to longer than planned commissioning of the winders and hoisting plant cycle times are now improving procurement of shaft station underground mobile equipment progressed with equipment deliveries expected to commence in q4 2022 and q1 2023 the letlhakane and karowe substation construction continued with focus on civil work and cable pulling for control equipment installation the transmission line towers were equipped with stringing hardware and safety nets were installed over existing line crossings activities for the karowe ugp in the fourth quarter of 2022 are expected to include the following sinking within both the ventilation and production shafts procurement of underground equipment including awarding the bulk air cooler tender continuation of detailed design and engineering of the underground mine infrastructure and layout commissioning the 29 km 132kv bulk power supply powerline diamond market after a strong start to the third quarter of 2022 diamond price softening was observed in late august and into september however solid market fundamentals continue to support diamond prices despite growing concerns of a global economic slowdown high levels of reported inflation persisted and governments responded with increasingly forceful measures in attempts to reduce it to sustainable levels a cautious economic outlook combined with the uncertainty caused by geopolitical events including the ongoing conflict in ukraine and continuing implications of the covid 19 pandemic specifically in china where the demand for diamonds has not yet recovered remain a risk to diamond pricing trends in the short term with demand from the us a critical driver on prices of both rough and polished diamonds the longer term market fundamentals remain unchanged and positive however pointing to strong price growth over the next few years as demand is expected to outstrip future supply the benefits of the committed sales agreement with hb continued to be realized during the third quarter of 2022 as the company participated in the upside to manufacturing polished diamonds for goods delivered in previous quarters the integrated approach using state of the art scanning and planning technology has further enhanced the final achieved polished outcome for very large 50 carat polished and high

on wednesday the united states federal reserve raised interest rates again making it the fourth straight increase of 0 75 in a bid to combat inflation in the country which remains at a four decade high in a statement the central bank said inflation remains elevated reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic higher food and energy prices and broader price pressures while reiterating its commitment to returning inflation to its 2 objective this comes after the two day meeting of the federal open market committee fomc the interest rate affects the cost of borrowing and investment in the economy which the federal reserve has been increasing since march in a bid to slow the economy down and bring down the soaring inflation in the country this rate hike marks the central bank s sixth consecutive increase just this year also read us federal reserve hikes interest rates to highest level since 2008 the policy decision set the target federal funds rate in a range between 3 75 4 which is the highest since 2008 the fed s policy tightening has sparked a debate about its impact on the us and world economies additionally many fear that any further hikes could stress the financial system or even trigger a recession ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate said the fomc indicating that they are highly attentive to the risks inflation poses which means that there could be further hikes in the future this comes as the rate of inflation is at least triple the central bank s target which has led them to increase rates marking the fastest rounds of increase since the 1980s fed chairman powell chances of soft landing for economy have narrowed federal reserve board chairman jerome powell addressed a news conference after the closing of the two day meeting and said that the ultimate level of the central bank s benchmark policy rate is higher than previously anticipated furthermore chances for the so called soft landing for the economy have narrowed but are still possible said powell while investors have supposedly been speculating about the 75 basis point rate hike they had been anticipating a decrease in the rate hikes after its meeting in december after the speech us stocks reportedly went volatile with dow falling more than 500 points s p 500 sinking by 2 5 and the nasdaq composite fell 3 4 as of wednesday reported cnn with inputs from agencies watch wion live here

washington ap the federal reserve pumped up its benchmark interest rate wednesday by three quarters of a point for a fourth straight time to fight high inflation but also hinted that it could soon reduce the size of its rate hikes the fed s move boosted its key short term rate to a range of 3 75 to 4 its highest level in 15 years it was the central bank s sixth rate hike this year a streak that has made mortgages and other consumer and business loans increasingly expensive and heightened the risk of a recession in a statement after its latest meeting the fed said that in coming months it would consider the cumulative impact of its large rate hikes on the economy it noted that rate increases take time to fully affect growth and inflation the fed s meeting occurred as financial markets and many economists have grown nervous that chair jerome powell will end up leading the central bank to raise borrowing costs higher than needed to tame inflation and will cause a painful recession in the process powell implicitly addressed those fears at a news conference while stressing that the fed would keep raising rates possibly even higher than it had forecast in september he left the door open to downshifting to a half point hike when it next meets in december the fed could then step down even further to a quarter point increase a more typically sized rate hike early next year at some point he said it will become appropriate to slow the pace of increases so that time is coming and it may come as soon as the next meeting or the one after that no decision has been made powell appeared to be trying to strike a delicate balance in suggesting both that fed may start downsizing its rate increases yet remains focused on defeating inflation and raising rates as high as necessary we think we have a ways to go to cool inflation he suggested the persistence of inflated prices and higher borrowing costs is pressuring american households and has undercut the ability of democrats to campaign on the health of the job market as they try to keep control of congress republican candidates have hammered democrats on the punishing impact of inflation in the run up to the midterm elections that will end tuesday stock and bond prices which had risen immediately after the fed issued its policy statement fell into negative territory after powell made clear at his news conference that the central bank remained committed to steadily tightening credit to a level that will weaken the economy the fed chair pointedly stressed that it would be very premature to think about halting the rate hikes to allow time to see how well they are working inflation pressures he said remain far too high chair powell stuck to this two pronged message we re not done yet due to high inflation and a strong commitment to bring it down sal guatieri senior economist at bmo capital markets economics wrote in a note but we may not need to keep cranking rates aggressively due to an economy that has slowed significantly from last year and long term inflation expectations that are still well anchored typically the fed raises rates in quarter point increments but after having miscalculated in downplaying inflation last year as likely transitory powell has led the fed to raise rates aggressively to try to slow borrowing and spending and ease price pressures wednesday s rate increase coincided with growing concerns that the fed may tighten credit so much as to derail the economy the government has reported that the economy grew last quarter and employers are still hiring at a solid pace but the housing market has cratered and consumers are barely increasing their spending the average rate on a 30 year fixed mortgage just 3 14 a year ago surpassed 7 last week mortgage buyer freddie mac reported sales of existing homes have dropped for eight straight months several fed officials have said recently that they have yet to see meaningful progress in their fight against rising costs inflation rose 8 2 in september from 12 months earlier just below the highest rate in 40 years still the policymakers may feel they can soon slow the pace of their rate hikes because some early signs suggest that inflation could start declining in 2023 consumer spending squeezed by high prices and costlier loans is barely growing supply chain snarls are easing which means fewer shortages of goods and parts wage growth is plateauing which if followed by declines would reduce inflationary pressures yet the job market remains consistently strong which could make it harder for the fed to cool the economy and curb inflation this week the government reported that companies posted more job openings in september than in august there are now 1 9 available jobs for each unemployed worker an unusually large supply a ratio that high means that employers will likely continue to raise pay to attract and keep workers those higher labor costs are often passed on to customers in the form of higher prices thereby fueling more inflation outside the united states many other major central banks are also rapidly raising rates to try to cool inflation levels that are even higher than in the u s last week the european central bank announced its second consecutive jumbo rate hike increasing rates at the fastest pace in the euro currency s history to try to curb inflation that soared to a record 10 7 last month likewise the bank of england is expected to raise rates thursday to try to ease consumer prices which have risen at their fastest pace in 40 years to 10 1 in september even as they raise rates to combat inflation both europe and the u k appear to be sliding toward recession this story is by christopher rugaber associated press economics writer

conference after the end of the central bank s latest policy meeting said he wanted no confusion on that point even if policymakers do scale back future increases he said they were still undecided about just how high rates would need to rise to curb inflation and were determined to stay the course until the job s done regardless of how fast the fed moves there s some ground to cover for the target federal funds rate to reach a sufficiently restrictive level that will slow inflation powell said the final destination is very uncertain we re going to find it over time the question of when to moderate the pace of increases is much less important than the question of how high and how long to keep monetary policy restrictive he said adding that it was very premature to discuss when the fed might pause its increases major u s stock indices spiked after the release of the fed s statement which promised to take economic risks more clearly into account in deciding the size of any further rate increases but erased those gains as powell spoke and ended the day sharply lower the s p 500 index fell 2 5 and the nasdaq composite slid more than 3 top stories get the latest headlines

now chief economist at the bank policy institute said ahead of powell s news conference that the fed s policy statement appeared to set the central bank up for more rate hikes before its tightening cycle is completed delivered at a possibly slower pace the document implied that the fed may be aiming for a higher medium term level for the fed funds rate than currently expected nelson said no decision has been made investors were expecting a signal the fed might ease up on its pace of tightening after a blistering run that raised the policy rate from near zero in march to what is now a range of between 3 75 and 4 00 the fastest monetary tightening since the early 1980s the pace of the rate hikes has triggered global anxiety the fed was dragging the world economy towards a point of

any future decisions ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate the central bank s policy setting federal open market committee said at the end of its two day meeting but in determining the pace of future increases in the target range the committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation and economic and financial developments the time to reassess the pace of increases is coming powell said it may come as soon as the next meeting or the one after that no decision has been made the language in the policy statement acknowledged the broad debate that has emerged around the fed s policy tightening and opened a new stage in that discussion while the rapid increases this year have been done in the name of moving expeditiously to catch up with inflation running at more than three times the fed s 2 target the central bank is now entering a more nuanced phase fine tuning

fomc statement took me a little by surprise said derek tang an economist with forecasting firm lh meyer the fed s statement was a lot more definite about a possible downshift than i thought it would be i thought powell would reserve a lot more judgment until december but it seems like the committee did reach a consensus that they could downshift as early as december depending on how the data go

2 million for third quarter 2021 declared dividend of 0 905 per share for third quarter 2022 representing a 7 7 increase over third quarter 2021 distribution for third quarter 2022 enviva delivered financial and operating results in line with the expectations we outlined on our last earnings call we are also thankful that our people and assets navigated hurricane ian safely with the financial impact limited to the deferral of around 3 million of adjusted ebitda from third quarter to fourth quarter due to the modest ship loading delays we experienced as a result of the storm at quarter end said john keppler chairman and chief executive officer this solid foundation gives us additional confidence in the step up we expect for the second half of 2022 and we believe we are well positioned to deliver full year financial performance in line with our guidance as demonstrated this quarter we continue to benefit from a very constructive pricing environment for wood pellets both for the near term and for long term contracted deliveries achieving an adjusted gross margin per metric ton of 60 this quarter with the continued expectation of further improvements for fourth quarter 2022 third

please see the non gaap financial measures section below please refer to the non gaap financial measures section below for a description of recast and non recast presentations the recast presentation was required for gaap purposes due to the simplification transaction announced on october 15 2021 net revenue for third quarter 2022 was 325 7 million compared to 237 8 million and 237 4 million for third quarter 2021 on a recast and non recast basis respectively the increase of approximately 37 year over year was driven primarily by an increase in average sales price per ton as a result of annual price escalators in our contracts as well as the elevated pricing environment for biomass enviva was able to help address dislocations in our customers and other producers supply chains during third quarter 2022 which enabled incremental deliveries at elevated spot pricing net revenue for third quarter 2022 was dampened slightly given the timing shift of three shipments from september to october due to weather delays related to hurricane ian which also drove higher than average finished product inventory at the end of the period adjusted gross margin was 75 4 million for third quarter 2022 compared to 34 4 million and 56 7 million for third quarter 2021 on a recast and non recast basis respectively adjusted gross margin per mt agm mt for third quarter 2022 was 59 99 as compared to 29 36 and 48 38 for third quarter 2021 on a recast and non recast basis respectively the year over year increase in adjusted gross margin and agm mt was primarily driven by higher pricing due to the same factors which benefited net revenue during the period adjusted ebitda for third quarter 2022 was 60 6 million as compared to 14 2 million and 62 9 million for third quarter 2021 on a recast and non recast basis respectively adjusted ebitda for third quarter 2022 was dampened slightly given the timing shift of three shipments from september to october due to weather delays related to hurricane ian the shift of roughly 3 million of adjusted ebitda is reflected in our fourth quarter 2022 expectations distributable cash flow dcf for third quarter 2022 was 36 3 million as compared to distributable cash outflow of 3 6 million and dcf of 49 5 million for the third quarter of 2021 on a recast and non recast basis respectively enviva s liquidity as of september 30 2022 which included

below similar to what was described in enviva s most recent financial update on october 3 2022 we expect fourth quarter 2022 adjusted ebitda to be approximately 113 million at the midpoint of our guidance range representing over 40 of full year 2022 adjusted ebitda the second half of the year is traditionally enviva s seasonally strongest period as higher plant productivity is achieved through drier warmer weather and increased asset utilization and throughput rates additionally the production ramp for enviva s newest wood pellet production plant in lucedale mississippi continues to progress in line with expectations and as a result we are increasing shipments and asset utilization at enviva s new deep water marine terminal in pascagoula mississippi as a result agm mt for fourth quarter 2022 is projected to be approximately 75 00 we are increasingly benefiting from i cost improvements ii improved pricing including new higher priced contracts and select repricing of legacy contracts iii contract escalators for 2021 inflation now fully embedded in sales prices and iv fixed cost absorption resulting from increased volumes sold enviva s contracts are predominantly denominated in u s dollars enviva narrowed its capital expenditures guidance range for full year 2022 to 255 million to 265 million from 255 million to 275 million both ranges inclusive of capitalized interest enviva continues to expect to build new plants at a project level return of an approximately 5 times adjusted ebitda investment multiple productivity improvements across our manufacturing facilities including debottlenecking asset utilization increases and the capacity expansions we have underway are resulting in production rates that we expect to translate to over 6 million tons next year and when combined with our improving supply chain conditions and the constructive pricing environment particularly in europe are expected to not only provide modest opportunities in fourth quarter 2022 to drive incremental margin and cash flow but also set the stage for substantial growth in 2023 and beyond said thomas meth president we are projecting meaningful year over year step changes in the cash flow generation of our asset base as we bring new fully contracted capacity online in a favorable pricing environment for our products going forward our capital allocation policy is focused on reinvesting retained cash flows into our business while maintaining ample liquidity conservative leverage and preserving a stable dividend that has the opportunity to grow over time for 2023 based on our preliminary outlook we are projecting an adjusted ebitda range of 305 million to 335 million which would cover our current stable dividend of 3 62 per share at 1 1 times at the midpoint of this range said shai even chief financial officer we expect to come back early in the new year with fulsome 2023 guidance as we complete our budget cycle and refine our shipping schedules with our customers and describe how the year over year incremental cash flow we expect continues to map both our transition to a self funding model for growth as well as our progression to a dividend coverage ratio of 1 5 times by 2025 consistent with what we have outlined previously contracting and market update in the current geopolitical environment customers purchasing decisions are being driven by both the urgent need to decarbonize their supply chains while seeking to secure reliable affordable low carbon feedstocks over the long term countries and companies are not only facing high and volatile fossil fuel prices while they navigate toward net zero goals but they are also revising the long term security of supply for the carbon feedstocks they are sourcing this congruence creates an increased ability to pay for our customers but is further complicated by the fact that there are limited large scale alternatives available for renewable base load and dispatchable power and heat generation and even fewer low carbon feedstocks to substitute in hard to abate sectors as a result our current customers are increasingly looking for supply in a structurally short market and are willing and able to collaborate with suppliers like enviva to develop mutually beneficial solutions including pricing new contracted volumes at terms more reflective of the current pricing environment in which pricing for prompt delivery of biomass has more than doubled in the past year and also at times repricing original contracted volumes at a significant premium to our historical weighted average contract prices in consideration of the overall transaction consistent with the strategy we have outlined enviva continues to steadily diversify its customer base not only by the number of companies served but also the geographies in which they are located and the industries in which they operate as of october 1 2022 enviva s total weighted average remaining term of take or pay off take contracts is over 14 years with a total contracted revenue backlog of over 21 billion this contracted revenue backlog is complemented by a customer sales pipeline exceeding 50 billion which includes contracts in various stages of negotiation our customer sales pipeline comprises long term take or pay off take opportunities in our traditional markets for biomass fired power and heat generation in geographies ranging from the united kingdom to the european union including opportunities in germany and poland to asia including incremental demand in japan and emerging potential in taiwan as well as in developing industrial segments across the globe including steel cement lime chemicals sustainable aviation fuel saf biomethanol and biodiesel we are also negotiating long term wood pellet supply contracts with several industrial companies in each of these hard to abate sectors that are actively and urgently pursing large scale decarbonization us inflation reduction act on august 16 2022 the united states enacted the inflation reduction act of 2022 ira which represents one of the most progressive financial commitments in u s history to tackle global warming the ira directs approximately 370 billion for energy security and climate change resources utilizing investments and tax credits to incentivize wind solar and other renewable power sources such as sustainably sourced biomass specific to bioenergy the ira strengthens the u s commitment to saf by providing tax credits for every gallon of qualifying saf produced in the u s based on lifecycle greenhouse gas emission reduction percentages further the ira extends and modifies the tax credit for the production of renewable energy from biomass and other technologies the legislation also enhances tax credits for bioenergy with carbon capture use and storage beccs at both industrial facilities and power plants in the u s historically enviva s business has been export driven with a limited domestic customer base recently we signed our first contract with a u s based saf producer and we are encouraged by the actions taken by congress and the white house and the potential for a significant domestic market for sustainable biomass for saf production and for utilization in potentially negative emissions beccs projects european union renewable energy directive update since 2009 european union policymakers have recognized that sustainable biomass is a vital renewable energy source which can provide dispatchable heat and power high temperature heat and transport fuel today bioenergy accounts for almost 60 of renewable energy used in europe providing a reliable source of energy during an unprecedented global energy crisis and supporting continued transition of the eu towards climate neutrality by 2050 as part of a package of measures designed to help the eu bloc reach its goals of reducing emissions by 55 by 2030 and achieving climate neutrality by 2050 the eu is updating the renewable energy directive red iii which includes revising its woody biomass sustainability criteria trilogues a negotiation among the eu parliament eu council of ministers council and eu commission have already started for red iii with the talks expected to conclude by the end of the year or in the first half of 2023 all three institutions have agreed positions which continue to treat sustainable woody biomass as renewable and keep the sustainability framework from redii largely intact a position that the parliament s lead negotiator markus pieper mep reiterated in a recent article that when it comes to biomass we want it to be considered as renewable energy as part of this process 550 scientists from across the world have issued a public letter to the presidents of the european commission parliament and council the scientist were unequivocal in stating wood from sustainably managed forests is co2 neutral and outlined the numerous climate benefits of woody biomass and sustainable forest management the letter highlighted the important role that woody biomass from sustainably managed forests can play in climate change mitigation delivering a fossil fuel free energy future and maintaining healthy forests this specifically includes imports of woody biomass sourced from sustainably managed forests in the u s southeast the views of these highly respected scientists align with enviva s mission and approach to limiting climate change and as the eu progresses its discussions on the red iii these expert perspectives based on science and deep expertise in forest management and ecology will help inform the policy debate surrounding the use of woody biomass in meeting the eu s climate targets japan japan s ministry of economics trade and industry is taking steps to phase out the country s more than 100 inefficient coal fired power plants with a combined capacity of roughly 25 gigawatts by 2030 the policy framework for this large scale initiative is currently being developed and could include financial compensation incentives and or a carbon tax this initiative is expected to drive biomass co firing demand at existing inefficient coal fired units japan is the world s second largest national market for utility grade wood pellets with expected demand of 5 1 million metric tons for 2022 according to forestry consulting firm hawkins wright japan s demand is currently less than that of the united kingdom but in excess of denmark s hawkins wright data further highlights that there are 17 large biopower plants currently in construction in japan these 17 plants represent significant incremental volumes as they include both biomass co firing with coal and full conversions of coal plants to dedicated biomass fired plants taiwan earlier this year the taiwan power company taipower taiwan s state owned electric company announced plans to convert a large coal fired unit of the hsinta power plant to biomass in order to meet the taiwanese government s policy objectives around increasing renewable energy generation the project is scheduled to produce approximately 3 000 gigawatt hours of renewable energy after 2025 which translates into demand for roughly 1 8 million mt of biomass annually given enviva s size scale and track record delivering into the asian market we expect to be an important partner in taipower s biomass supply chain international energy agency world energy outlook report 2022 last week the international energy agency iea issued its annual world energy outlook report highlighting that the world is facing its first global energy crisis spreading from natural gas oil coal and electricity to food security and climate it concluded that the world has not been investing enough in energy in recent years making it more vulnerable to the shocks seen this year they foresee that investment in renewable energy will be increasingly driven by energy security as well as climate change and called for a tripling in spending on clean energy and infrastructure by 2030 in order for the world to achieve net zero by 2050 of all renewable energy sources bioenergy and solar are expected to grow the most by 2030 with bioenergy supply expected to grow two and a half times by 2050 the report underlines that bioenergy will play a multifaceted role in reaching net zero with applications ranging from power and district heating through to industry and transport as well as playing an essential role in carbon dioxide removal sustainability update forests in the u s southeast are large and growing with only a small percentage harvested each year when a timberland owner makes the decision to harvest the products from each tract are generally merchandised into multiple markets from high value timber like dimensional lumber and other building products to low value pulp and bioenergy materials where customers like enviva typically provide the lowest revenue per ton enviva recently updated sustainability content on its website specifically related to our procurement of wood fiber as reported based on publication of data from of our track and trace t t program our industry leading supply chain transparency system enviva received on average only 35 of the harvested volume from tracts our merchandising percentage across our procurement areas for the second half of 2021 during this period our merchandising percentage was less than or equal to 30 for 59 of the harvested acres from which we procured wood and was greater than 70 for approximately 12 4 of such tracts harvested acres reasons for why we at times source a higher than average percentage of a harvest include hurricane damage multi stage harvesting and ecological or economic reasons that a harvest was predominantly pulpwood additionally for the second half of 2021 approximately 20 of the fiber we sourced was from secondary material e g sawdust shavings and other byproducts and approximately 18 of our wood was sourced from thinning activity healthy markets lead to healthy forests which continue to grow especially when the forest community is committed to ensuring forests remain forests a commitment enviva obtains from all its fiber suppliers enviva is proud to be a part of this vital community of forest stewards producing a steady stream of wood products used around the globe which supports forestland remaining as forest this community s collective decisions about planting trees for a range of products and markets have resulted in an increase in forest inventory in enviva s sourcing area of 21 since 2011 asset update enviva is progressing well through the early stages of our growth plan to more than double production capacity over the next four to five years from 6 2 million mtpy to approximately 13 million mtpy enviva s lucedale mississippi plant the first plant in our pascagoula cluster continues to ramp production and is on track to reach nameplate capacity of 750 000 mtpy by the end of this year in july 2022 we commenced construction of the fully contracted 1 1 million mtpy plant in epes alabama the second plant in our pascagoula cluster we also formally announced plans to build the third plant in our pascagoula cluster in bond mississippi subject to receiving the necessary permits our facility in bond will be our next state of the art manufacturing facility with capacity to produce more than one million mtpy of wood pellets and similar to the lucedale and epes plants will export from our terminal at the port of pascagoula our business model of fully contracting plants and expansions before commencing construction remains unchanged given the current pace of contracting with new and existing customers enviva is evaluating the timing of a fourth wood pellet production plant in our pascagoula cluster we continue to progress our analysis of site location options and anticipate making a decision around year end 2022 we also are in the process of securing sites in both georgia and south carolina and will continue the evaluation process in the coming months to determine which site is most suitable for a new greenfield project in our savannah cluster we recently appointed mark coscio as executive vice president and chief development officer to lead our corporate development and construction functions through enviva s next phase of significant growth mark brings extensive experience managing global engineering procurement and construction projects within the energy sector and is currently leading enviva s evaluation of potential partnerships with large north american engineering and construction organizations who share enviva s commitment to safety quality and environmental stewardship and have the expertise and teams to assist us with our program of large scale

supplemental information interest paid net of capitalized interest 48 689 29 362 non gaap financial measures in addition to presenting our financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap we use adjusted net income adjusted gross margin adjusted gross margin per metric ton adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda compound annual growth rate cagr and distributable cash flow to measure our financial performance in addition as a result of our simplification transaction we were required to recast our historical financial results in accordance with gaap accordingly any results presented on a non recast basis constitute a non gaap measure a reconciliation of adjusted gross margin per metric ton for the fourth quarter of 2022 to the closest gaap financial measure gross margin is not provided because gross margin expected to be generated is not available without unreasonable effort our adjusted ebitda preliminary outlook range for 2023 is based on an internal financial analysis and such estimates are based on numerous assumptions and are inherently uncertain and subject to significant business economic financial regulatory and competitive risks that could cause actual results and amounts to differ materially from such estimates a reconciliation of the estimated adjusted ebitda range for 2023 to the closest gaap financial measure net income loss is not provided because net income loss expected to be generated is not available without unreasonable effort in part because the amount of estimated incremental interest expense related to financing and depreciation is not available at this time adjusted net income loss we define adjusted net income loss as net income loss excluding acquisition and integration costs and other early retirement of debt obligation support payments and effects of covid 19 and the war in ukraine we believe that adjusted net income loss enhances investors ability to compare the past financial performance of our underlying operations with our current performance separate from certain items of gain or loss that we characterize as unrepresentative of our ongoing operations adjusted gross margin and adjusted gross margin per metric ton we define adjusted gross margin as gross margin excluding loss on disposal of assets equity based compensation and other expense depreciation and amortization changes in unrealized derivative instruments related to hedged items acquisition and integration costs and other support payments and effects of covid 19 and the war in ukraine we define adjusted gross margin per metric ton as adjusted gross margin per metric ton of wood pellets sold we believe adjusted gross margin and adjusted gross margin per metric ton are meaningful measures because they compare our revenue generating activities to our cost of goods sold for a view of profitability and performance on a total dollar and a per metric ton basis adjusted gross margin and adjusted gross margin per metric ton primarily will be affected by our ability to meet targeted production volumes and to control direct and indirect costs associated with procurement and delivery of wood fiber to our wood pellet production plants and our production and distribution of wood pellets adjusted ebitda we define adjusted ebitda as net income loss excluding depreciation and amortization

by our management and other users of our financial statements such as investors commercial banks and research analysts to assess the financial performance of our assets without regard to financing methods or capital structure distributable cash flow we define distributable cash flow as adjusted ebitda less cash income tax expenses interest expense net of amortization of debt issuance costs debt premium and original issue discounts and maintenance capital expenditures we use distributable cash flow as a performance metric to compare our cash generating performance from period to period and to compare the cash generating performance for specific periods to the cash dividends if any that are expected to be paid to our shareholders we do not rely on distributable cash flow as a liquidity measure 2021 non recast presentation the nine and three months ended september 30 2021 were calculated on a recast basis in accordance with gaap to reflect the consolidated performance of enviva and our former sponsor as if enviva had bought the former sponsor at inception instead of october 14 2021 the closing date of the simplification transaction in addition we are also presenting results for

basis and ii our consolidated performance calculated on a recast basis in accordance with gaap inclusive of the assets and operations acquired as part of the simplification transaction for the nine

performance because it reflects enviva s actual and historically reported performance on a stand alone basis through the closing date of the simplification transaction and performance on a

federal reserve officials signaled their aggressive campaign to curb inflation could be entering its final phase even as they delivered their fourth straight 75 basis point interest rate increase while central bankers said that ongoing increases will still likely be needed to bring rates to a level that are sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 over time they added fresh language to their statement after a two day meeting in washington the pace of future increases in borrowing costs would take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy the lag with which works and developments in the economy and finance they said the addition will spur speculation that chair jerome powell and colleagues will slow the pace of rate increases with many wall street economists anticipating they will downshift to a 50 basis point increase when they next gather in december in financial markets swaps traders cut the amount of pricing in for the december meeting and pushed where they see the peak rate for the cycle to below 5 from around 5 05 earlier wednesday yields on two year treasuries plunged while the s p 500 index rallied and the dollar index slid the new commentary by the federal open market committee comes amid still strong readings on inflation and jobs even as sectors like housing and manufacturing have slowed substantially the fed s unanimous decision lifted the target for the benchmark federal funds rate to a range of 3 75 to 4 its highest level since 2008 officials fighting to curb inflation running near a 40 year high gathered days before midterm us congressional elections in which anger over price pressures has been a dominant theme the outcome of the nov 8 vote could cost president joe biden s democrats control of congress and some prominent lawmakers in his party have started to publicly urge the fed to show restraint powell for his part has tried to keep the central bank out of the political fray officials as expected said they will continue to reduce their holdings of treasuries and mortgage backed securities as planned a pace amounting to about 1 1 trillion a year the higher rates go the harder the fed s job becomes having been criticized for missing the stubbornness of the inflation surge officials know that monetary policy works with a lag and that the tighter it becomes the more it not only slows inflation but economic growth and hiring too fed forecasts in september implied a 50 basis points move in december according to the median projection those projections showed rates reaching 4 4 this year and 4 6 next year before cuts in 2024 additional data no fresh estimates were released at this meeting and they won t be updated again until officials gather dec 13 14 when they will have two more months of data on employment and consumer inflation in hand economists surveyed by bloomberg late last month were looking for a 50 basis point increase in december but almost a third had penciled in a fifth 75 basis point hike they saw rates peaking at 5 next year investors saw a similar path pricing in financial futures markets earlier on wednesday was split between a 50 and 75 basis point increase in december with rates peaking slightly above 5 during 2023 the fed s most forceful tightening campaign since the 1980s is beginning to cool some parts of the economy particularly in housing but policymakers have yet to see meaningful progress on inflation nor has there been a significant loosening in the job market with unemployment in september matching a half century low of 3 5 employer demand for workers has also remained strong with 1 9 job vacancies for every unemployed person in america according to labor department data tuesday

which may vary significantly from those assumed therefore we can give no assurance that our future production volumes will be as estimated reserve information reserve engineering is a process of estimating underground accumulations of oil natural gas and ngls that cannot be measured in an exact way the accuracy of any reserve estimate depends on the quality of available data the interpretation of such data and price and cost assumptions made by reserve engineers in addition the results of drilling testing and production activities may justify revisions upward or downward of estimates that were made previously if significant such revisions would change the schedule of any further production and development drilling accordingly reserve estimates may differ significantly from the quantities of oil natural gas and ngls that are ultimately recovered in addition we use the term estimated ultimate recovery in this release which is not a measure of reserves prepared in accordance with sec guidelines or permitted to be included in sec filings these resource estimates are inherently more uncertain than estimates of reserves prepared in accordance with sec guidelines

as the situation intensifies throughout our lifetime how involved should humankind be in a crisis of our own making what role should the hand of nature play in its own regeneration the challenge is this in a world increasingly threatened by human driven climate change the fate of the natural world rests in the very hands of creatures who helped create it what we are now seeing within our state s largest forest is a conflict that will percolate well beyond the boundaries of hoosier national forest indeed the challenges now facing all of these people and organizations dedicated to serving the natural world will go far beyond indiana as the climate crisis worsens during so many times of the year they re burning these creatures the ovenbird the black and white warbler the hooded warbler the worm eating warbler these are birds that evolve nesting on the forest floor if they ve got their nestlings down in the forest floor in may june and they do some of these burns what do you think happens to the nestlings they re just fried alive stant said we find turtles that are scarred they can t outrun prescribed fire those species and many others stant said will be threatened in large numbers if the project goes through there are currently six federally listed and endangered species whose range includes hoosier national forest the indiana and gray bats are considered endangered while the northern long eared bat was listed as threatened in 2015 according to the usda three species of mussels are also endangered fanshell rough pigtoe and sheepnose what they need is deep forest deep hardwood forests of a variety of trees what they re doing here is trying to reduce this forest down to a much less diverse unnaturally less diverse forest type that really is what existed here after the pioneers cleared this area and did a lot of the logging burning to maintain it as is cleared ground to plow and planting crops said jeff stant who is the director of the indiana forest alliance critics disagree with the forest service s assertion that the project s goal of increasing the overall age diversity of the forest would help provide a proper habitat to species who need early successional habitat to thrive additional concerns have been raised that precious wildlife will face continued threats from the persistent burning proposed for more than a decade under the project the main thing that comes to mind is our water bars the main area the logging equipment goes on is called the skid road and then we would rehabilitate those roads with water bars to divert the water before erosion can happen and we d also seed and mulch those areas thornton said thornton who made the decision that there would be no need for revision in the houston south project has heard the water quality concerns from the public he said the forest service has a plan to implement management strategies to prevent erosion which include collaborations with their staff of hydrologists and biologists to monitor the sediment level in water the public has until nov 7 to provide input regarding the draft for that project many of the same groups who oppose the houston south project also oppose the buffalo springs project despite that admonishment the u s forest service recently announced a correction supplement or revision to the project s environmental assessment was not necessary the houston south vegetation management and restoration project based in a northwest corner of jackson county is a similar proposal to the buffalo springs project it would aim to burn as many as 12 300 acres and apply herbicide to more than 2 100 acres concerns over how forest service projects in hoosier national forest could affect water quality for people living closest to it were the focus of a recent federal ruling that is a huge supply in southern indiana which doesn t have these giant glacial outwash aquifers that are in the northern and central part of the state that people get their water here from said jeff stant who is the executive director of indiana forest alliance an indianapolis based non profit which works to protect forests across the state spread across three counties patoka lake makes up the second largest reservoir in indiana a source of drinking water for some 65 000 people critics fear the removal of thousands of acres of pine trees and the constant transportation of logging equipment in the area would clog the reservoir with excess sediment pollution that the project could potentially threaten water quality in nearby patoka lake has also been a massive point of contention for those opposing it that land is much more valuable for these other values water quality recreation endangered species climate moderation and carbon sequestration than it is for logging and commercial extraction mahler said those opposing the buffalo springs project think the forest service could reach out to private landowners in order to further their land management goals inside the hoosier national forest and leave public acres alone similarly a map from 2007 shows how much of the forest was privately owned around the time the 2006 plan went into effect areas in pink demonstrate land managed by private owners while areas in green show areas managed by the forest service a map provided to 13news by the forest service shows the bulk of hoosier national forest is already inaccessible that means when you look at hoosier national forest on some maps you re not necessarily looking at the total amount of land available to the public the hoosier national forest is already one of the most fragmented national forests in the country although the forest service manages 204 331 acres of the hoosier national forest the total acreage inside the purchase boundary is 646 949 acres fragmentation of the forest is yet another reason critics maintain the area identified by the federal government for the buffalo springs project should be left well alone has definitely increased since the 2006 forest plan has come online the forest plan for lack of a better word breaks up the forest into zones management areas where different things can happen so on half of the national forest silvicultural activities such as clear cutting are acceptable the management on the other half areas like the deam wilderness that we re also close to that s not going to happen thornton said thornton said the current plan restricts land management activities on public land by a certain volume which the u s forest service equates to acres in the last 10 years he said the forest service has used an average of 266 acres a year or 13 of the whole forest for commercial logging treatments but he acknowledges logging and burning practices have increased in the hoosier national forest since the 2006 forest plan everything that they re proposing now is based on the 2006 plan which is based on a planning rule which applied to all national forests that was written in 1982 so everything they re proposing for the hoosier national forest now is based on the planning rule that s 40 years old and the forest plan that s 16 years old even though they re required to have a new plan every 15 years mahler said we ve been asking for a plan that is responsive to changing circumstances changing public attitudes and that is what they refuse to give us because they are so wedded to the financial benefits of logging and burning the forest the national forest management act of 1976 mandates forest plans for national forests be revised at least every fifteen years because the current plan is from 2006 advocates say it is already out of compliance they maintain that the 2006 plan did not take proper considerations for how to properly manage forests amid an ongoing climate disaster at the crux of their dissent is the belief that the forest service is moving forward with the project within the guidelines of an outdated forest plan they were legally supposed to update years ago and which gives excessive permissions for logging and burning this does not mean they re bad people but it means they respond to perverse incentives that incentivize cutting down more and more highly valuable trees to maintain budgets so they can do all the other important work that the public expects them to do said andy mahler who lives near the forest and is affiliated with the save hoosier national forest group mahler founded the group heartwood and has been a forest activist for more than 20 years they maintain the forest service is operating within an archaic framework that profoundly and erroneously simplifies the makeup of a complex forest system and that the real reason the forest service is moving forward with the buffalo springs restoration project is because they want to auction off its most valuable trees for profit but several environmental advocacy groups including the indiana forest alliance sierra club protect our forest save hoosier national forest and the hoosier environmental council believe the forest service is making a mistake our forest is all pretty much the same age we call it even aged that s not good to have trees that are all the same age because they re all going to get old together which isn t a bad thing in some part of the forest but you want to have that diversity you want to have those younger trees coming on too thornton said they also aim to create larger age diversity between different tree species within the forest in order to provide for diversity in wildlife species according to the proposal the project would further a larger u s forest service initiative to sustain oak hickory ecosystems in the forest which they said are important to keep on the landscape as many wildlife species have evolved with it and depend on it i think the general public probably wants the forest to stay just like it is now forever and i agree it s beautiful thorton said but the forest service people the specialists are thinking 100 years down the road and what kind of stressors are happening to the forest now how can we set it up to be good for the next generation he will soon be tasked with signing off on what could be the most transformative project in the forest s history he believes failure to implement the buffalo springs restoration project in this specific part of the hoosier national forest would weaken it considerably over time u s forest service district ranger chris thornton is from tell city like heinrich he grew up exploring the wild thickets throughout southern indiana especially the area near lincoln s boyhood home forest service leaders maintain that burning cutting and spraying thousands of acres of mature trees is necessary to preserve the forest s overall health they say it will protect the wilderness near patoka lake in southern indiana from the impending stressors of climate change inside the heart of hoosier national forest the last truly wild place in indiana a deep chasm has formed between longtime area residents like heinrich environmental advocates and u s forest service managers over the proposed buffalo springs restoration project the more i ve learned about this project and the lack of information shared with local residents and landowners or any people that are interested in hoosier national forest the more involved i ve been able to get heinrich said heinrich read the notice baffled by the word restoration to him the project would destroy the land he loves or at best leave it unrecognizable for his young children the paper bore the u s forest service s insignia stamped next to the title the buffalo springs restoration project it was notice of their intent to log more than 5 000 acres of trees near the family s home lay down nineteen miles of road construction and turn 8 of 13 miles of horse trail into gravel log road in october 2021 though another piece of paper that could prove as transformative as the cherished deed arrived on heinrich s doorstep this sheepskin deed has within heinrich family lore held a revered place on the mantelpiece passed from son to daughter and so forth even landing briefly into the hands of governor eric holcomb in 2016 he declared no one in indiana had owned a piece of land longer than heinrich s family had held onto these woods our property has got some trees that are dated 250 years plus that saw the buffalo roam this area they saw all my generations of grandparents farm the land i as a child have hunted and played and enjoyed them heinrich said it was signed in 1811 the family s 93 acres of property in orange county bore witness to the happenings along the buffalo trace a trail carved by buffalo migrations years ago that eventually coalesced into the oregon trail few people can claim tangible evidence of some generational tie to this ancient land awash in white oak and shortleaf pine robbie heinrich can though in the form of a humble sheepskin deed made out to his 10th time great grandfather made dignified through the neat penmanship of james madison the fourth president of the united states a massive change happens along indiana s southern half almost a third of the way down the boot hills rise out from flattened cornfields the limestone juts up high where karsts carve down deep in a place where intense glacial forces formed a landscape well apart from the flattened ones indiana became known for and it s here where we get to one of the most contentious pieces of this whole conflict why environmentalists wonder would the federal government propose cutting large swaths of maturing trees even as scientists tout the role of old growth forests in combating climate change the buffalo springs conflict is percolating at an interesting time in the lives of these second generation maturing trees who arose from degraded farm land during a time when these trees have grown to the point they are considered mature forests just a few decades from being an old growth forest once more that the forest service has put forth a proposal to cut acres of them down gives them pause the forest service conducts surveys one year after a harvest and three years after a harvest to look for issues like that in whatever appropriate manner is available for that species thornton said anytime that we increase the light we definitely increase the chance that an invasive species could come into the area along with the species that we d like to have so that s a tradeoff to having the species that we need to have on those sites is having an invasive species thornton said it s a constant battle you know managing the good things that come after harvest and burning and then the invasive species that also come if you re not careful thornton said they have a duty to protect and prioritize trees that are native to indiana but with the logging and burning practices proposed under the buffalo springs project it s possible other non native species could infiltrate the understory and cause additional problems what you want to do is let nature figure out which trees are going to survive and which aren t this is an incredibly important area of indiana to do that because it s the only area where we have enough for us where you can actually let that play out what they re trying to do is manage every acre of forest here like it s a little garden and we want to determine the winners and losers when we don t know enough to know who the winners and losers are going to be the best policy you can pursue is leaving it be stant said prioritization of an oak hickory ecosystem is yet another point that makes environmentalists who are against the project bristle there s been a lot of research and there s winners and losers tree species wise from climate change thornton said with this project we tried to think about species that would do well thornton said the forest service had to consider mitigating the impacts of climate change in choosing to restore the forest to an oak hickory ecosystem and increasing its age diversity by removing mature trees their internal studies found beech and maple may have a harder time adapting to the stressors of climate change the forest service is trying to reclaim to a baseline a condition that was actually very beat up in the 1860s and 70s and 80s that s what they re trying to reclaim this forest to instead of what the natural forest condition was before european settlers got here which is more like 1740 1750 1760 this was a much more mixed hardwood forest than you see around you here stant said environmental groups want the forest service to move beyond that point of profound degradation which persisted throughout the 19th century to give these second generation trees a chance to grow to their fullest capacity we re all about having the diversity because we know from the past you never know what kind of pathogen or things are going to come through and cause problems for particular species so we want to have the biggest diversity that we can have but we want to have the right trees on the right sites so that they aren t as stressed as they are right now thornton said in the scoping letter for the project the forest service noted the project area is currently dominated by mature forests but the forest service believes that because many of the trees were planted at the same time the forest lacks the age diversity necessary for the survival of multiple species and that would create problems down the road as the forest ages at the same time you can restore old growth forest here 35 of the tracts they are going to log in here are between 100 and 132 years old that means according to biologists they re less than two decades away from becoming old growth forest again the consensus is old growth forests are where there hasn t been any disturbance for 80 years so that means if they go in and do all this selective management and thinning in these tracts or shelterwood cutting it ll be four generations before it returns again stant said if the buffalo springs restoration project goes through as proposed though opponents say indiana may not see another chance to foster these many mature trees into truly old growth forests within the state lines for several more generations then earlier this year president biden reiterated the importance of america s old growth forests in an executive order signed on earth day for the first time it mandated that the federal government take inventory of america s old growth forests because they are essential for capturing carbon greenhouse gas emissions from logging in u s forests are now comparable to the annual co2 emissions from u s coal burning and annual emissions from the building sector the letter cautioned protecting u s federal public forestlands from logging would not only reduce direct carbon emissions but would also increase annual drawdown of atmospheric co2 by 84 million tons per year scientists are increasingly finding old growth forest ecosystems are essential for capturing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere at the end of 2021 hundreds of climate and forests scientists sent a letter to congress warning that logging on u s forests emits 723 million tons of uncounted co2 in our atmosphere each year more than 10 times that of coal in the proposed buffalo springs project area many are more than 100 years old already they make up some of indiana s most mature trees and within a generation could have returned to old growth status many of the tallest trees we see today in hoosier national are second generation sprouted up after this time of deforestation the forest service didn t purchase the land until 1934 at the request of democratic indiana governor paul mcnutt who wished to create a national forest by 1899 indiana led the nation in lumber production in 1917 the image of a man cutting down a tree became enshrined on the official insignia of indiana a symbol which remains to this day within 20 years most of what would become forest service land contained small farms but as the great depression neared many farmers gave up on the depleted soil and moved elsewhere eventually the land in and around what we now call hoosier national forest was settled and used for agriculture plentiful high quality trees were chopped first black walnut tulip poplar black cherry later cuts removed every other marketable tree on the land and areas were often burned repeatedly to clear brush according to the usda between 1803 and 1820 surveyors recorded 7 289 of the trees in the southern hills were beech trees followed by white oak 5 051 sugar maple 3 685 hickory and black oak more than 98 different types of tree species were found in the southern hills according to that same study an analysis of field notes conducted by land surveyors and further analyzed by the historical landscapes laboratory out of indiana university show a variety of hardwoods dominated the hills of southern indiana around what is now the hoosier natioanl forest during those early years of deforestation as miles of trees were cleared to make way for farmland or roads the number of trees in the state fell from more than 19 500 000 acres in 1800 to 1 500 000 acres in 1900 according to a study from indiana university those many millions of acres of trees were decimated within a century european farming practices relied on heavy deforestation techniques to incorporate monocrops cornfields and soy rows throughout the state in the decade from 1810 to 1820 census records show the state s population boom from 24 000 people to 147 000 people meant the end for many millions of trees old growth trees the often knotted primordial types found among fogged up trails of washington s hoh rainforest or alongside paths shaded by looming redwoods in california were cut down in droves in indiana when the first european settlers arrived leveraging the federal government s policy of total war against native americans that allowed them to supplant indigenous farming practices which yielded an estimated four times the amount of crop onto their homeland for other environmental groups though an old growth forest hundreds of years old and freed from the disturbances of humankind for the first time in generations would represent the most resilient forest the theory is that done sparingly and intentionally clear cutting can mimic natural disturbances the strategy has been praised by the michigan department of natural resources the young forest project and the ruffed grouse society who believe managing early successional habitat is key to nurturing a variety of species the current forest plan challenges the forest service to maintain 4 12 of the desired area in young forest habitat the forest service s strategy then aims to increase acres of trees in the 0 9 age class to foster certain types of wildlife for the forest service the most resilient forest would be an age diverse one where oak hickory systems are given priority because they make up the original ecosystem of indiana every group involved in the current conflict over the buffalo springs project maintains they advocate for what s best for the overall health of the forest but their preferred management method what that looks like and how to get there depends largely on what type of forest they believe should be restored over hundreds of years the very nature of the hoosier national forest has changed dramatically from its original state this transformation at the hands of settlers has created one of the thorniest points of contention between the federal government and environmentalists when it comes to its restoration tree species now inside hoosier national forest are not the ancient ones that bore witness to what happened on these lands prior to european colonization part ii a look at other forests one of the biggest misconceptions about illinois based environmentalist john wallace is that he once back in the early nineties chained himself to a tree in protest over an extensive logging project slated for the shawnee national forest not true he said it was a bike lock i used a u shaped bicycle lock i took a bicycle lock and put it around my neck and attached myself to a log skidder wallace said for 77 days in 1990 wallace and other activists used their bodies to challenge timber harvests in shawnee national forest one of the forests closest to hoosier national forest wallace was arrested twice but the group s efforts were ultimately successful a judge banned logging in shawnee national forest a ruling which stood for 17 years in 2013 though the forest service successfully sued to lift the injunction and logging inside shawnee national forest resumed wallace who taught environmental education at southern illinois university for decades grieved the decision they re saying the same things that they were saying back 30 years ago you know that we re doing this to help the forest and it s just there s nothing further from the truth to some people i believe that they feel they re doing truly what they think is right they just don t understand wallace said wallace believed then the underlying motivation for logging on the shawnee was not to sustain the health of the forest but to generate profit the problem is we have this agency that has this production mindset see the forest service and their mission is to be productive to have productivity out of our forests well that means resources are coming out of the forest wallace said over the years he s seen the controversy over logging on public lands play out in eastern forests like hoosier national and shawnee logging projects aren t prohibited inside national forests the same way they are on national parks but they tend to be massively unpopular in part because the forest service draws a profit by auctioning off those trees cut from public land i ll be the first to acknowledge a forest after it s clearcut doesn t look pretty thornton said logging within national forests is permitted because though trees in national forests make up double that of ones in national parks they are managed by different entities national parks think great smoky mountains yellowstone or zion are managed by the park service as part of the united states department of the interior their mission is to preserve unimpaired the natural and cultural resources and values of the national park system for the enjoyment education and inspiration of this and future generations national forests though are managed by the forest service a branch of the united states department of agriculture their mission statement is to sustain the health diversity and productivity of the nation s forests and grasslands to meet the needs of present and future generations the forest service operates under a multi use strategy considering all the uses of a forest equally including timber harvesting while the park service emphasizes preservation of all wildlife and species watch the difference between national forests national parks the park service has a preservation concept where they want to not do anything to the land and just let it go wherever it s gonna go as much as they can i mean the land s constantly changing no matter what we want it to do the forest service is more of a conservation organization where we want to be able to use some of the products from the land thornton said those differences in overall mission means we see tension over logging projects build inside national forests in ways we do not in national parks in 2019 an executive order issued by then president donald trump instructed the secretaries of agriculture and interior to consider harvesting 4 4 billion board feet of timber from forest land and put it up for sale at the time it sparked a national conversation about the integrity of trees in national forests but logging did not start with president trump regardless of who is in charge at the white house harvesting timber for profit has always been part of the forest service s objectives since its founding days the last thing forests were founded for was to provide a supply of wood to the industry so that s something that we seek to do as well that s not the primary purpose of the buffalo springs project you know it ll be a byproduct to that if i ever heard anybody doing something for financial gain or we re doing that to get more money out of this stand of trees i m not having that not at all thornton said but the hoosier national forest is not the only one within the central hardwood forest area which extends from northern indiana down to the top of alabama and georgia where the forest service is facing off against environmentalist groups and residents over land management projects that include logging inside two national forests closest to indiana wayne national forest in ohio and daniel boone national forest in southeastern kentucky environmentalist groups have taken the forest service to court over projects similar to buffalo springs complaints leveraged against the agency in both those lawsuits closely mirror those made by critics over the buffalo springs restoration project that the forest service did not properly consider environmental impacts before proceeding with the project and that they did not appropriately include public input in their decision making wayne national forest represents the largest swath of publicly held land in ohio it s ecology mirrors the hoosiers so much that they were essentially managed in tandem between 1942 and 1992 the ohio environmental council is challenging the u s forest service over a plan to clearcut thousands of acres of white oak from the forest nathan johnson is an attorney with the ohio environmental council as they now take the forest service to court over the sunny oaks project something he calls the largest timbering project in memory maybe ever for that forest in terms of the illegalities we re talking about an agency that has failed to address or even acknowledge some of the aspects or factors in this what it s going to mean for the oak ecosystem johnson said specifically the ohio environmental council argued the forest service failed to consider the impact clearcutting would have on mycorrhizal fungi close knit networks of fungi systems necessary for oaks to communicate and thrive one of the things that is occurring when one goes in and clear cuts an oak forest or an oak dominated forest is that most likely there s going to be destroying the fungal networks that oak trees rely on and those networks are probably going to be replaced by the sorts of fungal soils and networks that support competing ecosystems like maple tree and tulip tree ecosystems johnson said you go in and clear cut when you destroy the oak soils you re destroying part of the oak ecosystem and that s something that forest service has not acknowledged they really haven t wrestled with it they ve not accounted for it they ve not studied it in their environmental reviews and that s something that legally is a live issue their group is arguing that dynamic creates a situation that makes it harder for oak ecosystems the very kind they aim to restore thrive forest managers for wayne national forest did not comment pending upcoming litigation in daniel boone national forest the group kentucky heartwood has taken the forest service to court over the south red bird project in that project they claim the forest service did not take erosion into account and also ignored their own evidence that proved the project would increase landslides in the area when the forest service or their loggers come in and bulldoze these skid roads back and forth across the slopes remove most of the timber you lose a lot of what s holding those mountain sides together and so the forest service s really failed to acknowledge that said jim scheff an ecologist with the group kentucky heartwood like groups opposing the buffalo springs restoration project they reject the forest service s assertion that cultivating an age diverse forest would enhance its overall health over time they treat forests over 100 years old as just eminently susceptible to disease decline and death they treat them as if they re not growing anymore that they re not sequestering carbon anymore they re just going to die and if they don t do something now they don t intervene those trees are going to die and underneath is going to be all maples and it s going to be a maple desert with no acorns or hickory nuts for wildlife and it s this oversimplified narrative that s very self serving scheff said forest managers with the daniel boone national forest did not respond to 13news request for comment both organizations now involved in litigation against the forest service said they believe increased timber targets are part of the reason we re now seeing the largest proposals in the history of three national forests closest to indiana the agency really has its own culture of promoting narratives that just whatever the problem the answer is a chainsaw their answer is always logging scheff said data from the usda s periodic timber sale accomplishment reports show in the last 15 years from 2007 to 2021 timber targets for hoosier national forest increased overall in 10 of those 15 years the amount of timber harvested by the hoosier national forest exceeded their target goal hoosier national forest timber targets 2007 2021 those increases mirror what s happening in the hoosier national forest s overall region region 9 an administrative area which includes shawnee national forest and wayne national forest it does not include daniel boone national forest in 2007 668 668 62 ccf or hundred cubic feet had been harvested from the whole of region 9 by 2021 that number had jumped to 1 081 173 62 ccf thornton said the service could anticipate anywhere from 50 000 to half a million dollars depending on what they are and that the money could go back into the hoosier national forest for projects one of the big things and that s forgotten in the buffalo springs project is there s eight aquatic organism passages or culverts that are undersized that are inhibiting fish to get from one side to the other and so there s eight of those in this project that some of the timber sale receipts can be used to fix those culverts those are often several 100 000 projects that are hard to do without that money we re hoping to benefit the watershed by some of the money that stays here on the forest thornton said the recurring conflict over the logging projects has prompted some to advocate for national forests to be moved out of the usda s control and into the department of the interior through national park designation it s something wallace has advocated for in shawnee national forest the park service has a mission that revolves around preservation of the resource education and recreation and i think all three of those components serve the overwhelming majority of americans best wallace said the united states department of agriculture also does not contain a preservation of cultural or historical branch within their organization in the same way the park service does steven stewart is a longtime area resident and historian who mapped the historic buffalo trace which bears the name of the current project he believes the history in this area warrants protection on the level afforded by national parks and fears for the future of places like lick creek settlement one of the first black settlements in the state aside from a cemetery much of the remaining history of that settlement is hidden underneath the ground they ve assured me at all times these sites will be protected okay they say we know we re gonna save it don t worry but yet that s not what they say on paper that s not what they show us in these maps that s not what they show with their treatment plans stewart said dr ryan campbell is an archaeologist with the center for archaeological investigations at southern illinois university years ago his team helped lead research into the lick creek settlement a thriving community the work that we ve done at their farmsteads which there been a few of them that we ve looked at seems to show that they had material culture so like goods plates houses that were just as nice or nicer than their than their white counterparts in the area so they were living relatively successful lives as as farmers in orange county at the time campbell said his team proposed the lick creek settlement should get a historical preservation marker our recommendations to the forest service have always been especially in the lick creek area because of the importance of that community that they should protect those sites that there should be sites that are preserved and maintained for future generations and if at all possible put on the national register of historic places and just given an extra level of protection campbell said campbell s team did not offer guidance to the forest service on the buffalo springs restoration project but said in his experience working with them that they take those recommendations very seriously the forest service said a mandatory survey of every acre within the proposed buffalo springs project area is ongoing we don t want to ruin that history and there s no undo button if you do go through one of those sites you lose the context thornton said stewart said he mapped the area dozens of times and believes it s impossible for the forest service to properly preserve all the history in the area if they move forward with the burns and logging as planned the rich history of this area stewart said has been overlooked by outsiders and the state at large even as this sliver of southern indiana provides multiple opportunities for tourism he believes creating engagement around these historical sites could provide additional revenue streams to nearby communities preserving the history he said means preserving the land around it

cbs and its former president leslie moonves will pay 30 5 million as part of an agreement with the new york attorney general s office to compensate the network s shareholders as part of an insider trading investigation and for concealing sexual assault allegations against moonves los angeles ap as the former captain in charge of the hollywood division of the los angeles police department cory palka was a star himself the towering cop with a telegenic smile hobnobbed with celebrities getting stars on the walk of fame ran security for the oscars awards show and even landed a bit part playing himself on the television drama bosch about a talented but troubled maverick lapd detective but palka s ties to the entertainment industry and his allegiances were under scrutiny thursday after prosecutors said he leaked a sexual assault victim s confidential police report to the accused former cbs leader les moonves for whom palka served as a private bodyguard for years the lapd said it was conducting an internal affairs investigation into palka s conduct and the state attorney general was probing any criminal elements after a report said he conspired with cbs to conceal sexual assault allegations against moonves the report which didn t name palka was part of a settlement announced wednesday by new york attorney general letitia james in which cbs and moonves its former president agreed to pay 30 5 million about 6 million is going to sexual assault and harassment programs the rest will go to shareholders kept in the dark while executives tried to prevent allegations from becoming public and at least one benefited by unloading shares before news broke weeks after the metoo movement erupted with sex abuse allegations against film mogul harvey weinstein in 2017 phyllis golden gottlieb reported to police in the hollywood division that she had been sexually assaulted by moonves in 1986 and 1988 when they worked together at lorimar productions the studio behind dallas and knots landing a law enforcement official briefed on the matter confirmed that golden gottlieb who died this summer was the woman involved in the leak by palka the official was not authorized to speak publicly and did so on condition of anonymity jim gottlieb said in an email to the associated press that he was shocked and very disappointed that his mother s report was leaked to cbs he said his mother was never looking for money she just didn t want moonves to get away with what he did and was satisfied that her report contributed to his downfall we would like to think the police are looking out for us the victims and not the perpetrators gottlieb said this sounds just like what you hear about certain police departments being in cahoots with organized crime attorney gloria allred who represented golden gottlieb said in nearly a half century of legal practice she had never heard of police tipping off a suspect to an investigation and said it could have a chilling effect on other women coming forward to report abuse it s very very disturbing allred said it s really outrageous if they did that and i have to ask what were their motives if that in fact occurred why were they for example trying to curry favor with cbs did they receive anything in return golden gottlieb went public with her accusations at the time ronan farrow reported on allegations against moonves in the new yorker in september 2018 within hours of that publication moonves quit nearly a year earlier the ink was just drying on her police report which was marked confidential in three places when palka tipped off cbs the report said palka then met personally with moonves and another cbs executive the new york ag s report said the complainant had requested confidentiality it cited the california constitution which prohibits disclosure of confidential information to a defendant a defendant s attorney or any other person acting on behalf of the defendant that could be used to locate or harass the victim or the victim s family the captain told cbs that he instructed police officers investigating the complaint to admonish the woman not to go to the media with her allegations he also put cbs officials in touch with the lead investigator cbs immediately went into damage control mode with an executive alerting a member of the news staff to stay close to the phone because they have a situation he told another staffer not to miss any messages and added i wouldn t bother you if this wasn t serious when the allegations ultimately became public palka sent a note to a cbs contact saying we worked so hard to try to avoid this day he sent moonves a note saying he was sorry and i will always stand with by and pledge my allegiance to you from 2008 to 2014 palka had provided private security for moonves at the grammy awards which cbs produced jessica levinson a professor at loyola law school and former president of the los angeles ethics commission said a police officer has to adhere to legal and ethical obligations as a member of the force and can t violate those duties when providing private security typically those two roles wouldn t be in conflict the question is on a case by case basis as to whether or not it leads to divided loyalty levinson said but the truth is most of the time it really shouldn t be a tough call patti giggans executive director of the nonprofit peace over violence in los angeles said she expects the scandal to have repercussions that extend beyond victims being afraid to report assaults to the lapd to advocates reevaluating relationships they have built with detectives palka who retired as a commander last year after nearly 35 years with lapd said in his linkedin profile that he grew up with eight siblings in a low income housing project in the mar vista community and had spent most of his life in los angeles video footage of palka went viral during the racial injustice protests in los angeles in the aftermath of george floyd s death when he took a knee with protesters on sunset boulevard in hollywood he was incident commander at the academy awards and numerous high profile events related to the entertainment industry his profile said in hollywood he was a frequent fixture on red carpets and at walk of fame ceremonies posing with celebrities like lynda carter jack black and stacy keach he was personally thanked during mark hamill s star ceremony and posed with hamill harrison ford and george lucas the hollywood chamber community foundation s honored him in 2019 as one of the heroes of hollywood celebrity always equates to power and influence said attorney debra katz who specializes in sexual harassment law it becomes very troubling when you have a town of celebrities that have access to the police when they have a dual role where they provide security and they hobnob with one another palka did not return requests for comment thursday nor did an attorney for moonves and cbs moonves acknowledged having relations with three of his accusers but said they were consensual he denied attacking anyone saying in a statement at the time that untrue allegations from decades ago are now being made against me the los angeles county district attorney declined to file criminal charges against moonves in 2018 saying the statute of limitations from golden gottlieb s allegations had expired ___ associated press writer michael r sisak in new york contributed copyright 2024 the associated press all rights reserved this material may not be published broadcast written or

federal reserve chair jerome powell sought wednesday to strike a delicate balance at a moment when high inflation is bedeviling the nation s economy and commanding attention in the midterm elections powell suggested that the fed may decide in the coming months to slow its aggressive interest rate increases yet he also made clear that the fed isn t even close to declaring victory in its fight to curb an inflation rate that is near four decade highs and has shown few signs of ebbing when the fed ended its latest policy meeting wednesday it announced that it was pumping up its benchmark rate by a substantial three quarters of a point for a fourth straight time its key rate is now in a range of 3 75 to 4 the highest in 15 years related us diesel supplier warns businesses to prepare for shortages higher prices for consumers it was the central bank s sixth rate hike this year a streak that has made mortgages and other consumer and business loans increasingly expensive and heightened the risk of a recession the statement the fed issued wednesday suggested that it would begin to take a more deliberate approach to rate hikes likely leading to smaller increases in borrowing costs in the coming months in doing so it said it would consider that hikes take time to feed into the economy and achieve their goal of slowing inflation the financial markets initially cheered the notion that the fed might soon decide to slow its hikes with stock and bond prices surging higher yet as his news conference got under way powell struck a harder line he stressed that the central bank s policymakers have seen little progress in its efforts to control inflation and would likely have to send interest rates even higher than they thought they would at their last meeting in september we still have some ways to go powell said and incoming data since our last meeting suggests that the policymakers might have to raise rates higher than the 4 6 they forecast in september the fed chair pointedly emphasized that it would be very premature to think about halting the rate hikes inflation pressures he said remain far too high the abrupt shift in tone gave the financial markets whiplash stocks reversed their gains and tumbled into the close of trading the dow jones industrial average ended the day down 500 points or about 1 5 i think he accomplished his goal of striking hawkish and dovish notes said vince reinhart chief economist at dreyfus and mellon hawks generally prefer higher interest rates to fight inflation while doves often lean more toward lower rates to support hiring that s why the market was so confused the fed s meeting occurred as financial markets and many economists have grown nervous that powell will end up leading the central bank to raise borrowing costs higher than needed to tame inflation and will cause a painful recession in the process related prices on new used vehicles finally begin to creep down from inflated highs powell implicitly addressed those fears at his news conference he kept the door open to downshifting to a half point hike when the fed next meets in december the fed could then step down even further to a quarter point increase a more typically sized rate hike early next year at some point he said it will become appropriate to slow the pace of increases so that time is coming and it may come as soon as the next meeting or the one after that no decision has been made washington dc june 2 the eccles building location of the board of governors of the federal reserve system and of the federal open market committee june 2 2016 in washington dc photo by brooks kraft getty images expand at the same time powell said the job market remains strong which means businesses have to raise pay to keep workers raises that are often passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices this week the government reported that companies posted more job openings in september than in august there are now 1 9 available jobs for each unemployed worker an unusually large supply which also fuels bigger pay increases and adds to inflationary pressures overall powell said the fed has made little progress against inflation so far we think we have a ways to go we have some ground to cover with interest rates he continued before we get to that level of interest rates that we think is sufficiently restrictive the persistence of inflated prices and higher borrowing costs is pressuring american households and has undercut the ability of democrats to campaign on the health of the job market as they try to keep control of congress republican candidates have hammered democrats on the punishing impact of inflation in the run up to the midterm elections that will end tuesday chair powell stuck to this two pronged message we re not done yet due to high inflation and a strong commitment to bring it down sal guatieri senior economist at bmo capital markets economics wrote in a note but we may not need to keep cranking rates aggressively due to an economy that has slowed significantly from last year and long term inflation expectations that are still well anchored typically the fed raises rates in quarter point increments but after having miscalculated in downplaying inflation last year as likely transitory powell has led the fed to raise rates aggressively to try to slow borrowing and spending and ease price pressures the average rate on a 30 year fixed mortgage just 3 14 a year ago surpassed 7 last week mortgage buyer freddie mac reported sales of existing homes have dropped for eight straight months still policymakers may feel they can soon slow the pace of their rate hikes because some early signs suggest that inflation could start declining in 2023 consumer spending squeezed by high prices and costlier loans is barely growing supply chain snarls are easing which means fewer shortages of goods and parts wage growth is plateauing which if followed by declines would reduce inflationary pressures outside the united states many other major central banks are also rapidly raising rates to try to cool inflation levels that are even higher than in the u s last week the european central bank announced its second consecutive jumbo rate hike increasing rates at the fastest pace in the euro currency s history to try to curb inflation that soared to a record 10 7 last month likewise the bank of england is expected to raise rates thursday to try to ease consumer prices which have risen at their fastest pace in 40 years to 10 1 in september even as they raise rates to combat inflation both europe and the u k appear to be sliding toward recession

mortgage rates continue to jump home sales slump and credit cards and auto loans increase savings rates are slightly juicier though as the federal reserve steadily increases interest rates many economists say they fear that a recession remains inevitable in the coming months and with it job losses that could cause hardship for households already hurt worst by inflation on wednesday the federal reserve raised its key short term rate by three quarters of a point for a fourth straight time even as its previous rate increases are being felt by households at all income levels it was the fed s sixth rate hike this year the fed s latest move raised its benchmark rate to a range of 3 75 to 4 the highest level in 14 years its steady rate increases have already made it increasingly costly for consumers and businesses to borrow for homes autos and other purchases and more hikes are almost surely coming here s what to know how does raising interest rates reduce inflation if one definition of inflation is too much money chasing too few goods then by making it more expensive to borrow money the fed hopes to reduce the amount of money in circulation eventually lowering prices which consumers are most affected anyone borrowing money to make a large purchase such as a home car or large appliance will take a hit according to scott hoyt an analyst with moody s analytics the new rate pretty dramatically increases your monthly payments and your cost he said it also affects consumers who have a lot of credit card debt that will hit right away that said hoyt noted that household debt payments as a proportion of income remain relatively low though they have risen lately so even as borrowing rates steadily rise many households might not feel a much heavier debt burden immediately i m not sure interest rates are top of mind for most consumers right now hoyt said they seem more worried about groceries and what s going on at the gas pump rates can be something tricky for consumers to wrap their minds around how will this affect credit card rates even before the fed s latest decision credit card borrowing rates have reached their highest level since 1996 according to bankrate com and these will likely continue to rise and with inflation raging there are signs that americans are increasingly relying on credit cards to help maintain their spending total credit card balances have topped 900 billion according to the federal reserve a record high though that amount isn t adjusted for inflation john leer chief economist at morning consult a survey research firm said its polling suggests that more americans are spending down the savings they accumulated during the pandemic and are using credit instead eventually rising rates could make it harder for those households to pay off their debts those who don t qualify for low rate credit cards because of weak credit scores are already paying significantly higher interest on their balances and they ll continue to as rates have risen zero percent loans marketed as buy now pay later have also become popular with consumers yet longer term loans of more than four payments that these companies offer are subject to the same increased borrowing rates as credit cards for people who have home equity lines of credit or other variable interest debt rates will increase by roughly the same amount as the fed hike usually within one or two billing cycles that s because those rates are based in part on banks prime rate which follows the fed s what if i want to buy a car since the federal reserve began increasing rates in march the average new vehicle loan has gone up nearly 2 percentage points from 4 5 to 6 3 in october according to the edmunds com auto site used vehicle loans are up 1 5 to 9 6 for both new and used loan lengths have gotten slightly longer to just over 70 months on average key though is the monthly payment on which most people base their automobile purchases edmunds says that since march it s up 46 to 703 for new vehicles the payment is up 21 per month for used vehicles to 564 edmunds director of insights ivan drury says the increased payments probably won t make much of a difference in buying habits but they re hitting totals that could stop people from buying now that we re past 700 per month on new vehicles people will drop out of the market he said how are savers affected the rising returns on high yield savings accounts and certificates of deposit cds have put them at levels not seen since 2009 which means households may want to boost savings wherever possible you can also now earn more on bonds and other fixed income investments though savings cds and money market accounts don t typically track the fed s changes online banks and others that offer high yield savings accounts can be exceptions these institutions typically compete aggressively for depositors the catch they sometimes require significantly high deposits in general banks tend to capitalize on a higher rate environment to boost their profits by imposing higher rates on borrowers without necessarily offering juicer rates to savers will this affect rents homeownership file for sale sign seen outside of a home artur widak nurphoto via getty images last week the average fixed mortgage rate topped 7 its highest point in 14 years meaning that rates on home loans are about twice as expensive as they were a year ago mortgage rates don t always move perfectly in tandem with the fed increase instead tracking the expected yield on the 10 year treasury note the yield on the 10 year treasury note has reached 4 its highest level since 2011 sales of existing homes have declined for eight straight months as borrowing costs have become too high a hurdle for many americans already paying more for food gas and other necessities will it be easier to find a house if i m still looking to buy if you re financially able to proceed with a home purchase you re likely to have more options than at any time in the past year how have the rate hikes influenced crypto cryptocurrencies like bitcoin have dropped in value since the fed began raising rates so have many previously high valued technology stocks bitcoin has plunged from a peak of about 68 000 to under 20 000 higher rates mean that safe assets like treasuries have become more attractive to investors because their yields have increased that makes risky assets like technology stocks and cryptocurrencies less attractive in turn still bitcoin continues to suffer from problems separate from economic policy two major crypto firms have failed shaking the confidence of crypto investors what s prompting the rate increases the short answer inflation over the past year inflation has clocked in at a painful 8 2 so called core prices which exclude food and energy also rose faster than expected fed chair jerome powell warned last month that our responsibility to deliver price stability is unconditional a remark widely interpreted to mean the fed will fight inflation with rate increases even if it leads to deep job losses or a recession the goal is to slow consumer spending thereby reducing demand for homes cars and other goods and services eventually cooling the economy and lowering prices powell has acknowledged that aggressively raising interest rates would bring some pain what about my job some economists argue that widespread layoffs will be necessary to slow rising prices one argument is that a tight labor market is fueling wage growth and higher inflation in august the economy gained 315 000 jobs there are roughly two job openings advertised for every unemployed worker job openings continue to exceed job hires indicating employers are still struggling to fill vacancies said odeta kushi an economist with first american will this affect student loans borrowers who take out new private student loans should prepare to pay more as rates increase the current range for federal loans is between about 5 and 7 5 that said payments on federal student loans are suspended with zero interest until dec 31 as part of an emergency measure put in place early in the pandemic president joe biden has also announced some loan forgiveness of up to 10 000 for most borrowers and up to 20 000 for pell grant recipients is there a chance the rate hikes will be reversed stock prices rose in august based on hopes that the fed would reverse course but it looks increasingly unlikely that rates will come down anytime soon economists expect fed officials to signal additional increases in 2023 possibly to nearly 5 will there be a recession short term rates at these levels will make a recession likelier by increasing the cost of mortgages car loans and business loans while the fed hopes that higher borrowing costs will slow growth by cooling the hot job market and capping wage growth the risk is that the fed could weaken the economy causing a recession that would produce significant job

as estimated reserve information reserve engineering is a process of estimating underground accumulations of oil natural gas and ngls that cannot be measured in an exact way the accuracy of any reserve estimate depends on the quality of available data the interpretation of such data and price and cost assumptions made by reserve engineers in addition the results of drilling testing and production activities may justify revisions upward or downward of estimates that were made previously if significant such revisions would change the schedule of any further production and development drilling accordingly reserve estimates may differ significantly from the quantities of oil natural gas and ngls that are ultimately recovered in addition we use the term estimated ultimate recovery in

payment was received in q3 2021 in addition more carats were delivered to hb in the comparative quarter 6 258 carats vs 2 412 carats despite the overall decrease in revenue recognized in q3 2022 diamond market fundamentals continued to support healthy prices as steady demand and some inventory shortages were reported natural variability in the quality profile of the 10 8ct production in any production period or fiscal quarter results in fluctuations in recorded revenue and associated top ups between periods is expected during q3 2022 7 1 weight percentage specials of total carats recovered was consistent with the karowe resource model as a result of the sales agreement with hb the company also participated in polished diamond price increases during q3 2022 as rough diamonds sold to hb in previous quarters were polished and sold in q3 2022 estimated top up payments of 9 0 million q3 2021 2 7 million were included in revenue for the quarter at september 30 2022 a number of higher value and more technically complex stones that take longer to manufacture had not fully completed the manufacturing and sales process these stones were delivered to hb in 2021 and the first nine months of 2022 as these stones finish the manufacturing process and are sold the company may record additional revenue in the form of top up payments from these sales clara sales platform clara lucara s 100 owned proprietary secure web based digital sales platform continues to gain scale and interest interest in clara continues to grow as the benefits of purchasing rough diamonds in an innovative way become evident in q3 2022 four sales q3 2021 four sales took place with a total sales volume transacted of 8 3 million a 26 increase from the 6 6 million transacted in q3 2021 as karowe goods were supplemented by growth in supply from additional sources the number of buyers on the platform remained stable during the quarter with the company maintaining a waiting list to manage supply and demand additional supply is required to meet existing demand and drive the platform s growth and the company continued trial sales on the clara platform with a third party producer in q3 2022 the company intends to continue to seek additional supply in 2022 both from third party producers and the secondary market karowe underground expansion update the karowe ugp is expected to extend the mine life to at least 2040 with initial underground carat production predominantly from the highest value em pk s unit and is forecast to contribute approximately 4 billion in additional revenues using conservative diamond prices the updated estimated capital cost for the karowe ugp is 547 million including contingency and reflects expected pricing changes following execution of the main sink contract in q2 2022 mine ramp up is expected in 2026 with full production from the karowe ugp expected in h2 2026 the company is using a combination of cash flow from operations and project debt for the investment in the karowe ugp which is fully financed during the three months ended september 30 2022 a total of 23 9 million was spent on the karowe ugp development primarily in relation to ongoing construction activities and procurement of long lead items including main sinking of the production shaft commenced at the end of september while main sinking in the ventilation shaft continued as main sinking activity ramped up in the ventilation shaft during the third quarter several operational issues arose resulting in sinking rates achieving less than plan due to longer cycle times in response to the operational challenges and longer duration cycle times changes and mitigations were actioned during the quarter observed cycle times and sinking rates are improving the start of main sink activity in the production shaft was delayed due to longer than planned commissioning of the winders and hoisting plant cycle times are now improving procurement of shaft station underground mobile equipment progressed with equipment deliveries expected to commence in q4 2022 and q1 2023 the letlhakane and karowe substation construction continued with focus on civil work and cable pulling for control equipment installation the transmission line towers were equipped with stringing hardware and safety nets were installed over existing line crossings activities for the karowe ugp in the fourth quarter of 2022 are expected to include the following sinking within both the ventilation and production shafts procurement of underground equipment including awarding the bulk air cooler tender continuation of detailed design and engineering of the underground mine infrastructure and layout commissioning the 29 km 132kv bulk power supply powerline diamond market after a strong start to the third quarter of 2022 diamond price softening was observed in late august and into september however solid market fundamentals continue to support diamond prices despite growing concerns of a global economic slowdown high levels of reported inflation persisted and governments responded with increasingly forceful measures in attempts to reduce it to sustainable levels a cautious economic outlook combined with the uncertainty caused by geopolitical events including the ongoing conflict in ukraine and continuing implications of the covid 19 pandemic specifically in china where the demand for diamonds has not yet recovered remain a risk to diamond pricing trends in the short term with demand from the us a critical driver on prices of both rough and polished diamonds the longer term market fundamentals remain unchanged and positive however pointing to strong price growth over the next few years as demand is expected to outstrip future supply the benefits of the committed sales agreement with hb continued to be realized during the third quarter of 2022 as the company participated in the upside to manufacturing polished diamonds for goods delivered in previous quarters the integrated approach using state of the art scanning and planning technology has further enhanced the final achieved polished outcome for very large 50 carat polished and high

equilibrium sustainability gop to go after esg investing if they win congress please try again later the republicans have announced plans to investigate what they see as woke capitalism if they retake congress by targeting wall street firms that treat climate change as an economic risk my view is that esg investing is a cancer within our capital markets rep andy barr r ky told the washington post referring to environment social and governance focused investing funds such funds are a fraud on american investors barr added gop members of the up for grabs senate are pushing for legislation that penalizes corporations for prioritizing esg goals over purely financial aims advertisement advertisement lawmakers in the house introduced a bill earlier this month that would prohibit the department of labor from considering esg factors in deciding between pension plans according to pensions investment magazine but for firms looking down the barrel of regulatory and climate risk the difference between sustainability and profitability is an increasingly meaningless distinction raising the possibility that the gop push is simply political hay making ivan frishberg of amalgamated bank told the post but i don t think this is changing what asset managers or banks are doing in terms of their stewardship of assets in a changing climate frishberg added a primary driver behind the anti esg effort appears to be the fossil fuel industry which has fought to weaken the new climate disclosure rules proposed by the securities and exchange commission banks and investors should not use esg as a premise to just discriminate categorically against an entire sector aaron padilla a vice president at the american petroleum institute told the post advertisement advertisement the accusations of a fossil fuel boycott has caused the enormous asset manager blackrock to roll out a new site in october to argue that it does no such thing welcome to equilibrium a newsletter that tracks the growing

office indicated on monday that he was reconsidering his previous decision as we reported political opponents had jumped on sunak s initial announcement that he would skip the summit alok sharma the british president of last year s climate summit cop26 in glasgow also agreed that the prime minister should attend could the king now also attend sunak s announcement may also open the door for king charles iii whom downing street had told to stay home to attend the summit the guardian reported sharma meanwhile said he was delighted by sunak s reversal according to the guardian fishing vessels may be hiding illegal activity researchers have identified tens of thousands of events in which fishing vessels have disabled their tracking devices potentially to cover up unlawful activity advertisement advertisement legitimate versus cover ups harnessing data from the shipboard automatic identification system created as a collision avoidance tool the scientists have homed in on what they believe may be illegal unreported and unregulated fishing activity while some disabling events may occur for legitimate reasons others appear to be attempts at illegal cover ups the researchers published their findings on wednesday in science advances millions of hours of hidden activity the researchers said they spotted more than 55 000 suspected intentional disabling incidents from 2017 2019 these events obscured nearly 5 million hours about 6 percent of fishing vessel activity according to the study advertisement advertisement suspicious behavior the scientists uncovered two specific situations in which the disabling occurred for potentially nefarious reasons lead author heather welch of the institute of marine sciences at the university of california santa cruz said in a statement such reasons likely involved fishing in unauthorized locations or obscuring unauthorized transshipments according to welch the data are produced in real time so it can be used to target inspections and improve fisheries management she added problematic places more than 40 percent of the total hours obscured by suspected disabling occurred in four hotspots the scientists found three of those hotspots are areas of concern for illegal fishing the northwest pacific and two other areas near the exclusive economic zones of argentina and west african countries these zones contain rich fishing grounds and have limited oversight advertisement advertisement and the fourth hotspot the culprits in these cases were u s trawlers disabling in u s waters off the coast of alaska rather than conducting illegal activity these ships were likely hiding from competitors according to welch unmasking hidden details we might not always be able to see what vessels are doing coauthor tyler clavelle a data scientist at the nonprofit global fishing watch acknowledged in a statement but knowing when they re intentionally hiding their movements provides valuable information that managers and scientists didn t have before clavelle added investment firm buys nearly 2b in trees a wall street company is betting nearly 2 billion on a climate saving technology that is both cutting edge and

estimates for the number of housing units in community associations climbed another notch last year but a condominium building s collapse increased lenders wariness related to the particular vulnerabilities associated with the sector s aging stock the unit count increased to 27 7 million in 2021 from 27 5 million the previous year according to annual statistics the foundation for community association research released this week the number of residents totaled 74 2 million up from 74 1 million in 2020 and the association count rose to 358 000 from 355 000 units in homeowner condominium and cooperative associations are relatively more affordable than traditional housing which has fueled some additional demand for financing in this sector this may account in part for why the share of the u s population living in community associations increased slightly in the past year rising to 28 from 27 and the total valuation of homes in this part of the market climbed to 11 billion from 9 2 trillion the units are coming on the market at a higher rate than pre pandemic levels because of the affordable price points said armstead jones a strategic advisor at real estate bees a technology platform used by home sales professionals the association count could grow by an estimated 355 000 to 363 000 this year but loans available to purchase units have been a little tougher to come by because investors have become a little more wary of the sector following a high profile condo collapse last year criteria for financings has gotten tighter but only because banks need to factor in hoa condo fees which in many cases are high jones said in an email total assessments increased to 106 4 billion from 96 billion in 2021 according to fcar because the collapse in surfside florida was related to structural and financial concerns at the building in question government sponsored enterprises fannie mae and freddie mac have introduced some new prerequisites related to critical repairs or special assessments in 2022 likely due to the changes the gses made in underwriting these loans following the building collapse the share of condo lending occurring instead through government guaranteed channels has increased this year at some companies what did change is the amount of loans that were government loans said kevin parra co founder ceo and president at third party lender plaza home loans in an interview last november it was 20 government and just this october it was 40 government so it appears that s kind of the direction it s going for new loans on condos the gses new requirements add some additional work for lenders when it comes to gathering information about buildings that aren t on fannie or freddie s approved lists typically only developers with new projects work with lenders to get those approvals so older buildings often don t have them parra noted loans that have a government guarantee from an agency like the federal housing administration are relatively easier to process which may be why the share of these loans has increased he said mortgage investors like the gses are particularly careful about managing hoa risks because associations in several states can put a super lien on units that supersedes all others including the lender s when residents don t pay their dues while the total amount of assessments community associations had to draw on rose last year the amount of reserve funds they had set aside to cover repairs and other contingencies fell slightly in 2021 community associations contributed 26 6 billion in resident assessments to reserve funds down slightly from 27 4 billion the top three states for associations remained the same in 2021 with each seeing slightly higher numbers california saw its number rise to 50 010 from 49 520 in florida the count grew to 49 420 from 48 940 and the number of associations in texas climbed to 21 680 from 21 000 parra said he didn t have a direct view of association counts or supply of units but noted that plaza which is based in california has seen the share of production in the condo market decrease slightly over the course of the year we peaked percentage wise of our total volume at 6 7 in may since then it s dropped back down to about 4 2 in october with the average over the 12 months being about 5 parra said
prime minister gordon brown of the united kingdom asserted earlier this week that the financial crisis revealed the need to rebuild our fractured financial system the european union echoed this sentiment in a call for a genuine and complete reform of the world s financial architecture the heart of brown s proposal is to enhance the power and authority of the international monetary fund imf and the world bank known collectively as the bretton woods organizations to create an unprecedented level of global governance to supervise financial institutions impose universal standards for accounting and regulation and serve as an early warning system for future crises the financial crisis certainly is serious but mr brown s suggested solutions would for the most part do little to prevent future crises on the contrary they could do great harm brown s proposal coincides with ongoing meetings between the bush administration and european officials and the announcement of a special g 8 summit as early as next month to focus on the global financial crisis the bush administration should not make the creation of a powerful new international regulatory authority a part of its legacy a new financial architecture prime minister gordon brown authored an op ed in the washington post on october 17 suggesting that the current international financial crisis requires a radical expansion of global governance over international financial institutions and transactions brown s op ed is a study of internal contradictions and confusion and should not be taken as a serious proposal brown opens his argument with the false statement that we are living through the first financial crisis of this new global age the numerous banking and financial crises in latin america over the past few decades the asian financial crisis in the late 1990s and the russian financial crisis in 1998 were all international in scope and precipitated calls for massive interventions indeed the crises resulted in substantial lending from the imf and world bank to ward off fears they would spread to the u s europe and other parts of the world perhaps brown means that this is the first financial crisis to arise in the u s and europe in the new global age if so he should state it brown s criticism of an alleged deficit of international cooperation in addressing the financial crisis is undermined several times in his own piece a good example is his statement that the global problems we face require global solutions there are no britain only or europe only or america only solutions to today s problems we are all in this together and we can only resolve this crisis together yet brown acknowledges that this cooperation is already ongoing and robust several examples laid out in his op ed include the following french president nicolas sarkozy and european commission president josé manuel barroso will meet with president bush to discuss the urgent reforms of the international financial system that are crucial both to preventing another crisis and to restoring confidence when president bush met with the group of seven finance ministers last weekend they agreed that we all had to deal with not only the issue of liquidity in the banking system but also the capitalization and funding of banks it was clear that national action alone would not have been sufficient we knew we had to send a clear and unambiguous message to the markets that governments across the world were prepared to act in a coordinated manner and do whatever was necessary to stabilize the system and address the fundamental problems over the past week we have shown that with political will it is possible to agree on a global multibillion dollar package to recapitalize our banks across many continents indeed international coordination in financial regulation has a long history including the basle i and basle ii international agreements on bank capital standards the recent crisis demonstrates the importance of internationally consistent regulation of financial markets but any international effort should be consultative and advisory engaged in such matters as the development of best practices standards rather than bent on establishing new international regulatory authorities possessed of dictatorial or coercive powers over such matters brown s problem seems less that cooperation is not occurring than that it is occurring in a way that is led by national governments rather than being directed by an international authority he specifically notes that at the end of world war ii american and european visionaries built a new international economic order and formed the international monetary fund the world bank and a world trade body they acted because they knew that peace and prosperity were indivisible they knew that for prosperity to be sustained it had to be shared the old postwar international financial institutions are out of date they have to be rebuilt for a wholly new era in which there is global not national competition and open not closed economies the problem is that the bretton woods institutions have been struggling for years to find a role precisely because the world has been increasingly open and globalized for instance imf under the rules established for the bretton woods system each currency was assigned a value in gold that was to be maintained within a narrow range the imf was the mechanism that kept this system running smoothly and for the first quarter century of its existence the imf had a clear mandate however in the late 1960s and early 1970s the system of fixed exchange rates that the imf was set up to oversee began to break down and ended entirely when the u s abandoned the gold standard this rendered irrelevant the primary function of the imf instead of reducing its activities the imf sought out new missions to justify its continued existence as successive crises erupted the imf reoriented its focus to deal with them to greater and lesser degrees of success world bank the world bank was originally established to rebuild europe after world war ii once that need passed it shifted to providing financing and economic advice to poor countries with the purpose of catalyzing development despite the best of intentions many world bank recipients today remain just as poor if not poorer than they were before receiving hundreds of billions of dollars in world bank loans and grants brown is offering a false hope by pointing to the imf and the world bank as the saviors of the international financial system they simply do not have enough money to resolve serious financial crises in the u s or the eu global markets facilitate the flow of trillions of dollars in private capital in 2006 international net capital flows totaled more than 4 trillion global trade of goods and commercial services exceeded 14 trillion in 2006 the u s and the eu countries have allotted well over a trillion dollars to address their financial crises by contrast the imf and world bank each control roughly 300 billion in resources moreover their readily available resources are far less than this amount because much of their resources are tied up in existing loans and grants solving serious financial crises through the imf and world bank is simply not possible unless these institutions are granted substantially greater resources an increasingly unlikely scenario considering the financial constraints in which countries currently find themselves moreover mr brown assumes that additional resources will not be made available through other outlets in response to growing panic over the tightening of trade finance the credit insurance and trade guarantees used to keep the wheels of international trade turning the wto has called for a meeting of world bank imf regional development banks commercial banks and trade insurance agencies to lay out a plan for improving the availability of trade finance to developing countries of the five commercial banks invited citigroup jp morgan and the royal bank of scotland are receiving government support and britain s hsbc and germany s commerzbank may accept public bailouts in the future with these and other commercial banks increasingly holding hands with interventionist governments a successful public private solution to tightening trade finance could drive momentum for a misguided approach to bailing out global financial markets at significant expense and risk to taxpayers everywhere mr brown s proposal to have the world bank or imf serve this function is also naïve and ill informed these institutions are cumbersome slow and lack the expertise and standing to fulfill this role effectively they should not be granted the sweeping authority proposed by brown especially when other organizations such as the organisation for economic co operation and development and the bank for international settlements arguably have more experience and expertise with central bank supervisory issues nor do brown s proposed solutions seem on target for example he calls for root out the irresponsible and often undisclosed lending at the heart of our problems to do this we need cross border supervision of financial institutions shared global standards for accounting and regulation a more responsible approach to executive remuneration that rewards hard work effort and enterprise but not irresponsible risk taking and the renewal of our international institutions to make them effective early warning systems for the world economy at the base of brown s proposal is an assumption that national and regional financial regulators were inadequate and the rules governing accounting and transparency of private and non private financial institutions need to be strengthened by an international regulatory authority this is far from clear in the u s both the federal reserve and the u s treasury warned repeatedly of pervasive risks posed to the u s financial system by unsound lending practices at fannie mae and freddie mac congress rejected measures proposed by the bush administration and some members of congress to rectify or constrain these practices it is this situation a political failure rather than a regulatory failure that triggered the financial crisis in the u s few can dispute the need for increased transparency in financial markets but there is no such thing as perfect information and risk cannot be eliminated that said improving standards and the amount of information available to the market would not only make them more efficient but would also improve accountability and reduce the risk of future crises however there is no need for such standards to be imposed through an international regulatory authority lacking the intimate knowledge of national financial markets that national regulators possess and which failed to deter the current crisis accounting standards are increasingly congruent internationally and can be tweaked on the national level to best fit domestic markets moreover to a great extent the world bank and the imf already provide sound advice to countries in improving transparency and accountability indeed it was a key condition for their assistance during the asian financial crisis unfortunately countries do not always adopt sound advice few lawmakers are or even should be willing to blithely yield their authority to set policy at the urging of the imf or the bank and that is unlikely to change in the future similarly the imf and the bank already provide frequent warnings and assessments of financial conditions internationally and in individual countries these early warnings are accurate as often as they are wrong an inevitable condition given the nature of imperfect information it is hard to see that they would be more effective simply by granting the institutions more authority as to mr brown s notion that pay for ceos be set by international financial regulators in a more responsible manner that rewards hard work effort and enterprise but not irresponsible risk taking it is simply beyond comprehension why remuneration in private companies should be determined by governments or supranational institutions rather than the companies stockholders or the board of directors both of which are more likely to have the best interests of the company in mind when making such decisions preventing a future crisis gordon brown s proposal to create a new bretton woods system with greatly enhanced powers over international financial markets may be aimed at boosting his flagging popularity in britain but it will not make global financial markets more sound or a future crisis less likely on the contrary to the extent that it promises to remove risk by backstopping financial crises his proposal could arguably increase market volatility and the likelihood of crisis by creating a moral hazard that encourages imprudent risk taking there are undoubtedly steps that can and should be taken to make future crises less likely or severe that president bush should entertain and suggest during his meeting with french president nicolas sarkozy and european commission president josé manuel barroso or at the upcoming g 8 meeting but creating an additional layer of international regulation and oversight with unprecedented authority and power especially one charged with ensuring that globalization works not just for some but for all hard pressed families and businesses in all our communities as suggested by mr brown will more likely retard

which are to be manufactured and sold as polished other diamonds continued to be sold through a combination of the clara platform and regular tenders the company recognized total revenues of 49 9 million in q3 2022 this included 46 5 million from the sale of 99 301 carats from karowe top up payments of 9 0 million as well as 3 4 million from the sale of third party goods on the clara platform in the comparative quarter the company achieved revenues of 72 7 million which included 72 5 million from the sale of 117 162 carats from karowe top up payments of 2 7 million as well as 0 2 million in revenue from third party goods sold through the clara platform hb sales agreement for 10 8 carat diamond production from karowe karowe s large high value diamonds have historically accounted for approximately 60 to 70 of lucara s annual revenues in 2020 lucara announced a partnership agreement with hb entering into a definitive sales agreement for diamonds recovered that exceed 10 8 carats from the company s 100 owned karowe diamond mine in botswana this agreement was subsequently amended and extended to december 31 2022 the mechanisms of the agreement result in complete transparency within the value chain and create important alignment between the producer and the manufacturer for the first time under the amended sales agreement 10 8 carat gem and near gem diamonds from the karowe mine of qualities that can directly enter the manufacturing stream are being sold to hb at prices based on the estimated polished outcome of each diamond the estimated polished value is determined through state of the art scanning and planning technology with an adjusted amount payable on actual achieved polished sales less a fee and the cost of manufacturing following the extension of the hb agreement in 2021 all 10 8 carat non gem quality diamonds and all diamonds less than 10 8 carats in weight which did not meet the criteria for sale on clara are being sold as rough through the quarterly tender in the agreement extension payment terms were amended to better reflect the timing of mine production and the manufacturing process this unique pricing mechanism delivers regular cash flow for this important segment of our production profile for the three months ended september 30 2022 the company recorded revenue of 27 1 million from the hb agreement inclusive of top up payments of 9 0 million as compared to revenue of 50 5 million in q3 2021 inclusive of top up payments of 2 7 million the decrease in revenue in q3 2022 versus the comparative quarter can be attributed primarily to the number of high value diamonds delivered to hb in q3 2021 four pink diamonds and two type iia top white gem diamonds 393 5 carats and 257 5 carats for which an initial mpv payment was received in q3 2021 in addition more carats were delivered to hb in the comparative quarter 6 258 carats vs 2 412 carats despite the overall decrease in revenue recognized in q3 2022 diamond market fundamentals continued to support healthy prices as steady demand and some inventory shortages were reported natural variability in the quality profile of the 10 8ct production in any production period or fiscal quarter results in fluctuations in recorded revenue and associated top ups between periods is expected during q3 2022 7 1 weight percentage specials of total carats recovered was consistent with the karowe resource model as a result of the sales agreement with hb the company also participated in polished diamond price increases during q3 2022 as rough diamonds sold to hb in previous quarters were polished and sold in q3 2022 estimated top up payments of 9 0 million q3 2021 2 7 million were included in revenue for the quarter at september 30 2022 a number of higher value and more technically complex stones that take longer to manufacture had not fully completed the manufacturing and sales process these stones were delivered to hb in 2021 and the first nine months of 2022 as these stones finish the manufacturing process and are sold the company may record additional revenue in the form of top up payments from these sales clara sales platform clara lucara s 100 owned proprietary secure web based digital sales platform continues to gain scale and interest interest in clara continues to grow as the benefits of purchasing rough diamonds in an innovative way become evident in q3 2022 four sales q3 2021 four sales took place with a total sales volume transacted of 8 3 million a 26 increase from the 6 6 million transacted in q3 2021 as karowe goods were supplemented by growth in supply from additional sources the number of buyers on the platform remained stable during the quarter with the company maintaining a waiting list to manage supply and demand additional supply is required to meet existing demand and drive the platform s growth and the company continued trial sales on the clara platform with a third party producer in q3 2022 the company intends to continue to seek additional supply in 2022 both from third party producers and the secondary market karowe underground expansion update the karowe ugp is expected to extend the mine life to at least 2040 with initial underground carat production predominantly from the highest value em pk s unit and is forecast to contribute approximately 4 billion in additional revenues using conservative diamond prices the updated estimated capital cost for the karowe ugp is 547 million including contingency and reflects expected pricing changes following execution of the main sink contract in q2 2022 mine ramp up is expected in 2026 with full production from the karowe ugp expected in h2 2026 the company is using a combination of cash flow from operations and project debt for the investment in the karowe ugp which is fully financed during the three months ended september 30 2022 a total of 23 9 million was spent on the karowe ugp development primarily in relation to ongoing construction activities and procurement of long lead items including main sinking of the production shaft commenced at the end of september while main sinking in the ventilation shaft continued as main sinking activity ramped up in the ventilation shaft during the third quarter several operational issues arose resulting in sinking rates achieving less than plan due to longer cycle times in response to the operational challenges and longer duration cycle times changes and mitigations were actioned during the quarter observed cycle times and sinking rates are improving the start of main sink activity in the production shaft was delayed due to longer than planned commissioning of the winders and hoisting plant cycle times are now improving procurement of shaft station underground mobile equipment progressed with equipment deliveries expected to commence in q4 2022 and q1 2023 the letlhakane and karowe substation construction continued with focus on civil work and cable pulling for control equipment installation the transmission line towers were equipped with stringing hardware and safety nets were installed over existing line crossings activities for the karowe ugp in the fourth quarter of 2022 are expected to include the following sinking within both the ventilation and production shafts procurement of underground equipment including awarding the bulk air cooler tender continuation of detailed design and engineering of the underground mine infrastructure and layout commissioning the 29 km 132kv bulk power supply powerline diamond market after a strong start to the third quarter of 2022 diamond price softening was observed in late august and into september however solid market fundamentals continue to support diamond prices despite growing concerns of a global economic slowdown high levels of reported inflation persisted and governments responded with increasingly forceful measures in attempts to reduce it to sustainable levels a cautious economic outlook combined with the uncertainty caused by geopolitical events including the ongoing conflict in ukraine and continuing implications of the covid 19 pandemic specifically in china where the demand for diamonds has not yet recovered remain a risk to diamond pricing trends in the short term with demand from the us a critical driver on prices of both rough and polished diamonds the longer term market fundamentals remain unchanged and positive however pointing to strong price growth over the next few years as demand is expected to outstrip future supply the benefits of the committed sales agreement with hb continued to be realized during the third quarter of 2022 as the company participated in the upside to manufacturing polished diamonds for goods delivered in previous quarters the integrated approach using state of the art scanning and planning technology has further enhanced the final achieved polished outcome for very large 50 carat polished and high

ratios and supplementary financial measures are utilized by the company as measures of financial performance non ifrs measures non ifrs ratios and supplementary financial measures do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by ifrs and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies management believes that these non ifrs measures non ifrs ratios and supplementary financial measures allow for a better evaluation of the operating performance of the company s business and facilitate meaningful comparison of results in the current period to those in prior periods and future periods non ifrs measures presented in this earnings release include certain figures from our statement of operations that are adjusted to exclude significant items although figures that exclude significant items provide useful information by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of the company s core operating results a limitation of utilizing these figures that exclude significant items is that the ifrs accounting effects of these items do in fact reflect the underlying financial results of the company s business accordingly these effects should not be ignored in evaluating and analyzing the company s financial results therefore management believes that the company s ifrs measures of financial performance and the respective non ifrs measures should be considered together non ifrs measures adjusted figures figures that exclude significant items provide useful information by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of the company s core operating results financial statement items that exclude significant items are non ifrs measures to calculate these non ifrs financial statement items we exclude certain items from our

washington dc november 2 2022 the federal reserve pumped up its benchmark interest rate wednesday by three quarters of a point for a fourth straight time but hinted that it could soon reduce the size of its rate hikes the fed s move raised its key short term rate to a range of 3 75 to 4 its highest level in 15 years it was the central bank s sixth rate hike this year a streak that has made mortgages and other consumer and business loans increasingly expensive and heightened the risk of a recession but in a statement after its latest policy meeting the fed suggested that it might soon shift to a more deliberate pace of rate increases it said that in coming months it would consider the cumulative impact of its large rate hikes on the economy it noted that its rate hikes take time to fully affect growth and inflation those words indicated that the fed s policymakers may think borrowing costs are getting high enough to possibly slow the economy and reduce inflation if so that would suggest that they may not need to raise rates as quickly as they have been doing the fed s signal that it might soon decide to slow its hikes sent stock and bond prices higher and reduced treasury yields for now the persistence of inflated prices and higher borrowing costs is pressuring american households and has undercut the ability of democrats to campaign on the health of the job market as they try to keep control of congress republican candidates have hammered democrats on the punishing impact of inflation in the run up to the midterm elections that will end tuesday speaking at a news conference chair jerome powell avoided sending any clear signal of whether the fed s next expected rate hike in december might be only a half point rather than three quarters typically the fed raises rates in quarter point increments but after having miscalculated in downplaying inflation last year as likely transitory powell has led the fed to raise rates aggressively to try to slow borrowing and spending and ease price pressures wednesday s rate increase coincided with growing concerns that the fed may tighten credit so much as to derail the economy the government has reported that the economy grew last quarter and employers are still hiring at a solid pace but the housing market has cratered and consumers are barely increasing their spending the average rate on a 30 year fixed mortgage just 3 14 a year ago surpassed 7 last week mortgage buyer freddie mac reported sales of existing homes have dropped for eight straight months blerina uruci an economist at t rowe price suggested that falling home sales are the canary in the coal mine that demonstrate that the fed s rate hikes are weakening a highly interest rate sensitive sector like housing uruci noted though that the fed s hikes haven t yet meaningfully slowed much of the rest of the economy particularly the job market or consumer demand so long as those two components remain strong she said the fed s policymakers cannot count on inflation coming down close to their 2 target within the next two years several fed officials have said recently that they have yet to see meaningful progress in their fight against rising costs inflation rose 8 2 in september from 12 months earlier just below the highest rate in 40 years still the policymakers may feel they can soon slow the pace of their rate hikes because some early signs suggest that inflation could start declining in 2023 consumer spending squeezed by high prices and costlier loans is barely growing supply chain snarls are easing which means fewer shortages of goods and parts wage growth is plateauing which if followed by declines would reduce inflationary pressures yet the job market remains consistently strong which could make it harder for the fed to cool the economy and curb inflation this week the government reported that companies posted more job openings in september than in august there are now 1 9 available jobs for each unemployed worker an unusually large supply a ratio that high means that employers will likely continue to raise pay to attract and keep workers those higher labor costs are often passed on to customers in the form of higher prices thereby fueling more inflation ultimately economists at goldman sachs expect the fed s policymakers to raise their key rate to nearly 5 by march that is above what the fed itself had projected in its previous set of forecasts in september outside the united states many other major central banks are also rapidly raising rates to try to cool inflation levels that are even higher than in the u s last week the european central bank announced its second consecutive jumbo rate hike increasing rates at the fastest pace in the euro currency s history to try to curb inflation that soared to a record 10 7 last month likewise the bank of england is expected to raise rates thursday to try to ease consumer prices which have risen at their fastest pace in 40 years to 10 1 in september even as they raise rates to combat inflation both europe and the u k appear to be sliding toward recession ap

the third quarter of 2022 compared to 1 043 billion 0 71 per common share in the prior year quarter primarily due to significantly higher crude oil and refined product realizations reflecting the improved business environment in the current quarter and higher upstream production the increase in adjusted operating earnings was partially offset by increased income taxes royalties and operating expenses in the current quarter the increase in operating expenses was primarily related to a significant increase in commodity input costs increased maintenance and higher costs associated with increased oil sands production adjusted operating earnings were also impacted by a weakening in benchmark pricing during the current quarter compared to a strengthening in benchmark pricing in the

quarter of 2022 compared to 4 718 billion 3 19 per common share in the prior year quarter in addition to the factors impacting adjusted funds from operations cash flow provided by operating activities was impacted by a use of cash associated with the company s working capital balances in the third quarter of 2022 compared to a significant source of cash in the prior year quarter the source of cash in the prior year quarter was primarily due to an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and the receipt of the company s 2020 federal income tax refund operating results suncor s total

increased to 80 compared to 66 in the prior year quarter reflecting lower planned maintenance activities in the current quarter as the prior year quarter was impacted by a significant planned turnaround at upgrader 2 subsequent to the quarter the company successfully completed its turnaround activities e p production during the third quarter of 2022 was 78 100 boe d compared to 93 500 boe d in the prior year quarter the decrease in production was primarily due to the sale of the company s working interest in the golden eagle area development in the fourth quarter of 2021 the impact of planned turnaround activities at hibernia in the third quarter of 2022 and natural declines partially offset by increased production from norway refinery crude throughput was 466 600 bbls d and refinery utilization was 100 in the third quarter of 2022 compared to 460 300 bbls d and 99 in the prior year quarter reflecting strong utilizations across all refineries in both periods refined product sales in the third quarter of 2022 increased to 577 300 bbls d compared to 551 500 bbls d in the prior year quarter the increase in refined product sales reflected increased demand in the current period combined with the company s ability to leverage its extensive domestic sales network and export channels strong operations at our refining assets resulted in the third highest crude throughput in our company s history and contributed to strong refined product sales during the quarter said smith increased utilization of the interconnecting pipelines helped to minimize the impact of significant planned upstream turnaround activities in the third quarter all major planned maintenance on our assets has been completed early in the fourth quarter and we remain focused on safe reliable operations the company s total operating selling and general expenses were 3 075 billion in the third quarter of 2022 compared to 2 768 billion in the prior year quarter the increase was mainly due to a significant increase in commodity input costs including higher natural gas prices increased maintenance and higher costs associated with increased oil sands production the company s exposure to higher natural gas costs is partially mitigated by revenue from power sales that is recorded in operating revenues strategy update suncor s top priority is improving its safety and operational performance the company s ability to deliver on its operational excellence priorities and drive improved operating performance by operating safely reliably and efficiently is underpinned by suncor s value of safety above all else suncor aims to further grow its profitability by focusing the company s capital investments on high value cash flow initiatives that support its incremental

as we consider the current political landscape and the various midterm election scenarios investors can turn to exchange traded funds to capture the potential outcome in the recent webcast axelrod and rove on what s at stake in the midterms karl rove foremost conservative commentator and strategist and former deputy chief of staff and senior advisor to president george w bush david axelrod senior political commentator for cnn and former senior advisor to president barack obama and michael arone chief investment strategist for us spdr business state street global advisors navigated the ins and outs of the midterm election and outlined potential outcomes that investors should be ready for rove has indicated that democrats may be fumbling the ball when it comes to the economy as many politicians remain adamant that the u s economic engine is chugging along despite the concerns of the average american family foremost inflation remains the greatest cost to the average u s consumer with many already seeing a sticker shock when it comes to the pumps or at their local grocery stores while employment rates remain robust americans aren t seeing their cost of living wages keep up with inflationary pressures so paychecks are being stretched in face of the elevated inflationary pressures the federal open market committee has executed its fourth consecutive 75 basis point interest rate hike further adding pressure to the u s economy meanwhile market participants anticipate the fed to slow down its rate of hikes with a terminal rate by spring axelrod has touched upon the messaging issue that democrats face today to get voters to come out during the midterm elections which have historically exhibited a lower turnout rate when compared to presidential elections meanwhile political runners have to simplify complex issues to get through to a wider audience especially independents and casual voters looking ahead after the midterm election dust settles arone pointed out that on a more positive note the s p 500 has historically posted strong returns following a midterm election on average significantly outperforming pre midterm periods over 17 of the past 19 midterm elections since 1946 stocks have outperformed in the six months following an election compared to the six months prior to the midterms while a split congress would likely mean legislative gridlock the market has also historically performed better during periods when there is a split congress additionally the incumbent president s political party lost seats 13 times in the u s house of representatives and nine times in the u s senate in the past six decades across 15 midterm elections a sitting president s party historically lost 25 seats in the house on average the low president approval rating has also coincided with more lost seats to help prepare portfolios for any outcome arone outlined several considerations on how energy policy defense spending tax policy and infrastructure programs could be impacted based on whether the democrats or republicans control congress highlighting various spdr etfs that align with each potential outcome for example in the energy sector the spdr kensho clean power etf cnrg and the spdr s p 500 fossil fuel reserves free etf spyx could be plays for a democrat controlled congress which would be more friendly toward shifting to a climate friendly policy outlook on the other hand the spdr s p oil and gas exploration and production etf xop and the spdr oil gas equipment services etf xes would be investment ideas for a favorable republican outcome which could restrict the implementation of biden s preferred climate agenda curtailing additional climate investments when it comes to defense spending both sides of the aisle are in favor of increased military expansion in the wake of the russia ukraine war along with the future of defense in the cyber space to capture these potential plays investors can turn to something like the spdr s p aerospace defense etf nysearca xar and spdr s p kensho future security etf nysearca fite if we see a republican sweep the country could likely see the extension of popular tax breaks and a reversal of some of the tax provisions in the inflation reduction act which would likely be beneficial for firms with significant revenue overseas and elevated buyback activity along with technology related sector etf plays like the spdr s p semiconductor etf nysearca xsd and the spdr nyse technology etf xntk on the other hand if we maintain the democrat status quo the country could see corporate and individual tax increases the 1 buyback tax may increase further which may make dividends more attractive than buybacks for shareholders potentially benefiting low tax sectors as well as high dividend paying firms investors can turn to income plays like the spdr dow jones reit etf rwr and the spdr portfolio s p 500 high dividend spyd financial advisors who are interested in learning more

range is now 3 75 4 the highest rate since january 2008 while broadly expected this latest 75 basis point hike comes against a backdrop of rising calls for the fed to slow its rate of increases or pause them altogether to allow changes in monetary policy to be fully absorbed by the economy federal reserve chair jerome powell said wednesday that he was confident the federal open market committee s 75 basis point rate hike would not contribute to financial instability but he opened the door to slowing rate hikes in future meetings bloomberg news it s premature to discuss pausing and it s not something that we re thinking about that s really not a conversation to be had we have a ways to go powell said during a press conference following the meeting on wednesday and one thing i ll say is that i would want people to understand our commitment to getting this done and to not making the mistake of not doing enough or the mistake of withdrawing our strong policy and doing that too soon yet many are more worried about the fed going too far than not far enough in the weeks since the fed s last meeting in september a growing number of economists policy experts and lawmakers primarily democrats have raised concerns that the fed is jeopardizing the u s labor market as well as global financial markets through its aggressive policy changes pointing to rising mortgage rates falling home prices and an uptick in defaults among high risk borrowers some economists argue the effects of the fed s tightened monetary policy have already been felt by the most interest rate sensitive parts of the economy because it takes time for higher borrowing costs to be reflected in other sectors tightening aggressively until those metrics trend down runs the risk of an overcorrection policy experts said powell described the decline in mortgage activity and home prices seen in recent months as a necessary correction to an overheated market he also noted that the current hardships in real estate markets were unlikely to bleed over into other parts of the economy from a financial stability standpoint we didn t see in this cycle the kinds of poor credit underwriting that we saw before the global financial crisis powell said housing credit was much more carefully managed by the lenders so it s a very different situation and doesn t appear to present stability issues but we do understand that that s a very big effect of our policy lawmakers also urged the fed to take a more tempered approach to fighting inflation to prevent adverse impacts on the labor market since last week at least 13 members of congress have sent or signed onto letters to the fed warning that raising rates too much or too quickly could trigger unnecessary job losses thus putting the fed s mandate to stabilize prices ahead of its obligations to maintain full employment high risk defaults could be canary in the coal mine for mortgage market powell addressed the topic of the fed s dual mandate repeatedly during both his prepared remarks and in response to questions posed during the press conference he said the fed remained committed to maintaining maximum employment adding that stabilizing prices would be key to that restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices in the longer run he said adding that given that job openings are currently outnumber job seekers a correction in the labor market could take place with fewer job losses that is broadly expected powell said the fed remained committed to increasing interest rates until prices stabilize and noted that further increases will likely be necessary to achieve that goal but the statement released by the fomc acknowledges there are many factors that could cause it to change course the committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the committee s goals the statement reads the committee s assessment will take into account a wide range of information including readings on public health labor market conditions inflation pressures and inflation expectations and financial and international developments questions have also been raised about how monetary adjustments in the u s might impact global financial stability in a speech on sept 30 fed vice chair lael brainard said central banks in leading economies around the world are also raising interest rates creating a compounding effect on monetary tightening in the u s brainard noted that the ripple effects of higher fed interest rates would be felt most acutely in emerging economies distress in those markets she added could have a destabilizing effect on the global economy for instance in countries where sovereign or corporate debt levels are high higher interest rates could increase debt servicing burdens and concerns about debt sustainability which could be exacerbated by currency depreciation she said an increase in risk premiums could kick off deleveraging dynamics as financial intermediaries de risk and shallow liquidity in some markets could become an amplification channel in the event of further adverse shocks powell said the fed monitors global economic conditions as well as geopolitical developments and factors them into its monetary policy decisions to craft policies that minimize the risk of spillover effects that could threaten the u s economy powell said he believed the fed s actions had little impact on rising inflation in europe noting that it has largely been driven by rising energy prices on which the fed has little impact he said the best thing the u s can do to protect global financial stability is stabilize prices domestically price stability in the united states is a good thing for the global economy over a long period of time he said price stability is the kind of thing that pays dividends for our economy for decades hopefully even though it may be difficult to get it back getting it back is something that provides value to the people we serve for the long run

cherezoff istock via getty images today we take our first look at an oil services firm approaching profitability for the first time in years an analysis follows below seeking alpha company overview oil states international inc nyse ois is a houston based provider of products and services employed in the drilling completion subsea production and infrastructure segments of the oil and gas industry with further applications in industrial and military verticals its domestic operations primarily support the oil shale industry whereas its international business supports deepwater offshore drilling activity oil states was founded in 1937 as an oilfield supply store and has grown through over forty acquisitions it went public in 2001 raising net proceeds of 80 5 million at 5 14 per share after giving effect to the 2014 spinoff of its accommodations business civeo cveo oil states stock trades at just under seven bucks a share translating to a market cap of approximately 325 million company presentation operating segments the company evaluates its business through three operating segments offshore manufactured products omp well site services wss and downhole technologies dt company presentation omp provides highly engineered products and services primarily for offshore oil and natural gas production as well as land based drilling industrial and military applications some of the equipment and services sold to the long cycle or mega projects include deepwater mooring systems cranes subsea pipeline products connector systems welding fabrication cladding and machining services as well as installation inspection and repair omp also provides consumable downhole casing and cementing products to the north american shale vertical as well as sound and vibration equipment for marine vessels and construction and maintenance products for offshore wind projects omp generated 1h22 operating income of 19 6 million on revenue of 180 6 million up from 5 9 million on revenue of 137 5 million in the prior year period this segment s first half accounted for 52 of oil states topline and 60 of its adj ebitda wss provides completion i e prepping a well for production and drilling services including wellhead isolation frac valve and downhole services amongst others predominantly to land based oil shale exploration and production concerns in the u s this segment lost operating income of 2 8 million on revenue of 103 0 million in 1h22 versus a loss of 21 4 million on revenue of 81 6 million in 1h21 wss contributed 30 of the company s topline and 29 of total adj ebitda in 1h22 company presentation dt harnesses the company s perforation technology to maximize the effectiveness of hydraulic fracturing by enabling optimization of perforation hole size depth and quality of tunnels predominantly for the domestic oil shale industry this segment also provides toe valve and frac plug offerings for horizontal wells as well as consumables primarily for completion applications dt came via a 615 million acquisition of geodynamics in 2018 in 1h22 this unit generated operating income of negative 3 0 million on revenue of 62 3 million as compared to a loss of 3 9 million on revenue of 52 2 million dt was responsible for 18 of the company s revenue and 11 of its adj ebitda in 1h22 also with regard to its 1h22 topline oil states derived 54 of it from well completion activities and 22 from longer cycle usually offshore project products and services which are not as sensitive to commodity price volatility the balance of the company s topline came from drilling services and other commercial and military applications third quarter results on october 27th the company reported third quarter numbers oil states international had a non gaap net loss of four cents a share even as revenues were up nearly 35 on a year over year basis to just over 189 million both sales and earnings results were roughly in line with expectations the company s offshore manufactured products backlog increased 7 over the second quarter of this year and now stands at 258 million operating cash flow came in at a positive 29 million during the quarter earnings volatility like most oil and gas services companies oil states is subject to the whims of commodity prices and the e p industry s outlook on said prices which dictate drilling activity and rig counts the company s stock price peaked at 65 77 per share in 2014 when oil was above 100 per barrel and frac spreads a de facto rig count like measure for completions were well above 400 shares of ois then traded lower for the balance of the decade with lower oil and gas prices capitulating to 1 52 during the pandemic sell off in march 2020 as the market rightly foresaw a dramatic drop in drilling activity with frac spreads bottoming at 45 in may 2020 as such oil states went from earning 3 31 a share gaap and adj ebitda of 438 1 million on revenue of 1 82 billion in fy14 to losing 1 06 a share gaap while generating positive adj ebitda of only 38 1 million on revenue of 573 2 million in fy21 the company has not been profitable on a gaap basis since fy15 energy prices have been volatile in 2022 for numerous reasons including the war in ukraine not helping matters is the current administration s combative stance towards the oil and gas industry who s going to put in the prerequisite midstream infrastructure when key political leaders are campaigning on ending fossil fuels additionally esg lobbying efforts to curtail investment have been another headwind for the industry balance sheet analyst commentary during the third quarter oil states paid 10 million in cash and issued approximately 1 9 million shares of its common stock having a market value of 10 3 million to fully settle the 17 5 million promissory note payable together with related accrued interest of 2 2 million and resolve outstanding legal disputes with the seller of geodynamics inc the company ended the third quarter with approximately 33 million of cash and marketable securities on its balance sheet the company s total debt represented 19 combined total debt and stockholders equity as of the end of the quarter liquidity cash plus borrowing availability stood at 113 million as of the end of september the only street analyst who has made public commentary on oil states in the past twelve months is ian macpherson at piper sandler who upgraded shares of ois from a hold to an outperform on valuation back in march he subsequently raised his price objective from 8 to 10 in april citing the improving environment in the oil patch on average the street expects the company to lose 0 15 a share on revenue of 740 million in fy22 followed by a gain of 0 33 a share on revenue of nearly 845 million in fy23 recently onboarded coo philip scott moses is in accordance with macpherson s assessment acquiring 58 624 shares at an average price of 3 63 on september 26th 2022 verdict geopolitical developments and questionable domestic energy policies conspired to drive commodity prices substantially higher which has put a little wind in oil states financial sails however as the global economy stumbles into recession the best case scenario higher energy prices leading to increasing frac spreads looks as if it has already passed with oil states yet to return to profitability even if the street is correct and the company earns 0 33 a share in fy23 that translates to a forward pe of over 20 not particularly cheap given the industry s volatility and the elevated interest rate environment the bet here is that a likely global recession will eventually act as a further drag on energy prices as such investment in ois is not recommended at this time

adults own a gun and nearly half of households have at least one gun in the home 100 americans die every day from gunshot wounds nearly half of all u s adults grew up in a household with guns more than half have friends who own guns and nearly three quarters have fired a gun the prevalence of gun violence and gun ownership has made gun control among the most hotly and frequently contested issues in the united states advocates for gun control want tighter restrictions on the sale possession and use of firearms while advocates of gun rights see ownership as an essential right protected by the second amendment to the u s constitution the debate heats up each time a mass shooting defined as a shooting involving the death or injury of four or more people occurs which now happens on average every day in the united states seven of the 10 deadliest u s shootings have happened in the past decade including the robb elementary school shooting in uvalde texas in may 2022 reform advocates point to evidence showing fewer people die from gun violence in states with strong gun laws case in point alaska has one of the highest gun death rates and some of the weakest gun laws while hawaii has the lowest gun death rate and some of the strongest gun laws advocates for reform have steadily gathered momentum some young survivors of the parkland florida school shooting for example proposed a blueprint for comprehensive gun control everytown for gun safety founded by former new york city mayor michael bloomberg has spent millions of dollars to promote gun control through ballot initiatives and state elections an august 2022 study conducted by the university of chicago harris school of public policy and the associated press norc center for public affairs research found that 71 of americans say gun laws should be stricter meanwhile more hardline groups such as gun owners of america fight hard in washington d c for lawmakers support gun advocates argue that more guns not less will help to prevent or stop shootings and that stricter gun control laws will only keep guns out of the hands of honest people but this has not stopped the current administration from responding to public appeal as regards gun ownership in june 2022 just over a month after the horrific shooting at uvalde president joe biden signed the bipartisan safer communities act which incentivizes states to pass red flag laws expands background checks for those under age 21 and closes what is known as the boyfriend loophole previous legislation had prevented those convicted of domestic abuse from owning a firearm the new bill now includes dating partners under that restriction in addition to spouses and former spouses in some respects this bill is a rebuttal to the supreme court s ruling which

includes interest income and interest expense taxes depreciation and amortization adjusted ebitda is defined as ebitda further adjusted for certain special items that occur during the reporting period as noted below we include ebitda and adjusted ebitda to provide investors with a supplemental measure of our operating performance neither ebitda nor adjusted ebitda is a recognized term under

fed delivers another steep rate hike with more to come the latest three quarter percentage point increase takes the benchmark lending rate to 3 75 4 0 percent the highest since january 2008 washington united states the federal reserve delivered another steep interest rate increase on wednesday as expected with its move to cool red hot inflation taking on more weight amid the political maelstrom of key us midterm elections with high inflation squeezing american families of all political stripes president joe biden faces a battle to avoid losing control of both chambers of congress the fed s aggressive rate hikes this year so far have not had a noticeable impact on prices but they have stoked fears of an impending recession even as the job market remains strong the us central bank raised the benchmark lending rate by 0 75 percentage point the fourth straight increase of that size and the sixth hike this year in its all out battle to tame inflation not seen since the 1980s the latest three quarter percentage point increase takes the benchmark lending rate to 3 75 4 0 percent the highest since january 2008 by making it more costly to borrow policymakers aim to put the brakes on spending and bring demand more into balance with supply that has been battered by global supply issues and the ongoing russian war in ukraine while the us housing market has cooled sharply amid higher interest rates key inflation measures show prices continue to rise and the labor market remains tight with job openings rising and private hiring accelerating in october the policy setting federal open market committee fomc said more rate increases will be needed to tamp down rising prices but it will take into consideration the impact on the economy when deciding on the pace of future moves opening the door to the possibility it will implement smaller steps in coming months but fed chair jerome powell cautioned that policymakers are not yet ready to halt their efforts it will take time however for the full effects of monetary restraint to be realized especially on inflation powell told reporters it s very premature in my view to be thinking about or talking about pausing our rate hike we have a ways to go but he said the committee could begin discussing the possibility of slowing the aggressive pace of rate increases at the december meeting but ultimately might have to increase the level higher than expected to achieve the goal of bringing inflation down to two percent slower growth as central bankers walk a tightrope fighting inflation while avoiding tipping the economy into a recession politicians are ramping up pressure on fed officials powell acknowledged that bringing inflation down is likely to require below trend growth and that the window to achieve a soft landing slowing inflation while avoiding a downturn has narrowed biden is facing growing voter frustration over high inflation and there are signals in polling that a red wave could sweep the opposition republicans to power in the house and senate republicans put the blame for inflation and slower growth squarely on biden while the president s democrats worry the fed moves will lead to higher unemployment but powell has argued that allowing high inflation to become entrenched would inflict even more pain on american families and workers in his press conference wednesday powell dismissed criticism that the central bank had moved too quickly and said the outlook for the world s largest economy is highly uncertain no one knows whether there s going to be a recession or not and if so how bad that recession would be he said white house spokesperson karine jean pierre said the fed moves are part of our transition to stable and steady growth with lower inflation the us stock market endured another volatile day jumping after the fed announcement when it looked like a pause was coming and then sinking as powell spoke ian shepherdson of pantheon macroeconomics said that while the statement offered hope of a policy pivot powell isn t budging yet he said the fomc offered a clear signal that the wave of 75bp hikes is over however the fed chief was deeply reluctant to promise that shift in december

chief financial officer added in the quarter we exceeded our guidance adjusted oibda increased 17 reflecting 19 revenue growth over the prior year our financial performance was primarily driven by growth in our media segment as well as a shift in the timing of revenue related to certain licensing agreements these items more than offset an increase in certain costs to support the creation of content for 2022 we now anticipate adjusted oibda at the upper end of the range of 370 to 385 million third quarter consolidated results revenue increased 19 to 304 6 million primarily due to an increase in core content rights fees for the company s flagship programs raw and smackdown and the monetization of third party original programming to a lesser extent higher consumer product licensing revenue and international ticket sales also contributed to the increase in revenue operating income decreased 8 or 5 1 million to 58 9 million as the increase in revenue was offset by an increase in

activities were 54 5 million a slight decline from 56 9 million primarily due to lower net income and higher working capital requirements free cash flow was 3 5 million a decrease from 44 8 million primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures for the three months ended september 30 2022 the company incurred 42 3 million of capital expenditures related to its new headquarter facility

primarily driven by higher costs to support the creation of content adjusted oibda increased 10 or 8 3 million to 93 9 million live events third quarter 2022 revenue increased 26 or 7 2 million to 35 2 million primarily due an increase in international ticket sales from the company s major stadium event clash at the castle there were 58 total ticketed live events in the current quarter consisting

million as the increase in revenues as described above was essentially offset by an increase in event related expenses adjusted oibda increased 5 or 0 5 million to 9 8 million consumer products third quarter 2022 revenue increased 45 or 11 3 million to 36 4 million primarily due to higher licensing revenue during the quarter approximately 10 million in revenue was recorded primarily as a result of

our annual report on form 10 k a for the year ended december 31 2021 in addition wwe is unable to provide a reconciliation of fourth quarter or full year 2022 guidance to gaap measures as at this time wwe cannot accurately determine all of the adjustments that would be required see supplemental information in this release on page 15 and forward looking statements in this release on page 8 3 a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow for the three and nine month periods ended september 30 2022 and 2021 can be found in the supplemental information in this release on page 16 non gaap measures the company defines adjusted oibda as operating income excluding depreciation and amortization stock based compensation expense certain impairment charges and other non recurring items that management deems would impact the comparability of results between periods adjusted oibda includes amortization and depreciation expenses directly related to supporting the operations of our segments including content production asset amortization depreciation and amortization of costs related to content delivery and technology assets utilized for the wwe network as well as amortization of right of use assets related to finance leases of equipment used to produce and broadcast our live events the company believes the presentation of adjusted oibda is relevant and useful for investors because it allows them to view the company s segment performance in the same manner as the primary method used by management to evaluate segment performance and to make decisions regarding the allocation of resources additionally the company believes that adjusted oibda is a primary measure used by media investors analysts and peers for comparative purposes adjusted oibda is a non gaap financial measure and may be different from similarly titled non gaap financial measures used by other companies wwe views operating income as the most directly comparable gaap measure adjusted oibda and other non gaap measures such as adjusted operating income adjusted net income and adjusted eps which are defined as the gaap measures excluding certain nonrecurring material items that impact the comparability between periods should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for operating income net income eps or other gaap measures such as operating cash flow as an indicator of operating performance or liquidity the company defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less cash used for capital expenditures wwe views net cash provided by operating activities as the most directly comparable gaap measure although it is not a recognized measure of liquidity under u s gaap free cash flow provides useful information regarding the amount of cash wwe s continuing business generates after capital expenditures and is available for reinvesting in the business debt service share repurchases and payment of dividends additional information as

results as the mine was in pre commercial production up until the achievement of commercial production at the end of q3 2022 3 aisc per oz sold excludes corporate general and administration expenses 4 numbers in tables throughout this news release may not sum due to rounding the company sold 4 more gold ounces in q3 2022 compared to q3 2021 the increase was mainly driven by increased production at mesquite and the contribution of pre commercial production ounces at santa luz offset by decreased production at los filos aurizona and rdm and by no gold sales at mercedes as the operation was sold on april 21 2022 higher gold production at mesquite was mainly due to accessing the majority of ore from the brownie open pit late in q2 2022 allowing for full leaching during q3 2022 lower gold production at los filos was mainly due to 33 lower gold grades primarily due to lower grade mined from the guadalupe open pit and slow development into higher grade areas in the bermejal underground lower gold production at aurizona was due in part to processing stockpile ore with lower grades as high rainfall continued into july 2022 and impeded access to higher grade ore from the piaba open pit lower than expected equipment availability also impacted the remainder of q3 2022 aurizona s mining contractor has supplemented its fleet in october 2022 to remedy this lower gold production at rdm is due to the decision to process low grade stockpile material while the open pit is being dewatered the company sold 2 fewer gold ounces for the nine months ended september 30 2022 compared to the comparative period of 2021 the decrease was mainly due to lower production at aurizona which experienced a longer rainy season in 2022 and lower production at rdm which was impacted by a temporary suspension of mining and plant operations in mid may due to a delay in receiving permits for the scheduled tsf raise and a transition in q3 2022 to processing low grade stockpile material rather than mining in situ ore the decrease was partially offset by increased production at mesquite driven by earlier delivery of ounces to the leach pad as compared to 2021 due to mine sequencing and the contribution of pre commercial production ounces at santa luz in q3 2022 earnings from mine operations were 7 4 million q3 2021 45 7 million and for the nine months ended september 30 2022 were 52 9 million nine months ended september 30 2021 131 2 million earnings from mine operations were lower in q3 2022 compared to q3 2021 due to lower realized gold price per ounce higher operating costs supply constraints and inflationary pressures particularly from increased prices of oil and other consumables earnings from mine operations were lower for the nine months ended september 30 2022 compared to the comparative period of 2021 primarily due to lower earnings from mine operations at aurizona and los filos aurizona s earnings from mine operations decreased by 45 4 million primarily due to selling 26 fewer ounces of gold los filos earnings from mine operations decreased by 40 9 million primarily due to an increase in open pit and underground mining costs reflecting more activity to produce a similar amount of gold as los filos moved 14 million more tonnes of waste to process 1 005 more recoverable ounces the company incurred a net loss in q3 2022 of 30 1 million q3 2021 net loss of 8 1 million and a net loss for the nine months ended september 30 2022 of 128 6 million nine months ended september 30 2021 net income of 445 9 million the net losses were impacted by lower

includes interest income and interest expense taxes depreciation and amortization adjusted ebitda is defined as ebitda further adjusted for certain special items that occur during the reporting period as noted below we include ebitda and adjusted ebitda to provide investors with a supplemental measure of our operating performance neither ebitda nor adjusted ebitda is a recognized term under generally accepted accounting principles in the u s gaap accordingly they should not be used as an indicator of or an alternative to net income as a measure of operating performance in addition ebitda

the transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2023 financial results adjusted operating earnings suncor s adjusted operating earnings increased to 2 565 billion 1 88 per common share in the third quarter of 2022 compared to 1 043 billion 0 71 per common share in the prior year quarter primarily due to significantly higher crude oil and refined product realizations reflecting the improved business environment in the current quarter and higher upstream production the increase in adjusted operating earnings was partially offset by increased income taxes royalties and operating expenses in the current quarter the increase in operating expenses was primarily related to a significant increase in commodity input costs increased maintenance and higher costs associated with increased oil sands production adjusted operating earnings were also impacted by a weakening in benchmark pricing during the current quarter compared to a strengthening in benchmark pricing in the prior year quarter resulting in a fifo inventory valuation loss partially offset by a realization of intersegment profit in the third quarter of 2022 compared to a fifo inventory valuation gain

quarter of 2022 compared to 4 718 billion 3 19 per common share in the prior year quarter in addition to the factors impacting adjusted funds from operations cash flow provided by operating activities was impacted by a use of cash associated with the company s working capital balances in the third quarter of 2022 compared to a significant source of cash in the prior year quarter the source of cash in the prior year quarter was primarily due to an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and the receipt of the company s 2020 federal income tax refund operating results suncor s total upstream production increased to 724 100 barrels of oil equivalent per day boe d in the third quarter of 2022 compared to 698 600 boe d in the prior year quarter reflecting increased production from

quarter of 2022 compared to 199 600 bbls d in the third quarter of 2021 primarily due to increased production from fort hills production from the company s in situ assets in the third quarter of 2022

in the third quarter of 2022 was impacted by planned turnaround activities resulting in upgrader utilization of 67 compared to 91 in the prior year quarter at oil sands base upgrader utilization increased to 80 compared to 66 in the prior year quarter reflecting lower planned maintenance activities in the current quarter as the prior year quarter was impacted by a significant planned turnaround at upgrader 2 subsequent to the quarter the company successfully completed its turnaround activities e p production during the third quarter of 2022 was 78 100 boe d compared to 93 500 boe d in the prior year quarter the decrease in production was primarily due to the sale of the company s working interest in the golden eagle area development in the fourth quarter of 2021 the impact of planned turnaround activities at hibernia in the third quarter of 2022 and natural declines partially offset by increased production from norway refinery crude throughput was 466 600 bbls d and refinery utilization was 100 in the third quarter of 2022 compared to 460 300 bbls d and 99 in the prior year quarter reflecting strong utilizations across all refineries in both periods refined product sales in the third quarter of 2022 increased to 577 300 bbls d compared to 551 500 bbls d in the prior year quarter the increase in refined product sales reflected increased demand in the current period combined with the company s ability to leverage its extensive domestic sales network and export channels strong operations at our refining assets resulted in the third highest crude throughput in our company s history and contributed to strong refined product sales during the quarter said smith increased utilization of the interconnecting pipelines helped to minimize the impact of significant planned upstream turnaround activities in the third quarter all major planned maintenance on our assets has been completed early in the fourth quarter and we remain focused on safe reliable operations the company s total operating selling and general expenses were 3 075 billion in the third quarter of 2022 compared to 2 768 billion in the prior year quarter the increase was mainly due to a significant increase in commodity input costs including higher natural gas prices increased maintenance and higher costs associated with increased oil sands production the company s exposure to higher natural gas costs is partially mitigated by revenue from power sales that is recorded in operating revenues strategy update suncor s top priority is improving its safety and operational performance the company s ability to deliver on its operational excellence priorities and drive improved operating performance by operating safely reliably and efficiently is underpinned by suncor s value of safety above all else suncor aims to further grow its profitability by focusing the company s capital investments on high value cash flow initiatives that support its incremental
