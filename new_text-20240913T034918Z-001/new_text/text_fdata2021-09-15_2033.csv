cupertino sept 15 apple inc unveiled the iphone 13 and a new ipad mini yesterday expanding 5g connectivity and showing off faster chips and sharper cameras without raising the phone s price the cupertino california based company did not announce any blockbuster features or products but analysts expect customers hanging onto older models like the iphone x will be eager to upgrade to encourage trade ins participating wireless carriers are offering incentives ahead of the year end holiday season that to make the new phones free to some customers the iphone 13 will have a new chip called the a15 bionic that enables features like automatically translating text the phone also has a better display longer battery life and a cinematic mode for automatically changing focus while taking videos apple said the iphone 13 will have custom 5g antennas and radio components for faster speeds and will come in five colours the phone will start at us 699 rm2 909 24 and participating wireless carriers will offer up to us 700 off for qualifying trade ins the iphone 13 pro starts at us 999 and the pro max starts at us 1 099 with trade in offers of up to us 1 000 all three models will be available september 24 advertisement the prices are unchanged from last year but some carriers such as at t inc will offer the devices for no additional charge with subsidies of up to us 1 000 if customers trade in a previous model and sign up for an installment plan verizon communications inc and t mobile us inc offered similar deals but with slightly lower subsidies up to us 700 the biggest subsidies will go to customers who turn in iphone 11 and iphone 12 models ben bajarin head of consumer technologies at creative strategies said he expects those aggressive subsides will increase as apple and carriers try to hold onto customers advertisement that offer is unique to apple and it s a strength they have to keep these sales cycles going for them and for the carriers bajarin said the iphone is apple s most important product but apple has rolled out a web of service and other products that are seen as locking customers into a system they enjoy and would find expensive to leave the series 7 smart watch will feature a larger display and faster charging it will start at us 399 and be available later this autumn the company also updated its ipad mini with 5g connectivity and a reworked design that makes it look like the higher end ipad air and pro models bob o donnell head of technalysis research said the small tablet was apple s most surprising announcement and could lure in customers who want a device with 5g that can handle more powerful apps than a phone i don t think it replaces any other device like we ve seen apple try to position some of the bigger ipads as pc replacements o donnell said the new ipad mini s price rose by us 100 but it also added new capabilities like compatibility with the company s apple pencil and a faster chip than the larger screened base model ipad bucking a trend of smaller screens being cheaper apple showed the mini in use by professionals like doctors apple also updated its base model ipad with a new camera the new ipad will start at us 329 and the mini at us 499 both will be available next week apple shares closed down about 1 per cent a sharper fall than a slight downturn in broader markets it seems like there s nothing really revolutionary announced but of course as usual they announced enough improvements to at least generate some enthusiasm among consumers said rick meckler partner at family investment office cherry lane investments apple s biggest product launch of the year comes as some of the shine has come off its stock as business practices such as charging software developers commissions on in app payments have come under regulatory scrutiny apple shares were up about 11 6 per cent year to date as of yesterday s close trailing the nasdaq composite index which was up 16 7 per cent over the same period kim forrest founder and chief investment officer at bokeh capital said she was not concerned by the lack of splashy unexpected products since apple s upgrades would keep customers i think the consumer once it gets the apple chip in its head it s very hard to dislodge she said the apple watch has become a cornerstone of its us 30 6 billion accessories segment which was up 25 per cent in apple s most recent fiscal year even as its iphone revenue declined slightly analysts widely believe that apple users who buy more than one product such as an apple watch and iphone are more likely to stick with the brand and spend on the company s apps and services apple focused on fitness features such as improving how the watch tracks bicycling workouts and dust protection for hiking the watch is paired tightly with apple fitness a paid service offering guided workouts with apple instructors the company added pilates skiing oriented workouts and group workouts shares of exercise bike and online training company peloton were down about 1 6 per cent reuters

the tax plan that democrats on the house ways and means committee released on monday did one good thing by removing president biden s proposal to tax unrealized capital gains upon death saving many owners of farms and small businesses but the plan would still hurt the u s economy by making large corporations and the rich pay among the highest marginal tax rates in the world democrats have long argued that the rich and big business don t pay their fair share of taxes the house democratic plan implements this insight by increasing the top marginal individual income tax rate from 37 percent to 39 6 percent and levying an additional 3 percent surcharge for individuals earning more than 5 million annually it also increases the capital gains tax rate from 20 percent to 25 percent and subjects it to the surcharge finally tax rates paid by large corporations would rise to 26 5 percent up from the 21 percent rate established by the 2017 trump tax cut the joint committee on taxation estimates these and other changes would make business and the well to do pay about 2 trillion more in taxes over a 10 year period many people would surely find this acceptable billionaires can afford to hand over a few million dollars more a year to the government the reasoning goes while behemoths such as apple and amazon could also spend less on stock buybacks and dividends to pay for the increased tax hike at a superficial level taking more from people and entities that can afford it and giving it to people who need it sounds like an obvious win win advertisement but this ignores the role state and local taxes play in our system as data from the organization of economic cooperation and development a group comprising the world s richest nations shows combined state and federal corporate tax rates already put the average u s tax burden on businesses in the middle among oecd nations at 25 75 percent the house democratic tax hike would raise that to more than 30 percent that combined rate would give the united states the third highest combined corporate rate in the oecd behind only portugal and colombia on the margin this pushes companies deciding whether to locate in the united states or in other countries to take their investment and jobs elsewhere follow this author henry olsen s opinions follow rich individuals would also face some of the globe s highest marginal tax rates when state local and medicare taxes are factored in u s taxpayers already face an average top marginal rate of 46 percent the house democratic plan would add 5 6 percentage points to that total raising the average top marginal rate to 51 6 percent that s almost as much as famously high tax sweden and would give the united states the 14th highest top marginal individual rate among oecd nations even this understates the rate many would face in high tax states such as new york and california californians earning more than 5 million would face a 58 25 percent marginal rate while new york city residents earning more than 25 million would pay about 60 percent only slovenia belgium and finland levy higher or comparable rates if these people get their money from interest and dividends the 3 8 percent net investment tax pushes their combined marginal rate to more than 62 percent making them the most heavily taxed wealthy people in the world advertisement the capital gains tax hikes would also give the united states the highest marginal capital gains rate in the oecd at 48 4 percent u s rates would be six points higher than those in denmark the country sen bernie sanders i vt often says he wants to emulate if passed the democrats tax hikes would likely accelerate migration from high tax states to low tax states a californian could move from san francisco to boston where massachusetts levies only a 5 percent flat tax and easily come out ahead states totally free of state income taxes such as wyoming and alaska offer beautiful environments while others such as texas and florida offer year round warmth the ultra rich and operators of hedge funds or investment capital firms would be fools not to move to these places costing their former residences potentially billions in lost tax revenue these tax hikes would also likely lead to tax increases for average americans in coming years the administration plans to use this money for new spending not to help close the 1 trillion annual deficits that stretch as far as the eye can see the social security and medicare trust funds will also need shoring up in the next decade if the rich and big business are already the most heavily taxed in the world they probably can t be taxed more to save our entitlements or reduce the deficit that means the money will come from where the rest of the world already gets it the pockets of average taxpayers

updated october 14 2021 at 11 00 a m mit reported an endowment investment return of 55 5 percent for fiscal 2021 and a 49 0 percent increase in the endowment s year end value to 27 4 billion updated september 14 2021 at 7 40 p m as an early indication of just how far might be up for investment returns in the fiscal year ended june 30 the consistently excellent university of virginia investment management company uvimco 20 year annualized rate of return of 10 6 percent reported a 49 percent return for its long term pool in which its endowment is invested although uvimco manages a much smaller pool of assets than harvard management company hmc which oversees the university s 41 9 billion endowment as of june 30 2020 and other investments it pursues a highly diversified strategy like that used at hmc and peer higher education endowments accordingly uvimco s results by asset class are of interest public equities 29 9 percent of assets produced a one year return of 51 4 percent private equity 26 4 percent yielded 98 7 percent apparently driven by venture capital and similar holdings the report refers to the substantial shift to online activities resulting in dramatically accelerated growth for many software and internet businesses long short equity what hmc would call hedge funds 17 0 percent of uvimco s assets produced a 33 3 percent return real assets 10 percent yielded a 49 0 percent return uvimco s report refers to hospitality and retail real estate and rebounding oil prices fixed income returns were negligible 1 4 percent and uvimco s credit portfolio involving financial restructurings realized a return of 29 9 percent it would be surprising if any of the very largest endowments harvard yale princeton stanford performed at uvimco s level and as explained below harvard may trail the top performers among its immediate peers but as uvimco s report reveals the recovery from the pandemic shaped historic returns for well positioned diversified long term investors who have built portfolios oriented to the risks and rewards of owning equity early reports for fiscal year 2021 ended june 30 suggest very robust investment gains for endowments and pension funds what does this imply for harvard management company s hmc results in investing the university s endowment by far the largest source of university revenues the simple answer is of course that it is too soon to tell hmc will report its performance for the period sometime this fall but the hmc team certainly was operating in an environment unusually favorable to owners of financial assets raising the prospect of high returns last seen early in the millennium and during the recovery from the great recession if so that might produce a multibillion dollar increase in the endowment s value which has risen relatively slowly during the past decade given volatile returns and the sums distributed now about 2 billion annually to support academic operations consult the harvard university fact book for endowment value return and distribution data beginning in 1981 the context when the coronavirus pandemic spread around the world in early 2020 economies were shut down with unprecedented severity and speed and financial markets declined precipitously it is hard to remember that now after equally unprecedented government outlays record low interest rates and the advent of vaccination led to swift if still partial economic recoveries and eye popping returns on investments even as owners of bonds endured negligible real returns with interest rates near zero those invested in equities prospered mightily for the year ended june 30 the standard poor s 500 stock index appreciated 41 percent and the nasdaq 100 index 45 percent the wilshire trust universe comparison service a standard analysis of institutional investments reported the best overall results in 35 years with median returns of more than 33 percent for large foundations and endowments assets of 500 million and above in its data a very far cry from harvard s endowment valued at 41 9 billion as of mid 2020 early reports by institutional investors showed robust returns 29 5 percent a record for the massachusetts pension reserves investment management board 21 3 percent below its internal benchmarks for california s giant calpers fund and so on of course each institution has its own needs tolerance for risk and investment strategies a portfolio appropriate for a state pension fund might be unsuitable for an operating entity like a university and even within a sector the results can vary significantly as the massachusetts and california data suggest but there are interesting straws in the wind no one expects a pool of bonds or of cash to drive performance in the current environment and indeed calpers disclosed that its fixed income and liquid cash holdings yielded net rates of return of 0 1 percent and 0 1 percent respectively real assets real estate infrastructure forestland and so on produced a 2 6 percent return through march 31 an interesting result perhaps reflecting the fact that many classes of institutional investors core real estate holdings office buildings hotels retail malls have been punished during the pandemic even as specialized assets warehouses that serve online retailing pools of residential properties or life sciences laboratories have appreciated amid strong demand commodity prices were exceptionally volatile during the past year so the clearly winning assets were equity related a year when risk was rewarded calpers enjoyed a 36 3 percent rate of return on public equities stocks and 43 8 percent for private equity assets valued as of march 31 the massachusetts pension managers realized an even more outsized 70 5 percent return in their private equity portfolio according to a boston globe report such results perhaps reflect the torrid market for initial public offerings from maturing venture capital investments at high valuations and sales of private equity holdings encouraged by the economic recovery and low borrowing costs hmc s holdings as of june 30 2020 its most recent reporting date hmc had 55 3 percent of the endowment invested in public equity equivalents 18 9 percent in public equities per se and 36 4 percent in hedge funds the latter heterogenous category is probably larger than hmc wants it to be longer term as part of a sweeping change in management and strategies the investment team has been reducing investments in real estate natural resources and other real assets in the aggregate now 11 percent of endowment investments and planning to gradually bolster private equity holdings 23 0 percent as reported last october he team s earlier decision to reduce real estate commitments and to spin out that investment team driven by their view of market cycles valuations and the characteristics of such assets versus their risk and reward potential may prove prescient for another reason the pandemic related carnage in the hotel office and retail sectors may depress values in coming years edeployment of investments away from this class of assets may be additive in the future but gaining access to preferred private equity managers investing funds with them and then harvesting the results is a protracted process at best typically seven to 10 years in the interim funds have been deployed into more liquid hedge fund assets and perhaps into cash cash and equivalents represented 5 6 percent of june 2020 assets up considerably from the prior year bond holdings totaled 5 1 percent of endowment assets looking across hmc s holdings which may well have been redeployed significantly from mid 2020 one might project minimal returns from cash and equivalents and bonds robust investment returns on domestic stocks perhaps tempered by foreign and emerging market equities and on the diverse pool of hedge funds which are designed not to be correlated with other markets and therefore may produce performance that varies down or up from the market indexes possibly less negative results than were recorded in 2020 for remaining real estate natural resources and other real assets where hmc has been aggressive about reducing exposure and as necessary realizing losses to redeploy funds and marking down values on the remaining investments and continued strong performance from private equity in light of hmc s relatively recent commitments to this category its returns for this year may be less stellar than those enriching longer term larger investors in the class it is probable that the stratospheric venture capital and private equity returns being reported now originated in investments made right after the great recession 2008 2010 and in the few years following then the period when hmc was most constrained in committing its funds to those classes of assets of course given the break neck speed with which companies have been formed capitalized taken public or acquired and then resold or merged of late it is possible that hmc will be a lucky beneficiary of this historic private equity year but more modest returns relative to those of other institutions at the beginning of what hmc intends as a long term private equity strategy would hardly be surprising in an environment that has lavishly rewarded equity owners hmc s strategic shift in that direction 78 3 percent of endowment investments including public and private assets and its ability to deemphasize real estate and other real assets in a timely way could well have produced a year of memorable absolute performance the crystal ball if hmc s asset allocation were unchanged from mid 2020 it earned nothing overall on its cash fixed income and real assets a down year vs 2020 for bonds but an improvement in the real estate natural resources and other categories and one applied hypothetical investment returns of 20 to 30 percent to the equity holdings it would be an easy back of the envelope calculation to come up with gains for the year of roughly 7 billion to 10 billion reduce those gains by the funds distributed to pay harvard s expenses about 2 billion and increase them by gifts for endowment received perhaps 0 5 billion and the endowment s value at the end of fiscal 2021 approaches 48 billion to 51 billion were the outcome in that ballpark there would be plenty of grist for reflection on the comparative prospects of those better and worse off when the pandemic laid bare some of the wide divisions in american society seen in another light an endowment of about that size would finally after 13 years have gotten back to the real purchasing power in 2008 when the endowment totaled 36 9 billion just weeks before the markets collapsed and the great recession began a long slog toward shoring up harvard s finances for the future during a period of subpar hmc performance and protracted financial constraint and there will surely be analyses pro and con of the restructured hmc s one year performance vs peer endowments the investment team rightly regards any single year as a period of time far too short to be meaningful for such assessments hmc is aiming for superior performance over complete investment cycles up and down and does so with harvard s needs in mind while aiming for perhaps less portfolio risk than some peers more interesting will be the reaction of the corporation which has held the financial reins tight even in the wake of the 9 6 billion harvard campaign will the president and fellows be inclined to consolidate the hard won gains given the recent pandemic challenges and the university s growing dependence on endowment distributions to pay the bills or might they for once indulge in the academic equivalent of animal spirits perhaps challenging especially loyal donors to match a one time distribution to advance the highest priority school and university academic initiatives such speculations

let s look at three cheap canadian stocks that i would buy with 2 000 right now based on their improving long term fundamental outlook when investing in stocks motley fool investors should always pay attention to companies long term fundamentals instead of just looking at its recent stock movement keeping that in mind let s look at three top canadian stocks that i would buy with 2 000 right now based on their improving long term fundamental outlooks rogers communications stock rogers communications tsx rci b nyse rci is one of the top canadian telecom services providers its stock is continuing to underperform the broader market this year as it trades at 60 58 per share with only 3 year to date gains earlier this year rogers communications announced its plans to acquire shaw communications the deal if approved could accelerate rogers s plans to roll out 5g across canada while the deal is yet to get necessary regulatory approvals its recent financials have already started showcasing a sharp recovery from their pandemic lows the company posted nearly 27 yoy year over year earnings growth in the second quarter as its total revenues surged by 13 5 from a year ago despite beating analysts sales estimates in the first half of the year its stock hasn t seen much appreciation that s why long term investors can buy rogers communications stock right now without waiting for its shaw communications acquisition deal to be approved apart from its ongoing financial recovery rogers s dividend yield of about 3 3 makes its stock even more attractive denison mines stock unlike rogers communications the shares of denison mines tsx dml nyse dnn are soaring this year the stock is currently trading at 2 06 per share with 136 gains in 2021 notably its stock has been posting solid double digit gains for the last six quarters in a row denison mines is a toronto based uranium exploration and mining company that has an interest in some large uranium projects like the wheeler river project and mcclean lake uranium mill its ongoing development of high grade phoenix deposits could help the company supply low cost uranium amid recovering demand the company aims to start preproduction activities at its wheeler river project later this year which could be driving a big rally in its stock price this year despite its solid year to date gains denison s consistent progress in developing its key uranium projects still makes its stock look cheap to me that s one reason why i expect this 2 tsx stock to keep soaring in the coming quarters as well restaurant brands stock restaurant brands international tsx qsr nyse qsr could be another great and cheap stock to buy on the tsx right now the canadian fast food restaurant chain firm mainly runs its business under three brands burger king tim hortons and popeyes after the pandemic took a toll on its financial progress last year restaurant brands s sales and earnings in the first half of 2021 have been stronger than its pre pandemic levels its total revenues in the june quarter rose by 37 2 yoy to us 1 4 billion also 4 higher than its sales in the same quarter of 2019 its recent cost reduction efforts along with rising sales helped the company expand its adjusted net profit margin to 24 9 in q2 significantly higher than 14 7 a year ago and 23 6 two years ago despite its sooner than expected financial recovery its stock has risen by only 5 this year on the tsx while the recent surge in delta variant cases might temporarily hurt its financial progress in the ongoing quarter i expect its long term growth outlook to remain unaffected that s why long term investors can consider buying qsr stock at a bargain right now
kdhl farm director jerry groskreutz was delivered a surprise this morning live during the morning show in 2020 it was announced that jerry would be inducted into the minnesota ffa hall of fame because of covid there was no banquet so he did not receive the nice plaque designating the honor steve olson ffa hof board member former minnesota turkey grower s association executive director stopped by kdhl on his way to iowa he phoned ahead of time to inform us of his desire to give jerry the plaque however nobody told jerry this was happening the plaque reads minnesota ffa hall of fame presented to jerry groskreutz in recognition of your contributions to agricultural education and ffa in minnesota jerry admitted he had no clue until olson arrived in the studio to visit with him olson didn t simply give him the plaque he interviewed jerry to find out more about his passion for ffa the presentation was done on kdhl and facebook live which you can enjoy below a transcript of the audio from the presentation and interview is available below if you prefer to read steve olson 00 00 last year you were inducted into the minnesota ffa hall of fame and i have the honor of co chairing that committee and of course with the convention going virtual instead of in person we didn t have the chance to get you the award in person so i guess maybe i did collude with some of your counterparts here and just said hey can i stop by i was on the way down to iowa and can i stop by and present this in person to jerr and so the plaque says i m going to read this but i ve got some questions for you too so the ffa hall of fame presented to jerry grosskreutz in recognition of your contributions to agricultural education and ffa in minnesota minnesota ffa convention 2020 jerry groskreutz 00 34 it s really quite an honor i don t brag about myself very well but it s just such a joy working with these great kids and maybe i have a small part in their development as they grow and mature steve olson 00 44 what i wanted to ask you to tell me you know this is kind of nice to be able to interview you i m jerry groskreutz 00 48 i m used to asking the questions steve olson 00 50 i know you are i know you are so um so why have you been involved in ag education and ffa jerry groskreutz 00 55 my degree in college was in ag education never did teach but maybe i m using my ag education degree now and when i had the opportunity to come here to kdhl of course kdhl had a long tradition going back to dean curtis with working with youth or youth organizations like 4h and the ffa and it s just so much fun hanging around these kids steve olson 01 15 a little bit more about what you ve done cause i know that one of the things that when we talked you know a year and a half ago or so that you said that typically you re one of the first people that ever interviews ffa members when they re at the national convention or state jerry groskreutz 01 26 one of the most rewarding experiences is i ve worked with a lot of ffa chapters at state and national conventions and the advisors tell these kids you have to stop by and do an interview with jerry because they see it as a learning and development experience for them and you can tell some of these kids are pretty intimidated and hyperventilating just a bit and you help them along and they realize maybe it wasn t so bad in the next year you know they stick out in your mind and next year it goes better by the time they get to be a junior or senior i ask them one question about what they re doing at the convention i don t get to talk again steve olson 02 00 i m not even gonna go there what that must be like for you but the hall of fame is recognizing individuals that have made a significant contribution over a long period of time to ag education but also you know the community as a whole you know both from agriculture as well as outside of agriculture so talk a little bit more about what some of your involvement has been you know with agriculture but within the community jerry groskreutz 02 21 one of my favorite events i m on the fairbault chamber of congress agribusiness committee and this was another tradition that was going when i came to kdhl they called it the adoptive third grade program where members would go into the classroom and talk to these third graders about where food comes from and then we later on in the spring bus em up out to a farm so they could see a farm well kevin estrem really took that over doing the ag in the classroom and he got so busy and he was traveling around the country so he asked if a couple of us could take over for the last number of years brent fuchs and i have gone to all the third grade classes except of course a covid year and we would get all these things from the store that the kids would recognize and then relate it all back to corn and soybeans grown right outside of faribault and we don t get into gmo or non gmo or any of those kinds of things we just want these kids to make the connection that if you like to eat you need a farmer steve olson 03 12 yeah i think that s important and again it s just letting them know early on and the fact that this stuff has been raised contributes to the community right in their backyard jerry groskreutz 03 20 with your passion for livestock we really relate to the consumers side these livestock too steve olson 03 26 it s about time you get that so what s your most memorable activity involved in ag education or promoting agriculture jerry groskreutz 03 33 i was stumped by a third grade girl we were talking about again our friend kevin eastern that passed away but when he was a young boy he was burned really badly spent a number of weeks up at the burn unit at hennepin county and it was actually pig skin that was grafted on his arms and pigs hair was growing on his arm and we relayed it back to the pig saved kevin s life and then one little girl said well i remember my parents talking about my grandma had a pig s valve in her heart it saved her life and this little girl raised her hand and said don t you have to kill the pigs and i looked at brent and brent looked at me and the wheels were spinning and brent actually thought of something first he said well yes we do have to harvest the pigs and that got my mind thinking i said see this little corn seed we plant this it grows into that great big stock and this ear of corn the sole purpose that seed was planted for was to make people s lives better in the same way these animals on the farm their sole purpose in life is to make people s lives better steve olson 04 34 yeah i think that s what you do a great job of you telling stories and i think that s what people relate to it gives all of us a better understanding of what the message is you re trying to deliver so the hall of fame has only you know i think we ve been around 17 years or so it was started in 2004 and 222 individuals have been inducted so you re one of 222 what does this mean to you jerry groskreutz 04 53 i don t deserve this i just do what i love to do tell that story of agriculture and i had the opportunity to do that i have a big microphone but i still get to go out to the farm and work with the livestock industry and actually raise crops i haven t done anything that brent and all the other members of the committee haven t done i m just getting recognized for it so maybe this is recognition for them too steve olson 05 15 that s for sure what s your message to ffa members youth that aren t in ffa yet ag teachers jerry groskreutz 05 19 the opportunity through 4h another one of my favorite youth organizations explore all those different project areas all those different i call them judging contests yet even though they call them cdes find out what your passion is and then we need you in agriculture we need our best and brightest to produce food for a hungry world no matter what your career is whether it s a chemist or you like computers we need all of those people in agriculture steve olson 05 43 i echo those comments and so on behalf of all of the education students ffa members ag teachers across the state of minnesota over you know since it s been around thank you for your contributions to education jerry groskreutz 05 54 well thank you steve and thank you to the ffa organizations and all the area ffa chapters that make my job easy and enjoyable thank you steve i ve worked with jerry ever since he arrived at kdhl in the mid 90 s his passion for agriculture is very evident jerry is concerned about the future of agriculture which is one of the reasons ffa is important to him i know he s related to me over the years when he was a kid he was interviewed by kdhl legend dean curtis also in the ffa hall of fame when jerry received an award at a banquet my knees were shaking like a leaf and i didn t even have to say anything mr curtis was very nice to me and made me feel comfortable little did jerry know way back then i had to get that dig in because he s older than me that he would eventually be the farm director at kdhl i have a feeling jerry s dad and dean curtis are smiling as wide as the grand canyon in heaven seeing him continue the great tradition of service to farmers and their families in minnesota a very deserving honor for jerry groskreutz officially a member of the minnesota ffa hall of fame this is interesting to read see how school cafeteria meals have changed over the past 100 years using government and news reports stacker has traced the history of cafeteria meals from their inception to the present day with data from news and government reports read on to see how various legal acts food trends and budget cuts have changed what kids are getting on their trays sometimes people think of animals when they think about farming

of all the candidates trying to unseat california gov gavin newsom in the recall election wrapping up tuesday conservative talk show host larry elder has the best chance elder works for the right wing broadcaster salem media group an outfit that has quietly become one of the most powerful forces in conservative media with hosts who peddle discredited claims about covid 19 last year s elections and more but salem media is not merely an employer for elder it is a platform a vehicle and an outright backer for him in this race polls suggest the recall attempt will fail yet elder stands out as the candidate likely to post the most votes should newsom falter and whatever success he has derives in large part from the significant support of salem media salem media group contributed 35 000 to elder just last week under california law corporations are allowed to give money directly to candidates campaigns on sunday elder was the featured speaker at an annual event sponsored by the conservative website townhall and krla am radio in southern california the home station for elder s nationally syndicated radio show both outlets are owned by salem media another krla host jennifer horn who was helping to moderate the evening s event noted that for legal reasons salem couldn t have him stage a true campaign style rally but it was at times hard to tell the difference elder sat comfortably microphone in hand bantering with his colleagues in a way tailor made to stir last minute supporters to vote your question was what would i do when i become governor elder asked drawing fervent applause as he lingered on the word when elder jokes of being the black face of white supremacy horn had introduced him to hundreds of cheering fans at a hyatt regency in orange county by his preferred nickname the sage of south central elder grew up in south los angeles went to brown university and earned a degree in law at the university of michigan yet he would not make his mark in law if his unlikely bid succeeds elder would be the first african american governor for the nation s most populous state he would also bring a record of years of brashly stated policy beliefs particularly on matters of race and gender intended to stir outrage among millions of the liberals who would number among his new constituents at the event sunday elder promised to kill any of newsom s coronavirus

kdhl farm director jerry groskreutz was delivered a surprise this morning live during the morning show in 2020 it was announced that jerry would be inducted into the minnesota ffa hall of fame because of covid there was no banquet so he did not receive the nice plaque designating the honor steve olson ffa hof board member former minnesota turkey grower s association executive director stopped by kdhl on his way to iowa he phoned ahead of time to inform us of his desire to give jerry the plaque however nobody told jerry this was happening the plaque reads minnesota ffa hall of fame presented to jerry groskreutz in recognition of your contributions to agricultural education and ffa in minnesota jerry admitted he had no clue until olson arrived in the studio to visit with him olson didn t simply give him the plaque he interviewed jerry to find out more about his passion for ffa the presentation was done on kdhl and facebook live which you can enjoy below a transcript of the audio from the presentation and interview is available below if you prefer to read steve olson 00 00 last year you were inducted into the minnesota ffa hall of fame and i have the honor of co chairing that committee and of course with the convention going virtual instead of in person we didn t have the chance to get you the award in person so i guess maybe i did collude with some of your counterparts here and just said hey can i stop by i was on the way down to iowa and can i stop by and present this in person to jerr and so the plaque says i m going to read this but i ve got some questions for you too so the ffa hall of fame presented to jerry grosskreutz in recognition of your contributions to agricultural education and ffa in minnesota minnesota ffa convention 2020 jerry groskreutz 00 34 it s really quite an honor i don t brag about myself very well but it s just such a joy working with these great kids and maybe i have a small part in their development as they grow and mature steve olson 00 44 what i wanted to ask you to tell me you know this is kind of nice to be able to interview you i m jerry groskreutz 00 48 i m used to asking the questions steve olson 00 50 i know you are i know you are so um so why have you been involved in ag education and ffa jerry groskreutz 00 55 my degree in college was in ag education never did teach but maybe i m using my ag education degree now and when i had the opportunity to come here to kdhl of course kdhl had a long tradition going back to dean curtis with working with youth or youth organizations like 4h and the ffa and it s just so much fun hanging around these kids steve olson 01 15 a little bit more about what you ve done cause i know that one of the things that when we talked you know a year and a half ago or so that you said that typically you re one of the first people that ever interviews ffa members when they re at the national convention or state jerry groskreutz 01 26 one of the most rewarding experiences is i ve worked with a lot of ffa chapters at state and national conventions and the advisors tell these kids you have to stop by and do an interview with jerry because they see it as a learning and development experience for them and you can tell some of these kids are pretty intimidated and hyperventilating just a bit and you help them along and they realize maybe it wasn t so bad in the next year you know they stick out in your mind and next year it goes better by the time they get to be a junior or senior i ask them one question about what they re doing at the convention i don t get to talk again steve olson 02 00 i m not even gonna go there what that must be like for you but the hall of fame is recognizing individuals that have made a significant contribution over a long period of time to ag education but also you know the community as a whole you know both from agriculture as well as outside of agriculture so talk a little bit more about what some of your involvement has been you know with agriculture but within the community jerry groskreutz 02 21 one of my favorite events i m on the fairbault chamber of congress agribusiness committee and this was another tradition that was going when i came to kdhl they called it the adoptive third grade program where members would go into the classroom and talk to these third graders about where food comes from and then we later on in the spring bus em up out to a farm so they could see a farm well kevin estrem really took that over doing the ag in the classroom and he got so busy and he was traveling around the country so he asked if a couple of us could take over for the last number of years brent fuchs and i have gone to all the third grade classes except of course a covid year and we would get all these things from the store that the kids would recognize and then relate it all back to corn and soybeans grown right outside of faribault and we don t get into gmo or non gmo or any of those kinds of things we just want these kids to make the connection that if you like to eat you need a farmer steve olson 03 12 yeah i think that s important and again it s just letting them know early on and the fact that this stuff has been raised contributes to the community right in their backyard jerry groskreutz 03 20 with your passion for livestock we really relate to the consumers side these livestock too steve olson 03 26 it s about time you get that so what s your most memorable activity involved in ag education or promoting agriculture jerry groskreutz 03 33 i was stumped by a third grade girl we were talking about again our friend kevin eastern that passed away but when he was a young boy he was burned really badly spent a number of weeks up at the burn unit at hennepin county and it was actually pig skin that was grafted on his arms and pigs hair was growing on his arm and we relayed it back to the pig saved kevin s life and then one little girl said well i remember my parents talking about my grandma had a pig s valve in her heart it saved her life and this little girl raised her hand and said don t you have to kill the pigs and i looked at brent and brent looked at me and the wheels were spinning and brent actually thought of something first he said well yes we do have to harvest the pigs and that got my mind thinking i said see this little corn seed we plant this it grows into that great big stock and this ear of corn the sole purpose that seed was planted for was to make people s lives better in the same way these animals on the farm their sole purpose in life is to make people s lives better steve olson 04 34 yeah i think that s what you do a great job of you telling stories and i think that s what people relate to it gives all of us a better understanding of what the message is you re trying to deliver so the hall of fame has only you know i think we ve been around 17 years or so it was started in 2004 and 222 individuals have been inducted so you re one of 222 what does this mean to you jerry groskreutz 04 53 i don t deserve this i just do what i love to do tell that story of agriculture and i had the opportunity to do that i have a big microphone but i still get to go out to the farm and work with the livestock industry and actually raise crops i haven t done anything that brent and all the other members of the committee haven t done i m just getting recognized for it so maybe this is recognition for them too steve olson 05 15 that s for sure what s your message to ffa members youth that aren t in ffa yet ag teachers jerry groskreutz 05 19 the opportunity through 4h another one of my favorite youth organizations explore all those different project areas all those different i call them judging contests yet even though they call them cdes find out what your passion is and then we need you in agriculture we need our best and brightest to produce food for a hungry world no matter what your career is whether it s a chemist or you like computers we need all of those people in agriculture steve olson 05 43 i echo those comments and so on behalf of all of the education students ffa members ag teachers across the state of minnesota over you know since it s been around thank you for your contributions to education jerry groskreutz 05 54 well thank you steve and thank you to the ffa organizations and all the area ffa chapters that make my job easy and enjoyable thank you steve i ve worked with jerry ever since he arrived at kdhl in the mid 90 s his passion for agriculture is very evident jerry is concerned about the future of agriculture which is one of the reasons ffa is important to him i know he s related to me over the years when he was a kid he was interviewed by kdhl legend dean curtis also in the ffa hall of fame when jerry received an award at a banquet my knees were shaking like a leaf and i didn t even have to say anything mr curtis was very nice to me and made me feel comfortable little did jerry know way back then i had to get that dig in because he s older than me that he would eventually be the farm director at kdhl i have a feeling jerry s dad and dean curtis are smiling as wide as the grand canyon in heaven seeing him continue the great tradition of service to farmers and their families in minnesota a very deserving honor for jerry groskreutz officially a member of the minnesota ffa hall of fame this is interesting to read see how school cafeteria meals have changed over the past 100 years using government and news reports stacker has traced the history of cafeteria meals from their inception to the present day with data from news and government reports read on to see how various legal acts food trends and budget cuts have changed what kids are getting on their trays sometimes people think of animals when they think about farming

of all the candidates trying to unseat california gov gavin newsom in the recall election wrapping up tuesday conservative talk show host larry elder has the best chance elder works for the right wing broadcaster salem media group an outfit that has quietly become one of the most powerful forces in conservative media with hosts who peddle discredited claims about covid 19 last year s elections and more but salem media is not merely an employer for elder it is a platform a vehicle and an outright backer for him in this race polls suggest the recall attempt will fail yet elder stands out as the candidate likely to post the most votes should newsom falter and whatever success he has derives in large part from the significant support of salem media salem media group contributed 35 000 to elder just last week under california law corporations are allowed to give money directly to candidates campaigns on sunday elder was the featured speaker at an annual event sponsored by the conservative website townhall and krla am radio in southern california the home station for elder s nationally syndicated radio show both outlets are owned by salem media another krla host jennifer horn who was helping to moderate the evening s event noted that for legal reasons salem couldn t have him stage a true campaign style rally but it was at times hard to tell the difference elder sat comfortably microphone in hand bantering with his colleagues in a way tailor made to stir last minute supporters to vote your question was what would i do when i become governor elder asked drawing fervent applause as he lingered on the word when elder jokes of being the black face of white supremacy horn had introduced him to hundreds of cheering fans at a hyatt regency in orange county by his preferred nickname the sage of south central elder grew up in south los angeles went to brown university and earned a degree in law at the university of michigan yet he would not make his mark in law if his unlikely bid succeeds elder would be the first african american governor for the nation s most populous state he would also bring a record of years of brashly stated policy beliefs particularly on matters of race and gender intended to stir outrage among millions of the liberals who would number among his new constituents at the event sunday elder promised to kill any of newsom s coronavirus related mandates joked with another radio host that he was the black face of white supremacy and defended himself from earlier criticism that he had argued women were not as smart as men elder told attendees that he s not against the vaccines for covid 19 and that he himself has been vaccinated but he questioned the need for government mandates on his radio show he has given ample time to those

of all the candidates trying to unseat california gov gavin newsom in the recall election wrapping up tuesday conservative talk show host larry elder has the best chance elder works for the right wing broadcaster salem media group an outfit that has quietly become one of the most powerful forces in conservative media with hosts who peddle discredited claims about covid 19 last year s elections and more but salem media is not merely an employer for elder it is a platform a vehicle and an outright backer for him in this race polls suggest the recall attempt will fail yet elder stands out as the candidate likely to post the most votes should newsom falter and whatever success he has derives in large part from the significant support of salem media salem media group contributed 35 000 to elder just last week under california law corporations are allowed to give money directly to candidates campaigns on sunday elder was the featured speaker at an annual event sponsored by the conservative website townhall and krla am radio in southern california the home station for elder s nationally syndicated radio show both outlets are owned by salem media another krla host jennifer horn who was helping to moderate the evening s event noted that for legal reasons salem couldn t have him stage a true campaign style rally but it was at times hard to tell the difference elder sat comfortably microphone in hand bantering with his colleagues in a way tailor made to stir last minute supporters to vote your question was what would i do when i become governor elder asked drawing fervent applause as he lingered on the word when elder jokes of being the black face of white supremacy horn had introduced him to hundreds of cheering fans at a hyatt regency in orange county by his preferred nickname the sage of south central elder grew up in south los angeles went to brown university and earned a degree in law at the university of michigan yet he would not make his mark in law if his unlikely bid succeeds elder would be the first african american governor for the nation s most populous state he would also bring a record of years of brashly stated policy beliefs particularly on matters of race and gender intended to stir outrage among millions of the liberals who would number among his new constituents at the event sunday elder promised to kill any of newsom s coronavirus related mandates joked with another radio host that he was the black face of white supremacy and defended himself from earlier criticism that he had argued women were not as smart as men elder told attendees that he s not against the vaccines for covid 19 and that he himself has been vaccinated but he questioned the need for government mandates on his radio show he has given ample time to those casting doubt on the effectiveness of the vaccines themselves and he has also amplified false claims that the 2020 election was stolen from former president donald trump such controversies might inspire rebukes from some employers not so at salem media which has welcomed conspiracy theorists into its lineups as a warmup for elder s appearance on sunday hosts interviewed a rogue s gallery of trump surrogates former trump white house adviser sebastian gorka turning point usa founder charlie kirk and blaze and fox news host mark levin all of them are employed by various outlets of salem media salem media seeks to appeal to a voter base of fundamentalist christians who are urged to the polls based on their conservative and sometimes socially regressive beliefs anti abortion anti lgbt etc says columbia university scholar anne nelson author of shadow network a book on the political alliance of conservative media and religious and business groups brothers in law founded salem media as a religious broadcaster salem media s founders were a pair of brothers in law stuart epperson and edward g atsinger iii they established the outfit in 1986 as a religious broadcaster their mission has now expanded to incorporate conservative fundamentalist christianity and to promote victories by like minded republicans salem media which is publicly traded on nasdaq now owns more than 100 stations making it among the largest radio groups in the country it says it syndicates its programs to 3 000 stations nationwide additionally it owns a welter of conservative opinion sites including not just townhall but also hotair pj media redstate and twitchy salem media claims more than 200 million unique users a month a figure that s hard to verify but nelson says that through the radio stations and the sites salem media can encourage trump minded people to vote especially in more conservative swing states in the midwest and south elder had been a nationally syndicated host twice for abc radio in los angeles when he was let go the second time in 2015 salem hired him nelson says he s found ways to align himself with his even more conservative bosses elder has kind of gravitated towards endorsing these positions and tapping into that voter base with this massive radio network support that s built under him nelson tells npr the senior executive at salem media assigned to handle media inquiries did not respond to three messages left by npr over five days seeking an interview for this story elder s campaign also did not respond to requests for comment in 2018 salem media fired writers at redstate who were deemed insufficiently supportive of trump according to reports in cnn and elsewhere salem media puts extreme content behind a paywall behind paywalls some salem media commentators offer even more extreme takes in july pj media editor paula bolyard warned readers that the critical reaction to the site s coverage of covid 19 especially its caustic takes on public health officials had taken a toll and bolyard wrote there was a reason she was asking readers to subscribe to get past the paywalls she did not want to subject her site s most powerful posts to scrutiny regular readers of pj media know that much of our covid 19 coverage has been behind a paywall accessible only to our vip subscribers bolyard wrote it s just not worth our time to have to deal with the fact checkers who have been working overtime to discredit us and damage our reputation behind the paywalls for various salem media sites writers and podcasters have blasted the use of masks and vaccines against covid 19 and instead promoted discredited cures additionally hosts unleash coarse rants against the media and glory in their ability to evade not just fact checkers but social media moderators on repeated paywalled streaming videos redstate s scott hounsell raises aloft a middle finger to facebook s mark zuckerberg and twitter s jack dorsey to be clear salem an explicitly conservative fundamentalist christian media company charges viewers listeners and readers money to access uncensored and profane content yet unfettered conspiracy theories can be found in free content too on the free version of the townhall podcast triggered hosts matt vespa and storm paglia earlier this year called congress a disgrace they mused why anyone should be surprised by the violent jan 6 insurrection at the u s capitol moments later however they concluded the event wasn t real but a setup by the fbi in july on his salem radio show elder took a call from a voter urging him to run and suggesting that the vote might be sabotaged against him elder laughed at the trump like prediction of electoral fraud and said he wouldn t be surprised in more recent days elder s campaign has set up an official site claiming fraud is taking place in the california recall race even though the election has yet to wrap up it s a claim unsupported by any meaningful evidence that s

apple unveiled its next iphone line up including a model that offers twice the storage available in earlier versions and other modest upgrades to last year s editions that proved to be a big hit among consumers devouring the latest technology during the pandemic the pre recorded video event streamed tuesday gave apple a chance to present a polished story following a turbulent few weeks the recent bumps included a hastily patched security vulnerability that could let hackers secretly take control of iphones and other apple devices a backlash to the company s plans to scan iphones for images of child sex abuse and a federal judge s ruling that chipped away further at the competitive barrier apple built around its app store which generates billions of dollars in profits each year as has been the case since apple s late co founder unveiled the first iphone in 2007 apple executives talked reverently about the latest model even though it isn t dramatically different from the version apple released nearly a year ago like last year s model the new iphone 13 will come in four different designs with prices starting from 700 to 1 100 they re scheduled to be in stores september 24 it s an incremental upgrade said gartner analyst tuong nguyen some of the new features are impressive but most of them are not noticeable or practical for most users seen on the screen of a device in la habra calif the new iphone 13 pro smartphones are introduced during a virtual event held to announce new apple products tuesday sept 14 2021 credit ap photo jae c hong possibly the most notable change in the latest high end iphone 13 will be an option for a full terabyte of storage that s 1 000 gigabytes on the device up from its previous maximum of 512 gigabytes that s enough storage to accommodate roughly 250 000 photos or about 500 hours of high definition video having a massive amount of storage could become more important to many consumers with the advent of ultra high definition video and ultrafast wireless 5g networks that will make downloading content faster and easier nguyen said apple is also promising better cameras on the iphone 13 including an improved ultrawide lens a cinematic like video feature and technology for better nighttime pictures the latter mirrors a feature google has long offered in its line of pixel phones which haven t been big sellers yet as usual the latest iphones are supposed to have longer lasting batteries too we keep making the iphone more capable apple ceo tim cook boasted seen on the screen of a device in la habra calif new apple watch series 7 models are introduced during a virtual event held to announce new apple products tuesday sept 14 2021 credit ap photo jae c hong these kinds of incremental upgrades have become routine for apple and other device makers in recent years as the pace of smartphone innovation slowed even while prices for some phones have climbed above 1 000 that trend has prompted more consumers to hold on to their older smartphones for longer periods but the release of last year s iphone 12 unleashed one of apple s biggest sales spurts since 2014 possibly because the pandemic helped make homebound people realize it was time to get a newer and better model than what they had been using through the first six months of this year apple s iphone sales have surged by nearly 60 from the same time last year that boom has helped push apple s stock price near its all time highs recently giving the company a market value of about 2 5 trillion more than twice what it was before the pandemic began 18 months

legend holds that when the university of georgia trustees were searching for a spot to establish the school in the late 1700s they considered watkinsville then a stagecoach crossroads ten miles south of modern day athens its one downside according to the trustees the eagle tavern the tavern had drinking gambling dancing and music says joann hubert who works at the oconee county welcome center so the trustees opted for a farm in the middle of nowhere ironically that farmland is now downtown athens home to roughly eighty bars in a single square mile today the eagle tavern stands as a museum heralding its riotous history back in the early 1800s you couldn t travel far or fast so there were these little taverns and stagecoach stops all throughout georgia hubert says this is one of the last remaining examples a center of public life the tavern had one door for men to enter the bar and a second for women to visit the trading post it was located right across from the courthouse so court day was like a festival hubert says of the locals who would stop in for a drink and to see which neighbor might end up in the stocks across the street photo courtesy of visit oconee county upstairs rooms were reserved for paying stagecoach passengers although two or three strangers would have to share a bed but buying a dram of mead currant wine or rose water at the bar also bought patrons the right to lay a pallet on the barroom floor a last call though was never guaranteed in fact an itinerant preacher once wrote in his diary after spending a night above the late night revelers that he prayed to never be sent back to watkinsville again during the pandemic the museum closed for critical foundation repairs but it will reopen in october in the meantime walk through visit oconee county s virtual tour to see the museum s period furniture and trinkets including rope beds trunks and snuff boxes in the upstairs sleeping quarters checker boards serving ware and dining tables remain across from the downstairs bar which is still encased by the wooden bars used to protect the alcohol at night a few original artifacts include a violin and top hat that were found in the attic during restoration work in the 1960s likely left by guests a century before photo courtesy of visit oconee county another relic hubert and her colleagues preserve the recipes that travelers would have enjoyed at the tavern which can be found compiled from memory and research by locals in a 1980 community cookbook find a few examples here currant wine gather your currants when weather is dry and they are full ripe strip them carefully from stalks and put them in wooden vessel and bruise well with wooden pestle and let stand twenty four hours after which strain and add three pounds of pounded sugar to every four quarts of the liquor and then shake and stir it well fill the vessel and put a quart of brandy to every five gallons as soon as it is fine bottle and cork it off rose water or violet water an 1875 recipe from isabella billups johnston whose family once owned the eagle tavern take same weight of rose or violet petals as brandy place in decanter and cork shake daily for ten days then add a pint of rainwater strain into your permanent decanter cure for baldness brew a strong tea made from the bark scrapings of an old dogwood tree and apply once a day and it will be remarkably effective it must be rubbed in well make the tea and keep in a fancy capped bottle for use

and showing off faster chips and sharper cameras without raising the phone s price the cupertino california based company did not announce any blockbuster features or products but analysts expect customers hanging onto older models like the iphone x will be eager to upgrade to encourage trade ins participating wireless carriers are offering incentives ahead of the year end holiday season that to make the new phones free to some customers the iphone 13 will have a new chip called the a15 bionic that enables features like automatically translating text the phone also has a better display longer battery life and a cinematic mode for automatically changing focus while taking videos apple said the iphone 13 will have custom 5g antennas and radio components for faster speeds and will come in five colors the phone will start at 699 and participating wireless carriers will offer up to 700 off for qualifying trade ins the iphone 13 pro starts at 999 and the pro max starts at 1 099 with trade in offers of up to 1 000 all three models will be available sept 24 the prices are unchanged from last year but some carriers such as at t inc will offer the devices for no additional charge with subsidies of up to 1 000 if customers trade in a previous model and sign up for an installment plan verizon communications inc and t mobile us inc offered similar deals but with slightly lower subsidies up to 700 the biggest subsidies will go to customers who turn in iphone 11 and iphone 12 models ben bajarin head of consumer technologies at creative strategies said he expects those aggressive subsides will increase as apple and carriers try to hold onto customers that offer is unique to apple and it s a strength they have to keep these sales cycles going for them and for the carriers bajarin said the iphone is apple s most important product but apple has rolled out a web of service and other products that are seen as locking customers into a system they enjoy and would find expensive to leave the series 7 smart watch will feature a larger display and faster charging it will start at 399 and be available later this autumn the company also updated its ipad mini with 5g connectivity and a reworked design that makes it look like the higher end ipad air and pro models bob o donnell head of technalysis research said the small tablet was apple s most surprising announcement and could lure in customers who want a device with 5g that can handle more powerful apps than a phone i don t think it replaces any other device like we ve seen apple try to position some of the bigger ipads as pc replacements o donnell said the new ipad mini s price rose by 100 but it also added new capabilities like compatibility with the company s apple pencil and a faster chip than the larger screened base model ipad bucking a trend of smaller screens being cheaper apple showed the mini in use by professionals like doctors apple also updated its base model ipad with a new camera the new ipad will start at 329 and the mini at 499 both will be available next week apple shares closed down about 1 a sharper fall than a slight downturn in broader markets it seems like there s

menafn newsin asia new york september 13 according to new york times the war has destroyed 40 of the food crops in afghanistan and the people are likely to face starvation in the coming winter in 2020 the international community had pledged us 12 billion in the hope that peace will prevail as the us and the taliban negotiated a settlement that would usher in an inclusive government but those hopes and plans went up in smoke with the taliban takeover in august 2021 with a monopoly of power in the nyt issue of september 13 the authors marc santora nick cumming bruce and christina goldbaum say millions of afghans could run out of food before the arrival of winter and one million children are at risk of starvation and death if their immediate needs are not met top united nations officials warned on monday putting the country s plight into stark relief for similar articles join our whatsapp group for the latest updates click here secretary general antónio guterres speaking at a high level u n conference in geneva convened to address the crisis said that since the taliban takeover in afghanistan last month the nation s poverty rate has soared and basic public services have neared collapse and in the past year hundreds of thousands of people have been made homeless after being forced to flee fighting after decades of war suffering and insecurity they face perhaps their most perilous hour mr guterres said adding that one in three afghans do not know where they will get their next meal the deepening humanitarian crisis tops a dizzying array of challenges confronting the new taliban regime as it navigates governing a country propped up for decades by aid from international donors speaking to the news media on monday afternoon mr guterres said more than 1 billion in aid pledges had been made at the meeting by the international community which is still grappling with how to work with an organization like the taliban with a history of brutality and human rights abuses across the country the telltale signs of a humanitarian crisis have grown more and more pronounced each day in wardak province less than an hour s drive west of kabul afghanistan s capital the taliban s military campaign brought the local economy to a standstill this summer weeks after the taliban seized power most cross border trade and many local businesses have yet to reopen leaving many without any income even as food prices soar there is security now we are happy about that said zakaria a villager in wardak province s chak district and a former taliban fighter who was serving a 16 year sentence in pul e charkhi prison in kabul when the taliban seized power and freed inmates but there is no work the people are not able to make any money he added the price of flour doubled at the local market zakaria said villagers stopped cooking chicken and other meat now a luxury in favor of less expensive meals of beans and rice many started eating less uncertain how they will pay for their next meal even as widespread malnutrition looms the hospitals that once treated people for starvation now face potential collapse at a local hospital in chak e wardak administrators have been unable to pay salaries or purchase new medicines with banks still closed according to faridullah the facility s resident doctor medicine facilities and livelihood are provided by foreign countries dr faridullah said we have no shortages in the hospital now but our own facilities and personnel depend on funds coming from abroad and we can t access them the prospect of humanitarian catastrophe long looming over the nation now poses an immediate threat to its children nearly 10 million girls and boys depend on humanitarian assistance just to survive henrietta h fore the executive director of unicef said at the conference at least one million children will suffer from severe acute malnutrition this year and could die without treatment even before the taliban swept across the country and took control of the government afghanistan was confronting a dire food crisis as drought enveloped the nation on monday in his first public remarks to congress secretary of state antony j blinken defended the biden administration s withdrawal from afghanistan saying there was no reason to believe the country would have stabilized had the united states remained there s no evidence that staying longer would have made the afghan security forces or the afghan government any more resilient or self sustaining mr blinken told the house foreign affairs committee in a live teleconference call if 20 years and hundreds of billions of dollars in support equipment and training did not suffice why would another year or five or 10 make a difference mr blinken said the biden administration would not abandon afghanistan and on monday linda thomas greenfield america s ambassador to the united nations promised 64 million in new funding for food and medical aid the world food program estimates that 40 percent of afghanistan s crops are lost the price of wheat has gone up by 25 percent and the aid agency s own food stock is expected to run out by the end of september the suffering wrought by conflict and made worse by climate change has been compounded by the uncertainty that has accompanied the taliban s ascent with many international aid workers having fled the country out of safety concerns those who remain are unsure if they will be able to continue their work during the conference on monday the u n said it needed 606 million in emergency funding to address the immediate crisis while acknowledging that money alone will not be enough the organization has pressed the taliban to provide assurances that aid workers can go about their business safely by the end of the gathering international pledges had surpassed the amount requested but even as the taliban sought to make that pledge the u n s human rights chief michelle bachelet also speaking in geneva said afghanistan was in a new and perilous phase since the militant islamist group seized power in contradiction to assurances that the taliban would uphold women s rights over the past three weeks women have instead been progressively excluded from the public sphere she said a warning that the taliban would need to use more than words to demonstrate their commitment to aid workers safety monday s conference was also intended to drive home the enormousness of the crisis and offer some reassurance to western governments hesitant to provide assistance that could legitimize the authority of a taliban government that includes leaders identified by the u n as international terrorists with links to al qaeda martin griffiths the u n s director of humanitarian and emergency relief operations visited kabul last week and said taliban authorities had promised to facilitate the delivery of aid we assure you that we will remove previous and current impediments in front of your assistance and all related projects working under supervision of u n and other international organizations in afghanistan the taliban said in commitments that mr griffiths read out to the conference the taliban also promised to protect the life and property of humanitarian workers and safeguard their compounds what happens to the women of afghanistan the last time the taliban were in power they barred women and girls from taking most jobs or going to school afghan women have made many gains since the taliban were toppled but now they fear that ground may be lost taliban officials are trying to reassure women that things will be different but there are signs that at least in some areas they have begun to reimpose the old order what does their victory mean for terrorist groups the united states invaded afghanistan 20 years ago in response to terrorism and many worry that al qaeda and other radical groups will again find safe haven there on aug 26 deadly explosions outside afghanistan s main airport claimed by the islamic state demonstrated that terrorists remain a threat how will this affect future u s policy in the region washington and the taliban may spend years pulled between cooperation and conflict some of the key issues at hand include how to cooperate against a mutual enemy the islamic state branch in the region known as isis k and whether the u s should release 9 4 billion in afghan government currency reserves that are frozen in the country on sunday taliban authorities sent assurances that they would facilitate humanitarian aid deliveries by road he said despite the risks u n relief organizations are still working in the country and are among the few international lifelines remaining for hundreds of thousands in need since coming to power the taliban have been largely isolated both politically and economically from the rest of the world the world bank halted funding for new projects the international monetary fund suspended payments to afghanistan and the biden administration has frozen the assets of afghanistan s central bank that are held in the united states while china has made friendly overtures to the taliban and offered some 30 million in assistance that is a fraction of the aid the country was slated to receive before the taliban takeover at a gathering in november 2020 donor nations committed some 12 billion in assistance to afghanistan over four years while the taliban did not have a representative in geneva for the meeting zabihullah mujahid the taliban s deputy information and culture minister said the government welcomed all humanitarian efforts by any nation including the united states he also acknowledged that not even the taliban expected to be in control of the country so quickly it was a surprise for us how the former administration abandoned the government he said we were not fully prepared for that and are still trying to figure things out to manage the crisis and try to help people in any way possible more than half a million afghans were driven from their homes by fighting and insecurity this year bringing the total number of people displaced within the country to 3 5 million filippo grandi the u n refugee chief said the danger of economic collapse raised the possibility of stoking an outflow of refugees to neighboring countries said 33 lived in kunduz before fleeing to kabul where he now

of all the candidates trying to unseat california gov gavin newsom in the recall election wrapping up tuesday conservative talk show host larry elder has the best chance elder works for the right wing broadcaster salem media group an outfit that has quietly become one of the most powerful forces in conservative media with hosts who peddle discredited claims about covid 19 last year s elections and more but salem media is not merely an employer for elder it is a platform a vehicle and an outright backer for him in this race polls suggest the recall attempt will fail yet elder stands out as the candidate likely to post the most votes should newsom falter and whatever success he has derives in large part from the significant support of salem media salem media group contributed 35 000 to elder just last week under california law corporations are allowed to give money directly to candidates campaigns on sunday elder was the featured speaker at an annual event sponsored by the conservative website townhall and krla am radio in southern california the home station for elder s nationally syndicated radio show both outlets are owned by salem media another krla host jennifer horn who was helping to moderate the evening s event noted that for legal reasons salem couldn t have him stage a true campaign style rally but it was at times hard to tell the difference elder sat comfortably microphone in hand bantering with his colleagues in a way tailor made to stir last minute supporters to vote your question was what would i do when i become governor elder asked drawing fervent applause as he lingered on the word when elder jokes of being the black face of white supremacy horn had introduced him to hundreds of cheering fans at a hyatt regency in orange county by his preferred nickname the sage of south central elder grew up in south los angeles went to brown university and earned a degree in law at the university of michigan yet he would not make his mark in law if his unlikely bid succeeds elder would be the first african american governor for the nation s most populous state he would also bring a record of years of brashly stated policy beliefs particularly on matters of race and gender intended to stir outrage among millions of the liberals who would number among his new constituents at the event sunday elder promised to kill any of newsom s coronavirus related mandates joked with another radio host that he was the black face of white supremacy and defended himself from earlier criticism that he had argued women were not as smart as men elder told attendees that he s not against the vaccines for covid 19 and that he himself has been vaccinated but he questioned the need for government mandates on his radio show he has given ample time to those casting doubt on the effectiveness of the vaccines themselves and he has also amplified false claims that the 2020 election was stolen from former president donald trump such controversies might inspire rebukes from some employers not so at salem media which has welcomed conspiracy theorists into its lineups as a warmup for elder s appearance on sunday hosts interviewed a rogue s gallery of trump surrogates former trump white house adviser sebastian gorka turning point usa founder charlie kirk and blaze and fox news host mark levin all of them are employed by various outlets of salem

media fired writers at redstate who were deemed insufficiently supportive of trump according to reports in cnn and elsewhere salem media puts extreme content behind a paywall behind paywalls some salem media commentators offer even more extreme takes in july pj media editor paula bolyard warned readers that the critical reaction to the site s coverage of covid 19 especially its caustic takes

1qb1 idaho champion or the company is pleased to provide an update on the 2021 exploration program at its 100 controlled champagne gold project champagne near the city of arco butte county idaho recently announced core drilling see press release dated july 7 2021 has identified a new mineralized corridor which is located on the high priority anomalous drill target area to the north west of the past producing open pits and covers approximately 800 metres north south and 300 metres east west drill core for holes one 1 through four 4 have been sent to the lab for assay and champion is currently cutting and logging holes five 5 through seven 7 with a total of 2 900 metres drilled to date figure 1 drill core from ddh cc 21 02 showing fracture veinlets and narrow veins of sulfides the targets for the 2021 drill program are the displaced roots of the multiple veins of the mine hill polymetallic ag pb zn ag and cu ag system and also nearby vuggy silica sheeted breccias mined for au ag at the north and south pits commented chief geologist rob kell the characteristics of the vein system and sheeted breccia are typical of high sulfidation epithermal deposits sourced from a porphyry copper intrusion at greater depth the 2020 drilling determined that the vein system and breccias at mine hill were cut off at shallow depth by a detachment fault the follow up ip survey identified a large chargeability anomaly positioned 800 meters to the west of mine hill testing the near surface parts of this ip anomaly is a key component of our strategy for 2021 figure 2 2020 and 2021 drilling locations and mineralized corridors drill program update drill holes ddh cc 21 02 03 and 06 intercepted a corridor of moderately to strongly altered andesitic volcanics and tuffaceous rocks dominantly clay and or quartz sericite pyrite qsp alteration quartz latite porphyry dikes also crosscut the volcanic rocks thick sections host disseminated sulfides in intervals up to 300 metres in total width hydrothermal alteration is seen to increase in intensity with depth in total this corridor of alteration veining and brecciation extends for over 800m in a north south direction and is up to 300m wide these holes also encountered intervals of fracture veinlets and narrow veins of pyrite galena sphalerite chalcopyrite and dark grey sulfosalts that crosscut the volcanic rocks and the porphyry dikes ddh cc 21 03 passed through a more significant vein possibly the st louis vein at 63 metres depth which consists of subequal amounts of pyrite and sulfosalts see figure 3 deeper parts of the vein systems appear to be zoned towards silver copper rather than lead zinc minerals while assays are pending semi quantitative analysis by field portable x ray fluorescence xrf indicated that the veins are enriched in silver lead zinc and copper figure 3 2021 drilling ddh 21 03 showing a vein with pyrite and sulfosalt minerals drilling has confirmed that alteration and veining do continue into the rocks that underly the caldera and volcanic rocks several narrow but significant veins composed entirely of sulfide and sulfosalt mineralization were also intersected in the hornfelsed basement siliciclastic sedimentary rocks hornfels alteration is formed by contact metamorphism from higher temperature rocks which could indicate the presence of more porphyritic rocks at depth the sedimentary basement rocks in this area are known as the mississippian mcgowan creek formation about the champagne project the champagne mine was operated by bema gold as a heap leach operation on an epithermal gold silver system that occurs in volcanic rocks bema gold drilled 72 shallow reverse circulation holes on the project which complement drilling and trenching from other previous operators the property has had no deep drilling or significant modern exploration since the mine closure in early 1992 the champagne deposit contains epigenetic style gold and silver mineralization that occurs in strongly altered tertiary volcanic tuffs and flows of acid to intermediate composition champagne has a near surface cap of gold silver mineralization emplaced by deep seated structures that acted as conduits for precious metal rich hydrothermal fluids higher grade zones in the champagne deposit appear to be related to such feeder zones the company cautions that the information about the past producing mine may not be indicative of mineralization on champion s property and if mineralization does occur that it will occur in sufficient quantity or grade that would result in an economic extraction scenario the historic data were simply used to evaluate the prospective nature of the property the company has not yet conducted sufficient exploration to ascertain if a mineral resource is

china s government is assembling a group of accounting and legal experts to examine the finances of china evergrande group a potential precursor to a restructuring of the world s most indebted developer regulators in evergrande s home province of guangdong dispatched a team last month from king wood mallesons a law firm whose specialties include restructuring two people familiar with the matter said asking not to be identified discussing private information at the urging of beijing provincial officials are also sending additional financial advisers and accountants to assess the developer one of the people said the move adds to signs that chinese authorities are laying the groundwork for what could be one of the country s biggest debt restructurings while senior leaders in beijing have yet to indicate whether they would allow evergrande creditors to suffer major losses bondholders are pricing in slim odds of a rescue guangdong officials have turned down at least one bailout request from billionaire evergrande founder hui ka yan who owns a controlling stake one person familiar with the matter said evergrande said on tuesday that the company hired its own advisers houlihan lokey and admiralty harbour capital to assess the group s capital structure and reach an optimal solution for all stakeholders the disclosure came in an exchange filing outlining the dire state of the company s finances with evergrande warning that it faces tremendous liquidity strains the financial stability of property giant china evergrande is increasingly in doubt and this has enormous consequences not only for the chinese economy but also for suppliers such as australian iron ore miners credit bloomberg the company s shares fell 12 in hong kong extending this year s drop to 80 and closing at the lowest level since november 2014 evergrande s 8 25 dollar bond due 2022 dropped about us5 5 cents to us27 cents pricing in a high likelihood of default according to bloomberg compiled prices pressure is building on hui and chinese authorities to find a resolution to a months long crisis that has intensified markedly in recent days the developer is falling behind on commitments to suppliers retail investors and homebuyers raising the spectre of social unrest after a spate of protests at evergrande offices across china protesters gathered at the company s shenzhen headquarters for at least the third straight day on tuesday braving the rain to demand repayment on overdue wealth management products the extent of the losses facing investors will depend in part on whether chinese authorities and state run banks take steps to limit the fallout evergrande which has about us300 billion of liabilities has emerged as the biggest test yet of president xi jinping s willingness to let over indebted companies fail as he tries to wring the excesses out of china s 54 trillion financial system without state intervention the risk is that evergrande enters a downward spiral the developer said in its statement on tuesday that property sales will drop in the normally buoyant month of september because of waning confidence among homebuyers who often need to give the company large down payments for properties that may take years to complete evergrande said it hasn t made material progress on plans to sell stakes in its electric car and property services units adding that the planned disposal of its hong kong headquarters building hasn t been completed as expected asset sales had been one of the most important pillars of evergrande s plan to escape its cash crunch guangdong s government has encouraged evergrande s major banks to set up a creditor committee a move that would allow lenders to take over major decisions including asset disposals two people familiar with the matter said the banks are reluctant to do so before getting a clear nod from national regulators the people said china s financial stability and development committee the nation s top financial regulator gave its blessing to an evergrande plan last month to renegotiate payment deadlines with banks and other creditors on a piecemeal basis a person familiar with the matter told bloomberg last week it s unclear whether recent developments such as the investor protests have caused beijing to reconsider evergrande which denied rumours late monday that it would file for bankruptcy said on tuesday that houlihan lokey and admiralty harbour capital would explore all feasible solutions to ease the current liquidity issue bloomberg
u s farm biofuel leaders seek immediate aviation fuel fix to budget bill renewable fuels association america s top biofuel and farm advocates called on democratic leaders to fix a major flaw in the house ways means committee text released friday night for tax provisions of the budget reconciliation which is set for consideration tuesday as drafted the text could leave american farmers and biofuel producers cut out of the sustainable aviation fuels saf market in favor of foreign imports despite farm friendly promises as recently as thursday from white house leaders the legislation under consideration would rely on foreign standards based on decade old models rather than updated lifecycling modeling by scientists at the department of energy who study the u s agricultural supply chain including both direct and indirect land use without a change in these three bills before the house of representatives u s biofuel producers will not be able to participate in the saf market rural communities will be locked out from contributing to a cleaner climate and our nation s ability to decarbonize the airline fleet will suffer said the renewable fuels association advanced biofuels business council american farm bureau federation american soybean association growth energy national biodiesel board national corn growers association national farmers union and the national sorghum producers in a letter sunday full text of the letter follows dear speaker pelosi and majority leader schumer we are writing to request that current legislative proposals to encourage development of sustainable aviation fuel saf under consideration for inclusion in budget reconciliation and the fy22 national defense authorization act ndaa be amended to rely on the most updated and accurate science based lifecycle carbon assessment lca methods and to permit the use of saf derived from agricultural feedstocks numerous members of our respective organizations are poised to produce saf or sustainable feedstocks for saf many others are working toward participation in the full value chain in the relatively near future because biomass feedstocks are essential saf sources it is imperative that tax credits and other programs properly account for the lifecycle emissions of these sources and the petroleum products these new fuels will replace just last week the white house convened a group of over 150 stakeholders where national climate advisor gina mccarthy and secretaries vilsack buttigieg and granholm announced a goal of reducing aviation emissions 20 by 2030 notably secretary vilsack said usda and american agriculture will make sustainable aviation possible in concert with our federal and industry partners and their stakeholders unfortunately the reconciliation packages for the house ways and means committee and the house transportation and infrastructure t i committee as well as the fy22 ndaa would exclude saf derived from agricultural feedstocks from incentive programs and ensure that the administration s vision for reducing aviation emissions and the cited opportunities for american agriculture are not realized instead saf blend stock from brazil singapore and elsewhere will be subsidized by u s taxpayers while u s producers and farmers are shut out in the case of the ndaa bill there is an explicit exclusion from an saf pilot program in the case of ways and means and t i the committees require the use of a model from the international civil aviation organization icao a united nations agency to measure the carbon intensity of various fuels that is inaccurate and effectively excludes agriculture based biofuels from these federal incentive programs the science within this icao model is severely outdated and data is 10 15 years old it fails to accurately account for on farm carbon reduction activities as well as production and efficiency improvements in biofuel production these changes are well recognized in the u s by the department of energy s doe greet model which is the state of the art model used globally to measure life cycle greenhouse gas emissions from transportation doe has the best resources expertise and current ability to assess lifecycle emissions fairly and scientifically congress should be using a u s based lifecycle emissions model when determining u s based tax incentives although the ways and means reconciliation text allows the option for doe to be involved in conducting lca with epa ways and means requires any u s based lca to meet the requirements of icao and t i requires any u s based lca to be as stringent as the icao model this language could be interpreted to require the use of the icao methodology in lieu of doe s more robust data and modeling approach additionally the t i text does not include doe in the process and relies exclusively on epa unlike the doe epa does not maintain a regularly updated lca model or methodology for biofuels notably epa s most recent comprehensive analysis for biofuels was conducted more than a decade ago in 2009 it does not reflect or capture the continuous improvement that has been witnessed over the past decade in on farm carbon emissions reductions or the technology and efficiency improvements in biofuel production as climate smart agriculture practices continue to improve and expand and as new fuel production technologies for saf are

racism kills and that is made abundantly clear with every black life lost to police misconduct environmental hazard or stress induced illness but the slow crumbling of our health due to systemic inequalities and generational trauma has a name that you should know about social scientists now call repeated exposure to socioeconomic adversity political marginalization racism and perpetual discrimination that harms our health weathering a phenomenon that kills us in slow less obvious ways the term was coined by arline geronimus associate director and professor of health behavior health education at university of michigan to describe the erosion of health that impacts black and brown people much earlier in life than white americans borrowing the term from environmental studies weathering is similar to the soil erosion that happens overtime due to exposure to the elements a small buildup of negatively impacting events eventually leads to a massive landslide or avalanche in humans this erosion is the accumulation of a broad range of adverse and largely preventable health conditions like high blood pressure diabetes cardiovascular disease and poorer mental health that lead to early death racism forms cracks in our spirit like cracks in the pavement of a busy road constant bouts of discrimination fill and expand the crack like raindrops over time the crack becomes a pothole that no longer resembles its original form the same is true of our cells over time a recent study found that black adults had a biological age that was 2 6 years older than their actual age photo adobe stock stress self doubt anxiety and fear causes dna methylation and telomere shortening signs of aging in our cells these epigenetic changes are so stark that they can be passed onto future generations serving as a biological thumbprint of generational trauma on our youth as our cells age we grow tired and less able to deal with the world s stressors we become a shell of our former selves and without timely intervention we risk chronic illness or early death on average life expectancy is 3 to 4 years lower for black americans than white americans even when differences in socioeconomic status are negligible a closer look at weathering weathering is rooted in a history of marginalization redlining and historical segregation places us in less desirable and unsafe locations hypersexualized images of black women and the painful trauma of mass incarceration are sold back to us in movies and music blackface and the waving of the confederate flag remind us that the legacy of slavery is alive and well and made salient when people call you the n word or touch your hair without invitation little credit is given to our social political cultural and economic contributions which have birthed our nation s many customs and traditions and the suggestion that we teach our history the nation s true history through critical race theory is met with outrage and resistance even more few other races have to have the talk with their kids about how to handle yourself around a police officer or when you go shopping in a store you get the point racism guides how we navigate the world and still despite the many obstacles before us we are the gatekeepers of culture dictating popular ways of life and spurring socio economic growth in remarkable ways living in a race conscious society means that the negative effects of weathering impact us all but it s effects are greatest among black adults who engage in high effort coping everyday chronic exposure to social and economic disadvantages leads to accelerated declines in physical and mental health partially explaining the racial disparities that exist in a wide array of health conditions photo adobe stock when black people say they are mentally and emotionally tired or that they are feeling the weight of the world believe them racism chips at our health in subtle yet profound ways but if you look closely you can spot the warning signs you may notice a little weight gain after a stressful week or that you re getting headaches more frequently your mood may fluctuate and performing once enjoyable activities may feel like a chore our body finds ways to protect itself by releasing high levels of cortisol and epinephrine chemicals that allow us to stay on high alert but at high amounts they are harmful to our health raising blood pressure glucose and cholesterol levels to boot living in a constant state of fight or flight where you feel the need to constantly defend and protect yourself greatly affects your mental and emotional health in ways that others are unaware of for example office culture is so unwelcoming to black employees that many of them don t like being there existing in work and academic settings where covert racism and microaggressions are the norm is stressful which explains why many black employees prefer to work from home overcoming the weathering effect fortunately people of color are more than just a neighborhood or group of people we re a family and when you have family you have everything our shared lived experiences lead to a type of kinship that is seen and felt this helps to explain the collective heavy feeling that black and brown people experience during times of social strife when our kinfolk experience pain as evidenced in the aftermath of the murder of george floyd or more recently the sudden deaths of earl dmx simmons and michael k williams we all share in that pain in that vein we all play a role in carrying the collective burdens that society imposes upon us lightening the load for our brothers and sisters so what do we do and where do we start unpacking our trauma and the many ways that we have been marginalized is one way to counter the damaging effects of weathering working together and reminding ourselves and the world of our worth also have immeasurably positive impacts on our health on a macro level the negative effects of weathering on the health of black and brown people are unlikely to go anywhere until we fix issues of structural racism and discrimination but on a micro level we can limit its impact by embracing all the small joys and victories that life has to offer my suggestion is this protect your peace at all costs don t sweat the small stuff support black businesses go on that trip wear your hair how you want ask for that promotion or better yet build your own life is too short to let society weather our health and spirit away dr shamard charles is an assistant professor of public health

legal troubles are mounting for charles schwab s robo advisor two months after the westlake texas based brokerage announced it was setting aside 200 million for an sec probe into schwab intelligent portfolios a group of clients have filed a class action lawsuit alleging the digital advisor violated its fiduciary duty by over allocating portfolios to cash while most robos charge a fee based on assets under management schwab advertises its intelligent portfolios service as charging no advisory fees or commissions to clients the product instead generates revenue for schwab by investing clients in the firm s proprietary etfs and depositing the cash allocation of client accounts into its own bank allowing schwab to earn interest both practices have generated controversy from schwab critics though the company has defended its use of both this lawsuit takes aim at the latter revenue stream claiming schwab has made hundreds of millions of dollars from cash sweeps by over concentrating portfolios in cash even as the stock market reached record highs this caused plaintiffs and the proposed class foreseeably to miss out on market gains they would have enjoyed had instead managed their intelligent portfolios accounts loyally and prudently and without csia placing its own interests and those of schwab before the interests of its clients as it has done here the lawsuit states plaintiffs lauren barbiero kimberly lopez and william lopez claim schwab has cost the class of investors more than half a billion dollars in losses they also claim that this breach of fiduciary duty is the subject of the sec s probe into schwab intelligent portfolios the sec does not comment on the existence or nonexistence of a possible investigation said a spokesperson for the agency a spokesperson for schwab declined to comment saying the firm does not comment on active litigation in its ongoing robo report research firm backend benchmarking has pointed out how cash allocations drag down the performance of schwab s robo advisor in the most recent report backend estimated that schwab intelligent portfolios high cash allocations cost investors 1 13 billion in total earnings when compared to the potential returns of investing the cash in the fixed income portion of its portfolio said david goldstone backend s manager of research and analytics schwab s business approach is also unique in the robo advice market says backend senior financial analyst thomas leahy ally invest offers a cash enhanced portfolio that sets aside 30 of its portfolio in interest earning cash instead of a management fee but users can opt for a market focused option that charges a 0 30 management fee and a more traditional cash allocation the notable difference is that ally invest offers a clearly defined alternative that has a traditional fee structure leahy said in an email if schwab charged a 30 basis point management fee for its robo and redirected the cash allocations towards the same fixed income assets it already holds clients would have earned an estimated 531 million more goldstone said clients would have been significantly better off had schwab charged a straightforward and transparent management fee instead of deciding to earn revenue through high cash allocations he said in an email although not charging a management fee may make sense from a marketing perspective using a high cash allocation instead of a transparent fee has handicapped the performance of these portfolios and ultimately hurt clients the case has been filed in the u s district court in northern california

from the perspective of market changes the price of lithium carbonate has skyrocketed recently and the prices of lithium carbonate enterprises have increased by a large margin for several weeks in a row according to smm s latest spot quotation the average price of battery grade lithium carbonate in the domestic market rose to 141000 yuan ton on sept 14 up 27500 ton from the beginning of september in addition battery network noted that pilbara a leading australian lithium mining company held its second spodumene concentrate auction on bmx electronic platform today with a final auction price of 2240usduniverse t and an auction volume of 8000 tons earlier pilbara s first spodumene concentrate on the bmx platform sold for 1315 a tonne at auction according to haitong securities considering the sea freight the production cost of lithium salt is more than 150000 yuan and considering the reasonable profit of the lithium salt factory the corresponding lithium price will certainly exceed 200000 yuan at present there is still a certain gap in the raw material end of the lithium market the volume of overseas mines and salt lakes will begin at the end of this year or early next year the shortage of raw materials may last for several months in terms of supply and demand supply will continue to fall short of demand and prices may continue to rise sharply why is lithium raw material so scarce according to the latest data from the china automobile association from january to august the production and sales of new energy vehicles in china completed 1 813 million and 1 799 million respectively an increase of 1 9 times over the same period last year and the cumulative sales penetration rate was close to 11 among them the production and sales of new energy vehicles completed 309000 and 321000 respectively in august an increase of 1 8 times over the same period last year and the penetration rate of new energy vehicles increased to 17 8 in that month the penetration rate of new energy passenger vehicles is close to 20 although it has been made clear that new energy models are a major trend the rapid growth of the new energy model market is still beyond most people s expectations at a time when the world is stepping into the era of electrification as the power source of pure electric vehicles the social status of lithium is no lower than that of oil moreover with the rapid rise in sales of new energy vehicles the demand for lithium resources in the global battery industry chain is increasing and the prices of raw materials have been rising since the second half of last year it is not difficult to see that lithium resources have become a key factor restricting the development of the new energy industry who is in charge of the lithium supply chain the stable supply of lithium resources determines the rapid development of the battery industry chain from the current resource reserves the proportion of domestic lithium cobalt nickel and other key raw materials is not high but with a large number of overseas distribution china s current lithium resources have mastered half of the country according to the incomplete statistics of the battery network the basic situation of the distribution of lithium stocks in china is as follows according to the data released by the us geological survey the global lithium resources metal equivalent reserves are about 13 5 million tons and the proven reserves are about 39 78 million tons lithium ores and halogen water resources are mainly distributed in south america north america asia and oceania due to the relatively mature system and convenient transportation of lithium ore in australia it has become the main source of ore series in the world most of the domestic leading enterprises such as ganfeng lithium industry and tianqi lithium industry rely on imported australian ore supplies and since the beginning of this year ganfeng lithium industry has obviously accelerated the overseas layout of upstream resources and acquired a number of lithium resource projects in africa argentina and other countries through acquisitions in addition data show that china s proven lithium resources metal equivalent reserves are about 5 2 million tons of which salt lake resources account for about 70 of the country s total reserves and ore resources account for about 30 in terms of salt lakes the country is mainly distributed in qinghai tibet xinjiang and other regions and occurs in the form of surface brine and surface intercrystalline brine according to the latest smm data the lithium reserves of the five major salt lakes in qinghai are about 15 91 million tons of lithium carbonate equivalent accounting for 62 4 of the country s total lithium resources among them chaerhan salt lake currently holds 12 02 million tons of lithium chloride reserves equivalent to about 8 91 million tons of lithium carbonate equivalent ranking first in the country at present about 3700 square kilometers of mining rights in chaerhan salt lake are held by salt lake shares with the advantages of resource scale production cost process optimization and lithium extraction technology innovation it will play a more important role in the global lithium resource supply pattern in the future in terms of lithium mines the most potential lithium deposits in china are mainly distributed in ganzi prefecture and aba prefecture in sichuan province such as methyl kaconding 134ore the best lithium mine in asia opencast mining and low mining costs at present the proven lithium reserves are equivalent to about 4 68 million tons of lce and only about 1 3 of them are explored so there is a wide space to increase reserves in the later stage the mine is currently held by rongjie shares and currently has an ore mining capacity of 1 05 million tons per year and a mineral processing capacity of 450000 tons per year in addition the main lithium resource supplier in china is yelonggou spodumene which is currently held by shengxin lithium energy with a production scale of 405000 tons per year while aba lijiagou spodumene mine held by sichuan energy power and yahua group has not yet been put into production if there s a mine there s nothing to worry about generally speaking companies with lithium resources are bound to have an absolute say in the battery industry chain and their future performance will be greatly released however due to the fact that most of china s lithium resources come from overseas the instability of the international situation and the fluctuation of the market we need to further increase the control of lithium resources and innovate lithium extraction technology it is worth noting that with the release of a large number of new energy vehicles the rise in raw material prices has caused panic in lithium resources in various regions of the world not only the upstream enterprises of battery raw materials many car companies at home and abroad have also begun to extend their supply to lithium mines for layout to ensure the security and stability of their own supply chain

of all the candidates trying to unseat california gov gavin newsom in the recall election wrapping up tuesday conservative talk show host larry elder has the best chance elder works for the right wing broadcaster salem media group an outfit that has quietly become one of the most powerful forces in conservative media with hosts who peddle discredited claims about covid 19 last year s elections and more but salem media is not merely an employer for elder it is a platform a vehicle and an outright backer for him in this race polls suggest the recall attempt will fail yet elder stands out as the candidate likely to post the most votes should newsom falter and whatever success he has derives in large part from the significant support of salem media salem media group contributed 35 000 to elder just last week under california law corporations are allowed to give money directly to candidates campaigns on sunday elder was the featured speaker at an annual event sponsored by the conservative website townhall and krla am radio in southern california the home station for elder s nationally syndicated radio show both outlets are owned by salem media another krla host jennifer horn who was helping to moderate the evening s event noted that for legal reasons salem couldn t have him stage a true campaign style rally but it was at times hard to tell the difference elder sat comfortably microphone in hand bantering with his colleagues in a way tailor made to stir last minute supporters to vote your question was what would i do when i become governor elder asked drawing fervent applause as he lingered on the word when elder jokes of being the black face of white supremacy horn had introduced him to hundreds of cheering fans at a hyatt regency in orange county by his preferred nickname the sage of south central elder grew up in south los angeles went to brown university and earned a degree in law at the university of michigan yet he would not make his mark in law if his unlikely bid succeeds elder would be the first african american governor for the nation s most populous state he would also bring a record of years of brashly stated policy beliefs particularly on matters of race and gender intended to stir outrage among millions of the liberals who would number among his new constituents at the event sunday elder promised to kill any of newsom s coronavirus related mandates joked with another radio host that he was the black face of white supremacy and defended himself from earlier criticism that he had argued women were not as smart as men elder told attendees that he s not against the vaccines for covid 19 and that he himself has been vaccinated but he questioned the need for government mandates on his radio show he has given ample time to those casting doubt on the effectiveness of the vaccines themselves and he has also amplified false claims that the 2020 election was stolen from former president donald trump such controversies might inspire rebukes from some employers not so at salem media which has welcomed conspiracy theorists into its lineups as a warmup for elder s appearance on sunday hosts interviewed a rogue s gallery of trump surrogates former trump white house adviser sebastian gorka turning point usa founder charlie kirk and blaze and fox news host mark levin all of them are employed by various outlets of salem media salem media seeks to appeal to a voter base of fundamentalist christians who are urged to the polls based on their conservative and sometimes socially regressive beliefs anti abortion anti lgbt etc says columbia university scholar anne nelson author of shadow network a book on the political alliance of conservative media and religious and business groups brothers in law founded salem media as a religious broadcaster salem media s founders were a pair of brothers in law stuart epperson and edward g atsinger iii they established the outfit in 1986 as a religious broadcaster their mission has now expanded to incorporate conservative fundamentalist christianity and to promote victories by like minded republicans salem media which is publicly traded on nasdaq now owns more than 100 stations making it among the largest radio groups in the country it says it syndicates its programs to 3 000 stations nationwide additionally it owns a welter of conservative opinion sites including not just townhall but also hotair pj media redstate and twitchy salem media claims more than 200 million unique users a month a figure that s hard to verify but nelson says that through the radio stations and the sites salem media can encourage trump minded people to vote especially in more conservative swing states in the midwest and south elder had been a nationally syndicated host twice for abc radio in los angeles when he was let go the second time in 2015 salem hired him nelson says he s found ways to align himself with his even more conservative bosses elder has kind of gravitated towards endorsing these positions and tapping into that voter base with this massive radio network support that s built under him nelson tells npr the senior executive at salem media assigned to handle media inquiries did not respond to three messages left by npr over five days seeking an interview for this story elder s campaign also did not respond to requests for comment in 2018 salem media fired writers at redstate who were deemed insufficiently supportive of trump according to reports in cnn and elsewhere salem media puts extreme content behind a paywall behind paywalls some salem media commentators offer even more extreme takes in july pj media editor paula bolyard warned readers that the critical reaction to the site s coverage of covid 19 especially its caustic takes on public health officials had taken a toll and bolyard wrote there was a reason she was asking readers to subscribe to get past the paywalls she did not want to subject her site s most powerful posts to scrutiny regular readers of pj media know that much of our covid 19 coverage has been behind a paywall accessible only to our vip subscribers bolyard wrote it s just not worth our time to have to deal with the fact checkers who have been working overtime to discredit us and damage our reputation behind the paywalls for various salem media sites writers and podcasters have blasted the use of masks and vaccines against covid 19 and instead promoted discredited cures additionally hosts unleash coarse rants against the media and glory in their ability to evade not just fact checkers but social media moderators on repeated paywalled streaming videos redstate s scott hounsell raises aloft a middle finger to facebook s mark zuckerberg and twitter s jack dorsey to be clear salem an explicitly conservative fundamentalist christian media company charges viewers listeners and readers money to access uncensored and profane content yet unfettered conspiracy theories can be found in free content too on the free version of the townhall podcast triggered hosts matt vespa and storm paglia earlier this year called congress a disgrace they mused why anyone should be surprised by the violent jan 6 insurrection at the u s capitol moments later however they concluded the event wasn t real but a setup by the fbi in july on his salem radio show elder took a call from a voter urging him to run and suggesting that the vote might be sabotaged against him elder laughed at the trump like prediction of electoral fraud and said he wouldn t be surprised in more recent days elder s campaign has set up an official site claiming fraud is taking place in the california recall race even though the election has yet to wrap up it s a claim unsupported by any meaningful evidence that s receiving a warm reception throughout salem media copyright 2021 npr to see more visit

the latest jobs report has caused great unrest in the united states is this all just an anomaly or rather the beginning of the end of the economic boom an anomaly a snapshot or rather the beginning of the end of the economic boom three days after the release of the latest u s jobs report economists policymakers and central bankers are still puzzling over what the numbers are trying to tell them and what conclusions they should draw the highly anticipated u s jobs report for august should make us feel sorry for those having to navigate through the flood of economic data wrote mohamed el erian chief economic adviser for allianz insurance company in his column for bloomberg this applies to analysts but especially to the financial and monetary policymakers responsible the fact is the number of those employed in the united states rose by just 235 000 in august compared to the previous month compared to june and july when around 1 million additional workers were registered each month this is a dramatic decline could the economic upswing that began after overcoming the pandemic recession already be over if that is indeed the case it would be a problem in many respects for the government as well as the federal reserve on the one hand additional unemployment benefits which congress had approved due to the pandemic entirely or partially ran out this monday for almost 9 million citizens many of these people may suffer acute distress if they don t find a new job soon on the other hand with regard to the recent rapid increase in inflation the fed previously considered announcing a gradual exit from its stimulus program before the end of the month now that is also back on the table the fact that joe biden himself spoke immediately after the figures were released revealed how explosive the white house considers the jobs report to be factually as well as politically on the one hand biden pointed out that the u s economy created 750 000 jobs on average from june to august that is indeed a high figure but it conceals a recent dramatic slump on the other hand he deferred responsibility for the disappointing august numbers and blamed those who did not get vaccinated people who are now infected and thus impeding economic progress this is a continuing pandemic of the unvaccinated biden said and it s creating a lot of unease in our economy and around our kitchen tables many hospitals are at capacity again the delta variant of covid 19 is indeed the primary reason why the economic recovery has sharply stagnated in the past week an average of 153 000 people per day were newly infected in the south particularly where the mostly republican governors have long since lifted almost all restrictions many hospitals are at capacity the result is that even vaccinated people are once again refraining from eating out going to the movies or boarding airplanes recently the number of table reservations at restaurants was nearly 11 below the level it was in the summer of 2019 after the gap had previously been significantly smaller hotel occupancy rates in san francisco were as much as 40 lower in mid august customer fears of infection are forcing restaurants travel agencies massage businesses and nail salons to significantly defer recruiting new employees and even lay off workers in the taxi and van business alone for example almost 8 000 jobs were lost in august at the same time many businesses are still having problems finding employees because either unemployed people don t fit the job profile or applicants are refusing jobs in restaurants for fear of covid 19 the pressure to raise wages has therefore continued to grow despite disappointing job numbers at the same time inflation rates are greater than 5 because many companies cannot produce what s needed due to supply chain shortages and some are making use of the situation to compensate losses by raising prices in the face of a possible wage price spiral economic experts including mohamed a el erian are already warning about stagflation a toxic combination of economic lull and inflation in which classic instruments don t work and policymakers worry that s because the fed would have to simultaneously raise and lower interest rates and congress would have to simultaneously put more money then less money into stimulus packages the situation is exacerbated by the fact that the upswing in countries like germany and china is stagnating and factors which drive new prices could come along such as plant closures in southeast asia a pandemic hotspot the probability of stagflation is low it s still only a rumor and the probability that stagflation will reach the united states is rather low however the discussion also shows that the risks to the economy and to prices are obviously much greater than many detractors had recently claimed the fed in particular is facing a dilemma almost every observer is in agreement that contrary to previous expectations there will no an announcement by the fed this september cutting back on previous stimulus measures instead it is now expected that the fed won t begin to scale back its 120 billion in monthly securities purchases which it uses to keep long term interest rates low until next year however it will be difficult if the price surge continues to speed up at the same time and there s still another problem which joseph lavorgna u s chief economist for the french investment bank natixis has repeatedly pointed out he argues that since the beginning of the pandemic the fed has influenced the economy not so much through the bond market let alone through interest rates but rather through stock prices it buys securities and spends billions for them which investors largely invest in the stock market the constantly rising prices in turn are causing even those with small savings to feel wealthier and consume heavily at least temporarily however according to lavorgna in barron s this mechanism stupidly functions in the opposite way if the fed wants to move away from its zero interest policy at some point due to rising prices a slump in the stock market and thus in consumption as well is almost inevitable concerns over such a development could mean that the fed may never be able to normalize interest rates

of all the candidates trying to unseat california gov gavin newsom in the recall election wrapping up tuesday conservative talk show host larry elder has the best chance elder works for the right wing broadcaster salem media group an outfit that has quietly become one of the most powerful forces in conservative media with hosts who peddle discredited claims about covid 19 last year s elections and more but salem media is not merely an employer for elder it is a platform a vehicle and an outright backer for him in this race polls suggest the recall attempt will fail yet elder stands out as the candidate likely to post the most votes should newsom falter and whatever success he has derives in large part from the significant support of salem media salem media group contributed 35 000 to elder just last week under california law corporations are allowed to give money directly to candidates campaigns on sunday elder was the featured speaker at an annual event sponsored by the conservative website townhall and krla am radio in southern california the home station for elder s nationally syndicated radio show both outlets are owned by salem media another krla host jennifer horn who was helping to moderate the evening s event noted that for legal reasons salem couldn t have him stage a true campaign style rally but it was at times hard to tell the difference elder sat comfortably microphone in hand bantering with his colleagues in a way tailor made to stir last minute supporters to vote your question was what would i do when i become governor elder asked drawing fervent applause as he lingered on the word when elder jokes of being the black face of white supremacy horn had introduced him to hundreds of cheering fans at a hyatt regency in orange county by his preferred nickname the sage of south central elder grew up in south los angeles went to brown university and earned a degree in law at the university of michigan yet he would not make his mark in law if his unlikely bid succeeds elder would be the first african american governor for the nation s most populous state he would also bring a record of years of brashly stated policy beliefs particularly on matters of race and gender intended to stir outrage among millions of the liberals who would number among his new constituents at the event sunday elder promised to kill any of newsom s coronavirus related mandates joked with another radio host that he was the black face of white supremacy and defended himself from earlier criticism that he had argued women were not as smart as men elder told attendees that he s not against the vaccines for covid 19 and that he himself has been vaccinated but he questioned the need for government mandates on his radio show he has given ample time to those casting doubt on the effectiveness of the vaccines themselves and he has also amplified false claims that the 2020 election was stolen from former president donald trump such controversies might inspire rebukes from some employers not so at salem media which has welcomed conspiracy theorists into its lineups as a warmup for elder s appearance on sunday hosts interviewed a rogue s gallery of trump surrogates former trump white house adviser sebastian gorka turning point usa founder charlie kirk and blaze and fox news host mark levin all of them are employed by various outlets of salem media salem media seeks to appeal to a voter base of fundamentalist christians who are urged to the polls based on their conservative and sometimes socially regressive beliefs anti abortion anti lgbt etc says columbia university scholar anne nelson author of shadow network a book on the political alliance of conservative media and religious and business groups brothers in law founded salem media as a religious broadcaster salem media s founders were a pair of brothers in law stuart epperson and edward g atsinger iii they established the outfit in 1986 as a religious broadcaster their mission has now expanded to incorporate conservative fundamentalist christianity and to promote victories by like minded republicans salem media which is publicly traded on nasdaq now owns more than 100 stations making it among the largest radio groups in the country it says it syndicates its programs to 3 000 stations nationwide additionally it owns a welter of conservative opinion sites including not just townhall but also hotair pj media redstate and twitchy salem media claims more than 200 million unique users a month a figure that s hard to verify but nelson says that through the radio stations and the sites salem media can encourage trump minded people to vote especially in more conservative swing states in the midwest and south elder had been a nationally syndicated host twice for abc radio in los angeles when he was let go the second time in 2015 salem hired him nelson says he s found ways to align himself with his even more conservative bosses elder has kind of gravitated towards endorsing these positions and tapping into that voter base with this massive radio network support that s built under him nelson tells npr the senior executive at salem media assigned to handle media inquiries did not respond to three messages left by npr over five days seeking an interview for this story elder s campaign also did not respond to requests for comment in 2018 salem media fired writers at redstate who were deemed insufficiently supportive of trump according to reports in cnn and elsewhere salem media puts extreme content behind a paywall behind paywalls some salem media commentators offer even more extreme takes in july pj media editor paula bolyard warned readers that the critical reaction to the site s coverage of covid 19 especially its caustic takes on public health officials had taken a toll and bolyard wrote there was a reason she was asking readers to subscribe to get past the paywalls she did not want to subject her site s most powerful posts to scrutiny regular readers of pj media know that much of our covid 19 coverage has been behind a paywall accessible only to our vip subscribers bolyard wrote it s just not worth our time to have to deal with the fact checkers who have been working overtime to discredit us and damage our reputation behind the paywalls for various salem media sites writers and podcasters have blasted the use of masks and vaccines against covid 19 and instead promoted discredited cures additionally hosts unleash coarse rants against the media and glory in their ability to evade not just fact checkers but social media moderators on repeated paywalled streaming videos redstate s scott hounsell raises aloft a middle finger to facebook s mark zuckerberg and twitter s jack dorsey to be clear salem an explicitly conservative fundamentalist christian media company charges viewers listeners and readers money to access uncensored and profane content yet unfettered conspiracy theories can be found in free content too on the free version of the townhall podcast triggered hosts matt vespa and storm paglia earlier this year called congress a disgrace they mused why anyone should be surprised by the violent jan 6 insurrection at the u s capitol moments later however they concluded the event wasn t real but a setup by the fbi in july on his salem radio show elder took a call from a voter urging him to run and suggesting that the vote might be sabotaged against him elder laughed at the trump like prediction of electoral fraud and said he wouldn t be surprised in more recent days elder s campaign has set up an official site claiming fraud is taking place in the california recall race even though the election has yet to wrap up it s a claim unsupported by any meaningful evidence that s

noel king host inflation slowed down a little bit last month but prices are still rising at nearly the highest rate in more than 12 years which means americans are paying more for everything from hamburgers to haircuts a lot of consumers are starting to think that higher inflation may be with us for a while are they right npr s scott horsley is following this story good morning scott scott horsley byline good morning noel king so the labor department releases its monthly snapshot of inflation the consumer price index this morning and it told us what exactly horlsey well overall prices are up 5 3 in the last 12 months that s down slightly from june and july when prices were climbing at a pace of 5 4 still inflation is pretty high gasoline and groceries are among the big drivers of that gas prices are up almost 43 from a year ago beef prices are up more than 12 now food and energy costs are often volatile so if you take those out of the equation so called core inflation was 4 percent over the last 12 months that s still double the federal reserve s long term target you mentioned haircuts haircut prices are up 5 7 over the last year and that s kind of a haircut for consumers buying power king all right so inflation is high not quite as high as it has been this really hammers home the point that all of this is relative isn t it horlsey that s right prices in general are still rising but not as fast as they were earlier in the year and if you look at the one month increase prices rose three tenths of 1 between july and august that s a smaller jump than between june and july and much smaller than between may and june so we may have seen the peak of the pandemic inflation wave although it s coming down slowly some prices are starting to fall used cars which were a big driver of inflation earlier this year dropped last month their prices by 1 5 we re also starting to see some of the impact of the delta variant in these numbers people are traveling less going out maybe a little less frequently so the price of movie and concert tickets was down in august and the price of airline tickets dropped pretty sharply king you know you do know that both the biden administration and the federal reserve keep saying that they think this period of high inflation is temporary it s a result of the pandemic and they ve been saying it for a couple months now which makes me wonder whether people are buying it horlsey you know financial markets are still betting that this is temporary king ok horlsey and most professional forecasters also see inflation moderating although not right away certainly the numbers we got today seem to support that idea however the federal reserve bank of new york just came out with a survey of regular people and they generally see prices staying higher for longer on average consumers expect inflation a year from now to be running at 5 2 so almost as high as it s been this summer and three years from now consumers think inflation will still be 4 the fed keeps a close eye on consumer expectations because if people think prices are going to keep climbing that can become a self fulfilling prophecy so the fed is certainly on watch for that it doesn t see signs of that happening just yet though king are rising prices going to be a political problem for president biden do you think horlsey the white house is certainly sensitive to this last week the administration put out a report suggesting concentration in the meatpacking industry is partly to blame for those grocery prices so that s maybe a way to deflect a little anger over rising cost of hamburger king npr s economics correspondent scott horsley thank you scott horlsey you re welcome transcript provided by npr copyright npr

should you buy or sell cineplex tsx cgx let s look at the case for buying or selling this controversial stock right now there are few investments on the market today that have polarized investors as much as cineplex tsx cgx with a potential end now in sight investors are considering whether it s time to buy or sell cineplex let s try to answer that question the case to buy cineplex stock was decimated during the pandemic the stock still trades at a significant discount compared to its pre pandemic price during that time cineplex has slashed costs and eliminated its dividend all to remain afloat fortunately the pandemic appears to be ending and businesses are open some parts of the country require proof of vaccination for entry as that rollout and recovery continue prospective investors can expect cineplex s revenue to soar another point that few investors realize is that cineplex is more than just its movie popcorn business while that segment is responsible for the bulk of cineplex s revenues there are other areas that are growing in importance cineplex s rec room concept is just one such example the large multi configurable entertainment venues can host any type of event offer live entertainment games and catering pre pandemic the rec room was a growing contributor to cineplex s earnings cineplex was also rapidly expanding its rec room presence across the country as the pandemic ends that growth could continue but is that enough to warrant a buy let s now look at the other argument to determine whether to buy or sell cineplex the case to sell the pandemic was tough on every business some businesses learned to cope whereas others are stuck with business models that are still reliant on people gathering in enclosed spaces cineplex fits into that latter category to be fair cineplex has tried to innovate in recent years with some success the arguments mentioned above are all valid points that could help the company post a profit someday there are two problems with that first cineplex needs to aim higher the success of cineplex s movie and popcorn business is tied to two completely different events we have the proliferation of streaming services and then we also have the covid 19 pandemic while the latter will end hopefully soon there s still a very personal decision on whether would be customers will return to theatres after living over a year with limited social contact will we be comfortable sitting in an enclosed place with others even if the pandemic ended today it could be weeks or months before people feel comfortable to venture into a theatre if ever the alternative to that is my first point streaming services were a major threat to the traditional movie and popcorn business well before the pandemic began if anything the pandemic only accelerated the transition towards a home streaming environment for less than a price of a single admission subscribers get nearly unlimited access to thousands of movies that do not run on a fixed schedule to make matters worse for cineplex there are now multiple streaming service companies that have established studios to film and distribute new films directly to streaming services unlike the direct to dvd model this replaces these films are attracting top talent have huge budgets and can reach a huge audience that doesn t sound too promising for cineplex investors buy or sell cineplex some final thoughts no investment is without risk that s something that every investor painfully learned during the onset of the pandemic last year fortunately the market has roared back to life since then but there are still stocks that are struggling cineplex is one such stock unfortunately cineplex s fortunes are not only tied to the end of the pandemic but are also linked to changing consumer tastes yes people will return to the theatres to watch the best that hollywood has to offer but there s a growing number of people that will opt to stream movies from home until cineplex can diversify itself away from being overly reliant on the declining theatre model the investment is just too risky despite it being perceived as undervalued in my opinion there are far better options on the market for investors to consider at present even better many of those other stocks can generate a healthy income stream which is something cineplex stopped doing last year
