unprovoked and unjustified military actions russia is grossly violating international law and undermining european and global security and stability the european council said we also condemn the

selling euros in exchange for roubles as part of an effort to slow the inflationary depreciation of its currency and the polish zloty s thursday underperformance of the rouble would be evidence of

new york ap markets shuddered thursday and then swung wildly after russia s invasion of ukraine threatened to push the high inflation squeezing the global economy even higher initially stocks tumbled as prices surged for oil wheat and other commodities on worries the conflict would disrupt global supplies but the moves moderated as the day progressed particularly after president joe biden said he wanted to limit the economic pain for americans and announced new sanctions that fell short of what some had suggested on wall street the s p 500 tumbled 2 6 at the start of trading before erasing the drop and flipping to a gain of 1 5 the heaviest losses hit stocks in europe after officials called russia s nearby moves a brutal act of war with the german dax down 4 beyond its tragic human toll the conflict looked set to send prices even higher at gasoline pumps and grocery stores around the world russia and ukraine are major producers not only of energy but also grains and various other commodities oil prices on both sides of the atlantic briefly jumped above 100 per barrel to their highest levels since 2014 but they gave back much of their gains after biden said the sanctions package is specifically designed to allow energy payments to continue while he described the sanctions as severe ukrainian officials urged the u s and west to go further and cut russia from a crucial financial payments system called swift i think the market certainly could gauge here that sanctions are a little more limited so there s not as much transmission of economic difficulties to the rest of the world from russia said rob haworth senior investment strategist at u s bank wealth management brand connections afterward the price of u s oil settled at 92 81 up 71 cents for the day well below the 100 54 it had touched earlier in the day still prices rose for everything from heating oil to wheat to gasoline as with stocks the movements were sharper in europe than in the u s because its economy is more closely tied to russia and ukraine the spot price in europe for natural gas jumped more than 50 increases in energy and food prices could amplify worries about inflation which in january hit its hottest level in the united states in a couple generations and what the federal reserve will do in turn to rein it in the fed looks certain to raise rates for the first time since 2018 with the only question being how quickly and how aggressively it will move starting next month in the past the fed has sometimes delayed big policy decisions amid uncertainty about the kosovo war and the u s invasion of iraq for example according to goldman sachs but economists at the bank say they still expect the fed to raise rates steadily at its upcoming meetings the ukraine tensions probably just make it less likely the fed will start the process with a bigger than usual increase in rates something some fed officials had recently suggested the fed may become more worried about the impact on economic growth and will probably want to tread more cautiously said kristina hooper chief global market strategist at invesco the fed was already saddled with the delicate task of raising interest rates enough to stamp out high inflation but not so much as to choke the economy into a recession strategists at evercore isi said that risk still remains and has become even more complicated by the attack on ukraine but that it s substantially greater in europe relative to the us many investors also said that past global events such as an invasion have had only short term effects on markets that last a few weeks or months with expectations falling for a bigger than usual increase in rates next month stocks that tend to benefit the most from low interest rates led the way for indexes to pare their losses through the day that put the spotlight on big tech stocks and amazon microsoft and nvidia all rose 4 5 or more that helped the nasdaq composite swing from a 3 4 loss in the morning to a 3 3 gain by the end of the day rising 436 10 points to 13 473 59 it was a remarkable turnaround after the nasdaq was on track during the morning to close 20 below its record high for the first time since the coronavirus collapsed the economy in 2020 expectations for higher interest rates had been beating down high growth and tech stocks for weeks we re seeing some attempt at bottom fishing here in terms of prices said haworth such a buy the dip ethos has proved profitable in the past but he said he thinks it s still a little early we just have a lot of uncertainty ahead of us the dow jones industrial average which isn t as influenced by big tech stocks rose a more modest 92 07 points or 0 3 to 33 223 83 it rallied back from an earlier 859 point loss the s p 500 rose 63 20 points to 4 288 70 huge swings also rocked the bond market where yields initially sank as money moved into investments that looked to offer safer returns than stocks but yields recovered through the day and the

president biden turned up the pressure on russia s economy thursday gambling that higher prices and a protracted recession might eventually compel the russian military to quit its offensive in ukraine speaking in the east room of the white house the president unleashed measures designed to starve russia of the cash and technology it needs to compete in global markets and to develop advanced weaponry and space vehicles the latest u s sanctions which follow limited penalties unveiled this week will cut out top russian banks from the u s financial system and choke off more than half of russia s advanced technology imports the president said several prominent russian business executives considered close to putin and their relatives are also being placed on a u s blacklist as u s actions bite russian citizens could face bank runs soaring inflation and unemployment in response to questions the president said putin will find the sanctions as devastating as military force and will confront a choice between seeing russia s 1 5 trillion economy wither or meeting demands for peace advertisement he s going to begin to see the effect of the sanctions biden said adding he ll have to make a very very difficult choice of whether to continue to move toward being a second rate power or in fact respond even before the president announced the expanded sanctions russian markets were in free fall the rts stock index lost more than 38 percent of its value on thursday and is down more than 61 percent since october still those financial setbacks showed no sign of sapping putin s will to fight as russian tanks and troops continued their advance biden defended his reliance upon sanctions as a long term bet on eroding russian power no one expected the sanctions to prevent anything from happening the president said this is going to take time but ukraine may not be able to wait advertisement in confronting putin s rockets aircraft and warships with the antiseptic work of financial regulators and customs officials biden said the sanctions were designed to maximize the long term impact on russia and economists expect the measures along with similar steps by u s allies in europe and elsewhere to tip russia into recession but putin in recent years has reduced russia s exposure to the outside world stockpiling 630 billion in financial reserves reorienting trade ties and shedding investments denominated in u s dollars each step was designed to insulate his economy from foreign pressure for a moment like now when he is pursuing a strategic goal of overwhelming importance sanctions don t necessarily work immediately they build up pressure over time said adam smith a partner at gibson dunn and a former obama administration sanctions official he s attacking kyiv today and sanctions impact might not be felt for months advertisement biden s stance recognizes the reality that americans fatigued from two lengthy military commitments in iraq and afghanistan

updated february 24 2022 at 11 32 am et stocks slumped on thursday after russia invaded ukraine sending the nasdaq index into what s known as a bear market the dow jones industrial average dropped more than 500 points or nearly 2 while the s p 500 fell nearly 1 as of late morning trading the nasdaq which is heavily made up of technology companies fell more than 3 at one point to enter a bear market that s when an index drops by 20 or more from its recent record high though the nasdaq cut some of its earlier losses leaving it in and out of the technical definition of a bear market the invasion also sent crude prices above 100 a barrel for the first time since 2014 that is likely to reinforce inflation fears at a time when consumer prices were already surging at their fastest annual pace in 40 years here are four things to know as global markets reel how bad are things on wall street right now it s been a tough year for stocks stocks had already been falling though most of the year because of fears about inflation and the prospect of higher interest rates the geopolitical tensions in recent days had already made things worse as investors braced for a russian invasion of ukraine both the dow and the s p entered correction territory this week or when stocks fall more than 10 from their recent record highs though predicting stock moves is impossible analysts warn sentiment will be cautious for a while global stock markets also dropped after the invasion with russian stocks down sharply while the ruble the country s currency hit a record low vadim ghirda ap a ukrainian soldier stands next to a military vehicle on a road in kramatosrk eastern ukraine thursday feb 24 2022 russian troops launched a wide ranging attack on ukraine on thursday president vladimir putin cast aside international condemnation and sanctions and warned other countries that any attempt to interfere would lead to consequences you have never seen how is this going to affect people in the u s the first impact will be felt through energy markets russia is a major exporter of both oil and natural gas and the prospect of disruptions to its exports have sent prices for both commodities sharply higher in recent days brent crude the global benchmark for oil prices went as high as 105 79 on thursday for the front month contract that surge will likely be felt at the gas pump where consumers in the u s are already paying an average of 3 54 a gallon though it s higher in some states such as california meanwhile surging natural gas prices could mean higher bills for heating and electricity that s even more true in europe which is heavily dependent on natural gas from russia russia is also a significant source of key metals such as aluminum and nickel both of which have wide industrial use and both russia and ukraine are important agricultural exporters together the two countries supply more than a quarter of the world s wheat exports and what about inflation and the u s recovery those are the other potential pain points from the invasion consumer prices surged 7 5 in january from a year earlier the biggest annual gains since 1982 the federal reserve has already indicated it plans to start raising interest rates at its next meeting in march and the central bank is ready to move more aggressively should inflation accelerate yet despite the prospect of higher inflation in the near term it s harder to predict the impact from the invasion over the longer term there s also the prospect that all of the uncertainty from russia s invasion could slow down economic growth revised data from the commerce department on thursday showed the economy grew even faster in the last quarter of 2021 than previously reported expanding at an annual pace of 7 the highest in decades frederic j brown afp via getty images afp via getty images gas prices hit over 6 per gallon at a station in los angeles on wednesday that means the economy came into the new year with a lot of momentum the conflict in ukraine is unlikely to derail that recovery but it is another complication and if growth slows that provides another wrinkle for the federal reserve to consider at it looks to crack down on inflation slower growth could make the fed s plans to raise interest rates a little bit more complicated but central bank officials in recent days have not sounded as if they will change their plans fed chairman jerome powell is set to testify before congress next week for previously scheduled appearances and he s likely to provide more insight into his current thinking what about the impact from global sanctions on russia the u s and european countries are moving to impose tougher sanctions on russia including on its banking and financial systems the u s is also considering limiting exports of certain high tech goods to russia which could affect domestic companies but it s worth noting that russia is a relatively small economy and it s not a big trading partner with the u s the fallout will be greater in europe which has much closer commercial ties with moscow and imports much of its energy needs from the country the wild card is the prospect that russia will retaliate with cyberattacks which could have economic and financial implications in the u s copyright 2022 npr to see more visit www npr org

updated february 24 2022 at 5 19 pm et stocks staged a remarkable recovery on thursday bouncing back from a steep plunge earlier in the day after russia s invasion of ukraine spooked markets underlining just how volatile conditions remain in wall street the dow jones industrial average rose 92 points or 0 3 after earlier dropping more than 800 points while the s p 500 rose 1 5 after earlier falling more than 2 the volatility in the nasdaq was even starker the index fell more than 3 in the morning momentarily entering what s known as a bear market but ended the day up 3 3 a bear market is when an index drops by 20 or more from its recent record high the invasion also sent crude prices above 100 a barrel for the first time since 2014 though oil later pared gains still crude prices remain high which is likely to reinforce inflation fears at a time when consumer prices were already surging at their fastest annual pace in 40 years here are four things to know as global markets become volatile how bad are things on wall street right now it s been a tough year for stocks stocks had already been falling though most of the year because of fears about inflation and the prospect of higher interest rates the geopolitical tensions in recent days had already made things worse as investors braced for a russian invasion of ukraine both the dow and the s p entered correction territory this week meaning the indexes had fallen more than 10 from their recent record highs though predicting stock moves is impossible analysts warn sentiment will be cautious for a while global stock markets also dropped after the invasion with russian stocks down sharply while the ruble the country s currency hit a record low anatolii stepanov afp via getty images afp via getty images ukrainian servicemen get ready to repel an attack in ukraine s lugansk region on thursday how is this going to affect people in the u s the first impact will be felt through energy markets russia is a major exporter of both oil and natural gas and the prospect of disruptions to its exports have sent prices for both commodities sharply higher in recent days brent crude the global benchmark for oil prices went as high as 105 79 on thursday for the front month contract that surge will likely be felt at the gas pump where consumers in the u s are already paying an average of 3 54 a gallon though it s higher in some states such as california i know this is hard president biden told reporters at the white house americans are already hurting i will do everything in my power to limit the pain the american people are feeling at the gas pump this is critical to me but this aggression cannot go unanswered if it did the consequences for america would be much worse meanwhile surging natural gas prices could mean higher bills for heating and electricity that s even more true in europe which is heavily dependent on natural gas from russia russia is also a significant source of key metals such as aluminum and nickel both of which have wide industrial use and both russia and ukraine are important agricultural exporters together the two countries supply more than a quarter of the world s wheat exports and what about inflation and the u s recovery those are the other potential pain points from the invasion consumer prices surged 7 5 in january from a year earlier the biggest annual gains since 1982 the federal reserve has already indicated it plans to start raising interest rates at its next meeting in march and the central bank is ready to move more aggressively should inflation accelerate yet despite the prospect of higher inflation in the near term it s harder to predict the impact from the invasion over the longer term there s also the prospect that all of the uncertainty from russia s invasion could slow down economic growth revised data from the commerce department on thursday showed the economy grew even faster in the last quarter of 2021 than previously reported expanding at an annual pace of 7 the highest in decades frederic j brown afp via getty images afp via getty images gas prices hit over 6 per gallon at a station in los angeles on wednesday that means the economy came into the new year with a lot of momentum the conflict in ukraine is unlikely to derail that recovery but it is another complication and if growth slows that provides another wrinkle for the federal reserve to consider at it looks to crack down on inflation slower growth could make the fed s plans to raise interest rates a little bit more complicated but central bank officials in recent days have not sounded as if they will change their plans fed chairman jerome powell is set to testify before congress next week for previously scheduled appearances and he s likely to provide more insight into his current thinking what about the impact from global sanctions on russia the u s and european countries are moving to impose tougher sanctions on russia including on its banking and financial systems the u s is also considering limiting exports of certain high tech goods to russia which could affect domestic companies but it s worth noting that russia is a relatively small economy and it s not a big trading partner with the u s the fallout will be greater in europe which has much closer commercial ties with moscow and imports much of its energy needs from the country the wild card is the prospect that russia will retaliate with cyberattacks which could have economic and financial implications in the u s copyright 2022 npr to see more visit

in an act of aggression not witnessed in the post world war ii era russia s invasion of ukraine added to the list of uncertainties facing investors what s the best way to navigate the markets where are the opportunities we asked several leading market observers for their opinions on what investors should expect next we highlighted some of their thoughts here but here s an expanded look at their views geopolitics vs economics this was a major shock says ed yardeni president and chief investment strategist for yardeni research which provides global investment advice and analysis but the u s economy will weather the geopolitical storm when the markets rebound it will reinforce the historical evidence that geopolitical events represent buying opportunities yardeni recommends sticking to his stay at home theme saying overweighting u s stocks makes more sense as europe will be challenged near term by its proximity to the violence and the potential refugee crisis resulting from the war he notes too he is hearing concerns mostly among european clients about possible margin calls resulting from skyrocketing oil and agricultural prices that could undermine some financial firms still the invasion increases the chances of a recession especially if consumers already staring at higher energy and food bills tighten their purse strings inflation instead of waning in the next few months as he had expected might become further entrenched if oil and agricultural prices stay high due to sanctions and supply chain disruptions become further exacerbated russia is responsible for 33 of the world supply of palladium a metal that is critical to the automobile industry morningstar s chief u s market strategist david sekera maintains too the biggest risk to u s stocks is the potential for heightened inflationary costs if sanctions are imposed on russian oil and natural gas and agricultural crops such as wheat noting russia and ukraine account for 25 to 30 of global wheat exports the biggest risk to markets he says would be if the u s became directly engaged in the conflict history has shown says andy kapyrin co chief investment officer of regentatlantic a morristown n j based registered investment advisor with 6 billion under management that there is an immediate market reaction driven by fear of the unknown but markets tend to recover quickly because there s not a lot of impact on major economic fundamentals especially in developed countries watch the fed says yardeni today s events throw cold water on the extreme hawkishness expressed by some fed governors they will likely slow down the pace and deliver 25 basis points in march he also expects the fed to maintain assets on its balance sheet and delay the planned runoff it had previously announced kapyrin expects the fed to embark on the fastest pace of rate hikes since 2002 2003 the fed will move aggressively regardless of what s going on with russia he says sector calls since the fed telegraphed its plans to tighten monetary policy the technology sector has underperformed and kapyrin expects that trend to continue u s fundamentals are robust but the large allocation to technology stocks in the indexes could keep the u s out of favor for a while he is a fan of cyclical stocks which he considers well positioned as the pandemic recedes and international stocks which were trading at good valuations and have become more of a bargain since the invasion the better opportunity is in europe says kapyrin u s investors should evaluate their positions abroad and if they have less than a 25 weighting in international they should ratchet it higher in addition to the technology sector kapyrin cautions against investing in small cap companies that are unprofitable and debt laden of which the russell 2000 is chock full jim paulsen chief investment strategist at minneapolis based institutional research outfit leuthold group is optimistic by the amount of pessimism in the market and sees the russian invasion as an emotional event that could be the final washout event of the correction for the s p 500 he is encouraged by the pessimism displayed in the vix the volatility index the aaii american association of individual investors sentiment survey the bull bear ratio and put call ratios as reasons to be bullish corporate fundamentals are extraordinarily good and should continue to be strong among u s stocks he s a fan of cyclicals and small caps for small cap exposure he suggests ijr ishares core s p small cap etf still paulsen predicts international stocks will outperform the s p 500 for the rest of the year and advises investors to take advantage among developed markets he favors australian stocks and euronext nv enxb for exposure to europe his other advice stay away from bonds bond yields will go quite a bit higher watch valuations while we continue to think value stocks are attractive and will benefit from consumer and economic normalization over the course of the year however following the bear market in growth stocks we find a significant number of attractive opportunities for investors says morningstar s sekera geopolitical events are notoriously hard to predict and any new escalation ahead could still derail the markets he says however for long term investors based on a composite of our equity valuations the u s markets are trading within range we consider to be fairly valued in fact the market is now trading near the bottom of that fair value range
a bipartisan group of lawmakers is promoting a handful of bills that aim to protect michigan children from lead poisoning continuing an effort launched in late 2021 these bills represent a series of improvements to our public health laws that bring michigan up to date and into alignment with the cdc blood lead level triggers epa guidance on lead paint remediation said rep rachel hood d grand rapids in december when she introduced the bills to the house health policy committee stay one step ahead join our email list for the latest news subscribe house bills 5413 5421 or the lead bill package advocate various provisions aimed at strengthening protections against youth lead poisoning kory groetsch division director of environmental health at the michigan department of health and human services explained during the committee hearing last week that michigan s lead abatement act hasn t been updated since 2005 and these bills will modernize the state s lead laws hood and multiple testifiers emphasized there is no safe level of lead for human consumption however nearly 78 of michigan children have lead in their blood said hood a potent neurotoxin lead can significantly affect child development and lead to developmental delays and learning difficulties michigan has the third highest level of lead in children s blood in the country hood said while action has been taken at the federal level to remove lead from gasoline lead is still pervasive in our communities in michigan it s in our water our pipes our homes our paint food and eventually it ends up in our bodies she said rep jim lilly r ferrysburg is sponsoring hb 5413 which modifies and reorganizes definitions related to lead rep pauline wendzel r coloma is sponsoring hb 5415 which modifies the definition of elevated blood level for certain minors and modifies and reorganizes other definitions for purposes of lead abatement rep sarah anthony d lansing is sponsoring hb 5417 which modifies reporting requirements for blood lead levels for minors jon gold chair of the michigan chapter of the american academy of pediatrics aap government affairs and advocacy committee who supports these three bills praised the addition of the cdc s blood lead reference value to the legislation this is based on levels of lead in the population and by putting a reference to it in the bill there will be no need to change the legislation every time the reference value changes said gold hood is sponsoring hb 5414 which would require health care providers to receive continuing education on lead poisoning identification and treatment gold explained that aap opposes this specific bill because it adds an undue burden for providers in michigan since many providers don t care for children many wouldn t benefit from this extra education requirement since it so far has no provision limiting the requirement to only providers who care for children gold is concerned the bill might disincentivize providers from supporting the initiative rep angela whitwer d charlotte is sponsoring hb 5416 which requires an annual lead screening test for children under 6 who are enrolled in medicaid and michild aap opposes this bill as currently written because providers face numerous barriers in accessing lead screening tests due to the pandemic and shortages of these tests rep julie rogers d kalamazoo is sponsoring hb 5418 which requires automatic qualification for children s special health care services for certain children affected by lead exposure rep julie calley r portland is sponsoring hb 5423 which modifies referral requirements for blood levels for minors gold said aap is opposed to these provisions because most children with lead poisoning don t need specialty care and receive their care through primary care providers he would prefer the state to invest in programs like developmental preschool or child care and developmental monitoring programs for children rep stephanie young d detroit is sponsoring hb 5419 which requires lead based paint inspections before the sale or transfer of real estate that was built before 1978 the year the federal government banned consumers from using lead based paint according to mara herman health policy specialist at the ecology center 70 of michigan s housing stock was built before 1978 hood noted that lead based paint is a major source of lead poisoning and poses a major threat to michigan children and families aap strongly supports this bill according to gold but wants to see plumbing included as a potential source of lead in homes that should be inspected rep timothy beson r bay city is sponsoring hb 5420 which provides for administration of a lead renovation repair and painting rule program enforcing strict oversight over utilization of lead based paint rep cynthia neeley d flint is sponsoring hb 5421 which modifies the definition of lead abatement gold said aap supports both of these bills the bill package currently remains in its committee of origin pending a vote from committee members

putin is the aggressor biden announces new round of sanctions after russian attacks against ukraine share copy link copy good afternoon the russian military has begun a brutal assault on the people of ukraine without provocation without justification without necessity this is a premeditated attack vladimir putin has been planning this for months as we ve been saying all along he moved more than 175 000 troops military equipment and positions along the ukrainian border he moved blood supplies into position they had built a field hospital which tells you all you need to know about his intentions all along he rejected every good faith effort the united states and our allies and partners made to address our mutual security concerns through dialogue to avoid needless conflict and avert human suffering for weeks for weeks we have been warning that this would happen and now it s unfolding largely as we predicted in the past week we ve seen shelling increase in the donbas region in eastern ukraine controlled by russian backed separatists russian the russian government has perpetrated cyberattacks against ukraine we saw a stage political theater in moscow outlandish and baseless claims that ukraine was a ukraine was about to invade and launch a war against russia that ukraine was prepared to use chemical weapons ukraine committed a genocide without any evidence we saw a flagrant violation of international law and attempting to unilaterally create two new so called republics on sovereign ukrainian territory and at the very moment that the united nations security council is meeting to stand up for ukraine s sovereignty to stave off invasion putin declared his war within moments moments missile strikes began to fall on historic cities across ukraine then came in the air raids followed by tanks and troops rolling in we ve been transparent with the world we shared declassified evidence about russia s plans and cyber attacks and false pretext so that there could be no confusion or cover up about what putin was doing putin is the aggressor putin chose this war and now he and his country will bear the consequences today i m authorizing additional strong sanctions and new limitations on what can be exported to russia this is going to impose severe costs on the russian economy both immediately and over time we have purposefully designed these sanctions to maximize the long term impact on russia and to minimize the impact in the united states and our allies i want to be clear the united states is not doing this alone for months we ve been building a coalition of partners representing well more than half the global economy 27 members of the european union including france germany italy as well as the united kingdom canada japan australia new zealand and many others to amplify the joint impact of our response i just spoke with the g 7 leaders this morning and we re in full and total agreement we will limit russia s ability to do business in dollars euros pounds and yen to be part of the global economy we ll limit their ability to do that we re going to stunt the ability of to finance and grow russia the russian military we re going to impose major and we re gonna impair their ability to compete in high tech 21st century economy we ve already seen the impact of our actions on russia s currency and the ruble which early today hit its weakest level ever ever in history the russia stock market plunged today the russian government borrowing rates spiked by over 15 today s actions we ve now sanctioned russian banks that together hold around 1 trillion dollars in assets we ve cut off russia s largest bank a bank that holds more than one third of russia s banking assets by itself cut it off in the u s financial system and today we re also blocking four more major banks that means every asset they have in america will be frozen this includes vtb the second largest bank in russia which has 250 billion dollars in assets as promised we re also adding the names to the list of russian elites and their family members that are sanctioning that were sanctioned as well as i said on tuesday these are people who personally gain from the kremlin s policies and they should share in the pain we will keep up this drumbeat of those designations against corrupt billionaires in the days ahead on tuesday we stopped the russian government from raising money from us or european investors now we re going to apply the same restrictions to russia s largest state owned enterprises companies with assets that exceed 1 4 trillion some of the most powerful impacts our actions will come over time as we squeeze russians access to finances and technology for strategic sectors of its economy and degrade its industrial capacity for years to come between our actions and those of our allies and partners we estimate that will cut off more than half of russia s high tech imports will strike a blow to their ability to continue to modernize their military it will degrade their aerospace industry including their space program it will hurt their ability to build ships reducing their ability to compete economically and it will be a major hit to putin s long term strategic ambitions and we re preparing to do more in addition to the economic penalties were imposing we re also taking steps to defend our nato allies it s particularly in east tomorrow nato will convene a summit will be there to bring together the leaders of 30 allied nations and close partners to affirm our solidarity and to map out the next steps we will take to further strengthen all aspects of our nato alliance although we provided over 650 million dollars in defensive assistance to ukraine just this year last year let me say it again our forces are not and will not be engaged in the conflict with russia in ukraine our forces are not going to europe to fight in ukraine but to defend our nato allies and reassure those allies in the east as i made crystal clear the united states will defend every inch of nato territory with the full force of american power and the good news is native was more united and more determined than ever there is no doubt no doubt that the united states and every nato ally will meet our article five commitments which says in an attack on one is an attack on all over the past few weeks ordered thousands of additional forces to germany and poland as part of our commitment to nato on tuesday in response to russia s aggressive action including his troop presence in belarus and the black sea i ve authorized deployment of ground and air forces already stationed in europe to nato s eastern flank allies estonia latvia lithuania poland and romania our allies have also been stepping up adding the other allies rest of nato adding their own forces and capabilities to ensure collective defense and today within hours of russia is unleashing its assault nato came together and authorized and activated an activation of response plans this will enable nato s high readiness forces to deploy and when and where they are needed to protect our nato allies on the eastern boundaries of europe and now i m authorizing additional u s forces capabilities to deploy to germany as part of nato s response including some of the us based forces that the department of defense placed on standby weeks ago i ve also spoken with defense secretary austin and chairman of the joint chiefs general milley about preparations for additional moves should they become necessary to protect our nato allies and support the greatest military alliance in the history of the world as we respond my administration is using the tools every tool that s supposed to protect american families and businesses from rising prices at the gas pump you know we re taking active steps to bring down the cost an american oil and gas companies should not should not exploit this moment to hike their prices to raise profits you know in our sanctions package were specifically designed to allow energy payments to continue we are closely monitoring energy supplies for any disruption we ve been coordinating with major oil producing and consuming countries towards our common interest to secure global energy supplies we are actively working with countries around the world to elevate collective release from the strategic petroleum reserves of major energy consuming countries and the united states will release additional barrels of oil as conditions warrant i know this is hard and the americans are already hurting i will do everything in my power to limit the pain the american people are feeling at the gas pump this is critical to me but this aggression cannot go unanswered if it did the consequences for america would be much worse america stands up to bullies we stand up for freedom this is who we are and they also repeat the warning i made last week if russia pursues cyber attacks against our companies our critical infrastructure we are prepared to respond for months we ve been working closely with our pride with the private sector to harden our cyber defenses sharpen our ability to respond to russian cyber attacks as well i spoke last night to president zelensky of ukraine and i assured him that the united states together with our allies and partners in europe will support the ukrainian people as they defend their country will provide your humanitarian relief to ease their suffering in the early days of this conflict russia propaganda outlets will keep trying to hide the truth and claim success for its military operation against a made up threat but history has shown time and again how swift gains and territory eventually give way to grinding occupations acts of mass civil mass civil disobedience and strategic dead ends the next few weeks and months we hardened the people of ukraine putin has unleashed a great pain on them but the ukrainian people have known 30 years of independence they have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards this is a dangerous moment for all of europe for the freedom around the world putin is a committed assault on the very principles that uphold the global peace now the entire world sees clearly but putin and his criminal and and his criminal allies are really all about this was never about a genuine security concerns on their part it was always about naked aggression about putin s desire for empire by any means necessary by bullying russia s neighbors through coercion and corruption by changing borders by force and ultimately by choosing a war without a cause putin s actions betrays sinister vision for the future of our world one more nations take what they want by force but it is a vision that the united states and freedom loving nations everywhere will oppose with every tool of our considerable power the united states and our allies and partners will emerge from this stronger more united more determined and more purposeful putin s aggression against ukraine will end up costing russia dearly economically and strategically we will make sure of that putin will be a pariah on the international stage any nation accountant is russia s naked aggression against ukraine will be stained by association the history of this area is written putin s choice to make a totally unjustifiable war on ukraine we love love russia weaker and the rest of the world stronger liberty democracy human dignity these are the forces far more powerful and fear and oppression they cannot be extinguished by tyrants like putin and his armies they cannot be erased by people from people s hearts and hopes by any amount of violence and intimidation they endure in the contest between democracy and autocracy between sovereignty and subjugation make no mistake freedom will prevail god bless the people of a free and democratic ukrainian may god protect our troops associated press zeke thank you so you believe to speak with president putin at this point and what interactions have you had with the russian government i heard the first part do i have any plans to speak with putin at this point and what what communications did you have with the kremlin as far as military operation ukraine and making sure this is not spiral into a larger conflict it s a large conflict already the way we re gonna sure it s not going to aspire to a larger conflict is by providing all the forces needed in the eastern european nations that are members of nato nato is more united than it s ever been and i have no plans to talk with putin mr president ah wall street journal serena mr president you didn t mention swift in your sanctions that you announced is there a reason why the u s isn t doing that is there a disagreement among allies um regarding swift and whether uh russia should be allowed to be a part of it the sanctions that we have proposed on all the banks of equal consequence maybe more consequence than swift one number two uh it is always an option but right now that s not the position that the rest of europe wishes to take um cecilia vega abc sir sanctions clearly have not been enough to deter vladimir putin to this point what is going to stop him how and when does this end and do you see him trying to go beyond ukraine and a second question i ll just give to you now this statement that he gave last night will that the what the threat that he gave the west will face consequences greater than any you have faced in history is he threatening a nuclear strike i have no idea what he s threatening i know what he has done one and number two no one expected the sanctions to prevent anything from happening it has to show it s gonna take time and we have to show resolve so he knows what s coming and so the people of russia know what he s brought on them that s what this is all about this is gonna take time it s not gonna occur he s gonna say oh my god these sanctions are coming i m gonna stand down he s gonna test the resolve of the west to see if we stay together and we will we will and it will impose significant costs on him will he go beyond ukraine sir do you see him going yes two topics just really quick first markets are down and gas prices are up i know you always stress the difference between wall street and main street but everybody seems to be in for some economic pain how economically painful is it going to get for people in this country and i do have one more question first of all there s no doubt that when a major nuclear power attacks and invades another country that the world is going to respond and markets can respond all over the world so there s no doubt about it number one number two the notion that this is going to last for a long time is highly unlikely as long as we continue to stay resolved in imposing the sanctions were going to impose on russia period what s your next question i m sorry the next question is did you underestimate putin and would you still describe them the way that it did in the summer as a worthy adversary at the time he was i made it clear as an adversary and i said he was worthy i didn t underestimate him and i ve read most of everything he s written did you read the shins i m not in a wise guy the you you heard the speech he made almost an hour s worth of speeches why he was going into ukraine he has much larger ambitions in ukraine he wants to in fact reestablish the former soviet union that s what this is about and i think that his his ambitions are are completely contrary to the place where the rest of the world has arrived you re confident that these devastating sanctions are going to be as devastating as russian missiles and bullets and tanks yes russian bullets missiles and tanks in ukraine yes i am mr if sanctions cannot stop president putin what penalty can i didn t say sanctions couldn t stop him you ve been talking about the threat of these sanctions for several weeks now yes but the threat of the sanctions in imposing the sanctions and seeing the effect of the sanctions are two different things there are two different things and we re now going to he s going to begin to see the effect of the sanctions and what will that do how will that change his mindset here because it was so weak in his country that he ll have to make a very very difficult choices of whether to continue to move toward being a second rate power or in fact respond you said in recent weeks that big nations cannot bluff when it comes to something like this you recently said that the idea of personally sanctioning president putin was on the table is that a step that you re prepared to take and if not a bluff it s on the table sanctioning president putin why not sanction him today sir why not sanction him today mr president if i can you detailed some severe and swift new sanctions today and said the impact it will have over time but given the full scale invasion given that you re not pursuing disconnecting russia from what s called swift the international banking system or other sanctions at your disposal respectfully sir what more are you waiting for specifically with the sanctions were imposed exceeds swift the sanctions we opposed to exceed anything that s ever been done the sanctions we imposed have generated two thirds of the world joining us they are profound sanctions let s have a conversation in another month or so to see if they re working yes can i ask you about zelensky sir you spoke to vladimir zelensky yesterday sir what s the risk that we are watching the beginning of another cold war and is there now a complete rupture in us and russian relations there is a complete rupture right now in us russian relations if they continue on this path that they re on and in terms of cold war that depends you have the vast majority of the rest of the world and total opposition to what he s doing from asia to south america to europe around the world and so it s going to be a cold day for russia the idea you don t see a whole lot of people coming to his defense and are you are you if i could follow up sir are you urging china to help isolate russia ru urging china to help isolate russia i m not prepared to comment and at the moment thank you thank you thank you all right yeah no no no he s had his hand up a long time thank you mr president how concerned are you that putin wants to go beyond ukraine into other countries and the u s will have to get involved if he moves into nato countries well if he did move into nato countries he will be involved we will be involved the only thing that i m convinced of is if we don t stop now he ll be emboldened if we don t move against him now with these two significant sanctions he will be emboldened look you know every well anyway anything more about your conversation i m sorry i can t hear you sir india which is a major defense partner of the united states is india with fully with you on the issue of ukraine and russia does the defense department of the united states india is one of your major defense partners is india fully in sync with the united states on on russia we re going to be we re in consultation with with india today we haven t resolved that completely thank you all very much yes get national breaking news alerts the latest breaking updates delivered straight

bonds and while not at historic lows the 2s10s curve slope for treasuries is marking a return to some of the flattest levels in a few years said eric kazatsky of bloomberg intelligence municipals on the other hand are catching up in terms of direction but not pace the question on investors minds is what could this mean for municipal returns he said he said the present trend resembles that of 2013 when the slope delta was below zero and municipal returns were negative while the impact on various duration buckets for munis may vary he said investors should at the very least expect sustained negative overall returns muni treasury ratios have been cheaper this year due to rising rates and outflows the most significant change however has occurred at the front end of the curve with two year ratios climbing upwards of 70 this week from 49 at the end of august 2021 he said while the five year part of the curve moved in a similar manner kazatsky said the change was significantly more subdued in absolute terms due to a higher beginning point in august as we approach the end of the first quarter and municipal supply is down almost 13 technical factors may have more impact he said almost 75 billion in principal and interest will be returned to investors over the next few months he said it s logical to suppose that most of this cash will re enter the municipal market

transportation sector conference last week the san diego county regional airport authority had the biggest single california airport bond deal in a 1 9 billion combined tax exempt new money and taxable refunding revenue deal priced in november by bofa securities and siebert williams shank pension obligation bonds continued to gain traction both in california and nationally which brown said is very much a function of low taxable interest rates we were doing those in california with true interest costs of 2 50 to 3 50 well below the discount rate she also saw a bump in essential housing credits which was somewhat new to the market in 2021 brown said workforce housing financings were also higher in 2021 than prior years that was more a function of interest rates in the vein of what the borrowing rates were for the owners of those complexes the california state government issued 26 3 billion last year a 23 increase from a year prior according to the state treasurer s office refinitiv ranked california as the region s top issuer selling almost 6 9 billion in 2020 64 of the state government s debt issuance was new money and 36 was refunding but in 2021 that reversed and 42 was new money and 58 was refunding said tim schaefer deputy treasurer for public finance the majority of that increase can be accounted for in the tobacco state securitization sales schaefer said the municipal bond market s largest 2021 deal was the 4 2 billion taxable refunding priced dec 8 by jefferies and citi for the golden state tobacco securities corp jefferies and citi also had priced a 1 8 billion in golden state tobacco taxable go refunding on sept 8 the far west s eighth largest deal that made golden state tobacco the region s number two issuer at 6 5 billion the state originally securitized its master settlement agreement revenue in the early 2000s as it sought revenue to plug state budget holes the tobacco bonds are a mix of shorter duration current interest bonds and capital appreciation bonds with longer maturities schaefer said it was time to go through and adjust them because you can t cherry pick the offering and just refund the 2040 maturities but not the 2043 maturities schaefer said to do so could introduce timing errors into the application of the tobacco master settlement agreement the deal involved two offerings one of enhanced bonds that have a backdoor pledge of the state s general fund and then bonds that are completely unsecured schaefer said the bonds have to work in harmony with each other which is why both bond sales had to come last year he said the state decided to refund the tobacco bonds last year because of the compression of spreads and interest rates schaefer said with tobacco you pay attention to rates and we concluded that rising interest rates were in store based on advice from the department of finance and our financial advisors the second largest deal in the region was a 2 billion combined new money and refunding sale of california state general obligation bonds priced by morgan stanley and wells fargo on sept 14 the san diego regional airport authority deal came in third hawaii had the largest deal outside california snagging the fourth spot with 1 8 billion combined new money and refunding taxable state go deal priced by bofa securities and morgan stanley the aloha state also had the distinction of seeing the largest decline in bond issuance from all its issuers down 38 to 3 billion the only other two states to see declines in bond volume were nevada dropping 20 and oregon falling 14 6 washington s state government was the region s fifth ranked issuer and largest outside california at 2 5 billion all the state s issuers sold 12 95 billion in municipal debt the second most in the far west and 29 ahead of 2020 in 2022 schaefer expects that the popularity of refundings will decline and there may be reluctance to issue debt in general we now have many economists and market participants saying that we could have as many as seven hikes in fed fund rates this year and that they are trimming the purchases of long dated bonds which will also put upward pressure on interest rates schaefer said the other big wild card is inflation and the uncertainty over russia and the ukraine combined with the taking a more hawkish stance all of which adds up to stiff headwinds for anyone thinking about issuing debt jpmorgan has indicated two year rates could be higher by 100 basis points in the fourth quarter and the 10 year could be 150 basis points by the end of the year schaefer said for the far west bofa securities topped the senior manager rankings credited by refinitiv with 15 6 billion in 103 deals followed by citi and morgan stanley pfm financial advisors snagged first place among financial advisors credited with 15 8 billion in 130 deals followed by public resources advisory group and knn public finance orrick herrington sutcliffe retained its lead among bond counsel credited with 49 5 billion on 304 deals trailed by stradling yocca carlson rauth and kutak rock
russia s military operation in ukraine seems to be going very successfully of course the initial reports should be taken with a grain of salt but the question arises what will the russians find in ukraine reports from the first day of the russian military operation in ukraine show that the ukrainian army does not have much to counter the russian forces the ukrainian army was heavily armed by nato but since most ukrainian soldiers were conscripted to serve against their will their fighting spirit seems to be decidedly low in many places it is reported that the russian army met no resistance at the border and was literally waved through by the ukrainian forces where fighting has occurred ukrainian soldiers have waved white flags this is not true everywhere but it seems to have happened very frequently however the so called volunteer battalions in particular composed of volunteer ukrainian nationalists are probably resisting fiercely russia reports that there is no longer a functioning military airport in ukraine and that a great deal of weaponry especially anti aircraft and artillery was destroyed in the first few hours the shooting down of several turkish made bayraktar drones was also reported cnn filmed russian soldiers allegedly occupying kiev airport this would make sense as russia has announced that one of the goals of the military operation is to denazify ukraine apparently the occupation of civilian airports is intended to limit the ability of those responsible in ukraine to escape u s bioweapons labs in ukraine i have often reported that the u s more specifically the pentagon operates several bioweapons labs in ukraine the last time i reported on this was on january 27 the u s has always refused international inspections of its labs so no one knows what they are researching in these labs but we can assume that russian special forces will take a closer look at these labs in the coming days and this seems to be exactly a can of worms a tweet was published on twitter about this and the user was immediately blocked i won t go into the content of the tweet which can still be found in an internet archive if you are interested you can view it here my point is that twitter was so quick to delete a tweet and its author merely because he pointed out that there are u s bioweapons labs in ukraine and that it looks like their capture is one of the important targets of the russian military operation who russia still seeks in ukraine russian president putin said the following in his address to the nation on monday about the odesa tragedy of may 2014 in which nearly 50 people were burned alive by radical maidan supporters and which has never been solved in ukraine the criminals who committed this atrocity have not been punished and no one is looking for them but we know their names and will do everything to punish them find them and bring them to justice considering that the russian army is also on its way to odessa some people there might be getting very nervous right now and trying to leave the city quickly the same goes for the radical neo nazis who are in power in ukraine on russian television russian officials say that they also want to hold those responsible for other crimes for example in the donbass accountable introduction this devastating 2018 article that brought on an fbi crackdown gives the background of how the 2017 research funded by usaid cia at the university of north carolina using wuhan horseshoe bat virus may have ended up centering on the us in either a horrible backfire or a purposeful deep state plot against the us it all began with project clear vision which is outlined below the studies tied to this have been cleansed and published by the on the make academics and scientists who took the cia s cash and turned off their common sense and professional ethics if such things exist anymore dilyana gaytandzhieva is a bulgarian investigative journalist and middle east correspondent over the last two years she has published a series of revealed reports on weapons smuggling in the past year she came under pressure from the bulgarian national security agency and was fired from her job in the bulgarian newspaper trud daily without explanation despite this dilyana continues her investigations her current report provides an overview of the pentagon s vigor in the development of biological weapons twitter dgaytandzhieva the us army regularly produces deadly viruses bacteria and toxins in direct violation of the un convention on the prohibition of biological

pentagon bio laboratories in 25 countries across the world these us bio laboratories are funded by the defense threat reduction agency dtra under a 2 1 billion military program cooperative biological engagement program cbep and are located in former soviet union countries such as georgia and ukraine the middle east south east asia and africa georgia is a testing ground for bioweapons the lugar center is the pentagon bio laboratory in georgia it is located just 17 km away from the us vaziani military airbase in the capital tbilisi tasked with the military program are biologists from the us army medical research unit georgia usamru g along with private contractors the bio safety level 3 laboratory is accessible only to us citizens with security clearance they are accorded diplomatic immunity under the 2002 us georgia agreement on defense cooperation the usa georgia agreement accords diplomatic status to the us military and civilian personnel including diplomatic vehicles working on the pentagon program in georgia information obtained from the us federal contracts registry clarifies some of the military activities at the lugar center among them research on bio agents anthrax tularemia and viral diseases e g crimean congo hemorrhagic fever and the collection of biological samples for future experiments pentagon contractors produce bio agents under diplomatic cover the defense threat reduction agency dtra has outsourced much of the work under the military program to private companies which are not held accountable to congress and which can operate more freely and move around the rule of law us civilian personnel performing work at the lugar center have also been given diplomatic immunity although they are not diplomats hence private companies can perform work under diplomatic cover for the us government without being under the direct control of the host state in this case the republic of georgia this practice is often used by the cia to provide cover for its agents three private american companies work at the us bio laboratory in tbilisi ch2m hill battelle and metabiota in addition to the pentagon these private contractors perform biological research

epicenter of the ebola crisis where three us biolabs are situated a july 17 2014 report drafted by the viral hemorrhagic fever consortium accused metabiota inc of failing to abide by an existing agreement on how to report test results and for bypassing the sierra leonean scientists working there the report also raised the possibility that metabiota was culturing blood cells at the lab

is a type of biological warfare that uses insects to transmit diseases the pentagon has allegedly performed such entomological tests in georgia and russia biting flies in georgia in 2014 the lugar center was equipped with an insect facility and launched a project raising awareness about barcoding of sand flies in georgia and caucasus the project covered a larger geographic area outside of georgia caucasus in 2014 2015 phlebotomine sand fly species were collected under another project surveillance work on acute febrile illness and all female sand flies were tested to determine their infectivity rate a third project also including sand flies collection studied the characteristics of their salivary glands a biting fly in a bathroom in tbilisi flies in georgia as a result tbilisi has been infested with biting flies since 2015 these biting insects live indoors in bathrooms all year long which was not the typical behavior of these species in georgia previously normally the phlebotomine fly season in georgia is exceptionally short from june to september local people complain of being bitten by these newly appeared flies while naked in their bathrooms they also have a strong resistance to cold and can survive even in the sub zero temperatures in the mountains biting flies in dagestan russia since the start of the pentagon project in 2014 flies similar to those in georgia has appeared in neighboring dagestan russia according to local people they bite and cause rashes their breeding habitats are house drains flies in georgia on the left the same fly in dagestan on the right flies from the phlebotomine family carry dangerous parasites in their saliva which they transmit through a bite to humans the disease which these flies carry is of high interest to the pentagon in 2003 during the us invasion of iraq american soldiers were severely bitten by sandflies and contracted leishmaniasis the disease is native to iraq and afghanistan and if left untreated the acute form of leishmaniasis can be fatal a 1967 us army report arthropods of medical importance in asia and the european ussr lists all local insects their distribution and the diseases that they carry biting flies which live in drains are also listed in the document their natural habitats though are the philippines not georgia or russia source arthropods of medical importance in asia and the european ussr us army report 1967 operation whitecoat infected flies tested to bite humans in 1970 and 1972 sand fly fever tests were performed on humans according to a declassified us army report us

research program carried out by the us army at fort detrick maryland between 1954 and 1973 despite the official termination of the us bio weapons program in 1982 usamriid performed an experiment on whether sand flies and mosquitoes could be vectors of rift valley virus dengue chikungunya and eastern equine encephalitis viruses which the us army researched for their potential as bio weapons killer insects the pentagon has a long history of using insects as vectors for diseases according to a partially declassified 1981 us army report american biowarfare scientists carried out a number of experiments on insects these operations were part of the us entomological warfare under the program for biological weapons of the us the pentagon how to kill 625 000 people for just 0 29 cost per

mosquitoes were dispersed through ground based methods in georgia usa during a us army operation codenamed may day parts of the 1981 us army report such as the mass production of aedes aegypti have not been declassified potentially meaning that the project is still ongoing aedes aegypti also known as the yellow fever mosquito has been widely used in us military operations the same species of mosquitoes are alleged to be the vectors of dengue chikungunya and the zika virus which causes genetic malformations in newborns operation bellweather the us army chemical research and development

decades 60 years the existence of aedes aegypti mosquito was confirmed in west georgia aedes albopictus is a vector of many viral pathogens yellow fever virus dengue chikungunya and zika these tropical mosquitoes aedes albopictus having never been seen before in georgia have also been detected in neighboring russia krasnodar and turkey according to data provided by the european centre for disease prevention and control their spread is unusual for this part of the world aedes aegypti mosquitoes have been distributed only in georgia southern russia and northern turkey they were detected for the first time in 2014 after the start of the pentagon program at the lugar center under another dtra project epidemiology and ecology of tularemia in georgia 2013 2016 6 148 ground ticks were collected 5 871 were collected off the cattle and 1 310 fleas and 731 ticks were caught in 2016 a further 21 590 ticks were collected and studied at the lugar center anthrax outbreak in georgia and nato human trials in 2007 georgia ended its policy of having compulsory annual livestock anthrax vaccination as a result the morbidity rate of the disease reached its peak in 2013 the same year nato started human based anthrax vaccine tests at the lugar center in georgia in 2007 despite the anthrax outbreak the georgian government terminated the compulsory vaccination for 7 years 2013 saw nato start human trials on a new anthrax vaccine in georgia pentagon research on russian anthrax anthrax is one of the bioagents weaponized by the us army in the past despite the pentagon s claims that its program is only defensive there are facts to the contrary in 2016 at the lugar center american scientists carried out research on the genome sequence of the soviet russian bacillus anthracis vaccine strain 55 vniivvim which was funded by the u s defense threat reduction agency s dtra cooperative biological engagement program in tbilisi and administered by metabiota the us contractor under the pentagon program in georgia in 2017 the dtra funded further research ten genome sequences of human and livestock isolates of bacillus anthracis from the country of georgia which was performed by usamru g at the lugar center 34 people intentionally infected with crimean congo hemorrhagic fever cchf in georgia crimean congo hemorrhagic fever cchf is caused by infection through a tick borne virus nairovirus the disease was first characterized in crimea in 1944 and given the name crimean hemorrhagic fever it was then later recognized in 1969 as the cause of illness in congo thus resulting in the current name of the disease in 2014 34 people became infected among which a 4 year old child with cchf 3 of which died the same year pentagon biologists studied the virus in georgia under the dtra project epidemiology of febrile illnesses caused by dengue viruses and other arboviruses in georgia the project included tests on patients with fever symptoms and the collection of ticks as possible vectors of cchv for laboratory analysis 33 people became infected with cchf 3 of them died in georgia source ncdc georgia the cause of the cchf outbreak in georgia is still unknown according to the local veterinary department report only one tick from all of the collected species from the infected villages tested positive for the disease despite the claims of the local authorities that the virus was transmitted to humans from animals all animal blood samples were negative too the lack of infected ticks and animals is inexplicable given the sharp increase of cchf human cases in 2014 meaning that the outbreak was not natural and the virus was spread intentionally in 2016 another 21 590 ticks were collected for the dna database for future studies at the lugar center under the pentagon project assessing the seroprevalence and genetic diversity of crimean congo hemorrhagic fever virus cchfv and hantaviruses in georgia symptoms of cchf military bio lab blamed for deadly cchf outbreak in afghanistan 237 cases of crimean congo hemorrhagic fever cchf have also been reported across afghanistan 41 of which were fatal as of december 2017 according to afghanistan s ministry of health most of the cases have been registered in the capital kabul where 71 cases have been reported with 13 fatalities and in the province of herat near the border with iran 67 cases afghanistan is one of 25 countries across the world with pentagon bio laboratories on their territory the project in afghanistan is part of the us bio defense program cooperative biological engagement program cbep which is funded by the defense threat reduction agency dtra the dtra contractors working at the lugar center in georgia ch2m hill and battelle have also been contracted for the program in afghanistan ch2m hill has been awarded a 10 4 million contract 2013 2017 the pentagon contractors in afghanistan and georgia are the same and so are the diseases which are spreading among the local population in both countries why the pentagon collects and studies bats bats are allegedly the reservoir hosts to the ebola virus middle east respiratory syndrome mers and other deadly diseases however the precise ways these viruses are transmitted to humans are currently unknown numerous studies have been performed under the dtra cooperative biological engagement program cbep in a search for deadly pathogens of military importance in bats 221 bats were euthanized at the lugar center for research purposes in 2014 bats have been blamed for the deadly ebola outbreak in africa 2014 2016 however no conclusive evidence of exactly how the virus jumped to humans has ever been provided which raises suspicions of intentional and not a natural infection engineering deadly viruses is legal in the us mers cov is thought to originate from bats and spread directly to humans and or camels however like ebola the precise ways the virus spreads are unknown 1 980 cases with 699 deaths were reported in 15 countries across the world as of june 2017 caused by mers cov 3 to 4 out of every 10 patients reported with mers have died source who mers cov is one of the viruses that have been engineered by the us and studied by the pentagon as well as influenza and sars confirmation of this practice is obama s 2014 temporary ban on government funding for such dual use research the moratorium was lifted in 2017 and experiments have continued enhanced potential pandemic pathogens ppps experiments are legal in the us such experiments aim to increase the transmissibility and or virulence of pathogens tularemia as bioweapon tularemia also known as rabbit fever is classified as a bioterrorism agent and was developed in the past as such by the us however the pentagon s research on tularemia continues as well as on possible vectors of the bacteria such as ticks and rodents which cause the disease the dtra has launched a number of projects on tularemia along with other especially dangerous pathogens in georgia especially dangerous pathogens edps or select agents represent a major concern for public health globally these highly pathogenic agents have the potential to be weaponized with proof of their military importance seen through the following pentagon projects epidemiology and ecology of tularemia in georgia 2013 2016 60 000 vectors were collected for strain isolates and genome research epidemiology of human tularemia in georgia and human disease epidemiology and surveillance of especially dangerous pathogens in georgia study of select agents among patients with undifferentiated

the us army developed in the past source 1981 us army report pentagon bio laboratories spread diseases in ukraine the dod defense threat reduction agency dtra has funded 11 bio laboratories in the former soviet union country ukraine bordering on russia the us military program is sensitive information ukraine has no control over the military bio laboratories on its own territory according to the 2005 agreement between the us dod and the ministry of health of ukraine the ukrainian government is prohibited from public disclosure of sensitive information about the us program and ukraine is obliged to transfer to the us department of defense dod dangerous pathogens for biological research the pentagon has been granted access to certain state secrets of ukraine in connection with the projects under their agreement biowarfare scientists under diplomatic cover among the set of bilateral agreements between the us and ukraine is the establishment of the science and technology center in ukraine stcu an international organization funded mainly by the us government which has been accorded diplomatic status the stcu officially supports projects of scientists previously involved in the soviet biological weapons program over the past 20 years the stcu has invested over 285 million in funding and managing some 1 850 projects of scientists who previously worked on the development of weapons of mass destruction the us personnel in ukraine work under diplomatic cover 364 ukrainians died from swine flu one of the pentagon laboratories is located in kharkiv where in january 2016 at least 20 ukrainian soldiers died from flu like virus in just two days with 200 more being hospitalized the ukrainian government did not report on the dead ukrainian soldiers in kharkiv as of march

most of the pentagon biolabs are located 37 people have been hospitalized for hepatitis a in the ukrainian city of mykolaiv as of january 2018 local police have launched an investigation into infection with human immunodeficiency virus and other incurable diseases three years ago more than 100 people in the same city became infected with cholera both diseases are alleged to have spread through contaminated drinking water in the summer of 2017 60 people with hepatitis a were admitted to hospital in the city of zaporizhia the cause of this outbreak is still unknown in the odessa region 19 children from an orphanage were hospitalized for hepatitis a in june 2017 29 cases of hepatitis a were reported in kharkiv in november 2017 the virus was isolated in contaminated drinking water one of the pentagon bio labs is located in kharkiv which was blamed for the deadly flu outbreak a year ago which claimed the lives of 364 ukrainians ukraine and russia hit by new highly virulent cholera infection in 2011 ukraine was hit by a cholera outbreak 33 patients were reportedly hospitalized for severe diarrhea a second outbreak struck the country in 2014 when more than 800 people all across ukraine were reported to have contracted the disease in 2015 at least 100 new cases were registered in the city of mykolaiv alone a new highly virulent variant of the cholera agent vibrio cholera with high genetic similarity to the strains reported in ukraine hit moscow in 2014 according to a 2014 russian research anti plaque institute genetic study the cholera strain isolated in moscow was similar to the bacteria which caused the epidemic in neighboring ukraine southern research institute one of the us contractors working at the bio laboratories in ukraine has projects on cholera as well as on influenza and zika all pathogens of military importance to the pentagon along with southern research institute two other private american companies operate military bio labs in

institute police investigate botulism toxin poisoning in ukraine 115 botulism cases with 12 deaths were reported in ukraine in 2016 in 2017 the ukrainian ministry of health confirmed a further 90 new cases with 8 deaths of botulinum toxin poisoning one of the most poisonous biological substances known according to the local health authorities the cause of the outbreak was food poisoning into which police launched an investigation the ukrainian government stopped supplying antitoxin in 2014 and no botulism vaccines in stock were available during the 2016 2017 outbreak botulism is a rare and extremely dangerous illness caused by a toxin produced by the bacterium clostridium botulinum 1 gm of the toxin can kill as many as 1 million people botulinum neurotoxin poses a major bio weapon threat because of its extreme potency ease of production and transport it causes muscle paralysis respiratory failure and ultimately death if not treated immediately a single gram of crystalline toxin evenly dispersed and inhaled can kill more than one million people it could be disseminated via aerosol or by contamination of water and or food supplies the pentagon produces live viruses bacteria

100 million in vaccines production from tobacco plants the companies involved in the project are owned by the biggest american tobacco companies mediacago inc is co owned by philip morris and kentucky bioprocessing a subsidiary of reynolds american which is owned by british american tobacco currently they are producing flu and ebola vaccines from tobacco plants the 100 million program blue angel was launched as a response to the h1n1 pandemic in 2009 medicago being awarded 21 million to produce 10 000 million doses of an influenza vaccine within one month blue angel program manager dr john julias explains although there are multiple plant species and other organisms being explored as alternative protein production platforms the us government has continued to make an investment in tobacco based manufacturing photos credit darpa the plant based vaccine production method works by isolating a specific antigen protein that triggers a human immune response from the targeted virus a gene from the protein is transferred to bacteria which is used to infect plants the plants then start producing the protein that will be used for vaccinations it is not clear why the pentagon chooses to invest in vaccines produced from tobacco plants amongst all other plant species which they explored medicago co owned by philip morris paid 495 000 for lobbying the department of defense the congress and the department of health and human services for funding to advance technology to support public health preparedness applications the pentagon funded tobacco companies to develop new technology and to profit from vaccines biological experiments are war crimes article 8 of the rome statute of the international criminal court icc defines biological experiments as war crimes the us

advisor returns as of january 20 2022 nick colangelo president and chief executive officer thank you eric and good morning everyone i ll begin today s call by discussing financial and operational highlights for the fourth quarter and full year as well as current trends and our expectations for 2022 joe will then provide a more detailed update on our financial performance and financial guidance before opening the call to q a the company delivered another year of strong revenue and profit growth in 2021 despite the continued impacts of covid 19 throughout the year total revenue for the year increased 26 to approximately 156 million our top line growth which was at the higher end of the range that we pre announced last month was also in line with our compounded annual revenue growth rate since we launched maci in 2017 we also generated nearly 30 million of adjusted ebitda and operating cash flow in 2021 ending the year with 129 million in cash and investments and no debt as we once again demonstrated the strong p l and cash flow leverage in our business as revenue continues to grow with respect to our fourth quarter results despite the unexpected emergence of the omicron variant in late november and the resulting impact on maci performance in december maci quarterly growth increased compared to the prior quarter and the same period in 2020 achieving record quarterly revenue in the fourth quarter we also finished the year with another strong quarter for epicel as we generated revenue of over 9 5 million for the fifth consecutive quarter from a commercial perspective we continued to see strength across the underlying growth drivers for maci and a high level of brand engagement from surgeons and patients importantly we met our goal of increasing the number of surgeons taking maci biopsies by 20 and generated biopsy growth of 30 for the year with a record quarterly high in the number of biopsies and the number of surgeons taking biopsies in the fourth quarter this strong biopsy growth was also driven by an increase in the biopsies per surgeon of approximately 10 another key performance indicator for maci as our penetration rate in individual practices is now higher than it was prior to the pandemic we also continue to see strength across the key growth drivers for epicel epicel s growth of over 50 for the year was driven in large part by a significant increase in the average number of epicel grafts per patient which we believe was due to the outstanding commercial execution by our burn care sales team this strong performance was also driven by over 30 growth in both the number of epicel biopsies and the number of burn centers treating patients with epicel in 2021 we believe that these key performance indicators will continue to help drive further penetration into epicel s 200 million plus addressable market over the coming years as we announced this morning we expect total revenue in 2022 to increase to approximately 178 million to 189 million with continued margin expansion and strong profit and cash flow growth joe will provide further details regarding our financial guidance in a moment but i wanted to take a minute to discuss the current operating environment and the framework underlying our guidance as we discussed throughout 2021 and in connection with our preannouncement in january we generated strong growth in both maci biopsy surgeons and biopsies in 2021 however due to a variety of covid 19 related factors throughout the year we saw a much more pronounced impact on maci implant growth as historical biopsy to implant conversion patterns were disrupted this was the case again in december as the emergence of the omicron variant resulted in patients deferring cases and scheduled cases being canceled because patients tested positive for covid 19 during their preop screening while these patient related dynamics created a biopsy backlog that we believe should contribute to maci growth this year the timing related to the recapture of this backlog and the normalization of conversion rates remains uncertain at this point given the carryover of the omicron wave into the first quarter we ve started to see general covid 19 conditions begin to improve in february and moving forward we expect continuous improvement throughout the year however because the timing and impact of covid 19 dynamics this year remain difficult to predict we ve assumed a wider range of revenue scenarios in our initial financial guidance for the year the lower end of our revenue range assumes additional significant covid related headwinds and continued disruption within the healthcare environment which would represent a more modest improvement over 2021 the higher end of our range assumes some disruption beyond the first quarter but gradual improvements in patient flow and conversion rates during the year importantly we expect the year over year quarterly growth rate for maci to increase each quarter throughout the year and the midpoint of our revenue growth range for total maci and epicel product revenue is in line with our 20 plus percent compounded annual growth rate that we expect to maintain over the next several years we also expect to generate additional margin expansion and increases in adjusted ebitda and operating cash flow this year as we further enhance our strong profitability profile turning to our pipeline we remain on track for a midyear resubmission of the nexobrid bla which would position nexobrid for a potential commercial launch in the u s in the first half of 2023 we also continue to advance important life cycle management initiatives for maci we expect to meet with the fda later this year to discuss the clinical development program for our custom arthroscopic delivery system which we believe offers the potential to make maci an even simpler and less invasive procedure and to expand the use of maci for the treatment of cartilage defects in the knee we also continue to advance our maci ankle program which we believe could increase our overall maci addressable market to approximately 3 billion finally we re very pleased to have announced plans earlier this month for a new state of the art advanced cell therapy manufacturing and corporate headquarters facility in the boston area the new facility which is expected to begin commercial manufacturing in 2025 will significantly increase our manufacturing capacity and demonstrates our confidence in the continued growth trajectory for maci and epicel in the years ahead i ll now turn the call over to joe to discuss our fourth quarter and full year financial results as well as our financial guidance for 2022 joe mara chief financial officer thanks nick and good morning everyone starting with the income statement total net revenue for the full year grew 26 to 156 2 million driven by strong growth in both of our franchises maci revenue grew 18 to 111 6 million while epicel revenue grew 51 to 41 5 million total net revenue for the fourth quarter increased 5 to 47 6 million versus the fourth quarter of 2020 while product revenues excluding barda related nexobrid shipments grew 6 maci s fourth quarter revenue was 37 3 million growing 8 versus the prior year despite continued covid 19 impact on volumes due primarily to the omicron variant maci fourth quarter revenue increased 56 sequentially versus the third quarter of 2021 compared to a 42 sequential increase for the same period in 2020 epicel fourth quarter revenue was 9 7 million similar to the strong results in q4 2020 of 9 6 million and the fifth straight quarter above 9 5 million for epicel in addition total revenue in the fourth quarter also included approximately 0 5 million of revenue related to the procurement of nexobrid by barda for emergency response preparedness gross profit for the quarter was 34 million or 72 of net revenue compared to 74 of net revenue for the fourth quarter of 2020 this decline in gross margin is mainly driven by the shortfall in revenue versus our initial expectations for the quarter due in large part to our scale up to meet expected demand total operating expenses for the quarter were 29 9 million compared to 21 4 million for the same period in 2020 the increase in operating expenses was primarily due to higher noncash stock compensation expense driven by share price appreciation net income for the quarter was 4 5 million or 0 09 per share compared to net income of 12 2 million or 0 25 per share for the fourth quarter of 2020 non gaap adjusted ebitda for the quarter was 12 8 million or 27 of net revenue and importantly this is now the sixth consecutive quarter that we ve generated positive adjusted ebitda for the full year non gaap adjusted ebitda was 29 5 million an increase of approximately 11 million compared to 18 6 million in 2020 finally we generated approximately 10 6 million of operating cash flow in the quarter and 29 million for the full year and as of the end of the year the company had approximately 129 million in cash and investments compared to 100 million as of december 31 2020 and no debt before turning to 2022 guidance i wanted to comment on capital expenditures which increased in 2021 relative to historical trends this growth was related to the build out of a new office building in cambridge that helped to free up space for additional manufacturing capacity over the next few years we expect capital spend in 2022 to increase as we begin to make preliminary investments for our new facility although the majority of capital expenditures for our new facility are expected in 2023 as well as 2024 transitioning to our financial guidance for 2022 we expect total revenue of 178 million to 189 million maci full year revenue is expected to be in the range of 132 million to 141 million as nick mentioned we are assuming a wider range of maci revenue scenarios for 2022 at this point given the variability of potential covid 19 related impacts on the business the uncertainty around patient behavior dynamics and the timing of the normalization of patient flow and capacity within the overall healthcare system importantly we are expecting another year of double digit growth in surgeons taking maci biopsies that conversion trends begin to normalize throughout the year and that we start to recapture some of the covid driven 2021 biopsy backlog although we expect this to be gradual during the year while there are a number of moving parts to what we are seeing in the first quarter more broadly trends are beginning to improve of late and we project maci volume in q1 will still represent a typical percentage of our full year volume of approximately 18 we would also expect trends to continue to improve during subsequent quarters with year over year quarterly growth rates accelerating throughout the year for epicel we expect full year revenue in the range of 45 5 million to 47 5 million at the midpoint this would be approximately 11 5 million epicel revenue per quarter on average however we expect that it will take a quarter or two to get up to that higher run rate as the team continues to add new burn centers and we anticipate that epicel revenues in the first quarter will be more in line with the recent run rate of approximately 9 5 million per quarter for nexobrid we anticipate recognizing the remaining barda related revenue of approximately 0 5 million in q2 of this year and do not expect commercial revenue from nexobrid this year moving down the p l we expect gross margin to be approximately 70 and full year operating expenses to be in the range of 134 million to 137 million non gaap adjusted ebitda margin for the full year is expected to be approximately 21 an increase from 19 in 2021 for the full year adjusted ebitda is expected to increase from approximately 30 million in 2021 to approximately 40 million in 2022 which also points to continued meaningful growth in our operating cash flow this concludes our prepared remarks we will now open the call to your questions questions answers operator thank you presenters your first question is from ryan zimmerman of btig your line is open ryan zimmerman btig analyst hey good morning thanks for taking the questions and congrats on your progress this year i guess i want to start with maci and the guidance there i appreciate your comments on the first quarter nick and joe help us think through the backlog though there s i think by our estimates from the last quarter there was about a 7 million backlog on maci and so how much of that is assumed in that guidance this year it sounds like some of it and kind of what s that underlying growth rate on maci ex the backlog joe mara chief financial officer thanks ryan this is joe i ll start and take that question so i think as we think about the backlog i think the way we re thinking about it is as we talked about in the prepared remarks we certainly want to be mindful of the operating environment we re in we have a wider range in terms of maci guidance for the year i think as we think about the backlog you re right so in q3 we talked about that number kind of being in the 7 million range as we came out of q4 we actually saw an increase so i d say the number is closer to 10 million in terms of how that plays into the scenarios what i would say is certainly on the higher end of our guidance we would assume or we are assuming a more substantial or substantive part of that backlog is kind of pulls through as part of that revenue number and in the low end i would say it s certainly a much lower percentage so as we think about kind of maci growth for the year i mean there s some competing dynamics certainly we think that backlog can help but as we talked about we don t think conversion rates and kind of patient flow will fully normalize or get closer to fully normalizing until the back half of the year and we also have some kind of covid impacts to start the year so i think all of those are certainly part of the equation when we think about the full year ryan zimmerman btig analyst ok and then your cost just a follow up so just joe help me understand i mean your costs are largely labor related right and there s lower kind of material raw material costs for development of both epicel and maci we re hearing a ton of companies talk about rising wage pressures just given the inflationary environment and so i just want to get your thoughts about what to think about from that perspective both from an sg a level and r d level and appreciating the guidance on adjusted ebitda but just help us think through kind of what kind of pressures you may be feeling on those lines thanks joe mara chief financial officer yes no thanks ryan so certainly we re mindful of kind of the operating environment we re in from a cost perspective and we re considering that as we re thinking about guidance for the year as we talked about we do think we can improve on our gross margin on a year over year basis and similarly on an adjusted ebitda perspective as we think about some of those potential cost kind of impacts i think the good news is a lot of our raw material spend on some of our higher dollar items are tied up in kind of longer term contracts i do think the team got ahead in some areas to make sure we had enough stock and whatnot on a materials perspective but i think to your point i mean we re certainly going to see some impact in terms of inflationary increases on some of our vendor spend some other pieces on the labor piece i think it s important to recognize and remember we ve been in the cambridge area for quite some time there s a lot of competition for labor here so that s something i think that s kind of been here for a while but certainly in the environment we re in that s going to impact labor costs a bit more on a year over year basis so i think we re doing what we can certainly to manage on the cost side but there are some impacts kind of here and there i would say ryan zimmerman btig analyst thanks for taking the question operator thank you your next question is from danielle antalffy of svb leerink your line is open danielle antalffy svb leerink analyst hey good morning guys thanks so much for taking the question just a question on the biopsy backlog and conversion rate i mean nick and joe do you think that there s i guess how are you thinking about the potential to actually keep those patients in the funnel i guess what i m saying is how much visibility or how many touch points do you have with those patients in order to ensure that at some point those patients do get treated and then i have one follow up nick colangelo president and chief executive officer yes thanks danielle good to hear from you and that s a great question and something we re really focused on here right so i think joe went through sort of the dynamics of how we re thinking about for the year that backlog may be worked down and i ll just add one comment there on the first quarter obviously the omicron wave kind of carried into the first quarter so i don t think we re under any illusions that backlog gets worked down in the first quarter given the dynamics but that s more something that we ve consistently been talking about we would expect to occur over the course of the year to your point of the sort of biopsies that were collected last year that under normal circumstances would have converted that is something we are hyper focused on here if you re running a commercial organization you certainly we are in a unique position in that we certainly understand obviously a biopsy comes with a transmittal form we know the surgeon that sent it in the patient the nature of the defects etc and so it s very easy for us from both the marketing and sales team perspective to be able to create those biopsy lists focus our reps on having those discussions with the surgeons so that we re able to kind of make sure we don t lose those biopsies to the extent we can control that and that they don t go stale so that is something we are really focused on there are initiatives on the commercial team to be able to focus on for instance q2 and q3 biopsies from last year so i think we re uniquely positioned to make sure we maintain those touch points and of course we have a very strong case management team that is routinely in contact with surgeons offices and staff regarding patients that are in the pipeline so we think we re that s a focus for us i ll just stand there and we think we have certainly the ability to influence that to the extent possible danielle antalffy svb leerink analyst got it no that s super helpful and then nick it s been a few years since you guys expanded the sales force unfortunately i guess your last sales force expansion was literally right before covid or during the early days of covid just curious about where you think the sales force is today versus where it needs to go from here do you think you have the sales force where it needs to be thanks so much nick colangelo president and chief executive officer well yes we re certainly very pleased with that expansion and the results we ve seen even during these covid times and i think we ve talked about that a lot in terms of the sales force expansion was necessary for a bunch of reasons one we increased our target surgeon universe two we wanted to get sales territories down to kind of more manageable geographic size and for those reasons it was something we needed to do we ve talked during the past couple of years about the performance of the new territories and driving new surgeon acquisitions and so on so we re very pleased and these were highly experienced sales reps that we added so from that perspective we re very pleased we ll take another look as you ll recall when we expanded the sales force back in 2020 it was intended to cover us through pretty much a two to three year period so we will look again sort of at the end of this year about what our needs are going forward and i would just say the performance is kind of the bottom line here right i mean we have access to procedural data for the procedures that make up our market microfractures chondroplasties osteochondral allografts etc that data tells us that since 2019 procedural volumes for the market as a whole are down double digits and over that time period maci revenues are up 20 plus so i think that speaks to the effectiveness of our sales force and we certainly don t ever question kind of expanding it was definitely something that we thought was the right thing to do and we certainly continue to think that danielle antalffy svb leerink analyst got it thank you nick colangelo president and chief executive officer thanks danielle operator your next question is from chris cooley of stephens your line is open chris cooley stephens inc analyst good morning and thanks for taking the questions just two for me maybe first when we talk about expanding the number of surgeons taking biopsies for maci i think the target you gave during the prepared comments was approximately 10 could you help us with maybe just how the sales force is incentivized in that regard is it going deeper within existing practices where i would assume those surgeons would ramp faster if their peers were already utilizing maci and they were familiar with it to some degree or are they more incentivized at this time to broaden the reach and then if i could just go ahead and ask my second question now and then i ll be quiet and get in queue but maybe just help us think joe a little bit about the sequential gaining on the spend obviously you re driving much greater leverage there better cash flow really impressive but just help us think about what the timing of the spend getting ready for the submission for nexobrid the timing of the expansion just help us think a little bit there about how we should think about that opex as it plays through the year if there s anything different this year versus maybe the last two so called normal covid years thanks so much nick colangelo president and chief executive officer thanks for your questions chris it s nick i ll take the first one regarding kind of the sales force incentives and how you build a successful business and then turn it over to joe so as i think we ve talked about before at the end of the day our sales reps are paid in addition to sort of cash and salary and equity on a commission basis for the implants that are done right that s when we recognize revenue and that s when their how their incentive comp works but just as we talk to investors and analysts about the growth drivers for the company at the high level that s exactly what the reps are focused on at the territory level and it s very clear throughout the organization to be successful as a sales rep you need to be doing everything we talk about which is expanding the number of surgeons taking biopsies penetrating deeper in their practices which is represented by the biopsies per surgeon and then getting those cases activated and converted so that is the focus throughout the organization and particularly with the regional directors and their sales reps joe mara chief financial officer yes chris thanks on the second question i would say if you look back in the last couple of years kind of from an opex perspective if you look at 2021 i mean there were some ebbs and flows during the year but i wouldn t expect anything hugely variable from a quarter to quarter perspective there s certainly some things we re looking to get ahead of in terms of some of the investments the life cycle side that started there s certainly some spend in there as we think about nexobrid which will kind of balance throughout the year and then obviously have some second half components so i wouldn t think of it as kind of hugely material differences from a quarter to quarter perspective although it may ebb and flow if you take that full year number and kind of work back to the quarters chris cooley stephens inc analyst thank you operator your next question is from jeffrey cohen of ladenburg thalmann your line is open jeffrey cohen ladenburg thalmann analyst just a couple of questions from our end so looking at the epicel guidance for 22 could you walk us through some of the trends you ve seen thus far in the first couple of months and it seems a little cautious on the aggregate numbers there particularly given the fact that you re discussing higher asps on an average case anything to read in there anything we should think about i know it s been a strong five quarters in succession now nick colangelo president and chief executive officer yes thanks jeff so when you look back at epicel s growth in 2021 it was obviously a phenomenal year particularly for a product that as we often say has been on the market for close to 30 years now so 50 growth a big piece of that as i mentioned in my prepared remarks was that we have seen consistently now over the past five or six quarters sort of an uptick or an increase in the average number of epicel grafts used per patient and we talked about this last fall as well that as we adjusted our tam upwards that the average grafts per patient had increased from about 90 to 120 grafts on average and so that if you look at that growth for last year you can say two thirds of it or thereabouts was due to sort of that increase in the grafts per patient and that s what that did was sort of move the market up to where the premier burn centers kind of the level of utilization per patient that they were using so we may get some small incremental growth in that over time right especially when you re treating these sort of large total body surface area burns but really where the growth is going to come from is adding more burn centers that are treating patients with epicel and increasing the biopsies or the patients that are being treated and we saw both of those sort of increase last year as i mentioned as well but i think it s a more realistic forward looking perspective to say we ll kind of baseline it at low double digit growth and then obviously we re focused on exceeding that joe mara chief financial officer yes and maybe just to add as well i think a couple of points so again on those kind of average grafts per patient the patient utilization obviously that was a huge growth driver last year if you look back that actually has been pretty consistently high over several quarters so even as we compare to last year kind of the first quarter etc that s really for the most part in the run rate a couple of other things just to highlight so if you look at the last several quarters that run rate has actually been right around 9 5 million if you look across the last five quarters if you take a bigger picture view we think we can grow the overall kind of business and again it s really thinking about adding burn centers and driving up volume into that double digit range but if you look at last year there s kind of that one outlier of 12 million plus so we think on a full year basis again we can get into that double digit growth range and that s a realistic number for us but what we re kind of seeing and where we are in q1 right now we re kind of more in that run rate similar run rate at least at this point so i still think given the nature of the product there s going to be ebbs and flows even as we try to drive growth although as you look back in the last few quarters it s been more stable i still think it will ebb and flow but overall we re still looking for that double digit growth chris cooley stephens inc analyst perfect and then could you talk about you said year over year quarterly sequential increase for 22 i m just wanting to clarify that you don t mean the cadence of q1 through q4 sequential but you mean the year over year joe mara chief financial officer yes so i think when we talked and we re talking about maci specifically there i mean what we re saying is if you kind of think about the maci progression throughout the year what we said in the first quarter is if you take our full year guidance for maci we ll be around that 18 which is a pretty typical percent of the business or of the overall revenue for the year as you think about seasonality i think given kind of the trends we re seeing we ll probably lean a little bit more kind of back loaded when you think about the percentage of business h2 versus h1 or at least look more like some of the years that were more slanted toward h2 so if you play that out and assume similar seasonality what you ll see there on a year over year basis when you look at kind of maci quarterly is sequential sorry year over year each quarter we ll have increasing year over year growth rates so just to clarify we meant year over year relative to 21 chris cooley stephens inc analyst got it and then lastly for us just to recap i know there s been a couple of questions on some of the conversion rates in biopsies so anything any read into this quarter thus far for 2022 thus far as far as any biopsy trends specifically i mean excluding any conversion rate commentary but biopsy trends for this year versus say 20 or 19 as far as beginning of year is it similar nick colangelo president and chief executive officer yes obviously we re kind of early in the year and as we ve mentioned you have omicron carryover etc i would just say that we certainly expect biopsies to grow for the year and that hasn t changed and so again when you have this dynamic of increasing the biopsy surgeons at a double digit rate which joe mentioned and then continued penetration into those practices which means higher biopsies per surgeon sort of by definition you re going to have biopsy growth right so that is certainly something that we expect for this year as well chris cooley stephens inc analyst perfect thanks for taking the questions operator your next question is from samuel brodovsky of truist your line is open samuel brodovsky truist securities analyst hi thanks for taking the question and i ll just start off with the high level just kind of i ll ask both of them upfront but just two kind of high level thoughts on maci going forward starting off with the sales force and as the expanded group matures and we hopefully are moving into a more normalized market going forward any kind of updated thoughts on how we think about peak or target productivity for reps on an annual basis and then sort of as we think about biopsy growth in 22 can you give us any granularity into where we should be expecting biopsy growth to come from whether it be sort of the difference between the pre covid doc group the docs added last year and the new docs nick colangelo president and chief executive officer well i ll start with sort of the first question or the second question around biopsy growth we kind of believe given the size of the addressable market that biopsy growth is really coming from sort of all segments in terms of the initial the existing users new surgeons coming in i mean we ve commented previously about the fact that we kind of see it across the board that when new surgeons join that they end up the that they end up kind of moving up over the course of a year or two to sort of the average level so we see growth with existing users we see new surgeons kind of getting to that level and so we don t expect that there will be anything other than what we ve seen in the past which is sort of across the board growth among our surgeon customers joe mara chief financial officer yes and just to add on the productivity metrics so certainly i think we talked about in the past we re certainly looking to get back up to call that sort of that 2 ish range for rep the two million range if you look at last year 21 versus 22 there s an improvement we re not quite there based on kind of where our full year guidance is but we certainly think we re kind of trending back in that direction and we can kind of get back to that number that we ve been talking about samuel brodovsky truist securities analyst thank you operator your next question is from rk swayampakula of h c wainwright your line is open swayampakula ramakanth h c wainwright analyst thank you good morning nick and joe quite a bit of my questions have been answered but i m just trying to understand certain comments that you made obviously by your announcement of getting into a new manufacturing facility you re kind of telegraphing the expectation for total growth of both maci and epicel so in terms of long term what sort of growth are we thinking about both for both products and also as you said the sales force expansion obviously has allowed you to penetrate better into the surgeon groups is there what sort of expectations do you have on your sales force in terms of how much even though it has been a tough two years do you think the sales force is working at the optimal level at this point or do you still need to add more sales force as you said by the end of this year thank you nick colangelo president and chief executive officer thanks rk i ll start joe you can add additional comments so first of all with respect to the new facility as we mentioned that is intended to support the long term growth for both maci and epicel we haven t really gone beyond sort of mid decade but as we talked about in our earlier preannouncement this year we certainly expect to be in the 20 plus percent compounded annual growth rate as a product portfolio through mid decade and then given the fact that these are large underpenetrated markets we think there s growth ahead for multiple years especially when you sort of layer on hopefully an increased commercial presence on the burn side with the nexobrid launch and then life cycle management for maci so we re really confident and bullish on the prospects through the end of the decade and beyond when you think about the sales force as we were mentioning earlier for the reasons we mentioned and just to repeat myself we have obviously procedural data for the market that makes up our addressable market and while that declined overall by double digits since 2019 maci revenues are up 20 versus 2019 so we are clearly we were outgrowing the market by a wide margin before covid we ve outgrown it through covid and we certainly expect to outgrow it when we re through covid so we feel really good about that that s driven in part obviously by the sales force they continue to execute well and we don t expect that to change and just on the productivity question that sam mentioned and joe touched upon i mean we kind of before the expansion we re up to about two million per rep that took a step back through covid and through the expansion but we certainly expect to be back to those ranges and beyond as we continue to grow the brand swayampakula ramakanth h c wainwright analyst in terms of the pipeline growth especially with the arthroscopic delivery of maci and also the ankle you said you re expecting to initiate some conversations with the fda could you give us a little bit more color on those timelines so that we understand how to think through some of the r d expenses going forward nick colangelo president and chief executive officer yes well i ll start with kind of timeline thoughts and then joe you can kind of layer in the expenses but not to pre empt them but we ve said pretty routinely that for these life cycle management initiatives for sales force expansions i mean that s just those are expenditures that we can sort of absorb in our operating margins and so on that we ve shared with analysts and investors previously so but for timelines around arthroscopic maci what we said is we plan to meet with the fda later this year we got a lot on our plate right now right getting the nexobrid submission in by mid year but also we want to meet with the fda shortly thereafter so that work is ongoing to discuss what the development plan would look like going forward and it s a little hard to give a lot of detail around sort of precise expenditures until you sort of understand and agree with the fda on what the program is going to look like and the same of course is for maci but we have placeholders in sort of our long range plans that cover that so as we said earlier we expect that an arthroscopic delivery for maci is more of a 2025 plus kind of endeavor and the ankle indication would be more of a toward the end of the decade just because it would involve a more robust clinical study to be able to get that indication under our current thinking so joe i ll joe mara chief financial officer yes i mean not a whole lot more to add i mean i d say these are certainly kind of areas we think it makes sense from an investment perspective and a business case perspective over kind of the mid to long term as you think about life cycle management in terms of kind of the p l and the operating expense impact i mean there certainly will be an impact over that time frame but as nick said it s kind of built into the numbers we think we can kind of manage that within our kind of operating cash flow and existing p l structure it will add some costs but it s not hugely meaningful over the next few years and not so much on an annual basis swayampakula ramakanth h c wainwright analyst thank you very much operator presenters i m showing no further questions at this time i would like to turn the conference back to nick colangelo for closing remarks nick colangelo president and chief executive officer ok well great and thank you all for your questions and your continued interest in vericel overall the company continued to execute very well across all areas of the business in 2021 and we expect another year of significant top line revenue growth margin expansion and operating cash flow driven by both our franchises in 2022 and given the significant market opportunities for our products our strong financial profile we believe the company is well positioned for sustained long term growth in the years ahead so we re excited about the business as we move forward and again i want to thank you for your questions and interest in the company have a

kyiv ukraine ap russia launched a full scale invasion of ukraine on thursday unleashing airstrikes on cities and military bases and sending troops and tanks from multiple directions in a move that could rewrite the world s geopolitical landscape ukraine s government pleaded for help as civilians piled into trains and cars to flee president vladimir putin ignored global condemnation and cascading new sanctions as he unleashed the largest ground war in europe in decades and chillingly referred to his country s nuclear arsenal he threatened any country trying to interfere with consequences you have never seen ukrainian officials said their forces were battling russians on a multiple fronts and had lost control of the decommissioned chernobyl nuclear power plant scene of the world s worst nuclear disaster advertisement russia has embarked on a path of evil but ukraine is defending itself and won t give up its freedom ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy tweeted in washington u s president joe biden announced new sanctions against russia saying putin chose this war and that his country would bear the consequences of his action the sanctions will target russian banks oligarchs state controlled companies and high tech sectors he said adding they were designed not to disrupt global energy markets russian oil and natural gas exports are vital energy sources for europe zelenskyy urged the u s and west to go further and cut the russians from the swift system a key financial network that connects thousands of banks around the world the white house has been reluctant to immediately cut russia from swift worried it could cause enormous economic problems in europe and elsewhere in the west zelenskyy who earlier cut diplomatic ties with moscow and declared martial law described russian forces advancing on a series fronts including a difficult situation developing in kharkiv ukraine s second largest city just over 20 kilometers away from the eastern border with russia and russian troops slowly advancing from the north on the city of chernihiv he said a russian airborne unit at an airport just outside kyiv the capital was being destroyed he appealed to global leaders saying that if you don t help us now if you fail to offer a powerful assistance to ukraine tomorrow the war will knock on your door both sides claimed to have destroyed some of the other s aircraft and military hardware though little of that could be confirmed russian forces seized control of the now unused chernobyl plant and its surrounding exclusion zone after a fierce battle zelenskyy adviser myhailo podolyak told the associated press the vienna based international atomic energy agency said it was told by ukraine of the takeover adding that there had been no casualties or destruction at the industrial site iaea director general rafael mariano grossi called for maximum restraint to avoid actions that could put ukraine s nuclear facilities at risk earlier a ukrainian official told ap that russian shelling hit a radioactive waste repository with a reported increase in radiation levels the official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter the 1986 disaster occurred when a nuclear reactor at the plant 130 kilometers 80 miles north of kyiv exploded sending a radioactive cloud across europe the damaged reactor was later covered by a protective shell to prevent leaks the chief of the nato alliance said the brutal act of war shattered peace in europe joining a chorus of world leaders who decried the attack which could cause massive casualties topple ukraine s democratically elected government and upend the post cold war security order the conflict was already shaking global financial markets stocks plunged and oil prices soared amid concerns that heating bills and food prices would skyrocket condemnation rained down not only from the u s and europe but from south korea australia and beyond and many governments readied new sanctions even friendly leaders like hungary s viktor orban sought to distance themselves from putin british prime minister boris johnson said he aimed to cut off russia from the u k s financial markets as he announced sanctions freezing the assets of all large russian banks and planning to bar russian companies and the kremlin from raising money on british markets now we see him for what he is a bloodstained aggressor who believes in imperial conquest johnson said of putin a senior u s official said the u n security council was expected to vote friday on a resolution condemning russia s attack and demanding an immediate withdrawal the vote will proceed even though the legally binding measure will almost certainly be vetoed by russia said the official who wasn t authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity while some nervous europeans speculated about a possible new world war the u s and its nato partners have shown no indication they would send troops into ukraine fearing a larger war they instead mobilized troops and equipment around its western flank as ukraine pleaded for defense assistance and help protecting its airspace nato reinforced its members in eastern europe as a precaution and biden said the u s was deploying additional forces to germany to bolster nato the first attacks came from the air ukrainian authorities later described ground invasions in multiple regions and border guards released video of a line of russian military vehicles crossing into ukraine s government held territory european authorities declared the country s airspace an active conflict zone it wasn t until late thursday afternoon that russia confirmed its ground forces had moved into ukraine saying they d crossed over from crimea the southern region that russia annexed in 2014 after weeks of denying plans to invade putin launched the operation on a country the size of texas that has increasingly tilted toward the democratic west and away from moscow s sway the autocratic leader made clear earlier this week that he sees no reason for ukraine to exist raising fears of possible broader conflict in the vast space that the soviet union once ruled putin denied plans to occupy ukraine but his ultimate goals remain hazy ukrainians who had long braced for the prospect of an assault were urged to shelter in place and not to panic until the very last moment i didn t believe it would happen i just pushed away these thoughts said a terrified anna dovnya in kyiv watching soldiers and police remove shrapnel from an exploded shell we have lost all faith with social media amplifying a torrent of military claims and counter claims it was difficult to determine exactly what was happening on the ground ap reporters saw or confirmed explosions in the capital in mariupol on the azov sea kharkiv in the east and beyond ap confirmed video showing russian military vehicles crossing into ukrainian held territory in the north from belarus and from russian annexed crimea in the south russia and ukraine made competing claims about damage they had inflicted russia s defense ministry said it had destroyed scores of ukrainian air bases military facilities and drones and confirmed the loss of a su 25 attack jet blaming pilot error it said it was not targeting cities but using precision weapons and claimed that there is no threat to civilian population ukraine s armed forces reported at least 40 soldiers dead and said a military plane carrying 14 people crashed south of kyiv poland s military increased its readiness level and lithuania and moldova moved toward doing the same border crossings from ukraine to poland rose putin justified his actions in an overnight televised address asserting the attack was needed to protect civilians in eastern ukraine a false claim the u s predicted he would make as a pretext for invasion he accused the u s and its allies of ignoring russia s demands to prevent ukraine from joining nato and for security guarantees saying the military action was a forced measure anticipating international condemnation and countermeasures putin issued a stark warning to other countries not to meddle in a reminder of russia s nuclear power he warned that no one should have any doubts that a direct attack on our country will lead to the destruction and horrible consequences for any potential aggressor inside russia authorities moved swiftly to crack down on any critical voices ovd info a group that tracks political arrests reported 1 620 people in 52 russian cities had been detained for protesting the invasion more than half of them in moscow among putin s pledges was to denazify ukraine world war ii looms large in russia after the soviet union suffered more deaths than any country while fighting adolf hitler s forces the kremlin has portrayed members of ukrainian right wing groups as neo nazis exploiting their admiration for wwii era ukrainian nationalist leaders who sided with the nazis ukraine is now led by a jewish president who lost relatives in the holocaust and angrily dismissed those claims hours before the invasion zelenskyy rejected moscow s claims that ukraine poses a threat to russia and made a passionate plea for peace

dave mckay president and chief executive officer thank you and good morning everyone thanks again for joining us today we reported earnings of 4 1 billion our second highest on record underscoring the strength and scale of our franchises net income was up 6 from last year and we generated positive all bank operating leverage while continuing to invest for growth pre provision pre tax earnings were up 10 year over year benefiting from robust client driven volume growth in canadian banking and city national strong wealth management results and record investment banking revenue these were partially offset by continued moderation in our trading revenue and the impact of lower spreads our 17 3 return on equity combined with a strong capital ratio enabled us to deploy capital in a balanced manner to support client driven growth and long term shareholder value our capital position supported 1 7 billion in dividends to our largely canadian shareholder base as well as almost 9 million of share repurchases in aggregate we returned nearly 3 billion to our shareholders for a total payout ratio of 72 we also deployed our balance sheet across our businesses to support our clients needs and ambitions resulting in organic rwa growth of 14 billion in the current quarter we ended this quarter with a robust cet1 ratio of 13 5 representing 13 billion in excess capital over an 11 level this provides significant flexibility to continue investing in talent and technology to accelerate the deployment of capital for organic growth opportunities and i will speak more to this strategy in a moment our strong capital position also enables further share repurchases as well as providing us optionality to acquire quality franchises in growth segments that align with our current strategy and geographic footprint looking forward we have a consistent and clear focus on creating client and shareholder value and a disciplined balanced approach to capital deployment as evidenced by our 15 year over year growth in book value per share this quarter and a 9 compounded annual growth rate over the last three years before i speak to our growth opportunities i want to touch on the macro environment we continue to experience market and economic volatility driven by heightened geopolitical risk continued supply chain disruption acute labor capacity shortages energy market imbalances and resulting high inflationary conditions however the underlying economic drivers are still strong as we move past the omicron peak we can look to record household savings over 200 billion in canada alone driving consumer spending on goods and services renewed immigration driving demand for housing increased business investment into just in case inventory strategies and building new digital capabilities recent hawkish central bank commentary around the concerning level of inflation and north american economy is reaching full potential suggests imminent rate increases and an acceleration of quantitative tightening programs while the prospect of benchmark rate increases has driven volatility in equity markets we are well positioned to benefit from rising interest rates which nadine will speak to later however we have also seen the yield curve flatten significantly over the last three months this combined with tight labor markets and economies reaching full potential suggest we are closer to mid cycle economic growth than early stages of an economic recovery as it relates to canadian housing we continue to monitor supply demand imbalances across the country we have long argued the supply side of the market must be made more responsive to demand we encourage policymakers at all levels of government across all jurisdictions to continue working together to implement policies that address the longer term problems of limited supply which are driving house price inflation and creating a risk to the long term competitiveness of the canadian economy i ll now expand on an increasing number of client focused opportunities to drive accretive organic growth across our core businesses our leading scale enables us to invest concurrently in technology sales capacity and client value positioning us to deploy capital to drive revenue growth while increasing productivity which nadine will speak to later and we will continue to leverage the significant investments we have made across our businesses over the last number of years in canadian banking mortgages were up 11 year over year adding nearly 9 billion this quarter alone we expect strong canadian mortgage growth to continue in the high single digit range driven by renewed levels of immigration pent up demand met by increased supply and our continued investment in expanding our mortgage sales force to capture this opportunity on the payment side overall consumer spending in late january and early february was up 15 over pre pandemic levels as restrictions continue to ease across canada we expect the continued reopening of the canadian economy to drive increased credit card spend and in time a steeper recovery in revolving credit card balances our investments to enhance digital capabilities in these businesses resulted in over 55 of all new credit cards being sold digitally this quarter and our mortgage retention rates are exceptionally strong at 90 we have also invested in a set of integrated banking and investment solutions to provide even more value to our clients including last year s launch of rbc vantage in addition investments made to enhance our client value proposition continue to attract new clients we are seeing increased engagement with our digital payment and investment products including myadvisor which now has nearly 3 million clients up from 2 million in just one year in the last two years alone we have gained over 80 basis points of market share in core checking deposits and nearly 50 basis points of market share in mortgages and the gross number of retail clients added in the last four years have contributed nearly 1 billion of revenue to our canadian banking franchise we also expect stronger growth in commercial lending from higher credit line utilizations driven by our clients desire to rebuild inventory levels and adjust business models in light of the persistent supply chain disruptions and labor shortages we are expanding our commercial account management teams and reimagining our products and services to capture this changing client value chain including growing owner an rbc venture and rbcx our platform to help entrepreneurs scale up tech and life science and verticals turning to city national average loans excluding ppp loans grew 15 from last year with retail loans up 25 loan balances have increased to 56 billion nearly 2 5 times the levels from when we acquired this high quality growth franchise in fiscal 2016 we are in the process of further investing in city national s technology and operational infrastructure for the next phase of growth including deploying improved commercial lending and mobile banking platforms looking forward we expect city national to continue to generate strong accretive growth through our multipronged strategy this includes expanding private banking capabilities through mortgage like growth and growing our mid market commercial division these strategies alone have added 6 billion in loans over the past two years furthermore city national s leading entertainment franchise supported by our filmtrack acquisition is well positioned to benefit from the industry trend of increasing investment in original content and programming turning to our broader wealth and asset management franchises across north america we re continuing to drive growth in these high roe businesses building on our current momentum canadian and u s wealth management aua increased 18 and 14 year over year respectively and rbc global asset management aum increased 9 from last year to nearly 600 billion with over 80 of aum outperforming the benchmark on a three year basis looking forward we will continue to expand our existing team of over 2 000 advisors in canadian wealth management our differentiated technology advantage and investment expertise helped drive strong advisor productivity generating revenue per advisor that is over 20 above the canadian industry average in the u s wealth management we remain focused on organically scaling our platform by adding experienced advisors and leveraging our investment in new products and technology investments we made in new securities lending products resulted in strong lending growth of nearly 3 billion over the past year this new portfolio generated nearly 80 million of revenue in 2021 alone since the start of fiscal 2019 we have hired financial advisors who are expected to bring in over 60 billion of aua these advisors are attracted to our client first culture coupled with our leading integrated technology platform our growing investments in people and technology has resulted in considerable momentum in our capital markets franchise as demonstrated by a record corporate investment banking revenue of 1 4 billion this quarter we have strengthened our talent in key verticals including adding managing directors in u s investment banking especially in the technology and healthcare sectors as well as our m a group these investments have propelled rbc capital markets to ninth in the global league tables and positioned us to win increasingly attractive mandates going forward in some of the most active sectors we are also helping our clients execute on their own sustainability strategies we ve provided 84 billion in sustainable finance in 2021 up from 73 billion in 2020 building toward our target of 500 billion by 2025 and aiden our ai based electronic trading platform has continued to gain traction supporting our global markets clients during these volatile times we believe these investments have structurally enhanced the earnings power of capital markets franchise and we expect to continue to drive pre provision pre tax earnings above 1 billion per quarter through 2022 our investment banking pipeline remains healthy given the near term economic outlook and an increased desire from clients to accelerate their own growth strategies in this context we will look to continue to deploy capital into capital markets including support for our underwriting commitments as our global clients continue to rely on us as an innovative and trusted partner to sum up we have started 2022 with continued strong momentum across our largest franchise our results reflect significant investments in our people technology and products and services to deliver differentiated value for existing clients and to continue attracting new client relationships we have a clear focus on driving long term shareholder value and we ll continue to deploy capital in a balanced manner nadine over to you nadine ahn chief financial officer thanks dave and good morning everyone i will start on slide 7 we reported earnings per share of 2 84 this quarter up 7 from last year revenue growth was driven by strong investment management fees and mutual fund revenue as well as strong m a advisory fees pre provision pre tax earnings increased 10 year over year also benefiting from positive all bank operating leverage our effective tax rate increased 270 basis points from last year mainly due to the net impact of tax adjustments and changes in earnings mix going forward we expect our effective tax rate to normalize back toward 22 to 23 through the rest of the fiscal year before i discuss our segment results i will spend some time on three key topics capital deployment rate sensitivity and our expense outlook starting with capital on slide 8 our cet1 ratio was down 20 basis points sequentially to 13 5 our earnings added 74 basis points of capital this quarter well in excess of 29 basis points of capital used to generate client driven rwa growth net credit migration lowered rwa by 2 billion balance capital deployment included 54 basis points of capital return to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases moving on to slide 9 net interest income was up 5 year over year as strong client driven volume growth in canadian banking and city national continued to offset the impact of lower net interest margins now to slide 10 while the impact of low interest rates continue to persist we started to see a stabilization of net interest margins in our banking franchises on both sides of the border canadian banking nim was down 1 basis point sequentially as the competitive nature of the mortgage market drove asset spreads lower we continue to see lower benefits from mortgage prepayment revenue a trend we expect to moderate going forward these factors were partially offset by an accounting adjustment that impacted nim last quarter city national s nim was up 6 basis points relative to last quarter with paycheck protection program loans contributing most of the increase we expect our ppp loan portfolio to largely run off by year end to provide context on our sensitivity to rising interest rates it s important to remember that the cumulative impact of lower interest rates across 2020 and 2021 reduced our revenue by approximately 2 billion this was partly driven by lower canadian banking deposit spreads and lower asset yields impacting city national going forward we are well positioned to benefit from the likely scenario of rising interest rates we estimate that a 25 basis point increase in short term interest rates could result in over 175 million of additional revenue over 12 months in our canadian banking and u s wealth management businesses we expect this benefit to be compounded by higher volumes and a shift in mix toward higher yielding assets over time at the same time we expect the benefit from rate hikes to be impacted by the competitive asset pricing environment as economies recover as interest rates increase we expect deposit repricing in our low beta retail banking deposit franchises will slowly increase toward historical levels over time reflecting trends we experienced in the previous rate hike cycle an environment of higher interest rates and a normalization of surplus liquidity in wholesale markets would be beneficial to our 300 billion repo business where spreads have declined significantly from 2020 levels turning to expenses on slide 11 noninterest expenses were up 1 year over year or 3 excluding the impact of variable and stock based compensation adjusting for the partial release of the legal provision in u s wealth management and excluding variable and share based compensation across our businesses expense growth was 5 year over year salaries and benefits were up 4 as we continued to invest in sales capacity and back end operations to support increasing client activity in our many growth verticals we also saw an increase in marketing and travel costs compared to levels in the first half of 2021 the top of slide 12 gives you an idea of how we think about expenses we have group total costs across a continuum of key categories including the foundational governance cost to run the bank these would include regulatory and risk management costs a large part of our run the bank spend is also related to operational and technology costs including our core systems we continue to act on opportunities to drive efficiencies and productivity in these areas while investing and innovating for the future we expect our scale and growing revenue to generate inherent operating leverage over this cost base which is relatively less variable in nature our new digital account opening experience for retail clients has reduced the average time to completion by nearly 70 this has freed up capacity for our advisors to focus on delivering value added advice and deepening client relationships our app dev teams are utilizing our next generation development platform which is generating efficiency through automation and reuse there s another bucket of costs which are investments to add new revenue generating products and capabilities which dave spoke to earlier and lastly there are investments to drive growth they have a flexible cost structure which represent approximately 30 of our cost base these are costs that largely scale up or down with revenue generated including our commission sales force and client facing employees in our capital markets and wealth management platform where we pay for performance there are also variable noncompensation costs such as trade execution where we will look to drive productivity improvements now to the bottom of the slide for our expense expectations excluding variable and share based compensation we expect structural costs to be higher this year partly due to the impact of inflation along with the realization of previously committed costs which is higher salaries we will continue to invest in technology add to our client facing sales force across our largest segments and scale our marketing spend to drive forward our strategic priorities and we will continue to invest in efficiency initiatives that streamline and simplify our operations and processes in aggregate we expect annual expenses excluding variable and share based compensation to grow at the higher end of the low single digit range in 2022 this includes the recognition and subsequent partial release of the legal provision in u s wealth management and as we recognize the benefits of the forward curve we expect our full year canadian banking efficiency ratio to fall under 40 in 2023 moving to our business segment performance beginning on slide 13 personal commercial banking reported earnings of 2 billion this quarter up 10 from last year canadian banking net interest income was up 3 year over year as strong volume growth was partially offset by lower spreads growth in business volumes was strong on both sides of the balance sheet while credit card balances increased this was largely due to higher transactor balances as revolve rates remain near pandemic lows higher credit card spend also contributed to higher noninterest income as did higher mutual fund distribution fees canadian banking generated operating leverage of 2 8 with expenses up 3 year over year turning to slide 14 wealth management reported earnings of 795 million up 24 from last year the segment generated positive operating leverage even after adjusting for the partial release of last quarter s legal provision canadian wealth management u s wealth management and rbc global asset management revenue growth benefited from higher fee based client assets reflecting favorable equity markets and net sales rbc gam generated positive net sales of over 5 billion this quarter however canadian retail sales were lower than the prior year partly due to redemptions out of fixed income funds especially in december which saw heightened market volatility u s wealth management revenue also benefited from continued double digit volume growth at city national partially offset by lower spreads turning to insurance on slide 15 net income of 197 million decreased 2 from record first quarter results a year ago lower earnings were largely due to claims experience and the impact of lower new longevity reinsurance contracts these factors were partially offset by business growth and higher favorable investment related experience on to slide 16 i ts net income of 118 million decreased 4 from a year ago mainly reflecting higher technology related costs the current quarter also saw higher revenue from funding and liquidity client deposits and asset services businesses turning to slide 17 capital markets reported earnings of over 1 billion down 3 from last year including the impact of a higher effective tax rate pre provision pre tax earnings surpassed 1 billion again this quarter helping drive our strong book value growth corporate and investment banking reported record revenues of 1 4 billion underpinned by record loan syndication and m a fees higher equity origination fees record lending revenue and higher debt origination fees also contributed to stronger revenue in contrast global markets revenue continued to moderate from elevated levels last year as narrower spreads impacted both ficc and repo revenue which were down 12 and 5 respectively equities revenues were robust but down 2 from strong results last year to conclude we are well positioned to continue growing client driven volumes and benefit from higher interest rates looking forward we remain focused on disciplined cost management and balancing our capital deployment to continue delivering value for our shareholders and clients with that i ll turn it over to graeme graeme hepworth chief risk officer thank you nadine and good morning everyone starting on slide 19 allowance for credit losses on loans of 4 4 billion remained largely unchanged from last quarter as write offs and release of reserves on performing loans were nearly offset by higher provisions on impaired loans this marks our fifth consecutive quarter with reserve releases on performing loans reflecting continued improvement in our macroeconomic outlook and in the credit quality of our portfolio over the magnitude of the releases this quarter were tempered by the economic uncertainty related to the headwinds i noted last quarter namely the omicron wave of the covid 19 pandemic inflationary pressure and the pace and scale of anticipated interest rate increases as dave noted earlier while the impact of the omicron wave has now largely subsided impacts of inflation and rising rates are expected to persist reserve releases of 80 million this quarter bring our total release to 1 4 billion since the start of 2021 when combined with considerable portfolio growth of 17 over the last two years our acl ratio is now approaching pre pandemic levels of 58 basis points turning to slide 20 our gross impaired loans of 2 1 billion were down 167 million or 3 basis points during the quarter impaired loan balances once again decreased across all our major businesses new formations of 263 million were at their lowest level in almost 10 years reflecting the significant liquidity accumulated over the pandemic the ongoing economic recovery and the continued benefits to clients from government support programs turning to slide 21 pcl on impaired loans of 180 million or 9 basis points was up 2 basis points quarter over quarter but remains well below pre pandemic levels and below our long term averages in our canadian banking retail portfolio pcl on impaired loans was up 13 million quarter over quarter with modest increases across most products we also saw delinquencies begin to rise during the quarter these increases can be attributed to a few factors including seasonality the winding down of certain government support programs and the client behavior beginning to revert to more historic norms overall delinquency levels remain below pre pandemic levels our canadian banking commercial portfolio pcl on impaired loans was up 27 million quarter over quarter which is largely driven by provisions on two larger accounts despite the increase this quarter we continue to see positive credit migration and a reduction in watch list exposure in this portfolio in capital markets we had a 12 million net recovery on impaired loans in the quarter which is the fourth consecutive quarter with net recoveries in capital markets as this portfolio continues to benefit from a constructive operating environment and strong market liquidity finally in wealth management pcl on impaired loans decreased 11 million quarter over quarter largely due to the reversal of a provision taken in the information technology sector last quarter at city national i ll now turn briefly to market risk on slide 22 during the quarter we saw market volatility increase as central bank started to reverse course on monetary policy the omicron wave of the pandemic at its peak geopolitical tensions rose in ukraine and russia and inflationary pressure came to the forefront notwithstanding the increased market volatility there were no days with net trading losses in the quarter as we effectively manage our market risk profile looking ahead while the impact of the omicron wave has largely subsided market volatility is likely to persist driven by ongoing uncertainty around monetary policy geopolitical tensions and inflationary pressure we continue to take a prudent approach to market and counterparty credit risk supported by a consistent risk appetite and a strong control environment to conclude we continue to be pleased with the ongoing performance of our portfolios and the resiliency of our operations through the pandemic as we noted last quarter the increase in pcl this quarter was anticipated as losses start to return to pre pandemic levels we still expect our pcl ratio on impaired loans to trend back toward historic norms for the course of 2022 and into 2023 as always the quality of our client base and our prudent risk management approach positions us well to manage through any uncertainty importantly we remain steadfast in our commitment to supporting our clients and delivering advice products and insight to help them navigate the evolving macroeconomic and operating environment so with that operator let s open the lines for q a questions answers operator thank you and the first question is from john aiken from barclays please go ahead john aiken barclays capital analyst good morning nadine thank you for the discussion and the outlook on expenses on slide 12 a quick question for you when we look at the more variable expenses the sales advice for revenue generation is there and i know that encompasses a whole host of different factors but within that bucket is there the possibility to generate positive operating leverage within those expenses or is this more of a function of 1 1 in terms of expenses versus revenues nadine ahn chief financial officer thanks john that is the objective when we look at when we particularly our sales force i mentioned some comments around how we increase their productivity and efficiency in terms of the tools that we ve deployed to them in the way that they work the other component of that i would say is part of that is also the support groups that also travel with the frontline staff and so there also we re looking to drive optimization through a number of programs such that we re for every dollar of cost we generate that much more dollar of revenue john aiken barclays capital analyst that s great and as a follow on david mentioned that you continue to grow the residential mortgage sales force what frictional costs are associated with potential downsizing so if and when we see a slowdown in the housing marketplace what how much of a lag would that be on the efficiency ratio because of the buildup of the sales force nadine ahn chief financial officer i ll turn it over to neil maybe neil mclaughlin group head personal commercial banking yeah thanks for the question i mean i don t think we really are looking at a scenario where we would we haven t really contemplated that to be truthful these are variable commission based sales people so for the most part i think we ll be looking for them to go out and continue to compete for volume and at the margin if we needed to slim down that sales force the friction costs would be negligible i mean it s not something that would really factor into our outlook on john aiken barclays capital analyst understood thank you operator thank you the next question is from ebrahim poonawala from bank of america please go ahead ebrahim poonawala bank of america merrill lynch analyst good morning i guess i just wanted to go back dave to your prepared remarks in terms of everything that you talked about mortgage growth commercial lending consumer spend sounds very bullish clearly a lot of crosscurrents that the market is paying attention to including inflation geopolitical risk just give us a sense of when you look at the outlook you mentioned we are maybe mid cycle not early cycle in terms of the economic cycle where are risks q2 do you see more downside risk as we are moving forward to the growth outlook or do you think the market has caught up with some of these things that might be transitory in the underlying trends around immigration things reopening back are much more stronger would love any insights there dave mckay president and chief executive officer it s an important question because there are a lot of mixed signals out there when we look at the stage of the economic cycle you d say commercial utilization and even monetary policy would be early cycle but capacity left in the economy would be late cycle and the balance of where the consumer is or the economy is solid mid cycle which could mean and we expect there s a good solid couple of years of growth here or more we would hope so so the risk factors are all the ones we see geopolitical risk inflation risk and one of the top risk factors is the lack of labor capacity in the workforce and does the liquidity that s sitting on consumer balance sheets lead to inflation or does it lead to growth those are the types of things we re going to watch and see how they play out net net immigration consumer spending returning to normal goods and services consumption all of those are very positive for kind of a mid cycle growth outlook so i think to your question we have to watch kind of economic capacity here and what the inflationary pressures are to graeme s point is one of the real risks to our economy is it real gdp growth or are we just going to use that 200 billion or 300 billion of liquidity 2 5 trillion by the way in the united states does that just create more inflationary pressure i hope that answers your question ebrahim poonawala bank of america merrill lynch analyst yeah that s helpful and i think just as a follow up i think you mentioned when talking about capital deployment looking to acquire or potentially looking to acquire quality franchises and growth segments unpack that for us in terms of what are things that would be attractive to royal you ve not been very acquisitive you ve talked about asset generation capabilities in the past would love any color especially in a period where we are seeing some asset price dislocation correction in the public markets dave mckay president and chief executive officer we re very focused on the type of growth and quality franchise we re looking for it and as with city national there was no auction around city national it was based on a relationship i built with the goldsmith family and russell goldsmith over a number of years to the point where we saw a future together and we re doing very similar things right now the high quality high growth assets don t come up for auction for obvious reasons so we are obviously looking to expand our network the timing is hard to predict but we always want to be the first call and there are a number of really attractive assets that exist when and how they make their strategic decisions we ll see so i think from that perspective we are continuing to maintain we re looking for commercial and wealth ultra high net worth franchises in the united states and europe and we have active dialogues but it doesn t mean things are going to happen so i think from that perspective it s that continued focus the city national model works look at the organic growth we don t need to make an acquisition to continue to accelerate the growth and outperform so when you get the right franchise you can grow it and run on it for a long period of time and when we made the city national acquisition we said we don t need to make other acquisitions this franchise has enormous organic growth potential so we are looking for similar platforms to build on like that and as i said many times capital does not have a half life it only dissipates if you misspend it so we are being smart about it you ve seen the growth numbers and we are returning some of that capital to you as you saw in our share buybacks ebrahim poonawala bank of america merrill lynch analyst greatly thanks dave operator thank you the next question is from paul holden from cibc please go ahead paul holden cibc analyst thank you good morning so i feel compelled i just have to ask this question because the magnitude of what s happening in europe are there any kind of first order impacts we should be thinking about in terms of the russian sanctions and rbc dave mckay president and chief executive officer and maybe i ll let graeme start and then i ll jump in with my perspective graeme over to you graeme hepworth chief risk officer yeah sure i mean i think the first point i make is that we do not have any direct or meaningful exposure to russia or the ukraine i mean that s the byproduct of the fact that we don t operate in those countries and we don t have a risk appetite that kind of allows us to operate with clients or markets that are high risk like that and so i think what we re focused on is more the indirect impacts that could flow through and certainly high levels of commodity prices those are interesting ones that have kind of multiple effects that we need to think through on one hand canada is a net exporter of natural resources and that s a positive for our economy on the other hand those are things are going to continue to fuel and exacerbate kind of current risk concerns like inflation and so those would be the areas of concern that we would be focused on in this environment but again i think our risk appetite or operating model will serve us well and position us well against these kind of emerging concerns that are happening right now in eastern europe dave mckay president and chief executive officer the only thing i would add is as you look at how markets react the obvious volatility coming from investor uncertainty global uncertainty but the effect on the yield curve you ve seen a little bit of tightening at the long end of the curve there s always a flight to quality when you have such geopolitical volatility you ve seen that today i think with the tightening in the u s curve of about 10 points at the long end of the curve and does it invert temporarily what we ve seen historically as you all see is that geopolitical risks tends to smooth out over time but can be quite volatile in the short term so i still expect the strength of the economy the inflationary pressures that we talked about economic capacity being used that i would still expect some form of rate increase to continue to move forward and monetary policy to continue to tighten these underlying four drivers are very strong paul holden cibc analyst ok that s great that actually leads me perfectly in to my real question which is for nadine and sort of the nim sensitivity or nii sensitivity you provide obviously there s a number of assumptions that go into that and kind of talked about some of the variables in your prepared remarks what i m particularly curious on are there certain factors that may lead to more nii benefit from rate tightening than what you put into your disclosed sensitivities and if there are can you give us a sense of what those factors might be and sort of a general order of magnitude nadine ahn chief financial officer sure so i think what typically we would have referenced in the slides is the impact on our retail franchise both canadian banking and in the u s wealth management business and pointed out as i called in my remarks focusing on what it looks like is the more of the curve flattening so the rising in the short end of the rate as it relates to other businesses you obviously have wealth management canada will benefit as well from the spread margin expansion on their deposit base i would say one of the other big areas that i did call out in my remarks relates to capital markets and the repo business so we have about 300 billion balance and saw margins compressed there in about 10 basis points so that business obviously as rates start to move up in the short end would benefit from that margin expansion as well coupled with the fact that we did see some balances come off with the elevated liquidity levels those are primarily i would say two of the primary drivers from a pure interest rate perspective paul holden cibc analyst that s great that s it from me thank you operator thank you the next question is from meny grauman from scotiabank please go ahead meny grauman scotiabank analyst hi good morning you ve been very clear in terms of your guidance on expenses i think what s interesting to me is there still does seem to be a disconnect a little bit between maybe the commentary that some especially larger u s banks are talking about with respect to their expenses and the way you are presenting the outlook so i m wondering if you could kind of delve into that in terms of structural or fundamental reasons why your expense structure is different than let s say some large banks in the u s so basically trying to get an idea of how is your outlook on expenses more optimistic and that s really the fundamental nature of the question nadine ahn chief financial officer thanks meny i would say there s two primary components related to that first off we ve been investing for a significant portion of time both in our technology or infrastructure as you would have also noticed in our front office sales support staff really that client acquisition arm of it so we have been investing in technology for a long time and scaling across our canadian businesses you ll also notice that despite depreciation that will start in over time so that doesn t necessarily result in an increasing cost base the extent that you ve been spending equally through the years i would say that the other thing that we talked about was around our efficiency and our sustainability of looking at our productivity options that we have to deploy not only technology tools but how we can be more efficient in our in that cost base i referenced to the far end of the chart there which can tend to be a bit more fixed over time so it s twofold there we look at how we can be more efficient where we work how we work digitization of processes automation and in addition how we can become more productive in our sales force staff so how we can expand upon the every cost dollar we put out there and the revenue multiple that we generate off of that so i think part of it meny is really we ve been investing over consistently over a period of time i think others may be catching up to where we ve been having to increase their spend levels but in addition we do focus consistently across the organization on the efficiency and productivity arm of it to be able to continue with that investment growth meny grauman scotiabank analyst that s helpful thank you operator thank you the next question is from doug young from desjardin capital markets please go ahead doug young desjardins capital markets analyst good morning just wanted to go back to the capital discussion i think you ve been clear about where you see the growth opportunities but i guess the crux of my question is i m curious if you can put your substantial excess capital to work organically such that you would be driving down your cet1 ratio and what are those best opportunities and so we saw risk weighted asset growth reduced the ratio by 29 basis points this quarter could we see rwa growth push that ratio down 50 60 70 basis points is really kind of where i m going nadine ahn chief financial officer yeah i mean i think that you ve hit on the primary objective there in terms of our organic growth and we have the significant ability to deploy that capital in high roe businesses and looking at good returns you see it both within capital markets and high roe this quarter continued around able to deploy it in the higher margin underwriting businesses the loan book as well as city national with that double digit growth so we are looking at how we scaled up our businesses particularly with the advancement of our frontline sales force and the ability to deploy that balance sheet so that is definitely an opportunity obviously we saw last year some of the model changes with respect to rwa so that brought it down and we have basel iii coming on the horizon next year which has the opportunity to improve again our rwa position so there s obviously puts and takes on that but we definitely look to continue to deploy it from an organic perspective doug young desjardins capital markets analyst i guess where i m going with this is this because everyone talks about m a and we can all speculate on that and then buybacks at the margin but the real opportunity would be to put 100 basis points of rwa to work or to put it work like organically and i know the credit card balance is coming back commercial card balances but like what i m trying to get at is what are the best opportunities do you foresee and what s the most capital intensive opportunities dave mckay president and chief executive officer i think we are putting a lot of rwa to work the beauty of the model is that we re generating so much capital from profitability and our scale and our efficiency that it drives a self funding model to your point so i think the beauty is we can accelerate growth we are accelerating growth and we re funding a lot of it from profitability so you re seeing us as i said returning capital to shareholders and we still have a significant strategic optionality to put capital to work in an inorganic fashion when the right opportunity comes to the table so we re in a great place you saw a strong strong growth driven by previous investments that we ve made we continue to invest we are generating organic capital we have strategic optionality we are in a very good place to continue to drive premium total shareholder return doug young desjardins capital markets analyst great appreciate the color thanks operator thank you the next question is from sohrab movahedi from bmo capital markets please go ahead sohrab movahedi bmo capital markets analyst i have two questions maybe i ll start with where i think doug left off nadine or dave you ve mentioned capital markets several times i think as a good source of i guess capital deployment is that would that be more so in the traditional banking businesses credit underwriting and the like or could there also be some capital chewed up in market risk dave mckay president and chief executive officer why don t we have derek answer that derek neldner group head capital markets sure thanks sohrab i appreciate the question i think we see opportunities right now across both the banking business and the global markets business as nadine said we are very focused on trying to make sure we re only deploying capital where we see good returns but as you ve seen with the capital markets business over the last couple of years partially due to the environment but partially due to some of the strategic initiatives and changes we ve undertaken we have notably moved up our roe and so that is giving us opportunities right across the platform clearly there are opportunities to deploy capital organically through the loan book and that has the ancillary benefit of also supporting the non lending or ancillary revenue opportunities through investment banking or otherwise there s some modest capital deployment through our loan syndications and underwriting business although we remain very mindful of the risk environment and so we re being quite prudent and disciplined about that and then in different pockets of our markets business as we re looking to grow out different areas of the trading platform in both the u s and europe i think we will see additional opportunities to deploy capital in trading as well so it is quite diversified right now but probably led more by the loan book and the investment banking side sohrab movahedi bmo capital markets analyst and derek just to clarify with no real change even at the margin and risk appetite derek neldner group head capital markets correct sohrab movahedi bmo capital markets analyst thank you and then my second question is for neil i think you talked you ve provided some statistics i think dave did actually around market share gains both in i think checking deposit stuff and mortgages and the revenue pickup is there any way neil you could attribute how much of that is because of the kind of consistent emphasis on the rbc venture s initiatives neil mclaughlin group head personal commercial banking yeah thanks for the question i wouldn t point to ventures as a market share driver there i would point to the drivers maybe just start with mortgages we ve talked for i think quite a long time just about investments we ve made just picking up on nadine s point really thinking about that franchise front to back about finding processes investing in digital investments in our sales force how we flow leads to those mortgage professionals so it s really been i think a consistent steady strategy that s really paying off in the mortgage business a little bit different in the core deposits business whereas last year we really came away and said we hadn t refreshed the value proposition for our core deposits business and we felt we needed to make some investments there that was i think a great example of a technology investment that we re seeing pay off nadine touched on the sort of the tools and the ability to reduce the amount of time it takes to open to one of those checking accounts but we also put some of that technology investment into the core underlying value proposition which really had us double down on our belief in reciprocity and tying it back to a core relationship strategy where when our clients bring more of their business to us we reciprocate with a fee reduction structure back to them and the ability to put our rewards points to use on their debit product so we d say that those types of investments and particularly that shift in the value proposition that you re seeing in the marketplace for advertising would be the driver on the deposits business sohrab movahedi bmo capital markets analyst thank you operator thank you the next question is from gabriel dechaine from national bank financial please go ahead gabriel dechaine national bank financial analyst good morning at what point does inflation become a problem i know we ve talked about it as a headwind but is there a very simple way of thinking through that over the course of five six seven months over a year whatever it is canadian inflation of 5 to 6 and u s inflation in the 7 range does that becomes something that compels you to look at your credit models and start adding to provisions and then from your business outlook standpoint consumption they re paying more for gas people are paying more for gas and other stuff as opposed to tvs and cars like when does that affect your revenue growth outlook thanks graeme hepworth chief risk officer sure thanks gabriel maybe i ll start there certainly on the credit side certainly inflation is a factor by itself but i think we would combine that with kind of a rising rate environment kind of as a set of risks that we certainly are mindful of in our credit books and certainly it s something front and center with us on that i would start we obviously have a backdrop where clients are in a very strong position with very strong liquidity and cash balances as dave noted earlier i think combined the fact that we ve had very strong underwriting a very persistent underwriting standards for a long time that are mindful of an operating environment of higher rates and higher inflation and so i don t think we kind of look at this as a surprise and something that shouldn t be considered but we always talk about being prudent and consistent through the cycle and these are kind of cyclical events that we do and we build into our underwriting standards i think different portfolios will be impacted at different times i think there s probably more latency in credit in terms of inflation s impact and rates impact than maybe we would see in the revenue and expense lines and that s kind of largely really the fact that we build good resiliency into our portfolios many of our portfolio look at our mortgage portfolio we were just talking about there s a long duration in that and so clients both have a lot of capacity there and there s a time frame there before you would see clients turning over and having to refinance into a higher rate higher cost environment so i don t think it s kind of reading back to my original comment that s why i don t think we see our views on our credit forecast there haven t changed largely since q4 but those are headwinds that we are considering and i think will accrue over time into higher credit costs but those will be offset by positives elsewhere on the revenue side as we previously talked about gabriel dechaine national bank financial analyst so there s a point at which you might have to signaling out royal and in effect every bank but is there a point at which you would have to maybe make an adjustment graeme hepworth chief risk officer are you referencing a credit adjustment gabriel dechaine national bank financial analyst well yeah yeah graeme hepworth chief risk officer again i m not sure when you say credit adjustment again we when clients come to the door we are constantly reassessing and assessing their credit quality their capacity we build in capacity for rate rises and cost rises in their in the origination process and again if you look at our portfolios there s a lot of equity built up with clients that give us a lot of capacity to work with them on that so our credit strides as i said are really designed to work through the cycle and that won t change we constantly reflect these factors though into our reserving models so certainly as we talked about we ve had some uncertainty that s coming off with they say things like omicron and government support and these are some new headwinds that are coming into play and so we ll constantly reassess all of those each quarter and reflect that into our reserving models but i wouldn t say right now that that s a headwind that we would indicate and say that that we expect an increase there coming any time soon dave mckay president and chief executive officer to your question i think the only risk you have to watch out for is if inflationary pressures erode cash flow because salaries and benefits aren t keeping up with it and therefore it challenges your sort of visibility ratio so what we re seeing now is disposable income and salaries are keeping up and tracking the inflationary pressure but that s what you have to watch out for and we re in this unique position where we have over 200 billion of cash sitting on consumers balance sheets to mitigate a lot of that in most of the economy but how that gets spent and how that drives inflation versus growth we all have to watch so i think that s what you re trying to get at and that s what we re watching for too gabriel dechaine national bank financial analyst ok well thank you operator thank you the next question is from mario mendonca from td securities please go ahead mario mendonca td securities analyst good morning can i take you to page 26 of your presentation and specifically the all bank asset yields i m looking at the loan yield and how it s dropped by 27 basis points over the last 12 months over that time period the five year bank of canada five years up about 100 points increase in the five years has been rather abrupt and recent i would have thought that we might start to see a little bit of a move in loan yields it might just be mix that i m seeing here it might be just a matter of timing but could you speak to when that increase in the five years that we re seeing will translate into higher loan yields nadine ahn chief financial officer sure mario thank you i mean i think you re right a bit of it is going to be mixed overall that you re mix overall though we re talking about some of it we had expressed as part from the comments around the mortgage book and how the competitive pricing there that is but as five year rates have started to roll into higher rates we have seen those rates go up mario mendonca td securities analyst so you re saying we are starting to see that do you have a sense for when we might actually this exhibit on page 26 will actually see the inflection in loan yields in terms of timing nadine ahn chief financial officer yeah we have to disclose it a bit for you mario because again as i said it is the full book across capital markets and city national so if rates start to rise you would expect it but it s difficult to probably get back to you and bring you a bit more of a decomp position on it dave mckay president and chief executive officer city national probably plays a role given how much it s impacted at the short end of the curve than the long end there is a significant compression that we ve talked about in the city national and it would disturb that number versus have nothing to do with the canadian long yield that may be part of it so we ll have to decompose that to one driver we ll look at roll on roll off on the mortgages in canada will be another driver and we can do a waterfall for you nadine ahn chief financial officer five year rate mario mendonca td securities analyst yeah i was looking at the canadian five year but obviously the u s five year is up as well maybe not as much as the canadian dave mckay president and chief executive officer our balance sheet is completely orange it s short end of the curve in the united states where we don t have many long term assets of the short end so that s what s driving this yield mario mendonca td securities analyst we ll need to see actual central bank rate increases before we might see that margin tick up nadine ahn chief financial officer right dave mckay president and chief executive officer and that s the way we gave you the sensitivity with the short end of the curve move because it has a big impact on the u s and canada for us and the longer end of the curve is quite flat mario mendonca td securities analyst slightly different type of question i also care a lot about what you re doing on the liquidity front the average looking at repos cash resources securities ex trading obviously that increase those balances increased very significantly when the pandemic hit because every bank was building liquidity then it started to taper off until very recently now we re seeing a really big increase again in repos for example on securities could you talk about repo specifically and the dynamic the sort of market dynamic that would cause such a significant increase in repos from last quarter to this quarter nadine ahn chief financial officer derek derek neldner group head capital markets sure mario it s derek what you re seeing there is a couple of things quarter over quarter a big part of that is just what i ll refer to as sort of seasonality or timing of the year and so because of the timing of our fiscal year end and our quarters versus many of our global peers that are operating on a calendar fiscal year end many of them will often pull back on liquidity they re providing in the market as they head into the december 31 period because that s intra quarter for us that often creates good opportunities for us to step in with liquidity around the calendar year end period and support our clients through really just a multi week period around year end and so there s a seasonality element to our repo business where often we can increase our balances to support clients through that time period and then bring those back down so that is definitely part of what you saw in terms of the quarter over quarter longer term and nadine referred to this earlier with all the liquidity that s been put into the market by central banks over the last couple of years the demand for financing through things like repo has come down and that has brought down our volumes but it s also had a notable spread impact i think we would expect as liquidity starts being pulled out of the market we will see an increased client demand for financing which would be helpful for us but also we would over time expect that to translate into higher spreads in that business and we i d say we re very early days and starting to see that this was the first quarter where we saw a modest uptick in spreads so it does take time but we would expect as rates go higher and liquidity comes out of the system that will help to normalize spreads in that business mario mendonca td securities analyst thank you operator thank you the next question is from lemar persaud from cormark please go ahead lemar persaud cormark securities analyst thanks my question is probably for nadine so i think i heard you suggest that inflation is captured in the structural part of the expense expectations slide expense expectations waterfall on slide 12 so maybe clarify that then would it be fair to suggest that the structural costs were more significantly impacted by say higher inflation could some of that 4 growth in investment and volume spend being deferred or is there just not that much flexibility there i m just really trying to assess the possibility that costs could come in above your guidance range here so any thoughts would be helpful nadine ahn chief financial officer sure thank you so the 2 structural does have a component and the parts of it related to inflations would be where we had increased salaries at the start of the year recognizing the fact that we were under some inflationary pressure but that s about a third of that about two thirds of that is more scalable related to business volumes so for example trade x sub custody etc and also seeing a bit of the pickup in travel the 4 you referenced of the investment a large component of that is actually investment in talent so we ve already incorporated as part of that a little bit of inflation as well lemar just in terms of expectations around certain of those groups that we re investing in from a frontline perspective as well as some of the rest of it would be in tools i would say if inflation was to significantly spike or push through a couple of things just to note there so we have put through some of it already into our full across the board salary base the other piece of it is some of our cost base actually is not going to be immediately impacted by inflation we do have a number of costs that will be fixed in nature for example our occupancy is already predetermined cost secondly although the depreciation was related to our app dev spend or some of that investment in technology is actually from historical spend as it pulls through from an nie standpoint we do have opportunity to scale on that but also on the efficiency and productivity side that we referenced there is an area that we re heavily focused on to be able to continue to invest and if inflation persists further into the future it s an area that we can continue to look at to continue our investment and play with that lever as well lemar persaud cormark securities analyst great thank you operator thank you the next question is from mike rizvanovic from stifel please go ahead mike rizvanovic stifel financial corp analyst hey good morning a question probably for neil so i do see the market share gains that you had just looking over a longer term horizon but you have lost share in the residential mortgage balances i m referring to among the big six each of the past three quarters and i know in the past you ve had some discussion points around spreads in the market and competitive dynamics and maybe some aggressive pricing from peers so i m wondering what your near term outlook might be on when you expect those market share losses to abate neil mclaughlin group head personal commercial banking yeah appreciate the question we made some comments last year just about making a decision to take a little bit more margin when we were kind of at the height of the market in terms of volume just to make sure we didn t lose any volume in the pipeline we ve converted all of those i was kind of like i d say midyear last year since then we ve been competing i think very hard and feel very comfortable of what we re taking out of the market i think one of the things you need to get underneath is the difference between of the market share and the cba market share data there s different inputs into each of them so one of the differences being just wholesale funding and purchasing mortgage is something we don t do and at least one of our competitors we ve been a part of what s driving some of the trends i think you re referring to just gets back to our strategy which is we believe in owning the channel we have a proprietary sales strategy we own the relationship and it all kind of ties back to owning the client to be able to cross sell so i don t think we have anything in our sights about us losing market share on the mortgage business mike rizvanovic stifel financial corp analyst i appreciate the color and then maybe just a follow up on dave s guidance earlier on mortgage growth remaining in that high single digit range for the rest of this year i believe was what the comment was referring to so i m just looking at some of the trends that we ve seen lately including you ve got like the recent originations about 60 of them have been variable and just thinking back to the rate hikes that we saw in 2017 it sort of pushed the mortgage growth all the way down to that low single digit i think it troughed at around 3 so i m wondering if we do get what the bond market is pricing in right now something in the range of six rate hikes would your 2023 outlook be looking something like low to mid single digit range at best in terms of growth neil mclaughlin group head personal commercial banking yeah it s neil again i ll take the question so i guess to give you a bit of an extended outlook dave made the comment that mortgage outlook toward the end of the year would be high single digits as we see rates come up naturally cooling the market slowing down some activity we d see that get into mid single digits to end 2023 mike rizvanovic stifel financial corp analyst ok that s helpful thanks for the color operator thank you the next question is from scott chan from canaccord genuity please go ahead scott chan canaccord genuity analyst good morning a lot has been asked on the canadian p c but i wanted to kind of focus on the city national side and the one thing that struck me was the retail book grew 25 year over year and you kind of called out mortgage growth leading similar to canada so i was just wondering maybe an update on the strategy there anything differentiated and is it fair to assume that the u s growth this year would be higher or could be higher on the canadian side thanks dave mckay president and chief executive officer so it s dave i ll make some comments we re very happy with the city national growth both on the commercial c i side as well as you pointed out on the consumer side it s a result of our strategy i ve been talking about for years hiring private bankers in our key markets expanding our capability to jumbo mortgages cross selling those jumbo mortgages into core deposit and investment accounts so you re seeing just the acceleration of the investments and the strategy starting to play out for us and it s our fastest growing line of business now followed strongly by very strong entertainment growth our inter containment clients are busy there s an enormous amount of content investment as i pointed out in my speech into global content production we have a fantastic core capability in entertainment banking from production through to talent management so i think from that filmtrack was an important acquisition in the ip side for us to play a bigger role in the entertainment industry and our core c i real estate and commercial we re seeing great progress on our mid corporate i think we re at almost 2 billion of growth there already so that strategy again seeded by investment of building out teams in core markets bringing new clients in this franchise has a proven ability over decades to execute organically at an exceptional high quality growth level and we re seeing as we move into new territories whether it be jumbo mortgage or mid corporate commercial that customer centric franchise that brings new clients has proven that it can extend geographically and it can extend into new customer segments and we re very very happy with the progress scott chan canaccord genuity analyst thank you dave dave mckay president and chief executive officer one more question and then we ll cut it off operator thank you so the last question will be from sohrab movahedi from bmo capital markets please go ahead sohrab movahedi bmo capital markets analyst ok great thank you i just wanted to actually go to doug guzman which doug you ve got the expanded responsibilities now that include i think overall well as you think about the opportunities there should we be thinking you will be focused more on the top line or efficiency improvements and maybe you can talk a little bit across the geographies as well doug guzman group head wealth management insurance and i ts sure thanks yeah first of all i don t think you should expect a radically new strategies across these businesses at all the wealth businesses so u s wealth and brokerage business and our canadian wealth management business also a brokerage model have had the parts of their operations that made sense to be centralized have been throughout so our operations function we run on the same rails on the operations side the products and strategy function at the margin maybe there s a little more room for more communication but i don t think you re going to see much really different there dave s talked to city national top line growth is really important there growing the infrastructure into the size of the revenue base is also important and expenses are important so i don t think i d pick between revenue and expense but we re optimistic both those businesses in the u s have shown really strong growth big investments in technology in the u s wealth management and brokerage very attractive destination for fas financial advisors in the u s we ve had good growth on that side and expense controls throughout on the canadian businesses you continue to see us outselling the competition our market share in global asset management and the retail mutual fund business remains 50 above no 2 and it s actually gapping out because our sales exceed our underlying market share similarly in wealth management canada where we ve had great success attracting advisors and a very low direct expense growth so i think kind of both the caveat of course is markets we can t control markets but we feel like we re positioned for any eventuality historically in market disruptions in our home market we ve benefited because we ve been able to remain consistent and we ve got a higher level of advice content in our delivery there remains considerable cash on retail customer individual balance sheet and that cash needs to move to longer term investments for their life planning and we re working on that as well so we feel pretty good about all the bits i just covered sohrab movahedi bmo capital markets analyst and doug just for crystal clarity you don t think you need any capital for inorganic engines on this this is all organic you re talking about doug guzman group head wealth management insurance and i ts we don t need capital for inorganic the growth emphasis in domestic wealth management on the distribution side has been hiring people so that s expense investment in people and building capabilities and that s the reason we re continuing to gain market share we re able to deliver more to our customers on a relationship than we have in the past and that protects fees over time we don t need more scale in canada similarly in other markets while we re open to it we don t need to do anything on the acquisition side sohrab movahedi bmo capital markets analyst thank you for taking my follow up question operator thank you this will conclude the question and answer session i d like to turn the meeting back over to mr dave mckay dave mckay president and chief executive officer i d like to thank everyone for a lot of great questions and as i sum up our quarter again we re very happy with the way we started the year and the themes that we wanted to really leave you with today was just the impact of the investments and the consistent investment strategy across all our businesses is producing high roe high quality growth across all our franchises and your questions touched on all of that growth today whether it s private banking and 25 and in cnb 25 jumbo mortgage growth with high net worth customers the strong cnb entertainment real estate and now mid market growth fueled by an expansion and hiring strategy there u s wealth management building completely new technology platforms that investment has led to an 8 billion secured lending portfolio with 80 million of revenue canadian banking launching vantage and continuing to expand our value proposition driving really strong customer acquisition and in profitability in core banking and market share gains capital markets our long term strategy is executing against expanded industry coverage bringing new mds and focusing on high growth high opportunity sectors like healthcare and technology driving really strong noninterest revenue growth it is the consistency and the approach and the focus on the strategy is delivering results and that s the message that we really want to hear and as many of your questions pointed to we have a line of sight and flexibility to manage the uncertainty around the inflationary environment we have levers you ve touched on those levers with your questions and very much we feel like we have an exciting year ahead of us so thank you very much for your questions look forward to seeing you in q2 be well operator duration 75

light of what s happening in the world stage above all else we hope peace is restored as quickly as possible you can refer to our 10 k we filed yesterday and our news release for detailed information as well as reconciliations to non gaap measures 2021 was a strong year we exited the year with some momentum and expect to see another good year in 2022 we exceeded our guidance numbers we paid off the balance of our revolver we added inventory in our core areas and we most recently took the first step toward a capital return plan by initiating our first ever regular dividend we re going to take a little different approach this morning from our previous calls and i m going to ask jimmy henderson our cfo to spend some time discussing our fourth quarter and full year results while we were assisted by a rising commodity price environment our team did a great job executing our 2021 program as well as the initiatives we set out at the beginning of the year once jimmy concludes i want to talk about our 2022 program our return of capital approach for 2022 and to answer some questions that arose from our last news release jimmy i m going to turn it over to you for the financial results jimmy henderson chief financial officer all right thanks lynn and i echo your thoughts on as our thoughts and prayers go out to ukrainian people on news that we re all watching here and hope that peace is resolved quickly well i hate to spot off a bunch of numbers i know you all read in our filings already i do want to highlight a few things a few results that are really striking in the fourth quarter of 2021 we had net income on a gaap basis of 292 million or 7 34 per diluted share as compared to 198 million or 5 per share in the previous quarter adjusting for certain items but primarily the mark to market of our hedging transactions we had adjusted net income of 168 million or 4 23 per diluted share in the fourth quarter as compared to 142 million or 3 57 per share for the previous quarter adjusted ebitdax was 226 million compared to 201 million in the previous quarter the increase is primarily due to the better commodity prices and a slight uptick in our oil production quarter over quarter our production on a barrels of oil equivalent basis remain relatively flat quarter over quarter averaging 92 800 boe per day compared to a third quarter production of 92 100 boe per day oil production for the fourth quarter averaged 52 900 barrels of oil per day which is up slightly from 51 800 barrels of oil in the third quarter oil differentials were considerably higher in the fourth quarter as overall basin production levels remain well within total takeaway capacity as we move into 2022 our term commitment levels have decreased resulting in more exposure to spot value premiums that we re seeing now our natural gas prices benefited in 2021 from a premium at our primary pricing point the ventura point as compared to henry hub and ngl prices continued to be strong in the fourth quarter at an average percentage of wti oil of around 37 just for context this compares to less than 20 that we were experiencing in the same quarter last year as noted last quarter the majority of our gathering and processing agreements are structured as fixed fee contracts and therefore receive a more pronounced benefit to our net realized price at current residue gas and ngl benchmark pricing the company invested capex of about 66 million during the fourth quarter to bring 16 gross 12 net wells on to production and we drilled 17 gross 10 4 net operated wells we ended the quarter with 34 gross 20 2 net drilled and uncompleted wells we currently have two rigs running and one completion crew both of those drilling rigs are in the sanish field and our completion crews working in the cassandra area lease operating expense was 62 million for or 7 31 per boe for the fourth quarter of 21 note that loe continues to be impacted by expensed workovers that we ve talked about previously our cash g a expenses were 12 million for the fourth quarter and for the year totaled about 39 million averaging right around 1 16 per boe for 2021 we also disclosed our year end proved reserves in our 10 k and our press release last night we did see a dramatic increase year over year with the estimated total proved reserves totaling 326 million boes with a pre tax pv10 value of 4 4 billion at year end compared to 260 million boe and 1 2 billion at the year end 2020 pricing under sec rules increased by approximately 27 per barrel to 66 56 per barrel at december 31 2021 compared to december 31 2020 gas increased to 3 60 per mmbtu compared to 1 99 for the same two periods obviously these price changes were the biggest factor in the year over year changes but we also added 20 3 million boe through the drill bit and 16 million boe with acquisitions which more than offset the decrease from selling our colorado assets lastly i ll point out that our proved developed properties accounted for roughly 80 of our total proved reserves with approximately 3 6 billion in value it s worth noting that this value is at sec pricing of around 67 per barrel of oil as compared to spot prices today with that i ll turn this back over to lynn and talk a little bit about where we re headed in 2022 lynn peterson chief executive officer thanks jimmy there were a lot of numbers here so i appreciate that again thanks to our entire team for their great efforts during the year divesting of our colorado properties combined with adding meaningful inventory through our acquisition work we ll pay great dividends in future years and we should really start to see the benefits accruing at the end of 2022 and moving into 2023 with our development plan the board and management understand the importance of returning capital to shareholders we have had much engagement throughout the last year by our board and we are excited to lay out our plans as we go through the year as such the board approved a quarterly dividend of 0 25 per share that will be paid beginning in march which was only the first step of our capital return program our board wants to be very thoughtful and measured in developing a plan to that end we have had multiple discussions of stock buybacks and fixed and variable dividends and i am completely comfortable in saying our board of directors is going in this direction and we would expect to lay out additional information that would place the company in the fairway of what we are seeing from returning capital from our peers when we look out over the next four years and consider a 70 price environment for wti crude we see our company generating free cash flow in an amount approximately the same as our current market cap i know we live in a world of instant gratification but again i will state that our board of directors is aligned with our shareholders and we will methodically develop and return a capital plan that should please our shareholders and i want to shift and outline how we thought about our 2022 capital plan and production profile looking ahead we will have a slightly higher activity level we will have larger working interest in the wells drilled and completed in our sanish field due to the acquisitions we anticipate an increased level of non operated activity and we have built in inflationary factors that we are currently experiencing and anticipate throughout the year our supply chain team has done a great job of locking many of the big ticket items for the first half of 2022 however we are less protected in the back half of the year we estimate the inflationary pressure to the program to be in the low double digit percentages but the high end of our guidance has contingency for higher inflation should that become an issue turning to our production profile we have shifted some production from the first half of the year and into the second half due to the drilling and completion activities on a five well pad mentioned in our previous release we had the rig down on the pad in january and we ll be moving back in in march this delay combined with our current activity in the sanish field create somewhat of a hockey stick moderating our overall 22 production but creating impressive growth as we exit the year and move into 23 which should benefit with a sharp increase in production in february we announced the acquisition of non operated assets in our sanish field we negotiate these transactions in the fall of 21 in a lower price environment and we believe they add significant shareholder value we have been able to hedge production from these acquisitions at a much higher wti pricing the acquired interest included wells currently on production wells that have already been drilled and are awaiting completion in 22 as well as significant interest in wells scheduled on our 22 and 23 drilling programs this is a field that we understand very well and i have a high confidence in the well economics supporting our belief that these are highly accretive transactions with excellent risk adjusted returns we re starting 22 in an incredibly strong financial position and i expect to have attractive cash flow from operations during the year with our current hedges in place and using the 70 price for wti and 4 for gas we model over 900 million in ebitda resulting in over 500 million of adjusted free cash flow which demonstrates that we can continue to grow our return to capital program while also continuing to pursue acquisition opportunities that will compete with our current profile by investing in whiting we think shareholders can really have it all and with that i ll turn it back to sara questions answers operator our first question comes from leo mariani with keybanc please go ahead lynn peterson chief executive officer you there leo leo mariani keybanc capital markets analyst yes hello sorry so look whiting obviously had strong production here in the fourth quarter came in above guide i was hoping you could maybe provide a little color around what drove the good fourth quarter here on production lynn peterson chief executive officer i think we continue to see good performance from our wells i ll let chip jump in here as well but the team is trying some different things on completion i think we re seeing some benefits to this chip chip rimer chief operating officer yes appreciate it lynn yes especially in our sanish field our lacey littlefield areas we ve seen going in there we re doing some rifting right next to the wells that we are stimulating the new ones and we re starting to see some impact and so we re seeing wedge production higher than we our original curves and also our base production is staying up there leo mariani keybanc capital markets analyst ok and i guess just in terms of maybe some of those new simulations are you all planning on kind of receiving a lot of that here i assume in 2022 is this pretty broadly applicable across the entire basin is it more just in sanish what can you kind of tell us about that chip rimer chief operating officer yes leo it s a little early to say we re seeing that impact i d like to wait for a quarter or two but we re pleased with what we ve seen so far and we ll see where it goes from here leo mariani keybanc capital markets analyst ok maybe can you just talk about the m a environment a little bit obviously you guys have done a few smaller deals over the past several months which in your wheelhouse are you seeing other type of bolt on opportunities out there or perhaps maybe there s some bigger deals that you re eyeing here in the bakken lynn peterson chief executive officer yes leo clearly we re watching everything looking at many things possible i think you also we got a backdrop of pretty aggressive rise in commodity prices and i think it s made it a bit challenging people are enjoying their cash flow they re seeing off these properties so we also want to make sure we don t buy on the high end here and watch oil drop over time so we re being cautious but we re looking at everything we can leo mariani keybanc capital markets analyst ok thanks guys lynn peterson chief executive officer you bet thanks operator our next question comes from neal dingmann with truist please go ahead neal dingmann truist securities analyst good morning all first question on dips kind of two for here just wondering could you talk about how you re thinking about maybe for jimmy first just speak to the delta on the spot dips this year versus 21 are you still guiding to that through 3 or 4 off versus i think it was about 4 in 21 i think you ve mentioned more exposure to spot this year and i think spot is now in a pretty good place so i m just wondering on that and to tuck into that i know there was some dapl news i don t doubt that has any impact near term but i m just also wondering how you re thinking about this dapl moves down the line on the debt jimmy henderson chief financial officer yes thanks neal i ll start and i ll turn it over to jo ann to correct anything that i say wrong but look at 21 over compared to 22 i mean if you remember 21 we started off the year with concerns about dapl and we re kind of affected this is going into the year and the guidance that we gave was trying to take that into consideration and it certainly got better as we move through the year as things kind of normalize and production levels stayed relatively consistent and within the total transportation capacity and jo ann maybe i ll let you talk a little bit more about the what you see on the america side as well as dapl jo ann stockton vice president commercial sure yes and just a little bit more detail on 2021 i mean we had a mixture of various term length deals utilizing firm transportation on alternative pipeline along with supply commitments into rail markets and really it was strategically aligned with our crude gathering service provider system connectivity to specifically protect our larger producing areas and if you think about how that case unfolded and the timing we really did layer in from q4 of 20 all through up until right in front of the may decision and so from there moving forward into 2022 most of the deals that acted as a physical hedge against an uncertain dapl outcome has rolled off and what remains is a combination of term into various markets with more of a concentration on spot volume relative to last year is what we ve indicated and so with the recent decision of the u s supreme court denying dakota access petition to appeal the lower court decision basically reaffirming that the eis will stand and so we shift ahead and expect a draft version of that here in the next few weeks with the official timing still protects project excuse me for september but we re actually wondering if that timing will slip because you take into account how contentious this issue is and the expectation that the numerous comments that will be filed will need to be addressed and taken into consideration before the eis is finalized we can easily see it slipping out past that date at the end of the day if you re thinking where we stand on the balance of this year we look at it as the army core engineers have the opportunity to go down a different road than they chose not to and as we factor in the macro outlook especially in light of the most recent news along with an existing pipeline with continuous operations we re cautiously optimistic on a favorable outcome and if anything that guided range that we gave me maybe we could see some slight improvement to that lynn peterson chief executive officer we should have given our proper introduction jo ann stockton is our vice president of commercial here for whiting neal dingmann truist securities analyst thanks for the details and then just one follow up maybe jimmy for you you guys have had some outstanding return of capital that to me then appears the market is fully appreciated i m just wondering could you speak to potential additional return of capital that you are seeing for yearly jimmy henderson chief financial officer well we announced the dividend earlier this quarter and that s the first step and i think it s pretty obvious when you look at our cash flow free cash flow generation there s more to come i think we spoke to that quite a bit in the prepared script as we ve talked about consistently over the last year it was it s always been our intent to do this very methodically and thoughtfully and goes one step at a time so we ve done that we ve paid down our debt to 0 we ve been able to do an acquisition which we ll pay off very quickly now we ve announced the dividend and there s more to come on that front we ve been very consistent in laying out with our shareholders neal dingmann truist securities analyst very good thank you all look forward to it lynn peterson chief executive officer you bet neal just to reiterate our board is completely aligned with us on this we just really wanted to do it one step at a time as jimmy said there so it s all good neal dingmann truist securities analyst yes that makes the most sense i m glad you re sort of walking before running on this it makes a lot of sense thanks thanks lynn operator our next question comes from michael scialla with stifel please go ahead michael scialla stifel financial corp analyst good morning everybody maybe just staying on that last topic in terms of return of capital when you said you re having a lot of conversations with the board everybody is aligned i don t want you to try and front run what the board might decide is the best avenue but i guess in looking at share buybacks just how do you think about that from a high level versus where your stock is today and the opportunity to continue to do these bolt on acquisitions how do you view the opportunity set there lynn peterson chief executive officer yeah good morning mike good to hear you i think stock buybacks is probably going to be our next step here we ve talked long and hard about it clearly after we put our last announcement out i wish i had it in place so i mean it would have worked out pretty well so we just we see a lot of noise in the investment world today and we talked to our shareholders both long only and value and everybody we get a different message for everybody some people want us to reinvest in properties some want us to pay dividends some want us to buy our stock back so we re looking at all of these things and again we just laid out the fixed dividend as our starting point here i think the next step would clearly be a stock buyback announcement and then i think you re seeing more of the variable dividends i still i think we ve got more work to do on that one but i think all these make sense in conjunction with you re seeing the free cash flow that we re generating here i mean you ve seen companies pay back 40 50 60 in some cases if we can get into that range i think we ll be very competitive with our peers out there so i m excited what we got to go ahead i mean again people want it today they don t want to wait i get it but at the same time i think i have a lot of respect for position our take on this and we re excited to lay out as we go through the year michael scialla stifel financial corp analyst that s helpful sounds good and i know you ve steered clear of quarterly guidance in the past but i just wanted to see if you could give us any sense maybe from a high level the expected completion cadence through the year should we just anticipate kind of flat production throughout the year or is there going to be any variability given the cadence of completions lynn peterson chief executive officer well again that was kind of the purpose of the comments here i think you re going to see a kind of a slow first half of the year with really ratcheting up as we exit the year and a lot of due to the comment i made earlier about the five well pad that we ve been delayed on a little bit so i think that was kind of the disappointment when we put out our news that people didn t see the production overall and it was just moderated a little bit by this pause or slowness on our five well pad i think as we exit out the year the numbers get pretty significant do you have anything you want to add too jimmy henderson chief financial officer yes no you re exactly right so our telecom is a little bit light on the first half and we re pretty strong in the back half of the year you ll see that in the back half of the year on production michael scialla stifel financial corp analyst great thank you guys lynn peterson chief executive officer yeah thanks mike operator our next question comes from scott hanold with rbc please go ahead scott hanold rbc capital markets analyst thanks good morning all lynn i don t want to beat a dead horse but i feel like i m going to here on dividends versus stock buybacks you obviously made a lot of compelling cases that buybacks make a lot of sense and they do provide a lot of flexibility i guess to a certain extent and maybe at a high level it would be helpful if you could just give us a sense i know it sounds like buybacks are an option you re looking at and it sounds like the next step but why not that be the first step like what was the decision to go with the dividend before the buyback lynn peterson chief executive officer well scott i wish you could be at all these investor calls we have because like i said some guys don t want any dividends others want every 0 01 of free cash flow so these are hard decisions to make and again a lot of comments were investors want the cash in their pocket they can reinvest in the stock if they want to if they want to reinvest in something else they can stock buybacks and maybe we should have combined it i m not saying we did exactly right here we probably should announce the combination of the buyback and a fixed dividend looking back now but again we re going to get there quickly so i m not too concerned we just thought we d do the fixed dividend first and then follow it up with the stock repurchase jimmy henderson chief financial officer yes and probably just to add just kind of the process of getting a dividend we re going to announce it so we can kind of get that get the record date set and get started paying actual cash scott hanold rbc capital markets analyst and then how do you contemplate usage when you think about usage of the free cash flow and look i think it s you guys got a good runway of inventory for at least five years and maybe a little bit longer but obviously when you think about the durability and sustainability of the free cash flow generation i think generally investors would like to see it somewhere in that decade plus if they can and so obviously it feels like that potentially some of that free cash flow could be earmarked for various types of consolidation but like can you give us a sense of like as you look at that free cash flow wall that you re seeing how much of that dry powder do you think make sense to keep in your hands for opportunities if they pick up lynn peterson chief executive officer it s a good question and i think the size of the company matters in this regard i mean i share your comment on our inventory i think we re fine but we re not where we want to be i think that was really what drove us in 21 to pay down our revolver i mean and again i got to you ve got to remember we started the year at 35 40 wti and we were in a totally different world where we ended up at 80 at the end of the year so things have changed dramatically here but we are constantly looking to see if we can find properties that compete against our current properties and we want to have some dry powder to execute on those and i don t know what the right number is again you see companies kind of 40 50 i know there s a few out of 60 of free cash flow in total between fixed stock buybacks and variable dividends so i think ultimately that still allows us to pursue these acquisitions when we find them and keep our balance sheet strong i mean we re trying to do a lot of things here and we re fortunate to have a really strong balance sheet right now we want to protect that but we do want to grow the company at the same time jimmy henderson chief financial officer yes also remember scott that we have an untapped revolver of 750 million of capacity on it so it s not a matter of porting cash to save our pennies for a deal we got a lot liquidity that we can tap to these things scott hanold rbc capital markets analyst would you be willing to use equity to do some of that that made sense or is that a nonstarter discussion lynn peterson chief executive officer no i think we ve used it in the past and i don t have a problem with all with us now if we think our stock inside at a reasonable number i mean again you got to just evaluate the time you are in and where you think your stock is right now we use cash versus our stock because we think our stock is it s below what we think we re worth so we would tend to use more of the cash position scott hanold rbc capital markets analyst understood thank you operator your next question comes from david deckelbaum with cowen please go ahead david deckelbaum cowen and company analyst good morning lynn jimmy thanks for squeezing me in here lynn peterson chief executive officer hey david how are you doing david deckelbaum cowen and company analyst doing well congrats on the operations update you pointed out the delays i think is a five well pad which i believe was in the cassandra area for context as we move forward here particularly with the higher working interest in sanish how long should we be thinking about those two rigs staying in that sanish area or are there going to be more of these sorts of longer lateral developments that get sprinkled into the program lynn peterson chief executive officer maybe i ll let chip take the first shot at that if you don t mind chip rimer chief operating officer yes will do david thanks for the question yes our program has about 65 of our program is in sanish and then we move to the west the hidden bench forming later in the year we re probably close to 35 maybe a little bit more than that or three miles as we go along so that will drive capital efficiency as we go and help to minimize some of the inflation impacts and so that s kind of what the program has us doing right now we ll run back up into that cassandra area later this year and knock out that additional pad that was delayed lynn peterson chief executive officer one of the things that matters a lot to us is all this esg conversation i think as we look bringing these wells on we want to make sure we have the takeaway that s required we re not allowing trying to flare anything and done a great job working with our midstream partners and so some of this movement is dictated because of the commodity takeaway as well chip rimer chief operating officer it was a mechanical issue up in the cassandra not a systemic issue so we ll get it back over there later in the year lynn peterson chief executive officer yep david deckelbaum cowen and company analyst yeah thanks chip and then lynn i know a lot has been asked around this but like one i think it just it seems like you ve been pretty explicit that you think whiting is perfectly capable of paying a 50 rate of its free cash while still maintaining enough cash hoarding and flexibility to pursue m a so it seems like that s a reasonable target as investors compare you to some of your peers lynn peterson chief executive officer yes i m not going to let you put a percentage on me david but i think you see the numbers and you see i think we have a lot of flexibility here and we can do the right thing and we will do the right thing we re excited about that i mean this is not a situation where we re trying to put cash on the balance sheet we want to return it to shareholders and we want to do the right thing but at the same time we are looking for opportunities yes i think your numbers are very reasonable david deckelbaum cowen and company analyst and then i guess in terms of how we should think about how that presents itself over the course of the year did the conversation when the fixed dividend i know we talked about the intention to start kind of small and build into this program but how frequently is the return of capital program being reevaluated and at some point it sounds like we should get another update at least this year but is this something that occurs on like a three month basis or it s just ad hoc lynn peterson chief executive officer yes we probably talk monthly weekly i have a lot of we have a great board we work together and i stay in communication we all got thrown together here about 16 months ago 18 months ago and it s been a great great opportunities to get to know each other and share ideas so we talk a lot and we ve talked about all of this for the last several months so yes you re going to see this evolve and you ll probably get evolve fairly quickly i think it s really important to our shareholders and we want to do the right thing we ve always had the intention doing the right thing and sometimes we have a different timeframe than other people but that s fine we re excited where we re headed so david deckelbaum cowen and company analyst thanks for the messaging and the clarification guys good luck ahead lynn peterson chief executive officer appreciate it david have a great day operator ladies and gentlemen there are no further questions at this time i ll turn the floor back to management for closing remarks lynn peterson chief executive officer all right thanks again sara in closing i want to thank our shareholders for your continued support i can assure you that we re excited with our free cash flow projections for 22 and beyond we have listened to our shareholders and their comments on the emphasis on return on capital as well as continue to participate in opportunistic acquisitions that build on our future our board and our management are very much aligned in expanding our return on capital structure to our shareholders and we will roll out this additional information soon at the same time i want to thank our staff for the continued dedication they have given to our company and shareholders a special shout out to our field staff that endures some very challenging weather conditions during the winter months each year their ability to maintain production and operations is not lost on me and they deserve kudos above and beyond their daily routines with that i thank

january 20 2022 alan gold executive chairman thank you brian and welcome everyone today we look forward to providing a recap of our business for 2021 and our views on the ever changing landscape of this still very young industry we have an ambitious agenda we will of course save time at the end to answer your questions as we all know the end of 2020 and the start of 2021 witnessed a tremendous amount of optimism in the wake of the new election cycle and tremendous 50 plus growth in 2020 sustained by the regulated cannabis industry over what was a very challenged period for nearly every other industry the capital markets optimism waned a bit as we move further into 2021 as the prospect for near term adjustments to the federal regulatory position on the industry dimmed however the industry continued to see strong growth throughout 2021 driven in part by the continued march of new states adopting and rolling out both medical use and adult use programs including unprecedented legislative action with new york virginia connecticut and new mexico legislating for adult use programs and alabama legislating for medical use that momentum continues in 2022 with the latest sovereign state mississippi legalizing cannabis for medical use earlier this month becoming the 37th state to do so 2021 also continue a trend of ever increasing consolidation in the industry with over 210 mergers and acquisition transactions totaling over 10 billion in value in the united states alone we also witness consolidation within our tenant base during 2021 and into 2022 and ben will provide more detail regarding those developments of course with the growth of the industry and the rollout of new programs demand for real estate capital continued to be robust throughout 2021 2021 was the highest year of investment activity in our company s history eclipsing over 700 million during the year ben will also provide an update on our acquisitions and investments in 2021 and year to date as of today we own 105 properties in 19 states totaling approximately 8 million square feet which are leased on a long term basis to high quality licensed cannabis operators with a weighted average lease term of over 16 years we are by far the largest real estate company focused on the regulated cannabis industry reflecting the performance of our property portfolio and continued execution on our acquisition and investment pipeline 2021 revenues grew 75 and adjusted funds from operations grew 78 from the prior year with the financial performance as a background we continue to grow our quarterly common stock dividend at a healthy clip with our most recent q4 dividend of 1 50 per share representing a 21 increase from the prior two years fourth quarter dividend please remember that our board s policy of reviewing any dividend increases is on a biannual basis with the next review coming shortly in the first quarter catherine will also provide more detail regarding our financial results and capital activity regarding federal regulatory developments paul will provide additional insight on the federal regulatory landscape and the cannabis market dynamics before i turn the call over to paul i want to again reiterate our entire team s appreciation for you our long term owners for your support throughout these years of growth and transformation of iipr and the industry we serve with that i d like to turn the call over to paul who will provide additional detail on the recent legislative and market developments of the regulated cannabis industry paul paul smithers president and chief executive officer thanks alan for this call i plan to provide an update on the regulated cannabis industry including continued state developments our views on the federal regulatory environment and an overview of recent dynamics of the industry as mentioned on prior calls i d like to also preface this discussion noting that regulations and industry developments are evolving rapidly and while we want to provide you a general landscape as of now in our opinions there can be no assurance that this landscape will not significantly change first a little detail on continued momentum on state legalization as alan alluded to in his opening remarks we continue to see great progress being made on the state level including establishment and rollout of both adult use and medical use programs as we noted in our past call 2021 saw unprecedented steps by state legislatures to pass new programs by legislative action including connecticut new york virginia and new mexico passing legislation for adult use cannabis programs and alabama adopting by legislative action and medical use cannabis program earlier this month mississippi s governor signed legislation legalizing medical cannabis becoming the 37th state to have adopted a program interestingly mississippi by an overwhelming majority voted in favor of a broader legalization of medical cannabis in the november 2020 elections but that vote was thrown out by the mississippi supreme court for not following the state s signature requirements for ballot measures as a result 37 states in washington dc have legalized cannabis for medical use and 18 states in washington dc have legalized cannabis for adult use we are also tracking several other states that we believe have a strong likelihood of legalizing either medical use or adult use cannabis in 2022 alone such as nebraska in idaho for medical use and potentially oklahoma arkansas missouri ohio north dakota and maryland for adult use second our views on the current federal regulatory environment building on our discussion from august we continue to see some movement on national cannabis reform however those reform proposals also are continuing to compete for space on the congressional agenda with 2022 of course also being a midterm election year there are numerous cannabis related bills pending in congress at different stages of review which we have touched on in prior calls the safe banking act which would provide additional safety to financial institutions in serving state compliant licensed cannabis operators was reintroduced for the sixth time as an amendment to the america competes act earlier this year though whether the safe banking act language will be included in the final bill remains to be seen in addition the more act short for the marijuana opportunity reinvestment and expungement act was first introduced in summer of 2019 and passed the house in the prior to legislative session in december of 2020 and was reintroduced last year in the current legislative session the more act focuses on descheduling cannabis from the control of substances act and includes strong social equity provisions in july of last year senator schumer released an initial draft of the cannabis administration and opportunity act which provides for among other things removal of cannabis as a schedule one controlled substance under the csa deference to states to determine their own cannabis policies transfer all regulatory responsibility of cannabis to the u s food and drug administration and certain other federal agencies and the establishment of a federal taxation framework for regulated cannabis sales the act was subject to a review period with requested comments by september of last year and received numerous comments both for and against perhaps one of the most significant criticisms which we agree with would be the proposed federal excise tax of 25 the highest proposed tax structure of any of the bills we ve seen this of course would have various implications to the states regarding their own taxation systems and further challenge the industry as it competes with a much larger unregulated and untaxed listed industry for now the comments have been taken under advisement and once the bill is formally filed it will be sent to committee for continued discussions and revisions before any potential senate floor vote also late last year house republican nancy mace introduced the state s reform act similar to the more act and the cao act the state s reform act would decriminalize cannabis and provide retroactive expungement for nonviolent federal cannabis offenses however there is limited federal oversight and the sra vests to the individual states the authority to determine what level of cannabis reform including outright prohibition notably the sra also has the lowest tax structure of all the bills at 3 which cannot be increased for at least 10 years notably this bill does carry some bipartisan appeal including the support of four republican representatives as we have said before predicting the timing or substance of federal legislation is exceedingly difficult and perhaps even more so in today s political environment any reform bill would have to compete with other legislative priorities of the country as we emerge from this unprecedented endemic and into a midterm election cycle we continue to closely monitor the status and progress of the numerous bills in congress and surrounding discussions strictly speaking from our own view we continue to see certain more limited bills like the safe act gaining traction in the near term while more comprehensive far reaching bills like senator schumer s draft bill being further down the road finally regarding industry dynamics in 2021 and 2022 notwithstanding the unprecedented challenges experienced in the country from the pandemic the cannabis industry continued to strong growth trajectory in 2021 after having exhibited a resiliency and strength that was truly unique versus other industry categories while there has been some offsetting slowing of the industry s sales growth due to the feeding of multiple rounds of fiscal stimulus and the general loosening of pandemic related restrictions annual u s legal cannabis sales are still estimated to have grown to 25 billion in 2021 up from a tremendous year in 2020 at about 20 billion and that factors in only small portion if any of the expected economic impact of the several states that have authorized the establishment of programs by ballot measures in the past few years and through legislative action in 2021 as we noted previously finally i would note as we have in the past that the total addressable market for cannabis is of course multiple times the current legalized cannabis market in fact new frontier data estimates approximately 25 billion global spending and legal cannabis markets for 2020 while the total annual spending in both legal and illicit markets combined exceeded 400 billion globally with the u s of course constituting a very significant percentage of that amount of course that illustrates the continued tremendous opportunity to transition that illicit activity to the legal cannabis market and while we are encouraged by certain state and local governments for their pragmatic approach to regulating and taxing cannabis under there are established programs to promote that transition we believe there s still much work to be done most notably in california to modify programs in ways that encourage the growth of the regulated industry and encourage the continued transition away from illicit markets as alan alluded to in his opening remarks m a in the regulated cannabis space continues at a brisk pace we saw starting in late 2020 progressing through last year and in 2022 with u s m a activity in 2020 when for regulated cannabis companies more than doubled the totals of either 2020 or 2019 in terms of transaction consideration we continue to witness the advantages that many of the established public msos have in terms of scale and capital availability as they continue to build on their expansive footprints primarily utilizing the debt markets to fund these initiatives ben will touch on some of the m a activity in his discussion of our largest tenants but i would also note that this consolidation march continues on in 2022 earlier this month verano announced the execution of a definitive agreement to buy our tenant goodness growth in an all stock transaction valued at around 439 as a reminder we have been goodness gross real estate capital partner since 2017 and have long term leases with them for two properties in minnesota and new york also planning of course is the merger of our long term tenant partners pharmacann and livwell which was announced in october of last year and which once consummated well once again make pharmacann our largest tenant by investment we believe that a significant driver of this m a activity in general has been the relative availability of debt to finance acquisitions which increased substantially over the course of 2021 as a percentage of the overall mix of capital in the industry while we applaud the enhanced capital availability to many proven operators as part of a capital allocation that when utilized appropriately further enhances the credit quality of our tenant roster in our underwriting of proposed transactions we re taking a close look at the overall debt profiles of the operators including assessments of the risks related to refinancing bad debt or repaying bad debt by other means when it comes due i ll now turn the call over to ben who will walk you through our recent acquisitions and follow on investments as well as some additional color on our overall portfolio ben ben regin vice president of investments thanks paul since october 1 we made 31 acquisitions in seven states representing a mix of expansion of our existing real estate partnerships with top operators and establishment of new tenant relationships as of today we own 105 properties across 19 states representing approximately eight million square feet including approximately 2 4 million square feet under development or redevelopment with a weighted average remaining lease term that continues to be in excess of 16 years the fourth quarter capped off a record year of investment activity for our company during which we committed investments totaling 714 million growing our total invested capital by more than 55 as we have grown we ve continually diversified our portfolio both in terms of geographic and tenant concentration and as we stand today no state and not one of our 27 tenants represents more than 15 of our total committed investments similar to past calls i plan to touch on each of our recent acquisitions by state and also provide some information about each tenant in our portfolio overall in the state i also plan to provide some additional detail on our tenant roster and overall portfolio in december we continue to support our long term tenant partner livwell making a follow on investment of 34 7 million at our property in michigan acquiring the central utility plant on site as well as making additional improvements and enhancements to the existing infrastructure increasing the total rentable square feet at this property to 205 000 square feet as you may know livwell founded in 2009 and pharmacann a long term tenant partner of ours since 2016 announced their plan merger in october of last year and pro forma for their combination pharmacann and livwell will become our single largest earlier this month we also committed an additional 18 million to skymint a tenant partner of ours since 2018 and one of the largest vertically integrated operators in michigan as they continue to build out their capacity and one of their cultivation and processing facilities skymint recently announced a pending acquisition of another operator in michigan which would add another dozen dispensaries to skymint s operating portfolio in the state now on to new jersey earlier this month we extended our real estate partnership with ascend wellness acquiring 114 000 square foot industrial property in new jersey with a long term lease to awh together with our properties leased on a long term basis to green leaf and columbia care we own four properties in new jersey with our total investment expected to be about 90 million new jersey of course is on the cusp of launching its adult use cannabis program which is expected to generate over 2 billion in annual revenues within four years of launch in november we executed a follow on investment

other tenant partners continue to execute well and we re very happy to note our growth of new tenant relationships since the beginning of 2021 including six new tenants gold flora temescal sozo schwazze calyx peak and kaya cannabis with that i ll turn it over to catherine catherine cat hastings chief financial officer thanks ben the fourth quarter capped off an exceptional year for iip in the area of acquisitions and investments and we were thrilled to continue to deepen our long term real estate partnerships with our existing tenants while continuing to expand our tenant roster with strong management teams the execution on the investment side and strong portfolio performance continued to drive our financial results for the fourth quarter and for the full year 2021 we generated total revenues of approximately 59 million for the quarter a 59 increase from q4 of last year the increase was driven primarily by the acquisition and leasing of new properties additional improvement allowances provided to tenants at certain properties that resulted in basement adjustments and contractual rent escalations at certain properties and as we ve indicated in the past our q4 revenue reflects only partial quarters of revenues from the acquisitions and investments executed during the quarter and no revenues of course for the leases or lease amendments executed after the end of the quarter and our revenues for the quarter were also impacted by rent abatements or deferrals under certain leases as we continued to account for all of our leases on a cash basis for the three months ended december 31 2021 we recorded net income of 28 million or 1 14 per diluted share as noted in our earnings press release our exchangeable notes were considered dilutive for purposes of calculating net income ffo and affo for the fourth quarter and full year 2021 and for the fourth quarter of 2020 but not for the full year 2020 we wanted to continue to highlight this item especially as it makes an apples to apples comparison difficult between the full year 2021 and 2020 results as it relates to net income ffo and affo measures also during the fourth quarter we privately negotiated with certain holders of our exchangeable senior notes representing a little over 110 million in principal amount to induced the exchange of these notes pursuant to which we delivered shares to the note holders equal to the then current exchange rate under the indenture along with accrued but unpaid interest through the date of the exchange and a cash inducement fee equal to approximately 1 of the principal amount exchanged we wanted to take a bit of time to explain this inducement and our rationale exchange rate for exchangeable senior notes adjusts each quarter in part based on our current dividend rate versus the reference dividend rate of 0 35 which was the dividends in place when we initially issued these exchangeable notes in february 2019 meaning that on a quarterly basis the common stock dividend declared results in adjustments to the exchange rate increasing the number of shares that were required to issue to note holders on their eventual exchange by inducing the exchange now we re able to eliminate this additional expected dilution from future dividends as it pertains to the notes exchange which we believe is in the best interest of our long term stockholders in connection with this inducement we paid 1 2 million to be accrued and unpaid interest on these notes a 1 cash inducement fee noted above and transaction costs of 590 000 in addition to these cash payments we also recorded during the quarter a non cash loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately 2 4 million for the notes exchanged as noted in our press release in order to provide a meaningful comparison of our funds from operations between time periods so that investors can better compare our operational performance on an apples to apples basis we ve included normalized funds from operations which adds back to funds from operations transactions specific expenses which we exclude from funds from operations to provide investors a better understanding of ongoing operational performance as a result of adding back acquisition related expenses and the loss on inducement of our exchangeable senior notes normalized funds from operations was 46 1 million or 1 75 per diluted share for the fourth quarter adjusted funds from operations for the fourth quarter which adds back non cash stock based compensation and non cash interest expense related to our unsecured senior notes to normalized ff0 was approximately 48 6 million or 1 85 per diluted share total revenues for the full year 2021 grew 75 to approximately 205 million and adjusted funds from operations grew 78 for the same period to 175 million that growth as alan mentioned in his opening remarks was attributable to exceptional investment activity in 2020 and 2021 as well as the continued strength of our overall portfolio s performance on january 14 we paid our quarterly dividend of 1 50 per share to common stockholders of record as of december 31 equivalent to an annualized dividend of 6 per common share and a 21 increase from the prior year s fourth quarter as we noted in our prior press releases our board of directors generally evaluates adjustments to the level of our quarterly common stock dividends every six months with adjustments expected to be declared in q1 and q3 of each year the board continues to target a dividend payout ratio of 75 to 85 of affo on a stabilized portfolio basis we also continue to fund real estate improvements into many of our properties as offered an improvement allowances or construction development to our operators under our leases as we previously noted these improvements are critical to either redeveloping an existing facility to a cannabis facility or funding expansion to address growing markets announced in 2021 we ve capitalized costs of approximately 384 million and funded approximately 375 million relating to improvements in construction activity at our properties finally with almost 2 2 billion in total gross assets and a total of about 334 million in debt consisting solely of unsecured debt with no maturities this year or next year and 300 million of net debt not maturing until 2026 our debt to total growth assets ratio stood at 15 at year end we believe we continue to have one of the strongest balance sheets in the reit industry and with that i ll turn it back to alan alan alan gold executive chairman thanks catherine i d like to note the following in closing as we have highlighted we are thrilled with the quality of our tenant roster and the continued demonstrated strength and resilience of our tenant partners and their execution on our operations we are well positioned to continue to execute on our business providing non dilutive permanent growth capital to facilitate our tenant partners continued expansion as an important part of prudently managed capital structure the regulated cannabis space continues to be one of the fastest growing dynamic industries and we believe we are still in the early innings of its maturity especially as it pertains to continuing to transition illicit sales to the regulated market ramping existing program promoted by sensible state regulation and the launch of new program in many states as always i want to personally thank our stockholders for your continued support and entrusting us as stewards of your investment we have and will continue to do our very best in that role every day with that i d like to open it up for questions operator can you please open the call up for questions questions answers operator and the first question comes from tom catherwood with btig please go ahead tom catherwood btig analyst thank you and good morning everyone alan gold executive chairman good morning tom tom catherwood btig analyst you guys have talked in the past about the timeline of medical and adult use states of evolving and eventually becoming attractive opportunities for real estate investments with the recent legalizations in new mexico and mississippi and eventual rollouts programs in new york new jersey and maryland and delaware likely following behind which geographies do you think provide the most near term opportunities for you and which ones could provide growth kind of over the medium to longer term alan gold executive chairman well tom i think that s a really good question i m going to start with first off the cannabis industry continues to experience tremendous growth and is expected to double by 2025 i m going to turn it over to paul and perhaps ben to perhaps directly answer which states go ahead paul paul smithers president and chief executive officer yeah thanks alan so tom we look we love what s going on in new york and new jersey despite new jersey missing a timeline or obligation they had we re pretty confident they re going to get this thing together we are really happy what happened with new york opening up the medical conditions requirements i think until new york does rollout the rec program and i think the opening up the medical is a great sign so we love those states i think very strong with pennsylvania still very strong there michigan we re very interested in texas is one of the new states coming out with their medical program we think there s tremendous opportunity there so virginia of course so we re very very happy about what we re seeing in some of the states that have passed adult use programs what they re doing to try and move that timeline up we saw that with virginia they passed a bill to kick start their rec program sales in september of course that still may not get through the republican controlled house in virginia but those are great signs i think you re right we have talked about there is a transition time between medical and adult use but i think as the states become more mature they look at what other states have done and they look at maybe some legislative fixes we re confident that that timeline that it might be as much as you know 24 months to 36 months that s going to that s going to shorten because the states are getting it and they re understanding that the program needs to roll out they need the tax revenue they need the job so we like what we are seeing tom catherwood btig analyst got it appreciate that maybe if we look at the cannabis industry in general public operators are seeing their cost of capital increase especially at least on the equity side and at the same time investment opportunities seem to be accelerating we saw a similar pattern to this in late 2019 and operators turn more toward their real estate as a source of growth capital have you seen an increase in demand for sale leaseback opportunities given this kind of real recent market dislocation alan gold executive chairman i m going to turn it over to ben to really talk about our pipeline but i think you have identified a unique aspect of the industry is that as their ebb and flows in the in our tenants cost of capital the demand for our unique and specific capital does ebb and flow we ve seen obviously 2021 was a tremendous year or we did over 700 million acquisitions pretty fantastic and that yields that were we expected actually to be on average somewhat lower and they were actually somewhat higher so we think that in 2022 we have the same dynamics building especially with the most recent disruption to the geopolitical world but so now i m going to turn it over to ben to really go through our pipeline ben ben regin vice president of investments yeah sure exactly tom yeah we are certainly seeing those dynamics i think we ve always continued to believe that this is the most efficient non dilutive capital available in the industry and i think that is becomes even more pronounced as you see the fluctuations in the equity markets we ve seen as alan mentioned equity markets go up and down changes on the regulatory landscape or on the competitive landscape and have been able to consistently succeed on placing capital having our largest year ever by investment volume last year i think we continue to be uniquely positioned the strength of the balance sheet to capitalize on these opportunities as we see him pop up tom catherwood btig analyst appreciate that color that s really helpful as well kind of building off of that ben you ve all talked in the past about m a activity driving sale lease backs alan you mentioned it was a record year for those and cannabis in 2021 as you sit right now how much of your identified pipeline is more m a driven as compared to expansions of existing assets or construction of new facilities alan gold executive chairman i was going to say i don t think we have bifurcated our pipeline in that way i think the real exciting aspect of our program is that it provides for and allows companies to develop over time and know that they have the capital available to them when they work with us and i think that that will continue so i don t know ben do you have any further color as to kind of percentages ben regin vice president of investments yeah no i mean i think that s right i mean i think one of the strengths and the biggest benefits we provide is being able to offer creative and tailored real estate solutions to the groups we work with whether that s m a construction existing facilities so that will shift over time depending on the particular groups we re working with and industry dynamics but we re again we feel very well positioned to support the groups that we partner with whatever form that takes tom catherwood btig analyst understood and then the last one for me what headlines around record cannabis harvests in the western u s this fall and then how that put pressure on cannabis pricing your exposure is small in these markets i think it s less than 20 of your portfolio overall but can you talk a bit about whether kind of that cannabis pricing pressure impacted your tenants and maybe does the focus on indoor cultivation and maybe premium flour insulate your tenants from some of those pricing shocks that we read about and hear about in the news paul smithers president and chief executive officer yes this is paul i think that s exactly right we said at the end there is such a difference between as you know the outdoor grow product and the indoor grow product that our tenants to cultivate so when we see those headlines i think a lot of it is coming from outdoor grows in california oregon and washington which are really different of course from our tenants grow so we see those numbers we are not seeing an impact on sales or commodity pricing for the indoor product tom catherwood btig analyst appreciate that color that s it for me thanks everyone alan gold executive chairman thanks tom operator the next question comes from scott fortune with roth capital partners please go ahead scott fortune roth capital partners analyst good morning and thank you for the questions i want to dig in a little bit more on the pipeline and what you re seeing obviously we ve seen some delay in some of these new states coming on board and are pushing out and that puts a little bit pressure in near term especially for the msos but it seems like the msos has a little more competitive debt financing down 8 levels here and maybe not turning on to the real estate side as much and you re moving down to more of the single state operators how do you look at your pipeline in terms of evaluating it from your existing established top tier in the cells versus these new customers providing some of the growth going forward for you if you can kind of unpack that a little bit as a new channel especially alan gold executive chairman yeah i mean before i turn it over to ben really maybe to dig a little bit further deeper you know first you got to remember that real estate transactions in general are very lumpy and we had abandoned year closing a lot of transactions specifically closing a couple of transactions at the end of the year we think our pipeline is very strong we think we have continued demand from our existing msos and a continued demand from single state operators that wanna be multi state operators through a variety of paths including m a i think we continue to have great confidence in our ability to place between 125 million 150 million of transactions per quarter and i think that s a pace that we ve been very successful at for the last couple of years keeping in mind if you think if you back up and remember that we have a very unique offering we are only doing one type of product which is the sale leaseback transaction where we re looking for 15 to 20 year lease terms which allows us to have that you know weighted average lease length in excess of 16 years so i think that that s how i would think about or i would ask you to think about how our pipeline is going if ben you want to talk about the what debt yields and or paul you want to talk about the debt yields and how that might relate to our programs ben regin vice president of investments yeah sure this is ben thanks alan you know we are definitely seeing there s more debt in the industry i think that is a result of the strength of the operators and we feel we have over 90 of who we think of the top operators in the country are in our portfolio and their financial strength is such that they can command lower rates this only strengthens our existing portfolio that s not to say we re not going to continue to work with the top operators in the country and it gives evidence by closing on a deal with ascend wellness here in new jersey recently again we had our largest year last year by investment with the debt markets opening up we re going to continue to support our tenants leveraging our balance sheet and continue to grow the portfolios scott fortune roth capital partners analyst alan i appreciate the color and then a kind of follow up on that how is iip looking at the capital markets here weighing on the different opportunities from a capital raising or financing side of things in this rising rate environment i appreciate the color alan on the consistency that you are able to hit with your acquisitions on a quarterly basis 125 million 150 million looking at your cash level with the atm about 230 million line available kind of what s the commitment there and maybe the cash needs as you look out the different financing options going forward here alan gold executive chairman yeah i think we still have one of the strongest balance we have a very extremely strong balance sheet with less than 15 debt to total gross assets we have obviously access to the equity markets and we have a variety of other forms of capital debt sort of convertible debt straight equity issuances and even some recent interest from the preferred side of our preferred investors we are looking at all those options and we will certainly do what is the best for the company given how choppy the markets are how impacted they are by the geopolitical events that have gone on but our company continues to perform extremely well and we think we have tremendous access to capital as we before scott fortune roth capital partners analyst well then one quick follow up on price for catherine you re committed your short term cash needs and cashier that s committed for your acquisitions and ti going forward kind of what s leaving you as far as the balance for potential acquisition transactions going forward from a cash level cat hastings chief financial officer yeah scott so we have over 400 million of cash on the balance sheet and as you said about 300 million of that is earmarked for eventual tenant improvements and redevelopment at the projects but especially these large projects that we ve entered into over the last us several years sit on our balance sheet for an extended period of time so that allows us to be strategic on when we think we can raise capital we ve talked in the past that those projects typically take between nine and 12 months to fully request those reimbursements for us scott fortune roth capital partners analyst ok i appreciate all the color and i ll jump back in the queue thanks alan gold executive chairman thanks scott operator the next question comes from alexander goldfarb with piper sandler please go ahead alexander goldfarb piper sandler analyst hey good morning good morning out there cat maybe just sticking with that if i heard you correctly you guys have 400 million of cash but 300 million is earmarked so it sounds like capital market activity is definitely on the horizon you mentioned preferred there was also that debt offering that you guys were contemplating earlier this year so if you look at atm preferred unsecured bonds where do you see the best opportunity and how do you guys think about sort of the capital costs because obviously as the exchangeable notes played out there s the initial coupon and then there s the reality over time as things can happen as the exchangeable notes demonstrate paul smithers president and chief executive officer before i turn it over to cat the market is choppy we re going to we re navigating what i think is one of the unprecedented periods of time where a lot of things are changing and changing rather rapidly and we are looking at all our options moving forward we think our cost of capital still provide for very accretive transactions and so we re still excited about that opportunity i think the pullback that we ve seen in one field allows another an opportunity and another and i and also even with the convert which we sold equity at that time i think up 20 plus and so it was still an accretive transaction very accretive in a long period of time now for obviously accounting purposes the way it worked out because those investors made a fantastic bet and our share price certainly increased significantly there was a accounting dilutive impact to our to what we were doing keeping in mind so we keep all those options and we re looking at all those options as we make every move forward and make those capital decisions i don t know cat is there anything else you want to add to that cat hastings chief financial officer i mean that s exactly right and we are happy with all the options that we do have i mean looking at the balance sheet with only 15 debt to total growth assets we have a portfolio of strong cash flows and are growing our affo 78 year over year it gives us a lot of options both for equity and debt and we continue to be strategic as to when we want to raise additional capital alexander goldfarb piper sandler analyst ok and then the second question is alan you mentioned all the stuff going on in congress different ways that people are trying to either reintroduce the safe act or maybe full legalization and it s interesting because you look last year and it was schumer and booker that killed safe banking at the end of the year and the defense budget because they wanted to pass full legalization and obviously with everything that s going on that doesn t look as likely so in the current environment it actually seems like the ideal situation for you guys right meaning that no legalization no safe banking that makes your business model continue to be very attractive or is your view that with legalization or safe banking that you would see better opportunities i m just curious which you think is better for iipr the current situation or one in which you either have legalization or safe banking alan gold executive chairman that s an interesting question that it s a double edged sword i mean right now things are fantastic we have got great pricing power we are the only new york stock exchange traded reit with a balance sheet really super strong balance sheet that exists out there we are probably 10 20 maybe more times our nearest competitor and have the greatest opportunity to raise capital today as you know if something changes in the regulatory environment we still have the strongest balance sheet it s strong the greatest portfolio weighted average lease length in excess of 16 years a very great group of tenants and we would have then certainly i think greater access to even all sorts of different capital markets opportunity and be able to drive our cost of capital value in the moment so right now i think we re comfortable where it is it certainly has made it very much more difficult for our competitors to catch up or even compete with us on a long term basis alexander goldfarb piper sandler analyst ok thank you operator the next question comes from eric des lauriers with craig hallum capital please go ahead eric des lauriers craig hallum capital group analyst great thank you for taking my question so with more debt capital entering the space you mentioned you re going to look more closely at mso debt profiles you also brought on six new tenants in 2021 my question is as more capital comes online and naturally ways on tap rates would you guys prefer to be flexible on the lease terms in order to sort of preserve your mix of top msos or would you prefer to be a bit more flexible on the tenant mix in order to preserve your attractive lease terms thank you paul smithers president and chief executive officer another interesting question i mean yeah i mean i think that look we re agnostic as to really how much or how we generate great returns if we can generate great returns with a different tenant mix we are certainly going to go down that path if we can continue to generate great returns providing capital to our existing tenant mix we are going to do that and that s how we know we re looking at that we are looking look at it our job is to make money for our stakeholders and make as much as we can eric des lauriers craig hallum capital group analyst that makes sense thank you operator this concludes our question and answer session i ll turn the conference back over to alan for any closing remarks alan gold executive chairman thank you operator and thank you all for joining us today and certainly my one comment is to you know send prayers out to those that are in harm s way in today s geopolitical issues and for and thank our stakeholders and our team for the stakeholders for really sticking with us and for our team for all your continued hard work thank you

superiority over ukraine elsewhere russian ground forces moved into ukraine from the north south and east forcing many ukrainians to flee their homes as the sound of bombing reverberated moscow s

elites he called corrupt billionaires and banks he earlier said the g7 group of wealthy nations had agreed to impose devastating economic sanctions the eu moved to impose massive sanctions on russia s energy and finance sectors while french president emmanuel macron called putin to demand immediate halt to the offensive biden once again said additional us forces were not heading to eastern europe to fight in ukraine but would defend every inch of nato territory fall of chernobyl weeks of diplomacy failed to deter putin who massed over 150 000 troops on ukraine s borders in what the west said was europe s biggest military build up since world war ii the city declared an overnight curfew but said underground stations would remain open throughout to serve as bomb shelters zelensky called the attack on chernobyl a declaration of war on all of europe while 18 people were killed at a military base near the black sea port of odessa in the deadliest single strike reported by kyiv ukraine also

carried significant economic risk for the world but putin insisted he did not seek to undermine the global economic system demonstrations across europe in a televised address putin justified the assault as a defence of the self proclaimed donetsk and lugansk republics in eastern ukraine the kremlin earlier said the leaders of the two separatist territories had asked moscow for military help against kyiv after putin recognised their independence on monday a conflict between the separatists and government forces has dragged on since 2014 killing more than 14 000 people on both sides nato

and elacestrant will provide an update on abaloparatide and elacestrant progress and cole ikkala head of neuroscience business operations will finish up with a neuroscience update from there we ll open up the call for questions and i would now like to turn it over to kelly kelly martin president and chief executive officer thanks ethan welcome everybody to our call which is both q4 and full year 21 and some discussion on full year 22 obviously unusual giving an earnings call during a outbreak of a european war but we ll all do our jobs and hopefully everything winds up in the right place for all concerned as ethan said a few of the senior team of radius will be speaking today steve bob chhaya and cole they represent an outstanding leadership team for the company some of whom you ve heard from some of whom you ll hear from in the future it s part of the 2020 and 2021 remake of the company to move leaders into the right seats and to our recruit people and vastly improve the opportunity to create value for shareholders next slide in the release which was rather exhaustive there s a fairly long quote from myself some of you know me well some of you don t know me at all i rarely have quotes in there this is a doozy it s pretty long there s lots of things that we could talk about what i tried to do in the quote was frame out those things that are most important at least to me and my seat there s dozens of other relevant and important items to be aware of and for us to share over the course of the year from a progression of the company point of view as i say in my quote 2022 is absolutely a year to pivot the company the company went public in 2014 now i joined the company in the second quarter of 2020 we had a new chairman in the second quarter of 2020 and we ve added three new board members since the second quarter of 2020 from an approach and philosophy point of view as you can see on the slide number one return of capital elacestrant was a critically important asset for the company you ll hear more from chhaya shah later on it we did a transaction as many of you know with menarini we took all of the risk out of the future prospects of that molecule we also saved future spend of somewhere between 100 million and 150 million we re working exceptionally well with our partner menarini as and when that asset gets clarity from a regulatory point of view and then into the commercial arena we will return all of that capital of milestones and net milestones and royalties to shareholders and you ll hear more on that later i ve said dozens of times our goal is to go from cash burning to cash generating so that s an underpinning philosophically of how we run the business and how we will continue to run the business we have over the years accumulated 1 7 billion of nols the vast majority of those are federal nols some of those are state nols we will endeavor to crystallize those as i say we say in the release through either earnings or asset sales or some combination of those things some of us have a lot of experience with nols and we look forward to utilizing those and crystalizing the value to shareholders the tymlos business you ll hear from bob valentine a bit more the team that we have in charge of that product bob danielle and chhaya are outstanding in every way we have an outstanding understanding of all the pieces of this business it s a pretty complicated product but i am highly confident and very constructive on the 2022 and 23 and beyond opportunities in that business rad011 is something that we have not spoken a lot about you ll hear from cole ikkala around that molecule how we purchased it and what we ve been doing to strengthen the molecule from a quality point of view and as we said in the release as and when it s appropriate in a gating way we have plans to move forward and in particular plans to move forward in the seizure arena orphan epilepsy space which is one that the market seems to perceive as somewhere between very valuable and exceptionally valuable we manage the assets as a portfolio between balance sheet liabilities and cash assets be they commercial or financial from an elacestrant or clinical from a rad point of view last but not least particularly in this era talent and culture is the only way to really sustain yourselves in the world of both hybrid and virtualization having the right people in the right seats with the right culture is just paramount to any continued or intermediate term success and we are working exceptionally hard on that next slide here are some of the key 2022 objectives there are more as i said underneath all the different pieces of the puzzle financially our target for tymlos net revenue is specifically 232 million it s a modest uptick from where we ended 2021 and we did that deliberately frankly to emphasize the operating leverage within the company that with modest tymlos growth we could significantly change the operating p l of the company we also have learned over the years and we certainly learned last year that this is a very seasonal business so we re going to budget our business as 42 specifically for the first six months of the year in net revenue and 58 for the second half we will be roughly a breakeven company plus or minus from a net loss or net profit point of view lots of pieces of that puzzle you ll hear some from steve as far as look back in 21 and some discussion about 22 productivity is a very important piece of our puzzle as we manage the business i ll talk about that in a second but we have worked extremely hard to be more efficient we don t run the company on headcount but we run the company on how do we get the best people in the best seats and what do we need actually functionally or organizationally to move things forward and last but not least on the financial side we want to grow the cash flow and increase the margins we did significantly increase the abalo operating margin in 2021 despite the fact that our revenue our final revenue number was below our initial guidance but we significantly improved the margin of abaloparatide and we will continue to do that on the asset side it s it was a very busy 21 it will then be a busy 22 to follow up on that you ll hear a bit more from chhaya later abaloparatide the male indication output was outstanding from a statistical point of view that s a very important indication for this molecule and we plan on filing that snda in q1 of 22 elacestrant is on target with our partner menarini to file that nda in the second quarter of 22 more on that later from chhaya the patch the last time we had a conference call with people was in december about the patch we said there were three important things for the patch to move forward i fully understand it s been the investment thesis of many investors since 2017 and 18 to move forward we need clarity from the regulator and we re in the process of securing a meeting to have that discussion the second piece of the puzzle is to first fix the business construct that we have on the supply chain currently that business construct is mostly redacted as far as the details but for my seat the risk is asymmetric that radius has a preponderance of the risk in that supply chain it would have to be fixed in order for us to move that forward and thirdly we would need capital that s not radius capital we ve spent enough on the patch we think it s very interesting we think it s potentially strategically attractive but from our shareholder and stakeholder point of view we would need external capture in some project finance structure some of which some of us have dozens of years of experience doing those things from rad011 point of view you ll hear from cole liz messersmith is on a well deserved vacation and so we have cole pitching in he s not a clinician but he s in charge of gluing that business together and all the various pieces you ve heard us talk about prader willi in the past we had data from that when we purchased the asset for the first time we re going to talk about angelman syndrome and infantile spasms why that is particularly relevant is both of those are in the families of seizures and as you ll hear from cole there s a walk across from the botanical competitor in the seizure space and it s a validated both mechanism and target for us to pursue on the synthetic side of things before i turn it to steve i want to emphasize a couple of things a couple of additional things the adjusted ebitda in 2020 the company lost 54 million in 2021 the negative was 24 million our target this year our objective is plus 35 million to plus 45 million so that s a swing of from 2020 when i started and we got a new chairman and three new board members the swing is roughly 100 million the swing from 21 is 60 million to 70 million so we continue to make progress and are exceptionally focused on the p l the operating p l and the performance of the company secondly productivity in the commercial space has been a spectacular success 2020 the revenue per commercial employee was roughly 1 1 million 2021 it was 1 6 million as we had in the release and our objective for this year is 1 9 million the uptick year over year in productivity for commercial is about a 50 increase 21 versus objective and the uptick in productivity from 2020 is 70 to 75 so we re doing way more with less the salesforce we have is spectacularly talented i have even through covid met most of them the rbd team that we have is spectacular i have definitely met all of them and they have met me we have a new head of sales with danielle and i again couldn t be more pleased on the salesforce how they re focused and their ability to grow productivity and grow net revenue and you ll hear more from bob valentine who has to piece all this together from a business analytics product marketing point of view shortly second lastly in 2021 all in we burned about 3 million of cash there was many many things that we did we in licensed and purchased rad we refiled abalo for the eu we completed the mouse study we completed the infamous patch study we completed mostly the second source for abalo because we only had a single source we began to sort out the supply chain for rad011 and we had modest growth in rad so the operating infrastructure and the leverage we have is very significant and despite all those ins and outs we end the year with roughly the same amount of cash that we started from and i would say that bodes very well from an execution point of view and direction point of view for the company as we go into 2022 so with that you re probably sick of listening to me i will now turn it to steve helwig who s done a great job as our principal finance officer and now i ll turn it over to steve steve helwig principal finance and accounting officer thank you kelly first i ll speak to the 2021 financial highlights for fiscal year 2021 we had net product revenue of 219 million or an increase of 5 versus 2020 which was primarily driven by volume as kelly just noted we had ended the year with 112 million of cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet and we continue to make improvements with our commercial team that has led to increased productivity of 47 year on year last on a non gaap basis we improved our adjusted ebitda by 56 in 2021 versus 2020 driven by reductions in r d due to the completion of our three pivotal trials along with improved efficiencies and sg a on the next slide some q4 p l metrics in q4 we had a record quarter of net product revenue of 65 million excuse me versus 60 million in q4 2020 and this was a 9 increase again primarily driven by volume our r d expenses were 42 million compared to 36 million in q4 of 2020 this was a 14 increase that was primarily driven by the abaloparatide transdermal system and timing on elacestrant for sg a restructurings that took place in q2 of 2021 led to expense reductions of 6 million or 16 versus q4 of 2020 all of this led to a net loss of 15 6 million a 5 8 million or 27 improvement versus q4 of 2020 for the full year p l metrics as previously mentioned we ended the year with 219 million in net product revenue compared to 208 million in 2020 r d expenses were 135 million versus 160 million in 2020 down 25 million or 16 again due to our three pivotal studies coming to an end and with improved organizational efficiencies we continue to reduce sg a which came in at 131 million versus 144 million or a 9 reduction these driving factors resulted in a net loss of 70 million versus 109 million in 2020 which is a 39 million or 36 improvement year on year on the next slide some balance sheet metrics we came in as kelly had mentioned at the end of the year with 112 million of cash and cash equivalents nearly flat with 2020 and we just wanted to point out that our term loan can be refinanced without prepayment penalties beginning in march of 2022 the last slide we have some commercial productivity and you know kelly mentioned this earlier but in through some efficiencies that we ve continued to make over the years in 2021 we ended with 1 6 million per head per commercial head versus 1 1 million in 2020 which is a 47 improvement and with that i ll turn it over to bob for more of the commercial updates bob valentine head of business intelligence and digital thank you steve good morning everyone so i will provide an update on the tymlos commercial progress i would like to start with a look at the mechanics of how we are monitoring and tracking so you ll recall for 2021 we focused heavily on communicating about new patient starts indeed this metric is important to the tymlos business however new patient starts is one piece of a more involved assessment of the business a simplified version of which you re seeing on this page it includes patients that are discontinuing therapy the resultant active tymlos patients currently on therapy and of course the conversion of those patients to tymlos pen volume so as you can see for 2021 new patient enrollments improved by 14 over 2020 new patient starts improved by 11 and the average monthly active patient number increased by 4 these are all important numbers and together as an example indicates some room for improvement in conversion of patients to therapies so finally in summation the business grew 5 year over year on a net revenue basis and to reiterate we will still track new patients over time but we ll be we are monitoring and actioning on all of the levers that impact the business so looking ahead to 2022 we project 232 million in net revenue this growth we anticipate will be driven primarily by growth in unit volume and as kelly hinted at we anticipate the seasonality in the net revenues that we ve seen and observed in years past including in 2021 so 40 to 45 in the first half of the year and the balance in the back half of the year so turning our attention again to the levers of the business we anticipate continued growth in patient enrollments over what we saw in 2021 and to support this we focused the sales team s attention to current major prescribers to maintain and grow the business that we know is strong and then seek to find the new prescribers that we know are the right balance of endocrinologists rheumatologists and orthopedics we also have strong tailwinds from a promotion perspective from the boxed warning removal and the mechanism of action update in the label and both of those allow us to further differentiate tymlos in a positive way and give us significant momentum moving into 2022 so beyond driving enrollments we re also dedicating particular attention to the later stages of the patient journey specifically improving conversion of enrolled patients to receiving therapy and secondly ensuring those patients stay on therapy for as close to the recommended duration as possible so these efforts will help grow the tymlos active patients and increase the average pens per patient over time so together we expect these efforts to translate into a 6 growth in net revenue over 2021 so with that i ll hand it over to chhaya shah who will take over and discuss abaloparatide development chhaya shah senior vice president of abaloparatide and elacestrant thanks bob good morning everyone i ll walk us through the development and regulatory progress for abaloparatide as well as the update for tymlos labelling as we announced last year october 18th we had positive top line results for our male indication we re in the process of submitting an snda which is a 10 month review we ll do that in quarter 1 we also have been approved for an oral presentation at the aace meeting coming up in may where we will present further detailed data with transdermal program the patch program we announced last year that we didn t meet the noninferiority as compared to tymlos however the data for the bone mineral density the bmd increase was clinically meaningful due to the clinical benefit we have now requested a meeting with the fda to figure out a regulatory path forward as bob noted we ve made great strides with regards to enhancing our label and adding the mechanism of action correction in our label and now we can state that tymlos is an anabolic agent that helps build bone fda approved this update in 2021 after reviewing the excellent histomorphometry study that showed tymlos stimulate bone formulation in humans additionally fda approved the removal of boxed warning from our label this further clarifies our safety profile for tymlos as an anabolic agent so overall really good development and regulatory progress for our abalo product i will now turn talk about elacestrant as kelly mentioned earlier in the opening remarks we view elacestrant as a financial output a hundred percent of cash received will go directly to radius creditors and shareholders the mechanism of cash return is a debt paydown share buybacks and or dividends from a regulatory perspective based on the positive top line results for emerald trial where elacestrant was evaluated as the monotherapy versus standard care in metastatic breast cancer patients that are hr positive her2 negative we are progressing toward the u s nda submission in the second quarter of this year menarini will also be submitting e u submission also in the second quarter of this year our partner menarini group plans to also test elacestrant in early treatment lines including adjunct study as well as one or more combinations with elacestrant menarini is making great progress in phase 2 combination trial for metastatic breast cancer that has metastasized to the brain so all of this is really good lifecycle management programs that they ve got going on and we re certainly partnering with them it s truly a pleasure in partnership with menarini to be able to develop our first ever oral serd for metastatic breast cancer on the next page on the slide we re showing two illustrative monotherapy net revenue scenarios and associated cash to radius from the net royalty and milestone payments we assume a five year peak in this illustrative model loss of exclusivity is way out there in 2038 and peak sales that fall within range of our sell side analyst estimates so the key assumptions are noted here and as you see on the graph those are our cash to radius by 2038 illustratively other relevant facts that i want to point out here is the intellectual property on this slide we ve shown that we currently have three issued patents for elacestrant and they re listed here additionally we ve also framed out elacestrant opportunity and what it means to radius as part of the agreement with menarini we are eligible to receive 20 million in development and regulatory milestone payments and up to 300 million in sales milestone payments and a tiered net royalty up to 9 the royalties and sale milestones are based on global net sales of elacestrant and includes as i mentioned before the monotherapy the combination therapy that menarini is working on as well as any other potential therapeutic applications for elacestrant so all of that together that amounts to all the royalties and the sale milestones so with that i will now turn and hand it over to cole ikkala to cover neuroscience cole ikkala head of neuroscience business operations thank you chhaya starting on slide 17 and as a reminder in january of 2021 we acquired rad011 from modest terms from benuvia therapeutics a company formed to acquire the distressed cbd assets out of the insys therapeutics bankruptcy this opportunity was both identified and sourced by the radius team and over the course of a four month period an extensive diligence process was completed resulting in what we view as an opportunistic and disciplined transaction for several reasons it had the necessary data package to advance directly into orphan pivotal programs and with further data generation and success additional disease areas and disorders of interest importantly existing clinical proof of concept data is available in seizure reduction established by a botanical cbd asset epidiolex validating a path forward in other epilepsy syndromes and finally rad011 is differentiated as a synthetic cbd oral solution and among other things contains no thc or alcohol an important consideration for the pediatric neurodevelopmental disorders we are targeting since the acquisition the team has significantly enhanced the underlying asset quality detail which we will walk through on the next slide transitioning into slide 18 this slide highlights the extensive progress the team has made in standing up rad011 as a core asset for radius from a clinical perspective our team has done a tremendous job with input from global patient facing advocacy groups and key opinion leaders developing clinical protocols for three programs that kelly referenced a seamless phase 2 3 in prader willi syndrome with the primary goal of hyperphagia reduction a phase 3 in angelman syndrome with the primary goal of seizure reduction and a phase 3 in infantile spasms with the primary goal of spasm resolution we intend to share further detail around the respective disorders and pivotal programs during an upcoming r d day in the second quarter from a regulatory perspective we are actively pursuing protocol feedback and orphan designation from both the fda and ema to highlight a few key points we have recently received very constructive and thoughtful feedback from the fda on our pws protocol and this month also we re granted orphan drug designation in the u s for angelman syndrome two great milestones for the team and finally from an operational perspective and in order to support and execute these late stage clinical programs we have built a stellar team with neuro orphan and cannabinoid experience strengthened our global cbd oral liquid formulation patent estate and are building out our global supply chain to support both global clinical development and eventually commercialization with success and with an internal team of experts we have also identified and are engaged in opportunities for both therapeutic and global expansion moving on to slide 19 why are we pursuing seizures and why are we pursuing seizures in angelman syndrome in addition to the cbd clinical and commercial validation from epidiolex and the drive to address the high unmet need for a novel efficacious convenient and safe drug for these patients from a market value perspective there are a few recent data points highlighted on the screen on the left hand of the slide takeda s acquisition of the remaining 15 stake of soticlestat from ovid and ucb s recent acquisition of zogenix both of which tell us that a late stage rare epilepsy asset can possess significant value the underlying value of both of these in the 2 billion range to wrap it up and on slide 20 we have summarized our guiding clinical framework we have designed our two lead pivotal programs in prader willi and angelman with robust endpoints to generate valuable data across a range of symptomologies first focusing on the red pws circle on the left hand of the slide success with hyperphagia the primary endpoint of our pivotal study could inform advancement into other obesity disorders where hyperphagia is a prominent feature and moving to the angelman circle on the right hand of the slide seizure reduction the primary endpoint of the study has been clinically and commercially validated and success with angelman syndrome could lead to development in other rare genetic epilepsy syndromes or broader epilepsies then together the irritability behavioral sleep and other data we collected from these pivotal studies in a range of secondary and other endpoints and scales could inform the advancement into other neuropsychiatric or neurodevelopmental disorders highlighted in the center of the slide so we view the opportunity with rad011 as robust we will progress it in a gated fashion and we will continue to follow the data as we strategically advance the molecule with that i will turn it back over to kelly for any closing remarks and q a kelly martin president and chief executive officer thanks cole and thanks for everybody who contributed today from the radius team again you ll hear from others as we move forward just some concluding comments i wrote parts of my quote several some time ago didn t necessarily realize that my comments about the disruption and challenge in the sector and in the markets would be somewhat long lasting obviously the tape is very challenging in lots of different ways we think in particular in the biopharmaceutical biotech space there s incredible dislocation we tracked on any given day or week or month you know 100 or 200 companies that have some similarities to us and many many of those are trading either at or below cash or at two year lows or three year lows very few of them are cash flow positive so our objective here in positioning radius is as i articulated to generate cash to have long term cash flows and to provide in a prudent way and a gated way potentially some very interesting optionality on very late stage pivotal pipeline in a manner that allows us to continue to grow cash grow margin and strengthen the company so we look forward to sharing additional progress over the course of 22 and operator now we re happy to open it up for any questions that the analysts may have thank you questions answers operator our first question comes from corinne jenkins with goldman sachs your line is open corinne jenkins goldman sachs analyst hey good morning everyone maybe just to start i m curious as you ve recently updated the label both for the black box warning and the mechanism of action if there s any feedback you can highlight from the field in terms of the response you re getting as you promote to most with those updates bob valentine head of business intelligence and digital yeah sure hi corinne so we re in the process of you know updating all of our promotional assets to reflect the boxed warning as well as the mechanism of action but i can tell you that already we re hearing that the fact that the boxed warning has been removed is news good news that s getting our field in the door and the mechanism of action update has enabled us now to explicitly state as chhaya mentioned tymlos is an anabolic agent that helps form new bone that message is pretty powerful and simple and so it enables us to kind of really simplify the message and that s really helpful for our sales team and it s definitely a place we re going to be emphasizing in 22 corinne jenkins goldman sachs analyst that s helpful thanks and then maybe with respect to angelman syndrome and infantile spasms that you announced recently can you just provide a little bit more detail on what the specific preclinical or translational work you did to assess rad011 in these additional indications and maybe when we could expect to see or if you plan to provide publicly some of that work kelly martin president and chief executive officer i ll allow cole will comment shortly but i just want to emphasize corinne and thanks for the question that we will have a very extensive r d session in the second quarter because there s obviously been a tremendous amount of work done on the underlying science target mechanism and data but cole you want to comment on anything cole ikkala head of neuroscience business operations yeah sure thanks for the question so rupert haynes and jon foster really led a long and diligent process last year to identify these two seizure populations angelman syndrome is particularly attractive due to the prevalence the prevalence of seizures within the population and the similarity of these seizures to epidiolex s approved indications in lgs and dravet infantile spasms is a area that we have historical data on that we analyzed tore apart i spoke with many kols and believe we have designed a new study going forward that would be fairly attractive the angelman study which we ll share more detail on at the r d day is a phase 3 study which in summary will look a lot similar to previous studies performed by epidiolex and in infantile spasms similarly we ll share more detail later but two attractive indications that we spent a lot of time assessing kelly martin president and chief executive officer yeah and i would just reemphasize or emphasize that with the seizure cluster there is a tremendous amount of read across from epidiolex which we can utilize and we do utilize and have utilized pretty pretty aggressively and as cole said we ve had extensive discussions with the clinicians that specialize clearly in these areas and have gone through with them under cda all the various details the safety issues safety any safety data efficacy data and so we would be most interested and excited to lay out all the pieces of rad you know when we have our r d update corinne jenkins goldman sachs analyst thank you operator our next question comes from jessica fye with j p morgan your line is open unknown speaker j p morgan analyst hi this is nick on for jessica thanks for taking our questions first one when you talk about significantly improving tymlos margins in 2021 can you provide specifics about how you accomplish that and kind of maybe looking forward how do you see the total osteoporosis market in particular anabolic market growing over the next one or three years and if so what do you see driving that growth kelly martin president and chief executive officer well those are like three different zip code questions peter schwartzman who s our head of corporate finance he will go through the margin details for our product i can give you some comments on anabolics for what that s worth if we don t think as much but we will comment you know so peter schwartzman head of corporate finance thanks for the question so as kelly pointed out we ve substantially improved the footprint and the productivity of the salesforce as well as taking out costs that were unnecessary to both sales growth and development which enabled us if you look at our prior disclosures we re not going to comment today on the segments but we were able to almost entirely offset our change in guidance to the reported 2020 to achieve a segment earnings level that is about the same so we increased the margin several hundred basis points and we think that in 2022 we ll be able to expand that even further and at the ebitda line for tymlos we ll bring more dollars as sales grow to that line which will increase the company s operating flexibility kelly martin president and chief executive officer that s great and i don t know bob if you would like to comment on the anabolic or you want me to comment on the anabolic specifically you want me to bob valentine head of business intelligence and digital sure kelly martin president and chief executive officer so the anabolic market you know the way that s measured is it shows that you know forteo is somewhat declining we are marginally increasing in that small bucket you know versus forteo and we obviously look at the anabolic components of the space but we don t look at the market opportunity as what s an anabolic and what s not an anabolic we look at the opportunity as you know and there s these very large numbers that you ve all heard before you know 10 plus million osteoporosis patients which is interesting but what s really interesting for us is to focus on those patients with fractures of which is 1 million to 2 million just to highlight we just we will be filing the male indication we think the male indication is another growth area no pun intended and particularly if you look at some of the secondary endpoints of the male trial and the intersection with metabolic disease particularly diabetes another very interesting place to go so and i know historically the market kind of looked at anabolics market share forteo versus our product and that was the whole way to look at it i understand that i can appreciate that but i think that only a small way to look at the underlying opportunity the underlying opportunity is broader than just who is or is not on anabolic hopefully that roughly answers your question unknown speaker j p morgan analyst nope it does thanks so much kelly martin president and chief executive officer thank you operator our next question comes from greg harrison with bank of america your line is open mary kate davis bank of america merrill lynch analyst good morning this is mary kate on for greg thank you for taking our question maybe regarding elacestrant how does the increasingly competitive sort of development landscape impact your expectations for elacestrant moving forward kelly martin president and chief executive officer i can give you some comments and chhaya can kind of add whatever she would like the competitive information so far is mostly blinded and unknown there s lots of noise there s lots of articles there s lots of research but there s no data and so we don t really not to be flippant at all but we don t really have a view of how does elacestrant compare to the sanofi molecule or the ac molecule because we have some previous data but we don t have the pivotal data we or menarini don t have the pivotal data we work very closely with menarini we have been fortunate to listen into and have lots of discussions with clinicians who actually would be utilizing therapeutics i would only characterize those as very constructive vis a vis elacestrant and as the first oral serd as chhaya mentioned and this is monotherapy the data you know i think not to speak at all on behalf of menarini but i would understate that they think that the patient need and the commercial opportunity is rather significant with where we stand today but chhaya would you like to add anything chhaya shah senior vice president of abaloparatide and elacestrant just thanks kelly just to add that at the san antonio breast cancer dr bardia gave an excellent presentation on the serd and firs oral serd and i think we re focused on that versus worrying about our competitors and getting this to the market for our patients and it was well received by other physicians kols and i think that s what we continue to stay focused on like other data s blinded so we re right there and we re pushing forward to the nda submission peter schwartzman head of corporate finance we would also comment that the trials among the oral serds had somewhat different patient bases and are somewhat differently designed we re entirely focused on getting our molecule through the process into the hands of patients as soon as possible and over the course of time we ll see what the different serds are kelly martin president and chief executive officer and i would just lastly the slides that chhaya went through you know our own analysts of which we have some great ones some of those numbers 400 and 800 kind of back into what they that s a range of what they think there are other analysts who follow the broader space there s lots of other numbers net net you know breast cancer is one of the top three cancers unfortunately from a mortality point of view still today the intersection of genetics is even more important and as we outlined menarini has quite aggressive plans and activities underway for both combination adjuvant and other indications particularly potential metastasis into the brain so it s a powerful molecule and i think the application in the oncology setting is that s a story that will unfold and to be told over time from our point of view the return of the cash generation to us depending on what the full net revenue is over time is meaningful and possibly extremely significant mary kate davis bank of america merrill lynch analyst absolutely thank you operator our next question comes from jack padovano with stifel your line is open jack padovano stifel financial corp analyst hi this is jack calling in for annabel samimy thanks for taking our question i know you mentioned that rad011 is going to become a major upcoming focus in the pipeline but could you maybe offer any additional insight into whether you re looking to pursue any additional near term business development at this time and if so how will you balance that with your profitability and cash flow positive goals thanks kelly martin president and chief executive officer anything this is kelly thanks for the question jack anything that we do on the bd side whether that s incoming or outgoing or structure traits we will do nothing to change the cash flow generation the margin extension of the company i e anything that we do that s opportunistic would have to fit into the improvement the radical improvement of the p l over the last 18 months we re not going to slide back so as good companies would be and as you know i ve mentioned it because of the dislocation in the market there s dozens and multiple dozens and dozens of companies that don t have cash they can t fund their programs and they have no way forward that s unfortunate for them we re not sort of the lifeline to that but opportunistically if we can add something and continue to keep the growth in cash flow and improvement in p l and it makes sense strategically then we would think about it but i think that we have our hands fairly full as we sit here today between rad and abalo and all the pieces of abalo and the elacestrant piece and also the globalness of the abaloparatide asset which we ve been working on so i guess the overriding theme would be we re not going to do anything to change the amplitude and improvement of the operating cash flow of the company jack padovano stifel financial corp analyst thank you kelly martin president and chief executive officer you re welcome operator our next question comes from vikram purohit with morgan stanley your line is open gospel asonye morgan stanley analyst good morning this is gospel on for vikram purohit and thanks for taking our question my question is this for your 2022 u s tymlos sales guidance how much contribution if any is expected from the male osteoporosis population thank you kelly martin president and chief executive officer zero because we would launch it toward the very end of 22 at best so say december but right approximately chhaya shah senior vice president of abaloparatide and elacestrant 23 months kelly martin president and chief executive officer yeah so it s really 23 where you would start to look at male and as i indicated and chhaya and danielle and bob are working on the interest in male seems to be pretty interesting for us and reminding people of entities not approved for male obviously forteo and now we are and we have some interesting secondary endpoints and the black box warning you know removal is interesting so i think the male population is one that if you talk to docs which i have unfortunately males that have osteoporosis that suffer a fracture and this is a broad statement will tend to decline much faster and more severely than female so the ongoing therapeutic need for male osteoporotic patients with fractures is pretty high and that s fairly well known by treating physicians gospel asonye morgan stanley analyst all right thank you very much kelly martin president and chief executive officer you re welcome operator our next question comes from eun yang with jefferies your line is open unknown speaker j p morgan analyst hi this is on eun thank you for taking the question could you please talk a little bit about what pricing points would be reasonable for elacestrant based on the pfs data compared to you know faslodex of about 19 000 per year thank you very much kelly martin president and chief executive officer yeah that would be in the hands of menarini we and chhaya should comment we work with them on all the pieces but that s not that s since we sold them the asset that would clearly be in the intersection of their commercial strategy reimbursement team etc chhaya do you want to add anything to that chhaya shah senior vice president of abaloparatide and elacestrant yeah they re just working through those pieces and again like kelly said it s in the hands of menarini and they ve hired some good commercial folks as well as pricing folks to evaluate all of the market kelly martin president and chief executive officer i can add editorially that pricing is not something that we we collectively speaking again not for menarini but maybe representing a little bit of the thinking that pricing is something that we re not overly concerned about relative on a relative basis or an absolute basis unknown speaker j p morgan analyst got it thank you kelly martin president and chief executive officer you re welcome operator our next question comes from doug tsao with h c wainwright your line is open chris bialas h c wainwright analyst good morning everyone chris bialas here on for doug so two from us so you know that patient conversion and keeping them on therapy are the weaker links in the patient journey so how do you find and improve these and is there any update on the depot formulation and when can we expect an update or any potential human studies thank you bob valentine head of business intelligence and digital yeah thanks chris this is bob so one area of clarification as well is that at least we still believe that the sort of the lion s share of growth will emanate from sort of the top of the funnel and enrollments but there s definitely leverage to be found in those areas you mentioned conversion of patients to therapy and then duration of therapy so we re taking a very deep dive into the process by which we onboard patients and that they re treated during the onboard process it s very administrative so how can we streamline some of that work and make sure that sort of some of the administrative pieces don t get in the way of the patient with a script getting on therapy from the perspective of duration of therapy as well i d say this is maybe particularly more cross functional across the board from the way we message to physicians to the way we interact either we or our partners interact with patients while they re on therapy after their first time it s important to make sure that the patient understands the criticality of staying on therapy for the recommended duration that again the administrative issues do not get in the way of them refilling their pens and that they re sort of aware of the benefits of staying on therapy for longer periods of time so we re taking a very very detailed in depth look at all of this we re dedicating a lot of attention to it and we anticipate we ll be able to incrementally improve both of those items chhaya shah senior vice president of abaloparatide and elacestrant i ll take the depot question the second part of your question yeah great question it s one of our lifecycle management processes that we re working through by the end of the first quarter in the next month or in half or so we ll have a bit of from a lab and a scientific perspective a go no go decision on the depot formulation we re working with some fantastic scientists who are really experts in long acting peptide science and we re you know working through again that those pieces next step if it s a go will be the animal studies and then we ll progress through the future preclinical phases as we want to but everything looks you known as we wanted to for timeline and we ll get some go no go decisions in the next month month and a half chris bialas h c wainwright analyst awesome thank you very much chhaya shah senior vice president of abaloparatide and elacestrant yeah welcome operator there are no further questions i have to turn the call back over to kelly martin for any closing remarks kelly martin president and chief executive officer well thank you all very much for your questions give us an giving us an opportunity to explain a lot of progress from 21 and our main areas of focus for 22 i d just recognize the whole radius team top to bottom is doing a great job and in this market volatility which i m sure will extend now for some time we will continue to try to differentiate ourselves generate cash be exceptionally disciplined increase the margin and selectively advance our products whether it s abalo or elacestrant with menarini or rad so thank you very much for your time and i look forward to sharing more as the year progresses operator duration

glenn glenn sblendorio chief executive officer thanks kathy good morning everybody and thank you for joining our fourth quarter and year end conference call as we think about 2022 we continue to focus on execution as evidenced by gather2 our second phase iii clinical trial for zimura for the treatment of geographic atrophy or ga which continues to exceed our expectation with an injection fidelity rate well above our stated goal of greater than 90 at month 12 we look forward to sharing top line data in the second half of the year this will be approximately one year after the enrollment of the last patient in plus as you know the needed time to do the database lock and analysis which keith will speak to in a few moments if the 12 month results are positive we plan to file applications with the u s fda as well as the european medicines agency for marketing approval of zimura in ga as we get closer to reporting the gather2 data we continued our efforts internally to prepare for potential filing of a new drug application for zimura for the treatment of ga we continue to gain momentum in building out our medical affairs team led by dhaval desai our chief development officer and the commercial infrastructure led by chris simms our chief commercial officer these are two experienced and well seasons leaders with experience in working and launching retina drugs with blockbuster potential we continue to execute on our ip strategy for zimura earlier this month the u s patent and trademark office allowed claims for patent covered covering methods of use of zimura to treat ga the patent once issued is expected to expire in 2034 we re also excited to announce the results of a post hoc analysis that evaluated various ga growth parameters to explore the rate of disease progression within the regions in the fovea in a subset analysis of patients from gather1 which is our phase iii clinical trial for the treatment of zimura in ga these data were recently presented at this year s angiogenesis exudation and degeneration conference and pravin will provide more details on the analysis in a few moments and you ll see why we are quite excited by this new data as we think back over the past year we successfully achieved a number of major milestones that we believe have laid the groundwork for 2022 to be a banner year for us let me briefly recap some of the significant highlights first we received a written agreement from the u s fda under a special protocol assessment or spa for the overall design of gather2 the agreement further solidifies our plans to file an nda with the fda for marketing approval of zimura for ga if the ongoing gather to clinical trial meets its primary endpoint at 12 months as you know zimura met its primary efficacy endpoint at 12 months statistical significance in a previous completed gather1 pivotal trial in july we announced the completion of patient enrollment in gather2 this was four months ahead of our original schedule we also started the planning to initiate a phase iii clinical trial studying zimura in patients with intermediate amd in the second half of this year we continue to enroll patients in our star clinical trial this is our phase iib screening trial of zimura for treatment of autosomal recessive stargardt disease we also initiated a number of preclinical tolerability and pharmakinetic studies for ici 500 or htra1 inhibitor however we anticipate that the start of the ind enabled tox studies will be later than originally planned this is primarily due to the availability or lack of availability of study slots at contract research organizations in the wake of covid 19 pandemic we expect to submit an investigational new drug application for or an ind to the fda for ici 500 during the mid 2023 we also strengthened our balance sheet by raising approximately 108 million and 163 million in net proceeds from public offerings in july and october 2021 respectively dave will cover our cash and cash run rate later in the call we believe that these funds these capital raise enabled us to accelerate preparations for potential commercial launch of zimura and allow us to continue to invest in manufacturing capacity in addition we continue to invest additional money additional lifecycle initiatives for zimura in order to expand the patient population with additional indications such as the initiation of an intermediate amd trial and investing in multiple sustained release delivery technologies on the corporate front we re excited to welcome christine miller who is the president and chief executive officer of melinta therapeutics to our board of directors we re thrilled to have somebody of christine s caliber join our board christine s extensive background in commercialization and supply chain management will be a valuable addition to our board of directors we re also as kathy just mentioned excited to welcome tony gibney to our company he joined as chief business and strategy officer this past december tony s an experienced biotech executive and former investment banker and as you know is well known throughout our industry we look forward to tony s leadership and extensive experience in contributing to our future success i will ask tony to say a few words about our business development strategy later on in this call i d like to now turn the call over to keith keith westby chief operating officer thanks glenn and good morning everyone as glenn mentioned we completed patient enrollment in gather2 in july 2021 with 448 patients enrolled four months ahead of our original schedule based on this timeline we expect top line gather2 data to be available in the second half of 2022 approximately one year after the enrollment of the last patient plus the time needed for database lock and analysis we are actively working internally and with our third party vendors to prepare for the gather2 database lock a major priority for us is to continue to aggressively drive patient retention and therefore and thereby further de risk the gather2 clinical trial as glenn mentioned we are targeting patient retention for the gather2 trial as measured by injection fidelity rate through month 12 of greater than 90 injection fidelity is calculated by dividing the total number of actual injections by the total number of expected injections we consider injection fidelity to be the most important and stringent measure of patient retention because it reflects the timely administration of the drug or sham into the patient s eye as of today we continue to maintain an injection fidelity rate of well above our 12 month target of greater than 90 as a comparison the 12 month injection fidelity rate for our gather1 trial which showed a statistically significant reduction in ga progression at 12 months was 87 we continue to focus on injection fidelity not only to protect the integrity of the data but also to observe potentially observe the early and increasing treatment effect we previously observed in gather1 patient retention is clearly an integral part of the gather2 outcome to date we are excited to have reached a trial completion rate of 84 for year one the time point for the primary efficacy endpoint of the trial therefore it would only approximately 16 of year one visits remaining in gather2 we are encouraged to see that our efforts to maximize patient retention in gather2 have resulted in even greater patient retention than was observed in gather1 through the same time period to summarize gather2 has exceeded our expectations for patient recruitment patient retention and injection fidelity we continue to work with our investigators to provide a safe environment for patients which we believe increases the patient s comfort and confidence to continue to participate in the gather2 clinical trial as we discussed in the past we implemented a number of initiatives to reduce the risk and exposure to covid 19 for our patients and the staff treating them we have found that many principal investigators are enthusiastic and committed to participating in gather2 clinical trial we believe the positive gather1 12 month data further supported by the positive 18 month efficacy results and the safety profile that was maintained throughout the trial along with the early and increasing treatment effect observed in gather1 are key motivators for retention and gather2 in addition there are currently no therapies approved for ga in either the u s or the european union turning to stargardt disease patient enrollment in the star trial is ongoing with the goal of enrolling approximately 25 additional patients for a total of approximately 120 patients the results of this trial are expected after the top line results of gather2 thanks for your time and i will now turn the call over to pravin pravin dugel president thank you keith thank you all for joining the call this morning i hope that you are all well on our previous earnings call we discussed that part of the gather program in addition to evaluating the overall rate of ga growth we re going to be investigating through supportive analysis whether zimura has the potential to slow the progression of ga into the fovea thereby preserving central vision which would otherwise be lost in this relentlessly progressive blinding disease two weeks ago data from a post hoc analysis that evaluated various growth parameters to explore the rate of disease progression within various regions in this fovea in a subset of patients from the gather1 clinical trial were presented at the angiogenesis exudation and degeneration conference by dr glenn jaffe director of the duke reading center and chief of the retina division at the duke eye center and robert machemer professor of ophthalmology consistent with the overall results of gather1 in the new analysis a reduction in lesion growth in five standardized regions surrounding and including the central foveal area was observed for patients receiving zimura 2 milligrams as compared to patients receiving sham over a period of 18 months we believe the observed pattern of reduction in ga growth in the different regions is consistent with the natural history of the disease and recent clinical trial results in which complement inhibition has been observed to be associated with a greater reduction in ga growth in patients with non foveal ga which is known from the natural history to be faster progressing than fovea involving ga this analysis supports our expectation that we would see a greater reduction in growth away from the foveal center reflecting the circumferential growth pattern typical for ga patients ga has a major impact on functional vision which could alter the quality of life and independence of affected individuals we believe that the results from this exploratory analysis are another step in studying the potential of zimura to preserve central vision by slowing the progression of ga the significance of this data is that it has the potential to bridge anatomical results to functional outcomes in other words like preserving the central foveal the patient may have the opportunity to continue to drive read live independently etc for a longer period of time as compared to the natural history of the disease additionally by preserving the central fovea we believe we have the potential to show a visual acuity benefit over time it must be stressed however that this is an exploratory post hoc analysis that requires confirmatory prospective trials over time we anticipate performing a similar analysis of gather2 to further build upon these insights turning to earlier stages of amd based on our hypothesis regarding complement inhibition as a mechanism of action to treat amd in the previously announced results from a post hoc analysis from gather1 evaluating the progression of incomplete retinal pigment epithelium and outer retinal atrophy or irora to complete retinal pigment epithelium and outer retinal atrophy or crora and the progression of dreams into irora and crora in the zimura 2 milligram and sham control groups we plan to initiate a phase iii clinical trial studying zimura in patients with intermediate amd a stage prior to the occurrence of ga in the second half of 2022 we expect this intermediate amd trial to be an international randomized double masked sham controlled multi center trial with approximately 200 patients per treatment group we expect to treat and follow all patients for 24 months we plan to obtain feedback from regulatory authorities that will influence the ultimate design of this clinical trial and our development strategy in this indication before initiating this trial drusen is a hallmark of the onset and progression of amd we estimate that by 2039 there will be approximately 6 million individuals with drusen in the united states and 8 million individuals with drusen in the eu countries the population will look to enroll on the intermediate amd trial is a subset of the prevalent drusen population we have been exploring several lifecycle management initiatives for zimura with efforts focused on potential sustained release delivery technologies our goal is to drive a formulation of zimura with a sustained release delivery technology that reduces the frequency of intravitreal injections while maintaining comparable efficacy and safety to monthly injections we have been exploring and evaluating a number of potential sustained release delivery technologies including conducting feasibility studies with various technology providers and analyzing the resulting formulations containing zimura and the sustained release delivery technology if any of these technologies meet the performance thresholds that we have established we may pursue longer term development collaborations we are fully committed to delivering treatments for amd including earlier stages of the disease such as intermediate amd we believe we are well positioned to expand to zimura s indications build an amd franchise and subject to regulatory approval commercialize zimura for ga as the market leader thank you for your time i will now turn the call over to tony tony gibney chief business and strategy officer thank you pravin and good morning everyone it is truly a pleasure to be here with you this morning i m excited to join iveric bio and to work with glenn and others in the leadership team who i have known for many years as well as pravin dave and all my new colleagues i appreciate the opportunity to say a few words about our business development priorities and broader strategy we are continuing to explore all options for the future development and potential commercialization of zimura including potential collaborations outside of the u s i want to reiterate our plan to develop and commercialize zimura in the u s where we can leverage our retinal expertise particularly well as we continue the development of our product candidates and programs and prepare for the potential commercialization of zimura we will continue to pursue selective business development opportunities that advance us toward our long term strategic goal of becoming a dominant and sustainable leader in retinal diseases we plan to continue to evaluate on a selective and targeted basis opportunities to obtain rights to additional product candidates and technologies for retinal diseases as pravin just mentioned with a near term focus on sustained release delivery technologies for zimmerer thank you for your time this morning i look forward to connecting with all of you soon i will now turn the call over to dave dave carroll chief financial officer thank you tony and good morning everyone i d like to highlight a few items from our press release of this morning and provide some guidance are expected year end cash balance or expected cash runway for the quarter our net loss totaled 33 million or 0 29 per share compared to a net loss of 25 4 million or 0 27 per share for q4 2020 this increase in net loss was driven primarily by an increase in r d expenses associated with our zimura clinical programs increased manufacturing activities for zimura and increase in personnel costs including stock compensation associated with additional r d staffing for the full year our net loss totaled 114 5 million or 1 12 per share compared to a net loss of 84 5 million or 1 14 per share for 2020 again primarily due to an increase in r d expenses turning to our expected year end cash balance and cash runway we now expect our year end cash balance range between 215 million and 225 million we estimate that our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund our planned capital expenditures and operating expenses through at least mid 2024 these estimates are based on our current business plan which includes the continuation of our ongoing clinical development programs for zimura in ga and stargardt s and the initiation of intermediate amd clinical trial preparation for potential filing of an nda and maa for zimura continuing preparations for potential commercial launch of zimura investing in sustained release delivery technologies for zimura and the advancement of our ici 500 development program excluded from these estimates are any potential approval or sales milestones payable to the corporation or any potential expenses for the actual commercial launches of zimura including sales force expenses and any additional expenditures related to potentially studying zimura in indications outside of ga stargardt s and intermediate amd or resulting from the potential in licensing or acquisition of additional product candidates or technologies or any other associated loan that we may pursue i ll now turn the call back over to glenn thank you for your time glenn sblendorio chief executive officer thanks dave as we look ahead to 2022 we ll continue to focus on the execution of gather2 with the retention of patients and preparing for potential commercialization of zimura in the u s as our top priority we will continue our internal efforts to prepare for a potential filing of an nda for zimura for the treatment of ga if the gather2 results are positive we also look forward to initiating a phase iii with zimura intermediate amd trial and investing in additional lifecycle initiatives such as sustained release technologies for zimura i want to thank you all today for listening in and your continued support and we look forward to providing you with updates on our progress as we move along i will now turn the call over to the operator so we can open up the lines for questions keith i ll turn it to you questions answers operator and the first question comes from ken cacciatore with cowen and company ken cacciatore cowen and company analyst hey good morning team congratulations on all the progress your competitor s results really helped nicely confirm the impact on complement inhibition studying extra fovea lesions and obviously your post hoc analysis also focusing on your enrichment strategy really validates it so just wondering could you talk about the percentage of ga patients that have extra fovea lesions talk about how easy it is to diagnose i know once a product is approved i would imagine you can implement a strategy to really help educate clinicians on earlier diagnosis but i d like to hear about that and then maybe talk about that and then maybe talk about how the fda would handle a label here in terms of extra foveal versus foveal so that s question no 1 with a couple of parts and then just question number two you talked about the progress on looking for extended release formulations just like to hear a little bit more about the ease or maybe lack thereof of zimura in formulating into extended release kind of what are you seeing in the early work here and then maybe talk about would an implant be something that you d look at there seems to be some success right now moving forward with the tkis on an implant strategy so just a little bit more around the sustained release formulation work thanks so much glenn sblendorio chief executive officer well thanks ken and we ll work on question one which i think has three parts and we ll break it up among the team the first part is the amount of extra foveal patients in the total population of ga which we estimate to be about 1 5 million in the u s and of that about two thirds have extra foveal so i hope that helps with that the second question on early diagnosis and funding these patients pravin let me turn it over to you and maybe we ll tag team on the nda and for the extended release we ll maybe ask tony to comment so pravin on the diagnosis question pravin dugel president thank you glenn and ken thank you for your question the diagnosis part ken is really with a fundus examination essentially one can see these patients and see the geographic atrophy with a routine fundus evaluation now you can also see it very clearly with an autofluorescence and this is a diagnosis that s really will be made not just by retina specialists but by general ophthalmologists as well as optometrists and that s where most of the extra foveal patients currently reside there s a referral bias as you can imagine for retinal specialists because they re usually referred the most severe patients so that means foveal involving however the ones that you re referring to the extra foveal is really the vast majority of the patients and these currently reside with general ophthalmologists and optometrists and our expectation is that once there s a therapy for these patients these patients will be referred to retinal specialists as was the case for wet macular degeneration now it s important to state that these patients really do suffer from a loss of visual function although their visual acuity may be 20 20 they may not be able to see a straight line they may not be able to finish reading a sentence or finish reading an excel table because of a blind spot so these patients we would imagine would be younger in the workforce and therefore much more desperate and much more compliant as well in regards to the other questions glenn i ll turn them back to you i m happy to answer as you direct glenn sblendorio chief executive officer thank you pravin let s go we ll come back to your nda question ken i just want to get clarification on exactly what you re looking for but tony a couple of words about extended release and the early work that we re doing there and the type of technologies that may be applicable here tony gibney chief business and strategy officer sure happy to glenn so we re looking at a number of technologies and really they re across the spectrum of available technologies for our back of the eye diseases some of which are quite late stage and validated and some that are really more emerging technologies and i have to say i think that the zimura given that it s an after mark rather stable seems to be rather conducive to a number of the technologies but not every technology and so as we look at the feasibility we are looking at implant technologies we re looking at microparticles we re looking at others and as we continue to gauge the feasibility really our targeted goal is to truly move forward those that are most amenable to zimura and meet our targeted goals for for sustained delivery in a way that really doesn t compromise patient care but it really continues the benefits that we re seeing with zimura in its current formulation so stay tuned ken cacciatore cowen and company analyst great and my question was on the label obviously there seems to be impacts on all areas of the foveal and extra foveal but just wondering how do you think the agency will handle the label given the patient enrichment for gather1 and 2 glenn sblendorio chief executive officer yeah so ken firstly i think we need to obviously see the data from from gather2 before we talk about label strategy but i ll let pravin answer that because i think we have some thoughts on how we position our data with the agency pravin pravin dugel president thank you glenn and ken thanks again i must say from the very start that we haven t had any formal labeling discussions with the fda obviously it would be premature to do so what i will tell you is that our expectation is that the label will be broad now it doesn t mean that complement inhibition doesn t work in patients with foveal affecting lesions it s just that the delta given the natural history would be we would be less and that s exactly what we see in our studies and in our competitor s studies as well so the one thing that i would take home from this is that we certainly de risk gather2 by picking the proper patient population now again our expectation is that if we re able to slow down a faster growing geographic atrophy safely there s no reason that we wouldn t be allowed to treat patients with a slower growing geographic atrophy having met a much higher bar of scrutiny i think the fda completely understands how important it is for patients with foveal affecting geographic atrophy to have some area in the perifoveal area survive their patients that i remember i used to treat that had lesions in the perifoveal area with eccentric fixation and they would use that area to stop from bumping into furniture or stop their hands from getting burned in a hot stove that s terribly important is difficult to measure but it s terribly important and we feel that the fda will recognize that and allow a broad label ken cacciatore cowen and company analyst great thanks team real exciting time for the company congratulations on the progress i ll go back in the queue glenn sblendorio chief executive officer thanks ken operator thank you and the next question comes from mike ulz mike with morgan stanley mike ulz morgan stanley analyst hey guys thanks for taking the questions just quickly on gather2 in terms of the injection fidelity rate you re obviously tracking above your goal of 90 and that s exceeding your expectations but i m just curious more recently if you ve seen a break in the trend there at all due to omicron glenn sblendorio chief executive officer yeah mike thanks for the question and i think one of the reasons we wanted to reinforce our progress today is that omicron does present complications but i think we were able to knock on wood manage through that so that s why we wanted to give the numbers both on injection fidelity running well ahead of our projected guidance and also a key point that keith raised today is where we are in the injection progess which was 84 so i think the protections we put in early on for both patients and healthcare workers as it related to the pandemic i think have continued to pay off and in fact keith s team put a little bit extra diligence as omicron started to hit its peak to be sure that patients were managed patients got to the visit a lot of prep work and then a lot of follow up work so that was the reason we we talked about injection fidelity today because we feel we re in real good shape mike ulz morgan stanley analyst yeah got it that s helpful and then maybe just a follow up on the intermediate amd study that you re going to start in the second half you gave us some sense at a high level of how you re thinking about the design but you re also planning to meet with the fda prior to starting the study so just curious what are the areas you re looking for feedback from the fda is it end points is it enrollment criteria or any color you can provide there thanks glenn sblendorio chief executive officer great great question mike and pravin you want to take that one in terms of the design pravin dugel president sure and good morning mike and thank you for the questions first of all i want to say if you just look at the biology of this disease if complement inhibition works in extra foveal geographic atrophy you can be quite confident that it will work in earlier stages because that s where complement is even more active which is intermediate amd what the fda has stated publicly is to say look this is a major problem and there is a major advantage to not only slowing down the death of photoreceptor cells but preventing it altogether so we re extraordinarily fortunate to have a very very collaborative and consistent fda and the purpose of our meetings is that really nobody s done this study before so the answer to your question mike yes all of the above we intend to sit with them and say look here are the parameters that we know from working with the community as we are and we have with the groups like the group and the star group and say look here are the parameters that we know are predictive of geographic atrophy and this is what we would like to study and these are the patients that we d like to enroll and that s the discussion we intend to have again the fda is extraordinarily collaborative and we believe that whatever feedback they give us will greatly influence the design and the development of this trial mike ulz morgan stanley analyst got it thank you operator and the next question comes tiago fauth with credit suisse tiago fauth credit suisse analyst hey thanks for taking the question and congrats on the progress so far so just to go back to a point you ve mentioned on gather2 being relatively de risked based on patient selection so again you haven t seen notes fully replicating their findings in philly and maybe baseline characteristics could have played a role there so can you just kind of recap kind of the factors that make you confident that gather2 will actually replicate gather1 findings and why you can expect a potentially different outcome than what you saw for your competitor and a quick follow up you guys alluded to some new ip that you have can you just recap the current portfolio of intellectual property and also any outstanding financial obligations based on potential approval and launch sorry multipart question there but that s it glenn sblendorio chief executive officer yeah no problem tiago i think we have three questions first on the gather2 and how we re feeling about the de risking i think there s a few things to cover and i ll let pravin add to my commentary one we have an unusual situation that we have one of two phase iii trials done so we have the benefit of the gather1 and we also have the benefit of the which and the 12 month data was the primary endpoint but also in gather1 we had the benefit of the 18 month data to see what happened in the six months after and as you know we continue to see a separation of the curves as to another factor did you pick the right patients we always believed that we did and then with our competitor s data with their subset analysis of extra foveal lesions showing quite similar numbers in terms of efficacy we felt that that s a further de risking on the recruitment and the reason we put the concept of injection fidelity and obviously to keep the integrity of the study you want high retention rates and we thought the best way to measure that was through injection fidelity that s why we created that concept and we continue to update that and the fact that we re running well ahead of our guidance and we re well into the 80 range demonstrates that these these patients are coming back and also going back to gather1 we had a terrific trial and data to show those patients that we finished the phase iii trial so i hope that created some momentum and i think our investigators did talk to their patients about that so for all the above and i ll let pravin add some additional commentary on that we feel that we ve seen a number of signs that are encouraging as we get to the end of gather2 pravin pravin dugel president thank you glenn and tiago good morning and thank you for the question well let me just divide my answer into two different parts the first part would be the consistency and validity of gather1 the second part would be how we de risk gather2 and both are really important questions so if you go back and look at gather1 and now that there s more data coming from our competitors and others you will see is this remarkable consistency in terms of the efficacy profile and in terms of the safety profile so in terms of the efficacy profile you ll see an immediate separation with the delta getting bigger and bigger with every visit and that s true in the 2 milligram dose that s true in the 4 milligram dose that s true whether it s a square root transformation analysis or a non square root transformation analysis and that s actually even true in all the retrospective studies we ve done so that kind of consistency should give us a great deal of confidence in the robustness of the data and it s the same thing that you see on the safety side as well i mean you see a superior safety profile and you see a dose dependent response so with everything in gather1 what i would tell you is that the confidence that we get is from the absolutely remarkable consistency of the data which is in line with the science now the second part is how have we de risk gather2 the most important answer is really by having gather1 as glenn said it s really unusual in fact i don t recall a time in my 30 year career doing clinical trials where i ve ever recruited for the second part of the phase iii study with the first phase iii study already being so overwhelmingly positive but the other ways that we recruit we ve de risked gather2 is by picking the proper patient population and we did this for several reasons but the important one here is the biologic one which is that is when complement is most active in geographic atrophy in the earlier stages and clearly that was confirmed by our competitor s results the second is that we have a mixed random effects model that is particularly stringent and validated by the fda as you recall we ve got a spa agreement where all of the trial has been looked at including our mixed random effects model and thirdly and what we are doing right now and keith and evelyn harrison and dhaval desai and their group are doing so well is to have that injection fidelity at a number that s just unheard of which is above 90 and that s despite having no vaccine having delta having omicron our guidance hasn t changed so we believe we re doing everything that can possibly be done to de risk gather2 in the face of an overwhelmingly positive and consistent results for gather1 glenn sblendorio chief executive officer thanks pravin and tiago to your second question around the patent i think it s one of our multi pronged strategy that we ve laid out in for life cycle of this product so this is a pattern that covers methods of using zimura and once issued it is expected to expire in 2034 i think it s under the umbrella of life cycle tony spoke a little bit about the initiatives for extended delivery obviously strengthening the ip portfolio is part of that and we ll look to continue to find ways to extend this franchise so we were happy to report today on that patent which is just one step in a number of things that we re working on the third question tiago was related to financial obligations and i m going to ask dave to cover that dave carroll chief financial officer sure thanks tiago thanks for the question and let me just open up with it s a really great deal for us there s no royalties on zimura whatsoever first off and then the total payments really just the first indication is in the 20 million to 25 million range it s 23 5 million something like that this will all be in our 10 k and actually in last year s 10 k also and then no royalties and those milestones just related to clinical and regulatory milestones that s it glenn sblendorio chief executive officer thanks tiago tiago fauth credit suisse analyst appreciate all the color that s it operator and the next question comes from annabel samimy from stifel annabel samimy stifel financial corp analyst hi thanks for taking my questions i had a couple here so i guess there s been some question about patient motivation to or physician motivation to treat is high patient motivation to continue to treat chronically i would say at late stages of disease where they re starting to see functional issues is likely high but i m just a little bit curious in the intermediate stages of disease to what extent are these patients compromised functionally and i know you re it s you re motivated to try to treat these patients as early as possible in the disease but i guess i m trying to understand the patient motivation to treat earlier in disease and maybe you can just talk about that in terms of where you think the most likely treatment will be even if you have meaningful data on the intermediate population and i guess the second question i have is on the 84 completion that you ve talked about are all these patients expected to move into that 18 month portion of the trial and if so or if it s an option and to what extent have these patients have those 84 also moved into the 18 month portion of the trial thanks glenn sblendorio chief executive officer ok thanks annabel so two questions there and i ll have pravin answer the first question because as a in a prior life as a treating physician i guess there s nobody better to talk about patients and patient s motivation on this disease and on the completion rate i ll have keith answer that including what happens to these patients at the end of their 12 months what happens in year two so keith will lay that out for you so pravin let me turn it over to you first pravin dugel president great annabel good morning and thank you for your question let me just divide the answer into two different parts the ga part as well as the intermediate amd and there s a there s really a fallacy out there that with geographic atrophy this is a disease that occurs in far older patients and the disease progresses extremely slowly we simply know that that is not true we know that is a disease that occurs as early as the patients in their 50s and 60s and always starts extra foveal always progresses circumferentially fairly rapidly and i use that word rapidly deliberately if you look at great natural history studies that have been done by genentech roche you ll see that that movement of geographic atrophy occurs in a matter of months not years we re talking about four to six months or so another way of looking at this is that there was a recent article that looked at the entire u k database that was authored the senior author was usha chakravarthy that showed that patients with geographic atrophy end up losing a driving vision 60 or so lose driving vision in 1 6 years which is just really stunning and about three years 40 or so have their central fovea completely obliterated so this is truly a relentlessly progressing blinding disease and these patients again that we re targeting are the whole gamut of patients with early disease as well as late disease you can imagine that these are patients who may be in their 50s and 60s that may not be able to see a straight line and functioning as an architect or an engineer or may not be able to read finish reading a sentence and are functioning as an attorney or an accountant these are people that have 20 20 vision but are visually completely dysfunctional and we believe that they will be very motivated when there s a treatment available to slow down the progression of this disease and again those patients are not necessarily all with retina specialists at this point they are with optometrists and general ophthalmologists but once there is a treatment available we believe those patients will be referred rapidly to the retina specialist and we ve seen this in wet macular degeneration as well now switching to intermediate macular degeneration typically these patients can be identified as early as in their 30s and 40s and you re exactly right a lot of them in the very early stages are not symptomatic in the later stages of intermediate amd they are symptomatic when the same kind of reasoning that i mentioned where they may be able to have visual dysfunction because of not seeing straight line what we call metamorphopsia or scotomas or blind spots and currently with the version one of zimura we feel that there are enough patients with intermediate amd where that impact will be made to prevent progression to a blinding disease which is geographic atrophy and that will be very important for the earlier stages our life cycle management of the more that tony referred to as terribly important we believe that if we can have a sustained deliberate type strategy where patients have to come in to the retina specialist maybe once every six months or once every year that will be quite acceptable to prevent them from having to suffer through geographic atrophy i hope i ve answered your question thanks for the question annabel samimy stifel financial corp analyst yeah thank you keith westby chief operating officer thanks annabel this is keith for your question on the 84 completion just a couple of things so you re correct 84 of completion of year one gather2 is designed as a two year study so as these patients complete year one they re rolled into year two of this study just important to note the design so as patients receive monthly injections that are on the 2 milligram zimura arm in year one at the 12 month time point here we randomize to either continue to receive monthly injections of zimura 2 milligram or every other month the sham patients continue on sham hope that helps to answer your question annabel samimy stifel financial corp analyst ok yes and all of them have been rerandomized all the 84 that have completed have been randomized keith westby chief operating officer that s correct that s correct as the patients come off it they go into year two annabel samimy stifel financial corp analyst ok ok great thank you glenn sblendorio chief executive officer thanks annabel operator thank you and this concludes the question and answer session and i would like to turn the call for the management for any closing comments glenn sblendorio chief executive officer well thank you keith for moderating today and i want to thank everybody for joining and

western capitals have started putting in place fresh restrictions on russia s sovereign debt as they seek to ratchet up pressure on moscow over the conflict with ukraine the united states and its allies introduced an initial round of sanctions after russian president vladimir putin recognised two breakaway regions in eastern ukraine on monday a string of harsher measures is expected after he launched a full scale invasion on thursday access to russian bonds had become increasingly restricted u s sanctions imposed following the 2014 annexation of crimea made future russian dollar denominated debt ineligible for many investors and key indexes in april 2021 u s president joe biden barred u s investors from buying new russian rouble bonds over accusations of moscow meddling in the u s election here is an overview of what measures have already been added and what impact they might have what are the new restrictions on sovereign debt washington announced a ban on u s entities participating in secondary markets for both rouble and non rouble debt issued by russia s central bank the national wealth fund and the finance ministry after march 1 the european union agreed new sanctions that will target the ability of moscow to access the bloc s capital and financial markets as well as services and ban eu investors from trading in russian state bonds canada s government said it would bar its citizens from engaging in purchases of russia s sovereign debt britain said on wednesday it would stop russia selling sovereign debt in london one of the world s major financial centres for such transactions the measures would require additional legislation according to western officials and clearing transactions would also be affected however there was no indication on whether britain would stop trade in outstanding sovereign debt the coordinated measures are aiming to curb russia s ability to raise new foreign financing and plug some loopholes despite the limitations in the united states russia had been able to issue bonds in european markets analysts at jpmorgan calculate that russia has issued a combined 3 5 billion in euro denominated bonds since 2020 implications for investors analysts see limited implications for holders of existing hard currency bonds they however predicted the new u s sanctions on local sovereign bonds so called ofzs would lead to the creation of two different classes of ofzs in response to the u s curbs on local sovereign bonds the finance ministry said it would offer only new series of ofzs starting from feb 22 and stop tapping issues registered before this date to lower risks of forced selling of circulating state securities by particular categories of foreign investors jpmorgan said that bonds which had been sold since mid june had a 10 25 bps premium over existing issues though this divergence faded likely due to bonds being added to the most widely used emerging fixed income benchmark however premia may be more persistent this time given that new ofzs will not be index eligible said nicolaie alexandru chidesciuc at jpmorgan as long as local banks can freely transact with foreigners the basis between the two curves should remain relatively narrow within 20 30bp what does this mean for capital flows latest data shows that russia has just under 40 billion in dollar and euro denominated bonds outstanding with just over half held by foreign investors positioning in those bonds by foreign investors looked light and the most underweight in two decades according to a jpmorgan emerging market client survey meanwhile foreign investors held around 18 or 2 8 trillion roubles 34 4 billion of overall outstanding ofzs according to ing the new u s sanctions are not expected to trigger forced selling in ofzs however capital flows have shown investors ditched the bonds as tensions over ukraine have escalated since late last year russia is now experiencing the fifth consecutive month of foreign portfolio outflows from ofz said chris turner global head of markets at ing in october january it totalled 5 4 billion and since the beginning of february some 1 1 billion were withdrawn russia currently has a weight of 6 8 in jpmorgan s local sovereign debt benchmark though given the u s measures would see no new issues added while existing ones would mature the weighting was expected to shrink to below 5 in just over three years the bank projected jpmorgan which runs some of the most widely used hard and local currency fixed income indexes jpmegdr jgegdcm in emerging markets said on wednesday it was reviewing the impact the new u s curbs may have on its emerging market benchmarks source reuters reporting by karin strohecker editing by emelia sithole matarise
after months of seemingly endless preparations biden s and the west s worst fears finally came true on thursday after russian forces launched their long feared attack on ukraine brushing off international condemnation and the first tranche of sanctions from the u s and its allies russian president vladimir putin declared the beginning of a special military operation aimed at the demilitarization of ukraine russian forces have reportedly fired missiles at military control centers in kyiv with ukrainian foreign minister dmytro kuleba saying via twitter on thursday that putin had launched a full scale invasion of the country some commentators are drawing parallels between russian aggression against ukraine to hitler s invasion of poland in august 1939 in what is shaping up to be europe s biggest crisis since wwii russia s invasion of ukraine represents one of the continent s worst security crises in decades and is expected to have far reaching implications for the global economy particularly given russia s unique position as europe s pre eminent energy supplier crude oil and gas prices are surging as russia strikes major cities in ukraine hitting levels not seen since 2014 brent futures co1 com nysearca bno jumped 8 early on thursday to trade above 105 per barrel at one point while wti futures cl1 com nysearca uso rallied by a similar margin and even hit 100 per barrel at one point the markets have been bracing for this kind of outcome given that russia is the world s no 3 exporter of oil and its no 2 exporter of natural gas russia produces 10 of the world s oil and is the biggest european natural gas supplier this is a triple hit to the global economy with a toxic combination of higher inflation lower economic growth and greater uncertainty the only silver lining is growth is strong a buffer to any slowdown and policymakers and investors already prepared for high inflation etoro strategist ben laidler writes laidler says supply disruption risks are low noting that russia reliably supplied the west through the cold war still he has predicted high for longer commodity prices with current oil risk premium only the latest driver to a structurally very tight market but not everybody is that sanguine while western governments probably will exempt energy transactions from sanctions the blizzard of new restrictions will force many traders to be exceedingly cautious in handling russian barrels gas transiting ukraine will likely be disrupted affecting supplies to several central and eastern european countries and raising gas prices in europe analysts at political risk consultancy eurasia group have told cnbc turning off the gas taps the million dollar question here is what would happen if russia does the unthinkable and completely turns off gas supplies to europe after all for several months russia has been repeatedly accused of intentionally disrupting gas supplies to leverage its role as a major energy supplier to europe amid an escalating dispute with ukraine two months ago european natural gas prices hit record highs after a pipeline that brings russian gas to germany switched flows to the east westward gas flows through the 2 607 mile long yamal europe pipeline one of the major routes for russian gas to europe have gradually declined a move the kremlin says has no political implications western politicians contend that russia has been using its natural gas as a weapon in the political tussle tied to ukraine as well as delays in the certification of another controversial pipeline nord stream 2 russia has of course denied any connection with state owned gazprom gzpfy saying it has fulfilled its contractual obligations to customers that has not stopped many energy analysts from being deeply concerned about the risk of a full supply disruption to the eu which receives roughly 40 of its gas via russian pipelines several of which run through ukraine indeed russia is in a better position than ever to pull off such a diabolical move according to david frum of the atlantic and author of trumpocalypse restoring american democracy 2020 russia s ukraine invasion has been greatly aided by high energy prices especially natural gas in the ongoing energy boom frum notes that the price of russian gas on spot markets surpassed 10 per million metric btus in june 2021 before tripling to the current 30 per million metric btus the sharp rise in energy prices has helped russia s foreign exchange reserves hit 630 billion or 42 of the country s 1 5 trillion gdp with those massive financial resources russia could inflict real havoc on world energy markets if it chooses to with the natural gas markets likely to be the hardest hit because gas is harder to substitute in theory russian pipeline gas could be partly replaced by liquid natural gas from the united states qatar or other suppliers unfortunately ramping up lng production and shipment is very difficult to do in a hurry according to kateryna filippenko principal analyst for europe gas research at wood mackenzie were all gas flows to stop today europe could well muddle through in the short term given higher storage inventories and low summer demand but in the event of prolonged disruption gas inventory couldn t be rebuilt through the summer we d be facing a catastrophic situation of gas storage being close to zero for next winter prices would be sky high industries would need to shut down inflation would spiral the european energy crisis could very well trigger a global recession troy vincent senior market analyst at researcher dtn markets concurs with filippenko s view and has told cnbc that there are simply no alternatives to russian volumes of oil and gas that do not entail far higher prices and potentially the development of severe shortages putin is of course well aware of this and could use oil and gas as an ace in moscow s hand in the unfolding drama russian market selloff advertisement

i botched my first interview with chris fuchs fuchs is a physicist at the university of massachusetts boston and the leading proponent of qbism one of the newest and most controversial of quantum theory s many interpretations it goes something like this quantum mechanics the theory physicists use to predict the behavior of elementary particles like electrons and photons that make up matter and light doesn t actually pertain to particles but rather to the beliefs about them of whoever is using the theory and if several people are using it at the same time then qbism says that each of them is entitled not only to their own beliefs but to their own facts it was august 2020 and fuchs and i were talking over zoom he was slumped in a stuffed armchair sporting wire rimmed glasses and pandemic long hair he d insisted i educate myself about qbism before talking to me and had sent me 17 links to articles interviews and videos now he was regaling me with an anecdote filled story of his career when i blurted out the question that had been bugging me all along which was essentially how the hell could that be right if our theories don t mirror an underlying reality in what sense can they supply explanations fuchs like me is in his mid 50s and has a boyishly rounded face my blunder was immediately obvious in the way that face melted before my eyes like wax under heat in an instant he transformed from raconteur to lecturer put up a picture of a complicated laboratory setup and began grilling me about it do two guys who walk in and casually glance at this experiment agree what the experiment is doing he asked the lecture concluded with a theorem sketched on a whiteboard i was kicking myself the whole time not just because i d scotched my plan to get to know fuchs better before wrangling over qbism but because i couldn t follow his argument anyway despite my background in physics including a ph d actually my education was part of the problem as was the reason i went into physics in the first place i was a tough case in elementary school an intelligent and curious but also emotional and impulsive adhd kid with a home life roiled by conflict and the confusion of stories that didn t add up being class clown was my greatest ambition until a teacher discovered that i d finished a math workbook in a weekend that was supposed to take a year that led to me finding myself in the back of an algebra class in a panic as a teacher tapped equations on the board and i was baffled by the letters what the heck is x i suffered in silence until the epiphany finally came x is a number just one you don t know yet euphoria plus the sensation of having opened a door to a place containing many more doors leading to many more ideas beyond x that palace of ideas with its numbers and symbols and geometric shapes soon became a playground as well as a refuge a place where all my why questions had answers and where things made sense in a way that didn t apply to the rest of my life i was later drawn to physics for its promise that the palace was real and that hidden somewhere inside it was one grand equation that like the god i d dismissed for being too magical could ultimately explain everything qbist in chief chris fuchs explains a problem to a colleague in his office at the university of massachusetts boston in 2019 photo by bob durling by the time i spoke with fuchs i was less wide eyed about physics graduate school will do that to you but the palace was still my happy place i d internalized a lesson that emotions are dangerous and developed an aversion to conflict and a craving for certainty that translated to my keeping a certain distance from people marriage for example had long been a bridge too far and i doubted my ability to change in part because a world that s ultimately nothing but particles conforming to the laws of physics appeared to make free will a delusion at the same time i could see there was a problem with the idea that physics can explain the world because of the way quantum theory describes particles with probabilities rather than properties we tend to think that the sizes shapes and locations of physical objects are explained by the locations of their constituent particles quantum theory however doesn t attribute such properties to particles describing them instead in terms of the probabilities that they will appear to have locations if and when they are observed and yet what observed means and what happens during an observation to make properties materialize out of quantum theory s murk of possibilities and into the solid shapes that objects have in our everyday experience are questions that the theory doesn t address physicists call this gap in quantum theory s account of explanation the measurement problem a host of interpretations of quantum theory offer an assortment of stories purporting to solve the measurement problem but i wasn t satisfied with any of them qbism s tale is the latest in a tradition that denies that quantum theory directly describes reality and yet to hear fuchs tell it still offers the possibility of getting some grasp on what reality really is the world is not made of six flavors of quarks he d written it is a world in which even dreams and ambitions have substance that sort of woo raised a red flag in my materialistic mind as did fuchs habit of saying that qbism s take on quantum mechanics makes life worth living still it was clear that qbism was worth taking seriously as it had been by a raft of recent physics papers including one in nature physics titled facts are relative so as unsettling as i found such ideas i was determined to get on fuchs good side and to learn how to think like a qbist myself a few weeks after my talk with fuchs high on a stony adirondack peak my heart pounding with nerves i got down on one knee looked up at my girlfriend martina s freckled face and asked her to marry me a few days later i shared the story by email with fuchs not something i d usually do but he d sent me photos from his own wedding 25 years before on ghost ranch in new mexico former home of painter georgia o keeffe he d fallen in love with kiki in a week and overcome with emotion had proposed six months later with a cigar band for a ring despite a promise to himself that he d wait at least a year i noted the contrast with my own proposal made after the 30 odd years of bachelorhood it took me to get used to the idea the two plus years of dating that was my rule and a grueling 4 mile hike up a mountain for good measure i blurted out the question that had been bugging me all along how the hell could that be right i d recovered from our first interview by talking to fuchs a second time and keeping my focus on getting to know him personally once he was convinced that my interest in qbism was genuine he began inundating me with emails links and reading lists including four books by and about william james whose philosophy was apparently important sprinkled into my qbism correspondence course came all manner of personal anecdotes and photos of 20 something fuchs in swim trunks on a beach of his backyard smoker and the glistening meats he d made with it of him proudly holding up a giant weed he d pulled from his yard i have no internal filter he told me still not all of the deluge was amicable fuchs read an article i d written for the new york times magazine and objected to my labeling the views of atomic physicists niels bohr and werner heisenberg anti realist he referred to that word as that damned misnomer and said my comment calling those views a dead end had nothing to do with the historical record i figured my comments stung because if qbism is fuchs baby the closest thing to its grandfather is bohr bohr won the nobel prize in physics in 1922 for devising a model of atoms in which electrons are confined to one of a discrete set of orbits around the atom s nucleus an idea that defied both the laws of physics at the time as well as common sense since it required electrons to jump between orbits but to never be between orbits nonetheless the model accounted for observed phenomena like the colors of light emitted and absorbed by hydrogen gas and in 1925 heisenberg conceived quantum theory by coming up with equations that predicted not only bohr s results but other atomic phenomena as well the strange thing was that heisenberg s handiwork was pure mathematical manipulation his equations only referred to observable quantities like light frequencies and avoided any description of electron behavior that could explain why those frequencies were what they were meanwhile erwin schrödinger developed his own version of the theory that by treating electrons as waves he hoped would reveal the workings inside the black box that heisenberg had made but the mathematical object that schrödinger called the wave function now often called the quantum state didn t describe physical waves in the way he d hoped instead it became the standard device physicists use to summarize the theory s probabilities albert einstein whose belief that physics can and should describe the world s inner workings had always inspired me figured the theory was simply incomplete but bohr and heisenberg argued that the lesson of these developments was that physics describes something else the laws of nature which we formulate mathematically in quantum theory deal no longer with the particles themselves wrote heisenberg but with our knowledge of the elementary particles knowledge meant the information encoded in the quantum state for example the probability that a given atom will appear at a particular location when it s observed bohr proposed an explanation for why physics must give its account of reality from such a remove we must never forget he wrote that we ourselves are both actors and spectators in the drama of existence bohr s point was that our observations change and to some degree create the world we observe an idea supported by the way quantum theory implies that the observer of an object and the object itself necessarily become to use schrödinger s word entangled what s observed is not the object per se but instead a kind of mash up of the object the observer and all the choices made in the method of observation bohr called these mash ups things like the colors of light emitted and absorbed by hydrogen phenomena and concluded that quantum theory tells us that physics rather than describing the world as it is must describe such phenomena or as he also put it the human experience of the world many seemingly paradoxical behaviors of subatomic particles such as those that appear in a classic case of quantum inexplicability called the double slit experiment can be demystified with this perspective in the double slit particles such as electrons are fired at a screen with two holes in it and the mystery is how they sometimes exhibit interference effects as if they were spread out waves and yet in other circumstances act like point like particles to this day there are physicists who argue that einstein was right that quantum theory is incomplete and that so called hidden variables meaning particle properties not appearing in quantum mechanics are necessary to explain this behavior but bohr believed the apparent contradictions of quantum phenomena result from attempts to picture the world as it is apart from observation when that s something we just can t do a corollary was that concepts like particle wave and which slit an electron passed through are not realities but rather what bohr called abstractions ideas devised to describe phenomena in terms of observer and observed when that distinction doesn t actually exist in which case an electron is neither particle nor wave it just is what it is or rather what it does when we interact with it and despite how nonsensical it sounds there is simply no fact of the matter of which slit an electron passed through unless that passing was observed such was bohr s radical reimagining of physics and yet fuchs argues bohr wasn t radical enough qbukis in fuchs speak are weekly meetings fuchs has with his research group nowadays on zoom i attended my first in october 2020 fuchs was slouched in his chair his pandemic hairdo now two months longer than when i d last seen him during the period of random banter that qbukis invariably start with fuchs brought up a favorite wings song let me roll it and played it for the group as the crosstalk subsided fuchs asked jacques pienaar a young postdoc working with him from brazil to take over and lead a discussion about a recent paper by a group of physicists who support a rival interpretation to qbism the central question was how to deal with wigner s friend everyone s heard of schrödinger s cat the thought experiment in which a cat is locked in a box with a quantum device having a 50 50 chance of releasing a poisonous gas the point of confusion is that quantum theory s quantum state characterizes the cat as a superposition of the two possible outcomes dead or alive while popular culture gets a lot of mileage out of imagining what it means for the cat to be in such a superposition the theory doesn t actually speak to that question and bohr would remind us that that s because physics must restrict itself to describing human experience in this case what the observer sees when he or she opens the box and looks schrödinger published this scenario in 1935 oddly it took a quarter of a century and another nobel laureate to ask what in retrospect seems like an obvious question if physics is about human experience why not put a person in the box that s what hungarian physicist eugene wigner did calling the imaginary person his friend being a friend wigner switched out the poison for a device with a light which we can imagine comes on either red or green the result of wigner s analysis is that the friend in the box sees for example green and believes the quantum state should reflect that result while wigner in the same position as the observer of schrödinger s cat believes the state to be a 50 50 superposition of the two colors wigner s state is analogous to that in the double slit experiment and indicates by bohr style reasoning that there is no fact of the matter about the light s color the conclusion is that while wigner s friend knows the green light is a fact wigner with equal justification knows it isn t this result highlights a troubling gap in bohr s and heisenberg s contention that quantum theory is about human knowledge and experience namely the answers to the questions whose knowledge and whose experience everything seems super stable and then you realize it s not fucking stable the facts are relative paper in nature physics written by physicist caslav brukner focuses on a variation of wigner s friend and argues that quantum theory s capacity for contradictions runs deep enough to imply that facts are indeed relative to the observer much as space and time were found to be by einstein this is a more bizarre conclusion than even bohr and heisenberg seem to have anticipated but in a way it s not new the many worlds interpretation of quantum theory for example claims that every possible outcome of every physical interaction happens that the universe is constantly cleaving to accommodate all the resulting contradictory facts and that in the case of wigner s friend both the device with the light and the friend divide into two and then proceed to live separate lives with different facts red vs green in distinct branches of a vast and ever growing multiverse the qbists panned their rivals paper marcus appleby a longtime collaborator of fuchs reclined on a sofa in sydney declared it incoherent blake stacey a physicist like fuchs at university of massachusetts boston was frustrated by the paper s assumption that two physicists can communicate perfectly about experimental outcomes listening to the qbists eviscerate what would otherwise seem to me a passable paper made me feel as though i d happened upon a more advanced civilization of aliens maybe to whom premises that most physicists take for granted are deemed antiquated and naïve it was fuchs who delivered the qbist coup de grace the authors he said don t even worry about what the hell probability means as i logged out of the meeting that comment struck me as capturing the defining observation of qbism quantum mechanics describes everything with probabilities so what probability means is central to what the theory is about the problem is that philosophers and mathematicians have been debating that since long before quantum theory and as bertrand russell said nobody has the slightest idea what it means holding court at a 2016 enrico fermi summer school on quantum physics held at varenna on lake como in italy chris fuchs center white shirt gives an impromptu talk photo by aephraim steinberg probability like love beauty and good taste resists objective definition that s easy to see in situations like a coin toss where newton s laws assure us that no real randomness is involved and that a person armed with a video camera and an appropriately programmed computer could potentially predict the outcome far more competently than a more casual observer who assigns a 50 percent probability to heads but even in the quantum case where the indeterminacy is intrinsic there is no escaping the fact that the probabilities a person assigns are to some degree subjective depending on their experience knowledge preferences and even their personality there s always that guy who thinks he knows more than he does qbism s core tenet is that probabilities are completely subjective the personal beliefs of whoever is assigning them constrained only by the rules of probability theory such as one which says that each must be valued between zero and one this interpretation of probabilities is called personalist bayesian the q in qbism stands for quantum and the b for bayesian or at least it did until fuchs ditched that connection and made qbism its own brand like kfc it like fuchs marriage got its start in the mid 1990s when he was a graduate student at the university of new mexico in albuquerque studying under physicist carlton caves and determined to get to the bottom of quantum theory it was caves and particularly his postdoc ruediger schack who won fuchs over to the personalist bayesian perspective and qbism grew out of a collaboration between the three qbism s account of quantum theory s meaning follows from its core tenet if the quantum state of an atom for example is considered to describe the atom then quantum theory which is basically a bunch of rules for how states evolve amounts to a system for predicting what the atom might do but with probabilities construed as beliefs the quantum state becomes beliefs too and the entire theory transmogrifies into a whole other animal the state of the atom then describes the theory s user specifically their beliefs about what they may experience by probing the atom and the theory s rules then govern those beliefs informing the user about how to optimize them fuchs calls quantum theory a law of thought and a system for making better decisions in light of the world you re in this viewpoint resolves the contradictions in wigner s friend wigner s and his friend s states differ because they represent different users beliefs about their potentially different future experiences qed it s almost too easy the way qbism quashes quantum conundrums and it took a while for its implications to sink in one day in the depths of a pandemic winter spent holed up in a house in the woods with my new fiancé i looked out the window and saw a titmouse hopping around in the snow i realized with a shock that the qbists would say that what i was calling a titmouse was not actually a thing in the world and that this was the key to their solution to the measurement problem an observation says qbism is simply a human experience like the one i was having looking out the window as for how such observations make facts like the titmouse s location and other properties emerge from the quantum murk qbism says that those properties are not objective facts but rather beliefs i ve conceived to account for my experience similar to bohr s abstractions but now personal to me i suddenly appreciated why in qbism there is no divide between the intangible quantum world and the concrete everyday one everything in my everyday world from hopping titmice to my iphone has the same diaphanous character as a quantum state all of it being part of one big web of beliefs weaved by my mind to explain my experiences fuchs philosophical hero william james had said as much several decades before quantum mechanics as part of a theory of knowledge called pragmatism he and other pragmatists in the wake of darwin the civil war and a proliferation of scientific theories in the 19th century whose conceptions of reality did not necessarily jibe concluded that our ideas theories and beliefs couldn t possibly mirror an underlying reality while at the same time not questioning such a reality s existence instead they argued that our ideas are derived from our experiences that they are tools that we construct to navigate the world and that their truth can only be judged by how well they do so as i read the references fuchs had provided i found myself sympathetic to these arguments even if the experience was sometimes painful to james i was a tender minded rationalist whose dreams of finding the foundation of reality in the palace of ideas was perverse abstraction worship ouch still if quantum theory is as qbism says all about beliefs that leaves an awfully big hole in physics where reality used to be einstein felt the same about bohr s take on quantum theory which is why he once asked a colleague if he really believed that the moon isn t there if no one s observing it of course would remain if there was no one about but the word moon and the sentence it s embedded in would cease to have meaning fuchs wrote in response to the question at a physics conference in 2021 reality need not be sentence shaped and i tend to think quantum theory indicates it is not which was fuchs way of saying about the moon what i d realized about the titmouse he d call either a bundle of expectations just as he had a wine glass in one qbuki saying if it s a wine glass then it should break if i drop it if it s a wine glass then it should hold liquid and so on but as for whatever object or reality there may be behind our experience of the moon or the titmouse well we might as well call it because we have no words for things behind beyond or in any other way outside of our experience qbism s core tenet implies that quantum theory describes the reality we construct in our minds the one of titmice and the moon rather than some objective state of affairs in the world james and bohr argued that this reality derives from our experiences and wigner s friend shows as one qbist paper put it that this reality differs from one agent to another qbists sometimes summarize all this by saying that a god s eye view of reality doesn t exist as much as i appreciated the efficiency with which qbism dispensed with the measurement problem i still struggled with it there sure seem to be objective facts in the physical world there is the fact that if i leave my laptop on my desk at night it will still be there in the morning there is the fact that if i call martina down to my office she ll confirm its location not to mention all the facts about matter light and the world in general that physicists look to quantum theory to explain from the periodic table to the blue color of a clear sky if qbism was right and what i and everyone else calls the physical world amounts only to subjective beliefs how do we explain such facts illustration by sam chivers it was a friday afternoon in march and this time there were 12 people on the qbuki zoom call besides me fuchs in a gray hoodie and his usual chair his qbist collaborators and a few qbissels people like me who were intrigued by qbism but not yet convinced fuchs inbox had gotten so clogged with emails from me trying to understand qbism s explanation of physical facts that he finally suggested that i run a qbuki myself and put my questions to the group i d been struggling with the dichotomy of how small things like electrons in the double slit behave in ways that defy description in terms of them having properties meaning facts about them that are independent of how they re observed while big things like wine glasses are describable in terms of facts like size and shape the common sense idea that the facts about a thing reduce to those of its parts must somehow break down but still do we really have to reject the idea that the bundle of expectations that is the wine glass is derivable or at least closely related to the bundle of expectations of the atoms that make up the glass i asked very often bob fuchs responded sounding like a teacher whose patience is being tried by a slow student it feels like you re still always putting the little guys down as the more basic things and the bigger guys down as the more derived things the reason i think of atoms as more fundamental than the glass i explained is that they re presumably simpler right this prompted a barrage of rebuttals from the group the simple seeming single colors that comprise white light someone pointed out require the philosophically complex concept of infinity for their definition even elementary particles are per quantum theory infinitely complicated another said before i could assess the damage done to my point fuchs changed the subject bob often brings up the stability of the world he said referring to the kinds of dependable regularities i wanted explained from the way my laptop stays put at night to the repeatability of scientific experiments fuchs mentioned the hollywood movies he d seen in which a happy family in a car gets hit by a truck he brought up 18th century philosopher david hume s argument that no matter how many times the sun has risen in the past we can t be sure it will in the future the sun always rises until it doesn t he said you can count on family stability until you can t hollywood car crashes i didn t see his point but again before i could respond physicist qbissel and pienaar s wife gabriela barreto lemos chimed in to say that it was extremely hot where they were in rio that their air conditioning worked until it didn t and that she s been noticing recently how everything is changing all of the time it s amazing she said because when you start doing that your whole world is like boosh she mimed an explosion with her hands everything seems super stable and then you realize it s not fucking stable i m not stable you re not stable my computer s definitely not stable the air conditioning is not stable nothing is i love it shouted fuchs so did everyone else a round robin of testimonials to the world s inherent instability ensued from qbists and qbissels alike buddhism and alfred north whitehead were cited in support i was disoriented but also sympathetic things with martina had been getting more strained living together through a pandemic had taken its toll i d even started to question whether marriage made sense gabi is right nothing is stable listening to the qbists eviscerate a paper was like i happened upon a more advanced civilization of aliens it was five o clock about the time fuchs usually started making noises about his imminent cocktail i could have used one myself but the qbists were on a roll and i sensed that fuchs wanted to finish me off what was your next question bob he said i took a breath and steered the discussion to hydrogen the simplest of the elements and the one whose frequencies bohr and heisenberg contended with back in the day i said i wanted to understand why if those frequencies are not objective facts about the world do we all agree about what they are there s something to be explained there i said because what does it mean to be subjective it means that different people can have different opinions right i m just slowly losing it fuchs responded maybe this is why i ve never answered you in email we agree when we agree and we don t when we don t i can t imagine that there is some precondition in the universe that says we must agree about anything anything whatsoever then the answer is just outside of qbism i said it s out of scope that s fine a few objections were lobbed at me in response but fuchs and i stayed out of it fuchs then brought the meeting to a close bob you have been thought provoking he said what i felt like i d been was pummeled it took several more qbukis numerous one on ones with the qbists and quite a bit of time for me to finally wriggle free from the ruts of my old ways of thinking and to realize that to a qbist a wine glass is not made of atoms once things are reconceived as bundles of expectations big ones aren t made of smaller ones since beliefs don t work that way atoms become instead an aspect of wine glasses rather than their constituents meaning a concept that encapsulates some of our expectations about them such as how they will look under an electron microscope that realization led to another that was even more startling to me than my encounter with the titmouse that to a qbist physical things are more than just atoms i also appreciated that the point of fuchs car crashes was that all the so called facts about the world that we glean from observing it are strictly speaking beliefs since future experiences could reveal them to be false no sensible scientist would disagree and an irony that i was just starting to perceive about qbism was that its most radical claim is not so much that our facts and ideas are subjective in this way but that it has identified in quantum theory a single one that is not but there was still one big nut i hadn t cracked the one that had set fuchs off at the end of the meeting the question of why people agree about physical facts if those facts don t exist objectively sure part of the answer is that as members of the same species we respond to similar stimuli in similar ways but that still begs the question of what the sources of those stimuli are because despite hollywood s car crashes and barreto lemos s faulty air conditioning the world does have stable features including the existence of my laptop the characteristic colors of hydrogen gas and all the other physical phenomena that people with working senses do agree about and that at least to my way of thinking quantum theory was originally developed to explain i mean that s what science is about right explaining things finding truth over the summer i spoke to several specialists who confirmed that i was not alone in my frustration jean bricmont is a retired professor of physics at the catholic university of louvain in belgium his books include making sense of quantum mechanics and quantum sense and nonsense bricmont wants to ask the qbists he told me what is your belief about they re subjective beliefs ok but about what he didn t buy my suggestion that qbism was an improvement over bohr because it solves wigner s friend it s an improvement only insofar as it reveals the absurdity he said it s pure idealism oxford philosopher christopher timpson has thought deeply and written much about qbism although he remains relatively sympathetic to it he still considers its lack of explanation of physical facts a potential killer blow if you want as very plausibly one should want a thicker notion of explanation which stands independent from merely what we expect he said then the qbists can t deliver it unless they make some clever new developments i was particularly eager to hear from carlton caves fuchs old research advisor and collaborator whose input had been crucial to qbism s early development i knew from fuchs that he d ultimately lost his enthusiasm for it why i wondered i look out my window and there s an oak tree there caves told me i expect other people to look out my window and tell me there s an oak tree there and there s nothing in qbism that would suggest there s any reason to think that that would be true caves had worked with fuchs and schack for more than a decade and considers them both incredibly deep thinkers he called their collaboration the first golden age of his career but in the end the implications of probabilities being beliefs led to a place that was he said not where i want to be ruediger schack the third of qbism s co founders was still a believer he s a professor of mathematics at royal holloway university of london he has a deep voice and an economy of speech that leads caves to call him mr terseness to fuchs mr prolixity when i told schack that timpson called qbism s lack of explanation of physical facts a killer blow his response was in effect an indifferent yawn qbism can predict that the color of ruby is red schack said and that he said is all the explanation i need i understood why caves called him mr terseness but it was schack s equanimity above all that helped me put the final piece of the qbism puzzle in place it convinced me that schack s own craving for explanation had been satisfied to be able to predict he was saying is to have an explanation not one that s necessarily simple enough to be summed up in a few sentences but one that resides nonetheless in all the knowledge and know how that went into the prediction william james and his fellow pragmatists would i believe have agreed after all if our ideas and theories don t mirror an underlying reality in what sense can they supply explanations truth in our ideas james wrote means their power to work rationalists like me crave mechanistic explanations a ruby is red because the electrons in its atoms move in a specific way and anyone looking out caves window will see an oak tree for similar reasons but when atoms are considered concepts as opposed to constituents of rubies mechanistic explanations no longer apply it s a stock rationalist trick james wrote to treat concepts we invent to explain phenomena we observe we could claim james said that a man digests and sleeps well because he is healthy but healthy is just a word coined to describe someone who digests and sleeps well so that claim is no explanation at all qbists believe that quantum theory validates james conceptions of truth and explanation because attempts at mechanistic explanations for quantum phenomena like the double slit lead to paradoxes such as electrons being both particles and waves i soon found myself applying such pragmatic thinking to day to day life including my disagreements with martina what was the point i thought of all the why questions i was always asking her and myself why is it so hard to put things back the way they were why am i so bothered that she doesn t what i really needed and what were so often right in front of me were answers to how and yet i couldn t feel satisfied with the notion that knowing how is as good as knowing why in physics for the same reason that bricmont dismisses qbism out of hand and that i once called bohr s ideas a dead end it seems to imply that physics ends at human experience and can t speak to the nature of reality beyond that fuchs disagrees it was a steamy morning in july of 2021 in that hopeful period post vaccines but before delta fuchs was sitting in a white adirondack chair in his backyard crossed bare legs and birkenstocks supporting the laptop in which he was engrossed i d driven to his home in quincy massachusetts from mine in upstate new york and we abiding by long ingrained middle aged guy manners shook hands i think he may have been a little nervous i know i was i d never before had such intense interactions with someone i hadn t even met he showed me around his expansive suburban backyard a charmingly chaotic sprawl of patios herbs and vegetables growing in pots fabricated flowers and giant insects made of metal and wood and the tools and hardware for innumerable partially finished projects all surrounding a large slate blue house a big tan and white dog named john archibald barked nonstop at me until he settled down kiki made muffins and for the next two days fuchs and i hung out in his yard and house and engaged in the kind of long free flowing conversation that you can t have on zoom quantum levity in 2010 at a new directions in the foundations of physics meeting chris fuchs cracks up himself and fellow physicist rob spekkens with a joke famed physicist charles misner is to fuchs left photo by michael seevinck after our initial tour fuchs recounted how he came to physics he d already told me about growing up pretty poor in the small texas town cuero and about a childhood that involved at least as much conflict and confusion as mine now he explained how he d found refuge in science fiction including isaac asimov s books and star trek on tv he d dreamed of living the life of captain kirk flying to the stars and exploring strange new worlds that led him to the physics section of the library where he went to learn how to make that happen it was like porn for me he said about the books he took home the equations went over his head but he understood enough to discover the disappointing truth that einstein s theory of relativity and its prohibition on faster than light travel made his star trek dream impossible the laws of physics aren t going to allow it he recalled telling his best friend so they ve got to be wrong fuchs explained he was inspired by the scientific writings of physicist john archibald wheeler a professor at the university of texas at austin once while attending the american legion s boys state program in austin fuchs snuck off to meet wheeler the professor was out of town but his secretary let him take a sampling of his papers including one on an idea called law without law which was that the laws of physics are not hard and fast but rather only approximations that arise from quantum randomness similar to how order emerges from chaos in darwin s theory it was an idea that offered fuchs hope that his dream was not dead as the other john archibald lolled in the grass nearby fuchs stopped at this point in his story a surge of emotion made it hard for him to speak i was like whoa he said i ve got to understand quantum mechanics fuchs did his bachelor s in physics at ut with wheeler as his research advisor he also earned a bachelor s in mathematics it from bit was another wheelerism it expressed his belief that an electron as fuchs put it is nothing more than our information about it inspired by that idea fuchs found his way to caves and schack on a mission to understand quantum mechanics in information terms while i d gone into physics seeking something solid to believe in fuchs went with precisely the opposite orientation with hopes of showing that the laws of physics aren t solid years later it seemed that he d succeeded too well qbism s core tenet that probabilities are personal beliefs had led to the conclusion that every part of quantum theory from quantum states to the lab equipment used to measure them had the metaphysical status of subjective beliefs with no apparent foundation in objective reality so where do you go with that fuchs said you would think well you can t go anywhere now everything is subjective the sound of blue jays jeering came from some nearby trees and then you think on it for a few years fuchs continued and then you go oh oh quantum probabilities aren t freewheeling they re all tied together this was the insight that led to qbism s most profound claim that there is one thing in quantum mechanics that is not subjective that everyone should agree to it s not really a thing but a rule a new mathematical rule that constrains a person s choices beyond the restrictions of standard probability theory to a qbist this new rule constitutes the essential content of quantum mechanics and signals what the theory can tell us about the nature of reality even beyond human experience the rule s most crucial feature is that it is normative meaning that it tells the theory s user how to think rather than how the world behaves fuchs compares it to the ten commandments one can disregard it but something bad is likely to happen as a result bad meaning that your computer nuclear reactor mri machine or any other application of the theory simply won t work we were now in fuchs living room him on his sofa bare feet on the coffee table and me in a chair nearby i asked him what the normative character of quantum theory s new rule says about nature s doings that their probabilities can t be quantified he said that there s no number that will shoehorn a potential event i was reminded of something i d read before nature and its parts do what they want fuchs had written and we as free willed agents do what we can get away with fuchs sounded a lot like james who speculated that experience as a whole is self containing and leans on nothing meaning that no deeper layer of reality explains our experiences because the experiences themselves comprise the ultimate reality james called his vision a pluriverse a place in which no thing was more fundamental than any other where mental phenomena like dreams and ambitions are as real and substantive as anything else and where he wrote being comes in local spots and patches which add themselves or stay away at random independently of the rest james pluriverse was the furthest thing imaginable from what he called the block universe one that amounted to a giant machine built from fundamental ingredients and governed by immutable laws the pluriverse was a wilder and more heterogeneous place one that was forever unfinished as its motley cast of constituents pushed pulled and clashed with each other in a never ending process of construction each driven by its own unknowable inner nature each free from the reins of any top down laws at all this is fuchs understanding of the world too i think the chair that i have my feet on has as much of an inner life as i do he d said in one qbuki our conversation circled back to wigner s friend fuchs compared the scenario to one of those escher drawings of say a staircase which displays in two dimensions a situation that can t exist in three in the analogy wigner s and his friend s contradicting facts are like two sections of the staircase they can peaceably co exist so long as we don t try to interpret them as aspects of a single block universe i was finally appreciating how quantum theory could substantiate the pluriverse idea how james experiences and bohr s phenomena could be one and the same how quantum theory s mysterious acts of observation could correspond to james facts in the making and how it might be that there are no variables hidden in heisenberg s black box because reality is simply the phenomena the experiences out of which that box was built and more generally that there may not be any deeper reality hidden in the palace of ideas because it too is derived from experiences and not the other way around and i could see why fuchs kept saying that quantum theory makes life worth living the world stands really malleable wrote james waiting to receive its final touches at our hands like the kingdom of heaven it suffers human violence willingly man engenders truths upon it it s that malleability that gives fuchs hope because to him it means that the laws of physics only summarize the experiences humans have had so far do not limit those we may have in the future and are even to some extent shaped by human activity one day we will get to the stars in the sense of star trek he said from his sofa how s that going to happen i don t know but if you buy the ideas of james then you ve bought into a hope that it can happen hope yes but as to going further fuchs unfortunately is stuck he told me this a couple of weeks earlier in a one on one zoom call while wearing a life is crap t shirt illustrated with a cartoon bird pooping on a sad face i d run my fifth and final qbuki a few days before and he d written me an email saying he felt sorry for me because of how exhausted i looked by the end he suggested we talk to try and iron things out his tone was completely different than i d ever heard before he spoke to me as if were colleagues rather than like an oracle speaking down from above he confessed that the qbism project was stuck and explained why he d snapped at me in the qbuki a few days before you got my ire because you poor fellow made the poor choice of word repeatability he said repeatability just meant the ability of scientists to repeat experiments what was wrong with using that word well he said i m trying to construct a philosophy where nothing is repeatable where the world is fresh in every moment trying to construct i suddenly realized how much of qbism is a product of fuchs desire and how much its future depends on faith fuchs went on to tell me a story he d written a long time ago which although he s an atheist recounted a conversation between adam and god adam wishes for a world like fuchs wants to believe in and god grants his wish by making the world conform to quantum theory such that it grows unbound by laws as james envisioned and yet where science can progress by finding normative rules to navigate it including potentially to the stars faith uses a logic altogether different from reason s logic james wrote reason claims certainty and finality for her conclusions faith is satisfied if hers seem probable and practically wise fuchs said he abides by the chain of thinking of james faith ladder it would be well if it were true it might be true it ought to be true it shall be true goes the last step act as if it is and it will be fuchs and his qbists are now looking for ways to flesh out fuzzy philosophical ideas like experience to translate them into mathematical language and to show in detail how quantum mechanics follows from them which is to say to explain why that particular theory is the optimal law of thought to survive and thrive in the pluriverse how to go about that is not at all clear i think there is a better story to be told fuchs said across the coffee table but we don t know how to do it yet we talked for a long time about the challenges of abandoning a god s eye view when thinking through situations like wigner s friend what after all is the situation if all that is real are wigner s and his friend s individual experiences i said i couldn t see how to think that way it s a struggle for me too fuchs said you re asking tough questions you really are a member of the group maybe he was being polite but i believed him even if i wasn t quite ready to take the leap of faith that a true qbist needs to make a week after i left fuchs on a vast green lawn overlooking the hudson river and the catskill mountains beyond martina and i stood under an arch of white flowers and exchanged vows in front of our families and friends although i had a lot of things on my mind in the preceding days one was how to think more like a qbist i chuckled at an irony i d started off hoping to understand qbism s way of reconciling the familiar everyday world with the foreign quantum one and ended up open to the idea that we re all living in the quantum world how much my new outlook came from fuchs versus my love for martina was impossible to know my thoughts and feelings were too entangled to separate but it seemed right as qbism claims that the everyday and quantum worlds are one and the same that uncertainty is unavoidable and unquantifiable that people can have different realities but must live in the same universe that we are more than just atoms that our choices are our own and that our futures are not limited by our pasts it ought to be true bob henderson is a writer based in upstate new york who earned a ph d in theoretical

ahead sir rob hays president and chief executive officer thank you jordan good morning and welcome to our call i ll start by providing an overview of the current environment and how ashford trust has been navigating the recovery after that deric will review our financial results and chris will provide an operational update on our portfolio i d first like to highlight some of our recent accomplishments and the main themes for our call first we saw the lodging recovery continuing to take hold in the fourth quarter leading to strong hotel performance and solid earnings second our liquidity continues to improve and our cash balance is meaningful we ended the quarter with approximately 639 million of net working capital which equates to approximately 18 per diluted share with our current stock price of around 8 we are trading at a meaningful discount to both our net asset value per share and our net working capital per share third we have lowered our leverage and improved our overall financial position since its peak in 2020 we have lowered our net debt plus preferred equity by over 1 1 billion equating to a decrease in our leverage ratio defined as net debt plus preferred equity to gross assets by approximately 13 percentage points fourth during the quarter we announced an amendment to our strategic financing which provides us with more flexibility to access the undrawn capital if needed even after we have paid off the current balance during the quarter we paid off the strategic financing s pic interest and are now paying interest current while the loan doesn t mature for several years we are looking for opportunities to pay it off later this year if the industry recovery continues to make progress finally even with an already attractive loan maturity schedule we remain proactive in our capital markets activities and balance sheet management during the quarter we refinanced our mortgage loan for the marriott gateway crystal city and with the completion of debt financing our next hard debt maturity is not until june of 2023 we are optimistic about the long term outlook for the company and by taking decisive actions to strengthen our balance sheet we feel well positioned to capitalize on the recovery we are seeing in the hospitality industry while our optimism remains we also must acknowledge some risks to the pace of the recovery due to ongoing variants of covid 19 in addition we believe the majority of our loans could continue to be in cash traps over the next 12 to 24 months or more and as a result we are focused on building our liquidity and improving our capital structure in the months to come in regards to common dividends the company and its board of directors previously announced a suspension of its common stock dividend and therefore the company did not pay a dividend on its common stock and common units for the fourth quarter however the board will continue to monitor the situation and assess future dividend debt declarations regarding our preferred dividends during the fourth quarter we reinstated and caught up on all of our accrued preferred dividends and currently plan to pay those quarterly going forward as we ve discussed this is important to us for several reasons including it was one of the requirements for ashford trust to regain its s 3 eligibility for 2022 we will increase our capex spending from the previous two years but will still be well below our historical run rate for capex given the sizable strategic capital expenditures we made in our properties over the past several years we believe our hotels are in fantastic condition and are well positioned for the industry rebound let me now turn to the operating environment at our hotels the lodging industry is clearly showing signs of improvement revpar for all hotels in the portfolio increased approximately 164 in the fourth quarter with only eight of our hotels having negative hotel ebitda in the first quarter this revpar result equates to a decrease of approximately 21 versus the fourth quarter of 2019 and improvement from the third quarter of 2021 when revpar was down 26 from the same period in 2019 we remain encouraged by the continued strength in weekend leisure demand at our properties and as we enter 2022 we did see some softness in demand with the omicron variant that was similar to what we saw with the delta variant in mid august that industry softness bottomed out in the last two weeks of january and has improved since then we believe the united states is transitioning from a pandemic to an endemic mentality and we hope to build on the momentum we saw in 2021 we believe our geographically diverse portfolio consisting of high quality well located assets across the u s is well positioned to capitalize on the acceleration in demand we expect to see across leisure business and group we continue to be focused on aggressive cost control initiatives including working closely with our property managers to minimize cost structures and maximize liquidity at our hotels this is where our relationship with our affiliated property manager remington really sets us apart remington has been able to manage costs aggressively and adjust to the current operating environment this important relationship has enabled us to outperform the industry from an operations standpoint for many years turning to investor relations during the quarter we attended several small cap and lodging investor conferences and we also held a well attended investor day in new york if you were not able to join us i encourage you to go to our website and watch the webcast for 2022 we will expand our efforts to get out on the road to meet with investors communicate our strategy and explain what we believe to be an attractive investment opportunity in ashford trust we look forward to speaking with many of you during upcoming events we believe we have the right plan in place to capitalize on the recovery as it unfolds this plan includes continuing to maximize liquidity across the company optimizing the operating performance of our assets as they recover deleveraging the balance sheet over time and looking for opportunities to invest and grow our portfolio we have a track record of success when it comes to property acquisitions joint ventures and asset sales and expect they will continue to be part of our plans moving forward we enter 2022 with a substantial amount of cash on our balance sheet and are looking for ways to go on offense i will now turn the call over to deric to review our fourth quarter financial performance deric eubanks chief financial officer thanks rob for the fourth quarter of 2021 we reported a net loss attributable to common stockholders of 59 3 million or 1 75 per diluted share for the full year of 2021 we reported a net loss attributable to common stockholders of 267 9 million or 12 43 per diluted share for the quarter we reported affo per diluted share of negative 0 09 for the full year of 2021 we reported affo per diluted share of negative 1 23 adjusted ebitdare totaled 40 7 million for the quarter while adjusted ebitdare for the full year was 113 6 million at the end of the fourth quarter we had 3 9 billion of loans with a blended average interest rate of 4 1 our loans were approximately 8 fixed rate and 92 floating rate we utilize floating rate debt as we believe it is a better hedge of our operating cash flows however we do utilize caps on those floating rate loans to protect the company against significant interest rate increases our hotel loans are all non recourse and currently 93 of our hotels are in cash traps this is down from 97 last quarter a cash trap means that we are currently unable to utilize property level cash for corporate related purposes as the properties recover and meet the various debt yield or coverage thresholds we will be able to utilize that cash freely at corporate we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of 592 1 million and restricted cash of 99 5 million the vast majority of that restricted cash is comprised of lender and manager held reserve accounts at the end of the quarter we also had 26 9 million in due from third party hotel managers this primarily represents cash held by one of our property managers which is also available to fund hotel operating costs we also ended the quarter with net working capital of 639 million as rob mentioned i think it s also important to point out that this net working capital amount of 639 million equates to approximately 18 per share this compares to our closing stock price from yesterday of 8 31 which is an approximate 55 discount to our net working capital per share our net working capital reflects value over and above the value of our hotels as such we believe that our current stock price does not reflect the intrinsic value of our high quality hotel portfolio from a cash utilization standpoint our portfolio generated hotel ebitda of 55 4 million in the quarter our current quarterly run rate for debt service is approximately 41 million our quarterly run rate for corporate g a and advisory expense is approximately 14 million and our quarterly run rate on preferred dividends is approximately 3 million as of december 31 2021 our portfolio consisted of 100 hotels with 22 313 net rooms our share count currently stands at approximately 34 9 million fully diluted shares outstanding which is comprised of 34 5 million shares of common stock and 0 4 million op units in the fourth quarter our weighted average fully diluted share count used to calculate affo per share included approximately 1 7 million common shares associated with the exit fee on the strategic financing we completed in january 2021 assuming yesterday s closing stock price of 8 31 our equity market cap is approximately 290 million during the quarter we refinanced our mortgage loan for the 701 room marriott gateway crystal city in arlington virginia which had a final maturity date in november 2021 the new non recourse loan totals 86 0 million and has a three year initial term with two one year extension options subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions the loan is interest only and provides for a floating interest rate of libor plus 4 65 our next final debt maturity is now in june 2023 as we previously discussed we selectively exchanged our preferred stock for common stock in 2020 and 2021 as a way to de lever our balance sheet remove the accrued dividend liability and improve our equity float through these exchanges we have exchanged approximately 71 of our original preferred stock which is approximately 401 8 million of face value into common stock these exchanges also eliminated a significant amount of accrued preferred dividends after taking into account the 200 million of new corporate debt from last january and our cash balance at the end of the quarter we have lowered our net debt plus preferred equity by approximately 1 1 billion since its peak in 2020 we opportunistically raised equity capital in 2021 to shore up our balance sheet improve our liquidity and to be prepared for potential loan paydowns needed to achieve extension tests or meet refinancing requirements for the full year 2021 we raised approximately 564 million of gross proceeds at an average price of 28 17 during the quarter we paid off the pic interest associated with our oaktree loan of 24 million and also utilized cash of 18 6 million to bring our preferred dividends current our current plan is to continue to pay our preferred dividends quarterly going forward while we expect our common dividend to continue to be suspended for the foreseeable future over the past several months we have taken numerous steps to strengthen our financial position and improve our liquidity and we are pleased with the progress that we ve made while we still have work to do to lower our leverage our cash balance is solid we have an attractive maturity schedule and we believe the company is well positioned to benefit from the improving trends we are seeing in the lodging industry this concludes our financial review and i would now like to turn it over to chris to discuss our asset management activities for the quarter chris nixon senior vice president and head of asset management thank you deric comparable revpar for our portfolio increased by 164 during the fourth quarter relative to the same time period in 2020 we are extremely proud of the work that our asset management team has done to drive operating results the team has accomplished so much this year including driving 21 of our properties to exceed their comparable fourth quarter 2019 revpar i would like to spend some time highlighting a few of those success stories sheraton anchorage had a strong fourth quarter with revpar exceeding comparable 2019 by 43 the team secured two new valuable pieces of business during the quarter that were very profitable the first was a group of extended stay nurses that provided approximately 5 000 group room nights and the second was a new airline crew that generated 5 400 room nights together these two pieces of business brought in an incremental 1 7 million in room revenue for the hotel next i ll turn to the marriott beverly hills this hotel experienced a 16 increase in hotel ebitda during the fourth quarter relative to the same period in 2019 while the hotel s revpar had nearly fully recovered to 2019 levels the hotel found a number of successful ways to deliver margin expansion in every single department increasing overall hotel ebitda margin by over 740 basis points the team accomplished this through a number of initiatives including closing the guest club lounge optimizing f b operations through menu changes and operating hours and executing on long term labor efficiencies with this increased productivity in place and the super bowl having been held in los angeles this hotel is primed for a great first quarter the embassy suites flagstaff also produced fantastic results during the fourth quarter with hotel gross operating income increasing more than 200 000 or over 30 relative to the comparable period in 2019 again our proactive sales efforts identified and secured two large pieces of business the first being a new long term airline contract and the second being a team of high altitude training athletes that were preparing for the olympics the increase in base business allowed the hotel to drive rate while yielding effectively which resulted in a revpar increase of nearly 16 over the fourth quarter of 2019 the last hotel i ll highlight is historic inns of annapolis this hotel had strong results with revpar increasing 18 during the fourth quarter relative to the comparable period in 2019 these results were driven by our team s tenacity and adapting to the new challenging work environment to attract group business the team reached out to large groups that had previously stayed at the hotel over the last six years and offered them a unique and special package to return in addition the team utilized a new selling tool to attract new groups that allows future clients to have a 3d tour of different spaces within the hotel the tool proved to be a great resource in closing new business these initiatives drove hotel ebitda above 2019 levels during the fourth quarter by nearly 5 moving on to capital expenditures in prior years we were proactive in renovating our hotels to renew our portfolio that commitment has now resulted in a competitive and strategic advantage as the market continues to rebound not only are our properties more attractive to potential travelers but we can also deploy capital more prudently throughout the recovery in 2021 we restarted a number of capital projects including the guest rooms at marriott fremont the guest rooms at hilton santa cruz and the corner pantry at embassy suites portland for 2022 we currently anticipate spending between 110 and 120 million in capital expenditures of which we estimate approximately half will be owner funded before moving on to q a i would like to reiterate how optimistic we are about the recovery of our portfolio as i mentioned earlier more than 20 of our assets exceeded 2019 revpar levels during the fourth quarter when you look at just the month of december the number of properties with revpar outperformance over 2019 jumps to nearly 30 with group lead volume increasing steadily we fully anticipate that this revpar momentum will continue that concludes our prepared remarks we will now open up the call for q a questions answers operator thank you ladies and gentlemen at this time we will begin question and answer session our first question comes from the line of tyler batory with janney please proceed with your question tyler batory janney capital markets analyst thank you good morning starting with a general question here just in terms of the cap structure clearly making a lot of progress there how are you feeling about your position today how comfortable are you with your liquidity in light of some of the expected upcoming cash flows and just help us think through some of the next steps as we move through this year in terms of making even more progress on your capital stack rob hays president and chief executive officer sure this is rob so let me take a whack at that one so i think we re obviously happy with where we are overall from a cash and liquidity standpoint and believe both the access we have to what s on our balance sheet as well as having access to additional funds from the strategic financing if we need we feel good about where we are but you re right to the extent that there are other cash needs that are some are known we talked about for example we ve got capex that is starting to ramp up again we ve been having that depressed for the last couple of years just spending 30 to 40 million a year and now it s going to be back up in the triple digits and about half of that is probably going to be owner funded so those are cash needs that we know we need to do it s the ones that are uncertain that are just making it a little more difficult tyler to lay out the specific plan just as and i think a lot of it goes around the extension tests on some of our loans that are due in 24 25 and 26 but some of those extension tests start up as early as kind of middle of the year next year and it is depending upon the shape of this recovery it really could be something where there s no need for capital to do anything on those and they will be fine to they could be several hundred million dollars of paydowns in order to meet those loan extension tests and so i think realistically what s going to happen is you re going to see us now that we re getting within 18 months or 12 months of some of those tests hitting is we re getting to a place where those lenders are willing to engage a little bit more in discussions and so i think a combination of talking with the lenders because they also don t want these loans to be in any sort of difficult situations to see if there s ways to potentially modify some of those tests maybe it is associated with some aspect of a paid out maybe there s an asset sale that we can pair with it because that is a process we re going through right now is looking at what do we think market is on a good number of our assets to see if that s a alternative way to maybe help on some of the loan extension tests we obviously have some restrictions on those given the broader strategic financing that we have in place but there s i think ways to use those so it s still a little bit of a fluid situation but we feel that we ve got kind of ample capital right now to address those and then the question then is well we also have some desires to go on the offense and so we re trying to balance the need for capital to still deal with some of the loan issues versus seeing opportunities in front of us and so that s where we you may see it at some point in time we mentioned in the call in the script because like joint ventures and whatnot to maybe go out and work with some capital partners to go on the offense but those are still tbd tyler batory janney capital markets analyst ok great i appreciate that and as a follow up i thought it was interesting and helpful the commentary about 2023 and 2024 in the earnings release can you talk about what sort of macro or perhaps industry assumptions are supporting that outlook and then it s interesting you re expecting to hit 2019 revpar before you hit 2019 hotel ebitda so just explain that a little bit more you re expecting some extra cost creep perhaps that s causing the lag there in achieving 2019 hotel ebitda rob hays president and chief executive officer yes good question so i ll start this first and then maybe deric may have some comments as well but we do think it s important that we ve obviously never really given long term formal guidance but we wanted to at least give investors in the street an opportunity to get some thoughts around what we re thinking in order from a modeling standpoint and from a and so given what we re seeing and obviously you tyler know well about some of the forecasts we re coming from smith travel about how the u s is basically overall going to get back to 2019 levels potentially this year in 2022 it s just that as we look at our portfolio which is predominantly upper upscale assets that s a little bit laggard a little bit behind but then we also have some upscale and limited service assets that have also been coming back stronger so as we balance all of that we do think that 2023 is the year as we sit here today where revpar will get back now the reason why it s not 2023 and instead 2024 on the ebitda side it s probably a little bit less on the margin side i think over the long term we still think that margins may have a little bit of upside to them after everything is said and done because of the new operating models but it s maybe relatively small it s just the fact that when we look at all of our ancillary and smb type revenues particularly around the catering side and group side those are just a slower ramp and so the offset is one where even though we think margins may be ok it may be just a little bit longer before those get us all the way back to kind of a total ebitda number ok great that s all from me appreciate the detail thank you operator our next question comes from the line of kyle menges from b riley securities please proceed with your question kyle menges b riley securities analyst good morning this is kyle on for bryan rob hays president and chief executive officer good morning kyle kyle menges b riley securities analyst good morning i was hoping that you could talk a little bit more about the oaktree loan i know you mentioned that you d like to address that by the end of this year if possible and i was curious if you could just dive in a little bit more into kind of how you re thinking about addressing that as well as the kind of industry trends you think you d need to see this year in order to pay that off rob hays president and chief executive officer yes no it s a good question so as we sit here today that loan is about 200 million as we mentioned on the call we were accruing the interest last year on it and in order to get our preferred paid in order to try to get our s 3 eligibility back we began paying the strategic financing current as well so there s no accruals on that and so as we look at what it would take to pay them off they do have a two year make whole provision so there s in some sense no real benefit economically of paying them off today versus in 12 months or in january of next year so we ll have to be paying that regardless that s another 32 million so we know that we are going to owe them at least 232 million as part of all that now we did obviously previously announced that we have the ability to pay them off and keep the additional draws outstanding which gives us a little bit of flexibility to the extent that we ever want to draw additional capital but it kyle goes to this tension that we re looking at where we obviously have the cash on our balance sheet today to pay them off and pay the make whole but we re just coming off the heels of omicron and we ve seen numbers come back and i think it s just a question for us if this trajectory recovery continues where more tend to what we were just talking about with tyler where we think revpar numbers are going to get back to 2023 levels next year we will be able to see that here in the next three six eight months as we see what happens with the group business what happens with business travel what are the continuing trends with leisure and depending upon if those are strong enough that will i think give us probably more confidence in order to write the check for the 200 plus million but we just don t we re cautious on doing that right now until we see just a little bit more traction kind of on the ground on the heels of omicron kyle menges b riley securities analyst great thanks for that color and then you ve also mentioned in the past that you d like to rationalize the portfolio maybe sell 10 to 15 hotels i was curious if you re still thinking in that way and also you mentioned you d like to go on offense could we actually see you maybe going offense in some creative ways like doing a jv maybe before you actually sell any assets rob hays president and chief executive officer the answer is i think all of those things are possible and all things are on the are available to us right now right now we are going through a process of looking at our assets but again it s a little bit more complicated because we do have obviously certain provisions within our oaktree loans within the strategic financing loan which determines kind of how we can use proceeds which makes it a little more complicated and we do have these other loans i mentioned that have extension tests that are coming up in the next year to two years that depending upon where what assets are in different pools it may make sense to pair those up together as a way and so there s just a bunch of moving pieces that we re looking at but i think hopefully here in the next few months you ll see us try to lay out a game plan for that at least that s my intention as i sit here now and then to your second part which is could you see us be creative and go on the offense the answer is yes i mean there is a lot of private capital out there and available and if it s something where ashford trust can at least have some participation in a deal and have some sort of rights on the backside where we can create access to a proprietary pipeline then it s definitely something that we re going to take a look at because we do have to be again cautious to in terms of deploying all of our cash we want to see a little bit more recovery before we put that out in earnest so we re looking at a few alternatives right now kyle menges b riley securities analyst great thanks that s all from me operator our next question comes from the line of chris woronka with deutsche bank please proceed with your question chris woronka deutsche bank analyst yes hi good morning guys i just wanted to start with maybe asking about the what your thoughts are on if you re going to be using an atm or anything like that this year i know those things can be kind of opportunistic in nature but just thoughts given the amount you did raise last year and kind of stock bouncing around any thoughts on whether that s more or less likely this year rob hays president and chief executive officer well i mean obviously chris we have not raised almost any capital here since kind of this fall since the our price pulled back pretty significantly and so we ve been on the sideline on that i think it s likely as you know just from a standard operating procedure that will whenever we get our s 3 eligibility we will likely put an atm in place just to have it there but where our stock price is currently i wouldn t anticipate using it until the stock price is materially higher than what it is i mean you saw the stat i heard the stat that we had in the release where the capital that we raised last year which was substantive is a little over 500 million but it was obviously done at prices materially higher close to 30 per share so materially higher than where it is right now and so i think until we are at a place where we are much closer to that we re not going to be very comfortable raising equity so we ll probably be on the sidelines that we will likely at least set up the atm just to put it in place chris woronka deutsche bank analyst ok very helpful and then one operational question for you if you look out across your portfolio pretty diverse right and a lot of some urban exposure do you have a view on the industry and we re getting back we re not back to prior peak occupancy levels yet we re hopefully getting there still need to hire some more people right in some of the hotels i mean is there any way to think about are those people out there is there another leg up in wages coming or do you think this thing can all kind of self out over time rob hays president and chief executive officer no that s a good question i mean i do think it will smooth itself up over time i mean we were looking at at least on the hourly side wages are up anywhere between 15 and 20 from pre covid and as we re looking at where do we think those can go i think the best guesses we have is that wages may be growing over the next year or two years maybe it s in the 5 type of annual range so something and but not nearly as steep as it has been so we do think that as the economy opens up that you re going to see some i guess less dramatic increases and so at the end of the day i do think we still can potentially hold on to maybe some of the margin increase because there s no doubt from an operational set we re running leaner i mean we re like i said we re still running at about 70 of our pre covid people and i don t think we re ever going to get back to 100 it may end up being something closer to 90 so it s a little bit of wait and see but i do think it will smooth out a little bit chris woronka deutsche bank analyst ok helpful and maybe a quick one for deric how do you guys kind of internally underwrite interest rates given where we appear to be headed on higher interest rates over time and just i guess the second question i m assuming we re nowhere near where the caps would come in but as we think about going forward you guys gave us guidance on the run rate interest how much does that change if we go 2 5 3 on the treasury deric eubanks chief financial officer yes chris it s deric a couple of things there i think one we take the position that it s a natural hedge to our operating cash flow so we re somewhat indifferent into what happens with rates because look we ve benefited from it on the downside and when now our earnings are going up we would anticipate some increase in cost as interest rates go up so like i said there s a bit of a hedge there but we do spend a lot of time thinking about it we do have cash to protect us from any spike we re not really tied to the treasury we re tied to short term rates and we spent a lot of time digging into this and really came to the conclusion that look most of the time the vast majority of the time you re better off being at the short end of the curve and being floating and it also provides a lot more flexibility to us to be opportunistic to either sell assets or refinance at an opportune time and so the run rate i gave you is based on current rates obviously if you look at the forward curve and what the market is expecting short term rates to do there s a pretty significant increase now we ll just have to see if the fed ends up doing that and rates end up going up as fast as the forward curve currently predicts we re tied to libor or will ultimately probably be one month sofr and that tends to be pretty close to the fed funds rate so as the fed moves rates we d expect our index to be pretty close to that but we ll just have to see there s obviously a lot of debt in our economy and as that rate goes up it really puts the brakes on our economy and so we ll just have to see how aggressive and how quickly the fed moves one of the things we have always seen in our history is that the market always overestimates how fast and high rates will go and we benefited from that years and years ago when we would bought some floor doors to participate in that sort of dynamic but needless to say we re comfortable with the exposure to have the debt markets have ramped back up and become more attractive sooner than i thought they would for hotel assets we were able to the two financings that we completed last year were on assets that had no trailing cash flow so on a trailing basis there was no cash flow yes we were able to get pretty attractive financings completed we ll continue to be opportunistic as we look at refinancing opportunities we re sitting at a great spot and then we have no maturities this year final maturities but i wouldn t be surprised if we go refinance a few pools to give us some more flexibility we may even be in a position to lower our spread so i feel very good with where we sit from a balance sheet standpoint maturity standpoint also from an interest rate exposure standpoint chris woronka deutsche bank analyst ok very good appreciate all the color thanks guys operator our next question comes from the line of michael bellisario with robert w baird please proceed with your question michael bellisario baird analyst thank you good morning everyone i want to turn the clock back and kind of go back to your five year stock price analysis that you guys i m assuming you still do but you talked about it a lot more pre pandemic could you maybe update us on how you re thinking about kind of your implied cost of capital both today and then also when you were issuing stock call it 15 per share or higher before the before the sell off happened in the fall any color there would be helpful thank you rob hays president and chief executive officer yes this is a good question michael i mean i think we obviously the way that we re obviously not in a process right now of doing significant underwriting of assets given some of the comments we had before so the five year stock price analysis obviously was more in regards to what we when we were acquiring assets and that s obviously been put on hold and so i think we re as we re trying to figure out what our capital structure is going to be looking like right now we were running at over 10 times net debt and preferred to ebitda going into the pandemic on a kind of a run rate basis we re probably close to if you kind of go back to 2019 ebitda numbers we re probably in the mid to mid eights right now i d like that number to probably be closer to six over the next several years and so i think as we think about the cost of capital right now it s we ve got to get the company into a position where we are i guess healthy that we ve got a capital structure that is sustainable and so the capital raising that we did last year obviously in many cases was painful at times but it was at times had to make a decision is that the best way to do it or do we want to file bankruptcy or restructure the opening and so and i ll say now there is significant risk to our shareholders of losing the whole thing and so i think as we look forward we re probably going to take some sort of more i don t know traditional understanding of or common understanding of our cost of capital probably trying to hit some sort of unlevered irrs as opposed to stock price modeling on our acquisitions but that s still kind of tbd as we aren t yet in kind of full offense mode but also we have some sense of what at what point is a level that is too low and obviously where our stock price is now we think it s a pretty substantial discount from both the underlying value of the assets and even the cash on our balance sheet as deric mentioned so which is why you haven t seen us raise any capital but so i think it s really dependent upon like what are the significant needs is it something that it s about going on offense and trying to do deals well then i think you ll see us look more kind of a traditional irr type return structure on a deal probably on an unlevered basis to underwrite acquisitions and then i think if it s raising capital for other reasons i think it will just all be related to what s the state of the company and what s the cost of whether it s maybe debt pools that are better to sell than raise capital to solve them so it s probably a little bit probably a little bit more fluid until we kind of get the company to a place where we have a sustainable capital structure michael bellisario baird analyst got it and just to clarify you said mid eight times today is that i don t think i heard that was a pro forma was that on 2019 numbers what was the deric eubanks chief financial officer yes it s kind of like of 2019 like if you took 2019 numbers i think that s yes we d kind of be in the mid eights so i think we ve reduced that by 150 to almost 200 i guess the best way of putting two turns or so over the last year and a half and we probably still have another two to go or so michael bellisario baird analyst got it and then just along the same lines thinking about the stock price obviously there s some amount of debt overhang and refinancing risk weighing on the stock price so maybe why even think about going on offense and allocating any amount of time or dollars on new investments and i get that it might be two plus months out but why you been thinking talk about that instead of being solely focused on addressing the liability side of the balance sheet rob hays president and chief executive officer well i think some of it is if you see i mean if we see opportunities to create value we re going to take them and as you know it s never 100 and 0 right you re always trying to find some ways to grow some ways to repair your balance sheet some ways to grow liquidity and it just depends on where you are in the cycle of how much of a dial that is and so yes we re not spending a ton of time underwriting assets at ashford trust we re looking at things there s a few things that we see that are interesting but yes our vast majority of our energies are on the liability side but we also want people to know that that it is important to us and if there is an opportunity that makes sense where we can put out maybe it s a limited amount of capital but create some attractive returns and maybe it can be a healthy step for the company over the long term and that s something that we ve got to be talking about it and taking a look at but there s no doubt that the vast majority of our time is being spent on kind of repairing and healing the balance sheet as opposed to going on offense deric eubanks chief financial officer michael this is deric the other thing i would add there is that just given the nature of our financing you ve really got to look loan by loan to kind of see where the equity value is in the company and so we may spend more time on one individual loan on a restructuring or a forbearance agreement or what have you given that we think there s a significant amount of equity in that specific loan pool and there may be other loans like you ve seen in the last 18 24 months where look we ve got to let something go we ll let it go obviously that s not what we want to do but when you re analyzing the value of the business given the nature of our nonrecourse debt at the property level you really have to look loan pool by loan pool and that s what we ve spent a lot of time and focus on and as we think about restructuring debt paying down debt or how to just fine tune the capital structure of each loan pool that s what our focus is and i think that s something that the market misses when you say there s sort of an overhang of leverage on our platform that may be the case for certain loan pools but in other loan pools you may look like well there s a ton of equity in that loan pool so it takes us a little bit extra work to kind of dig into the balance sheet a little bit more rob hays president and chief executive officer yes and one other thing i d add michael it s interesting is that over the we obviously experienced a pretty good downdraft in our stock price kind of then to year end and what was interesting was the reality is that for a while there for several month period we were trading not really in line with the other but we were trading much more highly correlated with some of the other kind of mean stock peers that are out there because we obviously had a pretty big shift in our shareholder base where i think at some point as much as 80 85 of our shareholder base was on the retail side and i think what has had happened as we got kind of our new shareholder base is that we ve now at the end of december we re now probably back to being 50 retail and 50 institutional so we ve got a big swath of that sell off seem to be retail shareholders whether it s for year end purposes or some of the other mean stock and crypto stocks and investments that were being made were struggling that people are liquidating their retail accounts and i think ashford trust got caught up in that and so it was interesting to look we had a much tighter correlation with gamestop and amc and other mean stocks than our gears and so i think there s a little bit of noise that is caught up in there and i think over time this year i think you ll probably see more and more of an institutional shareholder base come into the stock perhaps we ll see michael bellisario baird analyst got it helpful and then just one last one for me switching gears just wanted to go to your 2024 kind of margin commentary that you made maybe this is for chris here but just can you help us think about the cadence of group recovery so let s say in 2023 group demand is 10 or 20 below pre pandemic levels rates the same how do you see that av spending trending relative to group demand what s kind of the sequencing there on the group side rob hays president and chief executive officer yes thanks michael from a group standpoint group it s definitely the lagging segment i mean you re right as we look ahead to 2022 our group pace is down about 26 one of the things that we re really optimistic about is the key leading indicator is lead volume and we continue to see lead volume increase quarter to quarter but q4 was the strongest lead volume of any quarter we ve had since the start of the pandemic we re also very encouraged by our group adr pace group adr is up next year by 2 and then even further ahead in 2023 it s up high single digits and so what we re seeing a lot right now are some of the smaller meetings a lot of social and really to get that high banquet high catering contribution you need those larger group programs convention associations to come back and we think that that s going to be one of the last segments to return so i think as we get further along in the recovery in the 23 24 that s when we really see that catering spend return to kind of pre pandemic levels michael bellisario baird analyst helpful thank you operator there are no further questions in the queue i d like to hand the call back to management for closing remarks rob hays

questions with that i ll turn the call over to ed ed pitoniak chief executive officer thank you samantha and good morning everyone before i start let me just say on behalf of vici that our hearts very much go out this morning to the people of ukraine today i want to begin the call by addressing two topics vici s growth and total return over our first four years and our closing of our venetian acquisition and what it signifies about vici and our asset class i ll then turn the call over to john who will talk about our ongoing growth initiatives and to david who will talk about our 2021 results and our financing activities the year we just concluded 2021 constituted vici s fourth full year of operations and growth if measured from our emergence date in october 2017 a bit more than four years ago we ve accomplished following we have announced 29 billion of acquisitions establishing vici as one of the most dynamic growth platforms in american reit management we have raised more than 12 billion of common equity more than any other reit in america over that period pro forma for our announced acquisitions we will have grown our portfolio noi by more than four times we have lowered our leverage from 8 5 times adjusted ebitda at emergence to 3 1 times at the end of 2021 and moreover transformed the right side of our balance sheet from entirely secured to substantially unsecured debt and by transforming the magnitude and composition of our debt we have put ourselves we believe on the cusp of investment grade ratings we ve demonstrated the resilience of our assets and of our tenants through 100 on time cash rent collection throughout the covid pandemic to date most importantly for vici s stockholders we generated from october 18 2017 through december 31 2021 a total return of 100 5 this compares to the s p 500 total return of 100 7 over that period and a total return for the rmz of 58 9 meaning vici outperformed the rmz over that period by 41 6 percentage points here s a simpler way of looking at it 1 invested into vici at the beginning of that period became 2 1 invested into the rmz over the same period became 1 59 an integral part of vici s superior total return has been vici s dividend growth over the period with aggregate dividend per share growth of 37 1 since our first full quarter dividend payment in q2 2018 we re proud of the value we ve created over our first four years but here s what we re really excited about today we just closed yesterday on the acquisition of one of the most magnificent class a assets in american commercial real estate the venetian let me reiterate the features we cited when we announced the venetian transaction nearly a year ago the venetian is the single largest hotel complex in america with nearly 7 100 rooms the venetian is the largest private sector meeting convention trade show facility in america at 13 million square feet of class a quality finding another building in america with more marble we have bought the venetian at a price per square foot of approximately 300 82 acres of land that included an estimated 62 discount replacement cost when we announced the venetian acquisition in early march 2021 the covid 19 pandemic was still heavily and negatively impacting las vegas visitation and resort performance apollo our new venetian operating partner and vici were both mindful of that and in a period when most potential venetian buyers were not willing or able to come out into the heavy weather vici and apollo were able to craft a transaction that a protected against continuing uncertainty but was fundamentally based in the belief that las vegas and moreover the venetian would eventually return to 2019 levels of performance what vici and apollo did not assume when we announced this transaction in march 2021 is that las vegas and the venetian would over the ensuing 12 months stage a roaring comeback achieving run rate profitability levels that are beyond 2019 over the last 12 months rob goldstein and patrick dumont s team at las vegas sands led by george marcantonis have done a magnificent job of managing the venetian as lbs reported on january 26 the venetian produced these eye popping performance figures in q4 2021 100 occupancy of the venetian s nearly 7 100 rooms and doing so without the full return of meeting convention trade show business for the fourth quarter the venetian generated 154 million of adjusted property ebitda at a margin of 34 5 this amount of ebitda annualized would mean over 600 million of run rate ebitda before rent or nearly 2 5 times coverage of our initial venetian annual rent of 250 million as for value i just want to remind everyone that we have acquired the venetian again one of the most magnificent and majestic class a assets in american commercial real estate at a cap rate of 6 25 which we believe makes this one of the most compelling class a single asset transactions in america reit management in recent years and if it isn t selling you need to tell me what comped it and here as much work as i put into preparing these remarks i actually i have to quote one of you who posted last night this statement which i think says better than anything i ve said what we did in buying the venetian to quote simply put vici got a pretty sweet deal by looking past the short term disruption in las vegas created by covid vici was able to get one of the most iconic real estate assets in the country for a cap rate that today couldn t even buy you a well located dollar general finally not only did we buy venetian at a 6 25 cap rate we have leased the class a real estate of the venetian to apollo on a triple net basis with the superior economic transparency and integrity that the triple net lease model generally provides and that highlights the final point i want to make about our first four years at vici over this period one can say that we have brought gaming real estate into the triple net lease sector but i think what s more important is that we have brought the superiority of the triple net lease model to class a real estate triple net real estate is sometimes criticized for being commodity real estate in low barrier to entry locations bought at a premium to replacement cost here s what we ve done in vici in our first four years in real estate investment terms we ve built america s biggest and best portfolio of differentiated non commodity class a experiential real estate in high barrier to entry locations bought at substantial discounts to replacement cost and here may be the most important portfolio attribute of all our real estate is occupied by we believe the best experiential operators in the world as evidenced by their market leading resilience during the darkest days of the covid 19 pandemic and their market leading recovery to unprecedented levels of profitability thanks for bearing with me while i share my excitement for what we ve done at vici and now i ll turn the call over to john payne who will share our excitement over what we re doing to continue to grow vici john john payne president and chief operating officer thanks ed good morning everyone 2021 sure was another successful and transformative year for vici as we announced over 21 billion of transactions solidifying our position as the no 1 experiential reit in terms of acquisition volume significantly increasing our scale and furthering our credibility as one of america s blue chip reits as ed said we are very happy to announce that the acquisition of venetian las vegas closed yesterday and our acquisition of mgp remains on track to close in the first half of this year since we announced the acquisition of the venetian we witnessed cap rate compression in las vegas seemingly in real time with city center trading at a 5 5 cap rate and the cosmopolitan at a 4 97 cap additionally since our announced acquisition of mgp regional cap rates have continued to compress with encore boston harbor a large scale high quality urban asset recently trading at a cap rate in the high 5s we have been pounding the table about the quality of gaming real estate and its superior investment characteristics relative to many real estate asset classics classes since our formation we believe that in many ways the most recent trading cap rates are directly applicable to the value of the assets in our portfolio it is gratifying to see our thesis come to fruition and we believe there s much more to come as gaming real estate becomes a mainstream real estate asset class upon closing our mgp transaction we believe we will have a portfolio of assets with quality unmatched by any other leisure real estate portfolio our rental streams and underlying asset cash flow durability has proven through the has been proven through the pandemic we have tenant relationships with industry leading operators who utilize extensive crm capabilities to be engaged with the consumers and as many of you know these capabilities combined with our tenants operational expertise has led to record profitability in las vegas and across the region now as we think about vici s future growth prospects we see a long runway for growth within gaming many operators continue to study and understand how vici s capital can be utilized in their capital stack and we have regular dialogue with a number of public and private operators that continue to own their real estate additionally we ve started allocating capital toward other leisure verticals which we believe will round out our investments over time we will approach additional leisure investments in a prudent manner by studying the opportunities and market dynamics in detail and perform an appropriate diligence and risk reward analysis prior to allocating capital on behalf of our shareholders one of our fundamental goals as a company is to grow earnings per share accretively on behalf of our shareholders we believe this aligns our success with the interest of our shareholders and we do not approach investments blindly in order to just satisfy investment volumes or other arbitrary measurements to that end i will repeat the pillars that we believe will drive accretive growth for vici and create value for our shareholders well into the future we will strive to execute the compelling opportunities in our embedded growth pipeline we will study and evaluate open market gaming transactions in the united states and internationally we will partner with existing tenants under our property growth fund through which we will seek to fund high return growth projects at our existing properties and we will allocate resources toward studying leisure and experiential investments as well as large scale m a opportunities now i ll turn the call over to david who will discuss our balance sheet and our financial results david david kieske chief financial officer great thanks john i want to start with our balance sheet 2021 continued the relentless focus we have maintained over our four plus years of existence on ensuring that we have a capital structure designed to weather all cycles and provide the safety and protection our equity and credit partners deserve this disciplined focus was rewarded during 2021 by first the depth of the support from the equity capital markets to de risk the equity funding for our 21 billion of announced acquisitions and second from the culmination of one of our most important objectives since emergence and that is to finally transform our balance sheet into an unsecured borrower as ed mentioned we believe we are on the cusp of achieving an investment grade rating to recap as we look back at 2021 in march we raised 2 billion of equity through a 69 million share forward sale agreement in september we raised 3 4 billion of equity through a 65 million share regular way offering and a 50 million share forward sale agreement raising 5 4 billion of equity is not something we take for granted and we greatly appreciate the support of our equity holders to be able to de risk the equity funding and take advantage of two unique opportunities that presented themselves during the year the september offering in fact was recognized by international financing review or ifr as the north america secondary equity issue of the year we are thankful to our underwriters led by morgan stanley as well as a full syndicate of banks for the support to be able to execute the largest common equity follow on ever by a reit in september we fully repaid our 2 1 billion secured term loan this was a critical step on our path toward investment grade also in september we announced the successful early participation in the exchange offer and consent solicitation for the 4 2 billion of outstanding mgp notes as a result upon closing of the mgp transaction the covenants under the existing mgp indentures will be aligned with the covenants restrictions and events in default under the existing vici indentures in december we entered into a forward starting interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of 500 million subsequent to year end we entered into three additional agreements with a notional amount of 1 5 billion the interest rate swap transactions so far totaling 2 billion are intended to reduce the variability in the interest expense related to the debt we expect to incur with the closing of the mgp acquisition in addition subsequent to year end we closed on a new 2 5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility and a 1 billion delayed draw term loan increasing our overall liquidity with highly efficient bank capital the revolver maturity runs to march of 2026 before extension options with grid based pricing based on the company s current credit ratings the revolving credit facility bears interest at sofr plus 132 5 basis points an improvement in pricing from 200 basis points over libor under our prior secured revolving credit facility just to recap the venetian funding which we closed yesterday we settled the march and september outstanding forward sale agreements bringing 119 million shares onto our balance sheet for total proceeds of approximately 3 2 billion we drew 600 million on our revolver with the remaining proceeds coming from cash to close the 4 billion venetian acquisition i also want to highlight that the settlement of the two forward sale agreements will all but eliminate the outsized short interest that vici has been subject to as of january 31 we had approximately 85 million shares of short interest which the majority was from the mechanics of the forward sale agreements to summarize 2021 and the events at the start of 2022 highlighted our guiding principles on how we approach our balance sheet which are to maintain a long term target leverage goal of five to five and a half on a net debt to ebitda basis maintain an unsecured capital structure and an unencumbered asset pool pursue a disciplined composition and laddering of fixed rate debt safeguarding the company s balance sheet against future market volatility opportunistically accessing the capital markets to lock in funding certainty for all transactions and ultimately achieving an investment grade rating we have been relentless in our drive toward an investment grade rating and we believe the actions we took during 2021 and at the start of 2022 should position vici to be able to access the investment grade market when we seek to raise the 4 4 billion permitted debt required to redeem the mgm op units at the time of closing the mgp transaction all while continuing to maintain ample liquidity flexibility and optionality to grow accretively turning to the income statement affo for the fourth quarter was 278 9 million or 0 44 per share bringing full year 2021 affo to 1 0474 billion or 1 82 per share total affo in 2021 increased 25 3 year over year while affo per share increased approximately 11 over the prior year the disparity between overall affo growth and affo per share growth is due to an increase in our share count and resulting temporary dilution from the march and september forward equity offerings our fully diluted share count increased approximately 12 9 primarily as the result of the settlements of the june 2020 forward sale agreement in september of 2021 which added 26 9 million shares to our balance sheet in the regular way portion of the september offering which added 65 million shares to our balance sheet the proceeds from both of these offerings were used to repay the 2 1 billion secured term loan in september we refer you to our press release where we ve added two tables detailing our outstanding common shares and a reconciliation of the weighted average shares of common stock used in the calculation of earnings per share these tables are on page 5 of our release that was posted to our website last night our results once again highlight our highly efficient triple net model given the significant increase in adjusted ebitda as a proportion of the corresponding increase in revenue and our margins continue to run strong in the high 90 range when eliminating noncash items our g a was 9 million for the quarter and as a percentage of total revenue was only 2 4 in line with our full year expectations and one of the lowest ratios in the triple net sector finally i want to touch on our leverage we ended 2021 with net debt to ebitda of 3 1 times and pro forma for the venetian closing our net debt to ebitda is 3x this highlights the fact that we have significantly over equitized the balance sheet ahead of the closing of the mgp acquisition positioning our balance sheet to raise the incremental debt required to complete the funding and bringing on the associated income with that transaction as i touch on guidance this will be important we are initiating affo guidance for 2022 in both absolute dollars as well as on a per share basis as a reminder our guidance does not include the impact on operating results from any pending or possible future acquisitions specifically the pending acquisition of mgp or dispositions capital markets activity or other nonrecurring transactions as we have discussed we record a noncash cecl charge on a quarterly basis which due to its inherent unpredictability leaves us unable to forecast net income and ffo with accuracy accordingly our guidance is affo focused as we believe affo represents the best way of measuring the productivity of our equity investments in evaluating our financial performance and ability to pay dividends our guidance incorporates the recently closed venetian acquisition and the settlement of the 119 million shares that were subject to the march and september forward sale agreements we expect affo for the year ending december 31 2022 will be between 1 317 billion and 1 347 billion or between 1 80 and 1 84 per diluted share the midpoint of our total affo guidance on an absolute dollars represents an increase of 27 2 versus our 2021 actual affo on a per share basis guidance reflects all of the equity raised to close the transactions we announced in 2021 and thus the corresponding increase in vici s share count without the benefit of the corresponding income from the pending mgp transaction accordingly we expect to update guidance in the future to reflect the impact of the mgp transaction when we are in a position to do so with that operator please open the line for questions questions answers operator of course thank you our first question comes from rj milligan with raymond james rj your line is now open rj milligan raymond james analyst good morning guys i wanted to maybe ask a bigger picture question ed what do you think of realty income s entry in the gaming asset class what does that mean for vici obviously adds more competition but you have a new operator embracing the sale leaseback model pricing sort of implies that your stock is undervalued but maybe lower cap rates hurt spread in the future how do you think about those different puts and takes ed pitoniak chief executive officer yeah rj always good to chat with you net net it is unalloyed positive to have an institution of the quality and stature of realty income come in and validate our category realty income goes back to 1969 they ve built an amazing company sumit has obviously continued to drive excellence at that company and drive very judicious allocation of capital both categorically and geographically so we ve been saying as john spoke of in his remarks rj we ve been saying since the beginning that this is an asset class that we believe is the next great institutionalization story in american commercial real estate well institutionalization does not happen if institutions don t come into the category and the more institutions come into the category the further institutionalized it is there are puts and takes you re absolutely right when there s more competition we have to work hard every single day to make sure that our cost of capital over the longer term leaving aside the volatility we face in this current situation like this and over time we re improving the cost of capital on both an absolute and or a relative basis at a velocity equal to the rate of cap rate compression so again net net we see it as very positive and i think in this case especially validating of regional assets with the mgp transaction we will be become the owners the very proud owners of assets like national harbor right on the potomac river in d c we will become owners of the borgata of mgm detroit of beau rivage these are assets that are absolutely in the same class as encore boston and as john also alluded to in his remarks if you look through the cap rate of wynn boston and what we are acquiring in mgp in terms of preeminent regional assets we re obviously very happy with the revaluation that we believe our shareholders deserve rj milligan raymond james analyst thanks for those comments ed and then my second question is just can you be a little bit more specific on the expected timing of the closing of the mgp transaction and then maybe david what you re seeing out there in the debt markets and expected pricing for the debt that s going to be issued ed pitoniak chief executive officer samantha you want to take timing and then david can talk financing samantha gallagher executive vice president general counsel and secretary sure just on timing i ll just mention that we do continue to work through the process with all the applicable jurisdictions and remain on pace for a closing in the first half of 2022 david kieske chief financial officer thanks samantha and rj as it relates to the debt markets as i mentioned in my remarks we ve built a 2 billion hedge portfolio to start to minimize the volatility that we re witnessing obviously real time today one of the aspects a couple of the aspects that we have going forward is when we underwrote the venetian as well as mgp we underwrote that in the high yield markets and with the work that our team has done with the agencies and as we mentioned in our remarks we feel very confident that we ll be issuing debt into the investment grade market when we can do so and once we re positioned through regulatory approval which samantha just alluded to so our underwriting remains in line with what we underwrote originally even with the uptick in rates and obviously today is a unique day with the volatility going out on in the markets but for 10 year pricing we re getting quotes in the high 100 low 200 over treasury for 10 year paper so on a blended basis we still feel good about our overall accretion and everything that we laid out for you back in august of last year rj milligan raymond james analyst thanks a lot ed pitoniak chief executive officer thank you rj operator thank you rj our next question comes from wes golladay with baird wes your line is now open wes golladay robert w baird and company analyst hi good morning everyone can you talk about your appetite to buy more assets while mgp is still pending and you currently have a little bit higher cost of capital i believe caesars mentioned on their call they were going to be looking to sell an asset over the near term ed pitoniak chief executive officer yeah i ll take the last part of that and i ll turn it over to john in terms of our ongoing energy around growth activities yes you did see tom reeg announced last week his intentions to bring an asset to market and obviously we will take full advantage of the opportunity we have to get that very full first look and to see what possible advantages this the addition of another asset could have and the addition of other relationships but i just want to emphasize the fact that given obviously not only the volatility in the market but what are the hallmarked practices of great capital allocators as a good real estate capital allocator you never want the answer to the question of why did you buy that to be well it was for sale right i went to work for somebody who had a great adage which is spend every dollar of capital like it s the last one you have so whatever the opportunities may be we will only allocate capital if we feel versus our other alternatives it is the best use of capital at a given time and then in terms of our ongoing growth activities i ll turn it over to john john payne president and chief operating officer yeah good morning wes as you know these deals don t happen over the first lunch so we re very active continuing to talk to the operators on the gaming side as we had since we started the company and we re spending as i said in my remarks quite a bit of time in what we call the hospitality or experiential space sitting down with c suite executives of certain companies in certain industries explaining how our capital could help them grow and we could be partners over time so we re very active and as ed said we ll be very prudent in the way that we put out our capital wes golladay robert w baird and company analyst ok and then there is a strong bid for the regional assets would you entertain recycling assets selling some assets if they re seizing the opportunity with something you like or would you look to lean in a little bit of leverage maybe go over your i guess i think you mentioned dave 5 5 on the high end is where you want leverage would you be willing to take leverage a little higher than that i guess how would you fund it if you were to find something ed pitoniak chief executive officer david david kieske chief financial officer yeah wes i mean we re going to look at alternatives that are in front of us as it relates to recycling assets i mean that s not we have recycled an asset in atlantic city an asset in reno we just in our release we sold louisiana downs so potentially there could be that opportunity there could be a potential jv opportunities you ve obviously seen mgp joint venture some assets in the past and then the attractiveness of a reit and the ability to issue op units that we are doing directly to mgm glpi is doing that to cordish so there s other avenues of equity as it relates to taking leverage up we re pretty disciplined with our dialogue with the agencies of our goal we ve gotten a path to take leverage up to six times when you take leverage up often that s just that s financial engineering to drive accretion and that s something that we strive to do so we ll stay within our guidepost but i think there s other tools in the toolbox that a reit can bring to the table to as john said pursue opportunities that we re in dialogue with wes golladay robert w baird and company analyst ok thanks everyone for the time david kieske chief financial officer thanks wes ed pitoniak chief executive officer thanks wes operator thank you wes our next question comes from greg mcginniss with scotiabank greg your line is now open greg mcginniss scotiabank analyst hey good morning so just curious it sounds like realty income was able to get kind of boston encore deal without any competing offers so had you previously tried to acquire this asset and any thoughts as to why wynn did not run a bid process on that location and i guess do you think you would have been competitive at the 5 9 cap with no capex minimums ed pitoniak chief executive officer i ll turn it over to john in a moment greg but you absolutely would have to ask wynn why they did not run a process sumit roy in realty income s earnings call yesterday as you are implicitly referring to clearly stated there was no process and again you d to have to ask wynn why did you not run a process and above and beyond that i don t know how much more we can or should say about the asset given that we were not part of the process but john i ll hand it over to you to see what you might want to say john payne president and chief operating officer i think we ve already said it look it s a great validation of the value of our real estate right i mean if you take national harbor there s an asset as good a quality i d even say it s better quality right and so the cap rate that s put on that asset really just is a validation of what we ve been talking about for four years when we started this company greg mcginniss scotiabank analyst ok and i guess just two follow ups on kind of potential investments so thinking about the partner property growth fund how are you guys viewing the likelihood of those transactions occurring or maybe the potential to reach the 1 billion and separately 1 5 billion max amounts ed pitoniak chief executive officer john john payne president and chief operating officer well we re having active conversations with all our tenants about opportunities where they can use our capital to grow we can gain incremental rent over time i m not a big guy who tells you predicts what exactly we re going to do but what i can tell you is this fund has been well received by our tenants and i think there are some large projects growth projects in the future that i believe we ll be a part of with our tenants and it will be exciting to be exciting to help them grow and be exciting to help us grow ed pitoniak chief executive officer greg the think i would just add in regard to our property partner property growth fund is that when the projects achieve the needed return hurdle and of course our investments will be contingent upon them clearly demonstrating that they can achieve that hurdle we are in extremely attractive source of capital for our partners based on the cost of our capital because when the given investments can achieve the necessary hurdles the cost of our capital should not be compared only to the cost of the debt capital of our partners it really given that we can in many cases alleviate them the need for them to put in any incremental equity the cost of our capital should be compared not again to the cost of their debt capital but to their weighted average cost of capital inclusive of both equity and debt and on that basis we become again a very compelling source of low cost capital greg mcginniss scotiabank analyst ok i guess just the final piece of the pipeline so you got this potential rofr which you guys said you ll be evaluating this whether or not that s within the portfolio but also the centaur call the indiana caesars assets that you can potentially call this year can you just remind us how the pricing is determined there and whether the caesars investment is part impact your desire to get something done in the near term ed pitoniak chief executive officer john john payne president and chief operating officer i ll let david talk a little bit about the structure i ll talk about the assets first of all they re just great assets they re big they re growing as you touched on caesars just rebranded the asset one of the assets in indianapolis to a horseshoe they re investing large chunks of capital into both of the businesses there as table games was legalized at these casinos and so these assets have not only grown under the caesars leadership they will continue to grow as these assets get the capital and they ve stabilized so we re continuing to watch it we think these are going to be great additions to our portfolio and then david can tell you a little bit how the deal was structured and how it would enter into our master lease david david kieske chief financial officer sure thanks john as you referenced that put call started january 1 of this year it runs to december 31 2024 we can call those two assets at a 7 7 cap or tom and team can put them to us at an 8 cap it s an ltm coverage ratio that was set at 1 3 times part of the reason we agreed to that within the broader funding of eldorado s acquisition at caesars is that those assets will go into the regional master lease and so those are two very attractive assets as john alluded to and something that we ll assess as how we sequence that into our growth and the cadence that we have internally with everything else going on over the period of time but just given where cap rates have gone we re very excited to potentially own those assets at some point here ed pitoniak chief executive officer let me just add in regard to the 1 3 coverage as david spoke of these will go into the regional master lease but we got comfortable when tom reeg closed that coverage level to us a few years ago based upon our confidence that the new caesars under tom s leadership would achieve corporate profitability levels that could give us very strong corporate rent coverage making us comfortable with the 1 3 well it s needless to say tom s team have greatly exceeded our expectations in terms of the corporate profitability there and will achieve at caesars and thus again to restress the point why in this case at the asset level we were willing to take on that asset level coverage given what is proving to be rather magnificent corporate level rent coverage which is part of a corporate rent guarantee john payne president and chief operating officer and i just want to add one more thing david said that i don t want to make sure it s lost we have the right to call this at a 7 7 cap and there was a transaction that just happened in the regional markets for a 5 9 cap greg mcginniss scotiabank analyst well great thank you operator thank you greg our next question comes from barry jonas with truist barry your line is now open barry jonas truist securities analyst great thank you for taking my questions you guys obviously have and will have the largest portfolio in gaming right now i m curious if there are any geographies or segments of the market you re less inclined to expand on at this point ed pitoniak chief executive officer john john payne president and chief operating officer i ll take that barry i ll take that barry i ll answer it more in there s areas of opportunity where we d like to own real estate if you think of the las vegas market which i know barry you follow closely you look at the regional performers there how well they ve performed during before the pandemic and after the pandemic or as they were coming out of the pandemic we don t own any real estate in downtown las vegas if you see how circa has changed that market and the way people think about that market tillman and his team have done a great job there for years so if there s an opportunity on real estate in the downtown las vegas market which is a big market we don t own assets in reno colorado rhode island we don t have pittsburgh lake charles others so there s still quite a few gaming markets that we don t own assets and as we talked earlier we ve got a rofr here on another las vegas asset so many opportunities for us haven t had opportunities where i m saying i wouldn t go into but i m sure there s a few we feel like we ve got enough real estate but i really want an answer to that of where we see that there s continued opportunity barry jonas truist securities analyst that s really helpful and then just as a follow up given the current macro environment we re seeing i m curious if that s impacted the timing or pace of any m a discussions you may be having ed pitoniak chief executive officer barry it s been a pretty wild four years right i wouldn t bother naming the ball but we had the interest rate kind of crack up of spring of 18 we had december of 18 which none of us hopefully have to live through again anytime soon we ve obviously had march of 2020 we have obviously learned to live and deal with volatility at vici and i think if we ve taken one key lesson it s that don t stop developing relationships in times of volatility because times of volatility will eventually come to an end so to be honest with you we just shut out the noise and we keep doing what we re doing we obviously can t be heedless by any means of our cost of capital at any given time and have to take care to make sure we know where the money is going to come from and what the money is going to cost us but again i just want to reemphasize the point that periods of volatility cannot be periods of dormancy in terms of our fundamental activity every single day which is working to develop relationships will ultimately turn into deal flow barry jonas truist securities analyst that s great thanks guys ed pitoniak chief executive officer thank you barry operator thank you barry our next question comes from daniel adam with loop capital markets daniel your line is now open daniel adam loop capital markets analyst hi thank you and good morning everyone just to follow up on realty income s deal for encore boston i m curious whether you guys think the sub 6 cap rate marks a turning point or new normal if you will for regional asset valuations in general or whether you see that as more of a one off just given the quality and location of encore ed pitoniak chief executive officer yeah daniel always good to hear from you i may have mentioned this on prior earnings calls but one of the things i am struck by within gaming generally in gaming real estate specifically is we have not yet come up with a widely accepted hierarchy of quality classification right as many of you know i used to work in the hotel sector where there s a clearly accepted well there s a few clearly accepted hierarchies of quality whether it s based on stars five four three two so on and so forth or whether it s luxury upper upscale and so on and so forth well that categorization does not yet exist in gaming really doesn t exist so much on the strip and it definitely doesn t exist in regional so if you were to try to impose a hierarchy of quality on regional gaming there is a highest level of regional gaming asset quality that would include assets like encore boston national harbor mgm detroit borgata beau rivage caesars new orleans especially after the caesars team puts in the capital that they re about to spend harrah s atlantic city there is this higher tier of assets and encore boston has set a new benchmark cap rate for the highest tier regional assets and usually when the top category in an asset class establishes a new benchmark in terms of lower cap rates there can and usually is a slip stream effect on the lower quality lower categories of quality so i guess maybe your implicit question does encore boston create a slip stream not only for the highest end regional properties which we will be the market leader in owning but will it also create upstream for other regional assets and we believe it would because again you look at the resiliency through covid you look at the indispensability of the asset to the operator you look at the barriers to entry if you look at all of the classic real estate valuation metrics and frameworks you have to concede these are really good assets and they are woefully underpriced daniel adam loop capital markets analyst that makes a ton of sense i appreciate that and then just as a follow up i think in the prepared remarks you mentioned evaluating deals outside of the u s are there any markets in particular that you re focused on internationally ed pitoniak chief executive officer david do you want to take that david kieske chief financial officer sure dan nice to talk to you i mean as we look outside the u s we look most simplistically what s readable and what is a good rule law obviously good real estate but good tax jurisdictions and things jurisdictions like canada australia singapore japan europe u k less maybe less so gaming in the europe u k just given the nature of the boxes but we talked about realty income here a lot going into gaming they ve obviously gone into spain and europe and other jurisdictions you ve seen other reits like simon go abroad so there are opportunities that we re looking at and assessing across the globe and as we continue to grow we ve got the infrastructure and the expertise to do so and we look to continue to develop those opportunities and ultimately bring those sorts of opportunities into our portfolio over time daniel adam loop capital markets analyst ok great thanks so much guys david kieske chief financial officer thank you daniel operator thank you daniel our next question comes from smedes rose with citi smedes your line is now open michael bilerman citi analyst hey it s michael bilerman here with smedes ed i wanted to come back to your opening comments and you spent some time talking about the last four years since emerging as a new public entity even with the successes that you ve had and the total return and the dividend growth which has all been pretty strong i wanted to get your sense of how you think about issuing equity in the future just in the sense that if you were to break down the different periods of time in your total return there clearly has been a little bit more of a lackluster performance since last summer i think driven in part by the overhangs that you ve created with the equity issuances but also the commitments that you have going forward and the fact that leverage levels are toward the higher end of where you want it to be and then you look at the valuation of the company today relative to right before the pandemic and it s actually widened relative to reits as reits have done a little bit better from that time frame point to point even though you ve talked about all the positives that have occurred since prepandemic including the fact that all your tenants pay rent which no one thought going into any type of recession would have happened so i want you to sort of step back and think about it more so over the recent time frame in terms of the performance and how you believe you re going to be able to drive outperformance from this point forward and how the sort of equity issuance ties into that ed pitoniak chief executive officer yeah michael it is a profound and extremely important question it is one david and i especially have been wrestling with really going back to last fall soon after we raised the equity for mgp which we did use yesterday for the venetian but that s all because of the fungibility of cash yes it s a profound question and i would say that our strategy going forward having done the transformative deals we ve done venetian to a degree but especially mgp is that having achieved the scale we ve achieved having in place some of the built in growth elements that we do have we really want to begin to develop more of a flow model we want gaming and nongaming to achieve the cadence of deal flow that is both more sustained simple and accordingly we want our fundraising activities to be frankly less gargantuan you are absolutely right it s been a slog since well especially since late summer we actually won in late summer it was pretty much the week of labor day things have turned and then that happened to be we raised the equity for mgp and we re glad we did it when we did michael and we do thank the citi team for their help in doing so and we realized that that sheer amount of equity 5 5 billion in 2021 did have a weighty effect on the performance of our stock and we really appreciate the patience of our shareholders we were very pleased to see the 12 31 13 assets seeing how steady our core shareholders remain through the turbulence of q4 and we re hopeful that that is still prove to be the case here in q1 going forward we do want to create a business model that is sustained and sustainable and lessens our chance on these kinds of gargantuan equity raises i hope that gets to the core of the question you were asking michael bilerman citi analyst yeah and i think taking a step further it still feels as though there is some level of overhang on the shares given all the positives and the accretive nature of the transactions that you ve done right estimates have been moving up yet the multiple has been contracting and so i think that there s certainly amount of nervousness about a next gargantuan raise a to finally deal with the funding of closing mgp but also these other types of transactions whether they be the rofr and i think that there s just this tension in the marketplace and so that s where i was trying to get at is where your heads at now in terms of eliminating this overhang that appears to be on your shares and maybe you need another potential to raise before you get into this more normal pace and that s where i m just trying to i don t know where your heads at in terms of financing this level of growth given this for commitment to wanting to get to investment grade as well ed pitoniak chief executive officer yeah so just to be clear we do not need to raise any further equity for mgp we have raised all the equity we need we will be raising only debt we will obviously have a share exchange on a fixed exchange ratio with the mgp shareholders including mgm so there s no equity further needed for mgp and when it comes to a rofr or any other opportunity again just to reemphasize the point we re very mindful of the fact that we need to consider every possible way of funding such opportunities if and only if they re compellingly accretive for our shareholders and it will be our bias to not have to raise our grants to an amount of equity because we re very conscious of the fact that we need to give our shareholders understood broadly a chance to realize that revaluation that they deserve and it will be easier to achieve if we do not go out into the market and raise a little town of equity to use the technical term michael bilerman citi analyst so are you having those discussions today in terms of joint ventures or selling incremental land parcels or assets outright to put yourself in a funding position so that when a pitch comes down you ve already been funded getting to this point where you almost go below your target leverage levels and sort of eliminate that as an overhang ed pitoniak chief executive officer yeah we are looking at all those things and maybe i ll just turn it over to david quickly and he can talk about the way in which we are going to very strategically use the amount of retained cash that we will be building up given our payout ratio david david kieske chief financial officer yeah thanks ed and michael always good to talk to you i mean even just taking a step back when we went into the mgp transaction in june july august we assessed all options around how do we navigate what is ultimately a significant capital raise i mean 3 4 billion of equity and that s something we took lightly and something that we had a lot of other levers that we could have potentially pulled and we were able to obviously execute that with everybody s help but as we closed mgp here and samantha said the first half of the year and then is moving along very well you get to kind of a run rate of roughly 2 billion of affo sorry i m getting a little feedback take 75 of that out for dividends you ve got roughly 500 million of free cash flow and that is true free cash flow as you know we have no capex we have our g a is our g a there s not a lot of other items that need to come out of that free cash flow so if you lever that two to one that s 1 billion of buying power that we have internally to continue to deliver the growth that we ve delivered since day 1 michael bilerman citi analyst great and then just second topic just in terms of encore and the wynn how do you it obviously was a negotiated transaction between wynn and realty income i think when you listen to wynn speak you obviously hear the desire of them to have negotiated items that were very important to their enterprise and obviously realty income had to get what they wanted to get out of it as you think about these leases obviously the encore didn t have a capex requirement it had bumps that were below 2 for the first 10 years how do you think about the structure of that transaction put aside the pricing because you ve made your comments that you thought it validated and was rich from that perspective setting a new mark for these regional assets but how do you think about the individual key terms and what are the critical factors for you as you continue to grow in gaming real estate ed pitoniak chief executive officer yes michael i think realty income and vici are fairly different companies running different kinds of rent roles running different kinds of risks i think i saw in sumit s remarks that their weighted average lease term at this point is 14 years ours is 43 5 years so given that delta in just for example weighted average lease terms things that are really important to us like the magnitude of rent escalation like the magnitude of capex maybe more important to us than to sumit where wynn will represent i think encore will represent 3 of his rent rule i think we both have different levers we both have we both run different profiles so what would be really important to us may be less important to him michael bilerman citi analyst yeah and that s what i was just trying to get about what are your sort of nonnegotiables in terms of when you go into these what you re willing to accept and what you re not it sounds like the capex side and a certain sort of growth rate given the longer lease duration are important variables for you is there anything else obviously corporate coverage here was north of two times and that should grow given the performance of the asset just what are the other variables that are critical for you as you continue to embark down this road ed pitoniak chief executive officer well obviously one right now that s very very critical is some measure of cpi protection and correct me if i m wrong but once we achieve cpi protection in our mgm lease and danny step in here if i m getting this wrong 90 will have cpi protection built into it and needless to say we ve always thought that to be important michael but it feels really much more important right now than it did one year or two ago michael bilerman citi analyst right but you don t have capital reduction ed pitoniak chief executive officer michael i m sorry michael that broke up michael bilerman citi analyst you said you had a cap on that though don t you there s a limit to that inflation protection ed pitoniak chief executive officer we do in some leases we don t in others the caesars leases are uncapped which is why we posted a 5 0 odd percent rent increase on november 1 out of the caesars las vegas lease michael bilerman citi analyst ok all right thanks guys see you in the second half ed pitoniak chief executive officer yes indeed looking forward to it john payne president and chief operating officer operator we ll take one more question operator ok our next question comes from todd thomas with keybanc todd your line is now open todd thomas keybanc capital markets analyst yeah thanks yeah hi good morning i appreciate the comments around the timing of the closing being on track for the first half of the year with regards to mgp but what are the primary hurdles to closing that remain and then david your understanding of the timing to achieve an investment grade rating what s the time line look there ed pitoniak chief executive officer david why don t you start with the time line and maybe samantha step in with further process on mgp david david kieske chief financial officer yeah happy to good to talk to you todd look we re in regular dialogue with the agencies we started talking to them end of june july of last year and if it s not every other day it s weekly or biweekly that we connect with the agencies to give them updates along the way we updated them on the revolving credit facility we updated them on the closing of the or the consent solicitation of the shareholder vote we ve updated them on the closing of the venetian yesterday and they are waiting on final approvals which samantha can talk about but they want a little bit of certainty that it s going to close and we have no concerns that it will close but the agencies just want to kind of be have a little bit more clarity around that so it s a little bit of a chicken and the egg but the body language of signals and everything that we ve gotten is that it s all moving toward that date the issue is none of us really know what that date is and so with that samantha i ll turn it over to you ed pitoniak chief executive officer yes thanks david i think just as we get into hurdles not surprisingly we won t speak about individual processes with the applicable jurisdictions but we do continue to work through all applicable jurisdictions and again i just want to reiterate that we remain confident in the first half closing todd thomas keybanc capital markets analyst ok david kieske chief financial officer sorry just to make it a little bit more clear i mean we do believe that once we get the approvals finalized the agencies will be in a position to act quickly and then once we go to the debt markets after that approval we will be launching with the upgraded rating todd thomas keybanc capital markets analyst ok got it and then regarding the future capital raising initiatives the 4 4 billion of permanent debt that you expect to raise can you just remind us where you expect to be on leverage on a net debt to ebitda basis pro forma the closing and also to the extent that sorry but just also to the extent that a caesars asset or something else does present itself in the near term do you have capacity to execute on something ahead of obtaining an investment grade rating and closing mgp or should we assume that until that transaction closes that there will not be any potential investment activity david kieske chief financial officer let s start with the pro forma leverage for the venetian and for the mgp transaction that will be on a net debt to ebitda basis our run rate is 5 8 times net debt to ebitda and that s inside of the six times that specifically s p has targeted that would give them confidence in upgrading us as it relates to the funding or timing around a potential rofr or other opportunities i mean that goes back to the dialogue that we ve been having around we will assess every option if the opportunity transaction that we re underwriting makes sense and is accretive for our shareholders so it s not an either or and we ve got the team and the capability to do potentially do both operator at this time i will now pass the conference back over to edward pitoniak of vici ed ed pitoniak chief executive officer thank you amber and in closing we want to thank all of you for your engagement with us this morning as you can tell we re very excited about our present situation our near term opportunities and our long term prospects and we look forward to chatting with you again when we report our first quarter results

example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video the dow dropped 830 points thursday morning over concerns of a prolonged conflict by the time the closing bell rang it was up by 92 points houston russia s invasion of ukraine is impacting oil and wheat prices the dow dropped 830 points thursday morning over concerns of a prolonged conflict by the time the closing bell rang it was up by 92 points we haven t seen something on this scale in quite a while in europe said jorge barro fellow in public finance with rice university s baker institute barro says this invasion is unique because it was not a surprise he believes that gave the market time to adjust and helped keep stock prices from falling more barro believes a few factors will impact how much farther the market drop especially the conflict s impact on supply chains for oil grains and semiconductor components from russia and ukraine historically the stock market has recovered and kept rising even after drops from the september 11 attacks in 2001 the recession in 2008 and the start of the pandemic in 2020 there s reason to believe that based on historical events that this one might be another one of those instances where the stock market would bounce back said barro i think it depends on a lot of factors like the long term outlook on interest rates the million dollar question what should people with investments do barro s advice is to decide how much risk you can stomach and research alternatives if you re in a different situation where you re coming up on retirement and you could either buy a house on the beach or live comfortably off of social security for the rest of your life then maybe it s okay to continue investing in higher risk assets like the stock market he said the price of cryptocurrencies have also dropped due to the situation in ukraine while gold prices have gone up
updated february 24 2022 at 5 19 pm et stocks staged a remarkable recovery on thursday bouncing back from a steep plunge earlier in the day after russia s invasion of ukraine spooked markets underlining just how volatile conditions remain in wall street the dow jones industrial average rose 92 points or 0 3 after earlier dropping more than 800 points while the s p 500 rose 1 5 after earlier falling more than 2 the volatility in the nasdaq was even starker the index fell more than 3 in the morning momentarily entering what s known as a bear market but ended the day up 3 3 a bear market is when an index drops by 20 or more from its recent record high the invasion also sent crude prices above 100 a barrel for the first time since 2014 though oil later pared gains still crude prices remain high which is likely to reinforce inflation fears at a time when consumer prices were already surging at their fastest annual pace in 40 years here are four things to know as global markets become volatile how bad are things on wall street right now it s been a tough year for stocks stocks had already been falling though most of the year because of fears about inflation and the prospect of higher interest rates the geopolitical tensions in recent days had already made things worse as investors braced for a russian invasion of ukraine both the dow and the s p entered correction territory this week meaning the indexes had fallen more than 10 from their recent record highs though predicting stock moves is impossible analysts warn sentiment will be cautious for a

images ukrainian servicemen get ready to repel an attack in ukraine s lugansk region on thursday how is this going to affect people in the u s the first impact will be felt through energy markets russia is a major exporter of both oil and natural gas and the prospect of disruptions to its exports have sent prices for both commodities sharply higher in recent days brent crude the global benchmark for oil prices went as high as 105 79 on thursday for the front month contract that surge will likely be felt at the gas pump where consumers in the u s are already paying an average of 3 54 a gallon though it s higher in some states such as california i know this is hard president biden told reporters at the white house americans are already hurting i will do everything in my power to limit the pain the american people are feeling at the gas pump this is critical to me but this aggression cannot go unanswered if it did the consequences for america would be much worse meanwhile surging natural gas prices could mean higher bills for heating and electricity that s even more true in europe which is heavily dependent on natural gas from russia russia is also a significant source of key metals such as aluminum and nickel both of which have wide industrial use and both russia and ukraine are important agricultural exporters together the two countries supply more than a quarter of the world s wheat exports and what about inflation and the u s recovery those are the other potential pain points from the invasion consumer prices surged 7 5 in january from a year earlier the biggest annual gains since 1982 the federal reserve has already indicated it plans to start raising interest rates at its next meeting in march and the central bank is ready to move more aggressively should inflation accelerate yet despite the prospect of higher inflation in the near term it s harder to predict the impact from the invasion over the longer term there s also the prospect that all of the uncertainty from russia s invasion could slow down economic growth revised data from the commerce department on thursday showed the economy grew even faster in the last quarter of 2021 than previously reported expanding at an annual pace of 7 the highest in decades frederic j brown afp via getty images afp via getty images gas prices hit over 6 per gallon at a station in los angeles on wednesday that means the economy came into the new year with a lot of momentum the conflict in ukraine is unlikely to derail that recovery but it is another complication and if growth slows that provides another wrinkle for the federal reserve to consider at it looks to crack down on inflation slower growth could make the fed s plans to raise interest rates a little bit more complicated but central bank officials in recent days have not sounded as if they will change their plans fed chairman jerome powell is set to testify before congress next week for previously scheduled appearances and he s likely to provide more insight into his current thinking what about the impact from global sanctions on russia the u s and european countries are moving to impose tougher sanctions on russia including on its banking and financial systems the u s is also considering limiting exports of certain high tech goods to russia which could affect domestic companies but it s worth noting that russia is a relatively small economy and it s not a big trading partner with the u s the fallout will be greater in europe which has much closer commercial ties with moscow and imports much of its energy needs from the country the wild card is the prospect that russia will retaliate with cyberattacks which could have economic and financial implications in the u s copyright 2022 npr to see more visit

leaders across the world responded to russia s invasion of ukraine russian forces invaded ukraine early on thursday assaulting by land sea and air in the biggest attack by one state against another in europe since the second world war ukrainian forces battled russian invaders from three fronts amid the russian military incursion from the east north and south the day began with missiles raining down on ukrainian cities and ukraine reporting columns of troops pouring across its borders from russia and belarus and landing on the coast from the black and azov seas the invasion led to a warning from us president joe biden that the aggression by russian president vladimir putin would cost russia dearly and caused tens of thousands to flee their homes heavy exchanges of fire were taking place in the regions of sumy and kharkiv in the northeast and kherson and odessa home to ukraine s most important seaport in the south read more explosions were heard before dawn and throughout the morning in kyiv a city of 3 million people gunfire rattled sirens blared and the highway out of the city was choked with traffic as residents fled ukraine s health minister oleh lyashko said 57 people had been killed and 169 wounded on thursday after russia launched the invasion by nightfall on thursday a picture was emerging of fierce fighting across multiple fronts the chernobyl nuclear power plant has been captured by russian forces an adviser to the ukrainian presidential office said on thursday evening the plant is located just 90km north of kyiv russian troops had also captured hostomel airport

territory in the kherson region near russian occupied crimea which was annexed by moscow in 2014 russia s defence ministry said it had destroyed 83 land based ukrainian targets and had achieved all its goals according to interfax news agency ukrainian forces downed two russian helicopters and seven other russian aircraft and destroyed several russian trucks and a platoon from russia s 74th motor rifles brigade has surrendered ukraine s ambassador to the us oksana markarova said ms markarova cited earlier figures that russian attacks had killed 40 ukrainian servicemen and dozens of civilians the mayor of kyiv vitali klitschko ordered a curfew on thursday amid the assault and the ukrainian government declared martial law in an address ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskiy said ukraine

could halt half of high tech imports into russia speaking at the white house mr biden said his administration would limit russia s ability to do business in dollars as well as in other currencies and

larger ambitions than ukraine he wants to in fact re establish the former soviet union that s what this is about emergency services working at the crash site of a ukrainian military plane in the

that had been placed on standby to deploy to nato ally germany he described the current crisis as a dangerous moment for europe but said that freedom would prevail his speech followed an earlier meeting with his g7 counterparts with the group condemning the invasion and saying they would bring forward co ordinated economic and financial sanctions against moscow mr biden also said earlier he was praying for ukrainian victims of an unprovoked and unjustified attack european union leaders on thursday night adopted tough new sanctions on russia hitting its economy and elites in response to the invasion the eu will freeze russian assets in the bloc and halt russian banks access to european financial markets as part of what the eu s foreign policy chief josep borrell described as the harshest package of sanctions we have ever implemented the package will also target russia s trade energy and transport among other sectors and impose export controls in a statement agreed at their emergency summit on the crisis on thursday eu leaders said the new round of sanctions will impose massive and severe consequences on russia for its action mr borrell said earlier in the day these are among the darkest hours of europe since the second world war late on thursday french president emmanuel macron called mr putin to demand the immediate halt to moscow s offensive the élysée palace said the russian assault brought a calamitous end to weeks of fruitless diplomatic efforts by western leaders to avert war with their worst fears about mr putin s ambitions on ukraine realised and led to international condemnation russian embassy on thursday the russian embassy in ireland said the operation has been conducted in response to a request by the leadership of two separatist regions in east ukraine donetsk and luhansk and the action was aimed at stopping the bloodshed inflicted by the ukrainian military upon the people of donbass it said there was no objective to occupy ukraine and that

photograph ap photo evgeniy maloletka nato secretary general jens stoltenberg warned that the military alliance would defend every inch of its territory should russia attack a member country speaking after chairing an emergency meeting of nato envoys mr stoltenberg said the 30 nation security alliance will continue to beef up its defences on its eastern flank near ukraine and russia he said mr biden and his nato counterparts wouldhold an online summit on friday russia has attacked ukraine this is a brutal act of war our thoughts are with the brave people of ukraine mr stoltenberg told reporters peace in our continent has been shattered we now have war in europe on a scale and of a type we thought belonged to history russia treacherously attacked our state in the morning as nazi germany did in the ww2 years tweeted mr zelenskiy russia has embarked on a path of evil but ukraine is defending itself won t give up its freedom no matter what moscow thinks calling on ukrainians to defend their country he said arms would be given to anyone prepared to fight in a statement the department of foreign affairs confirmed that an earlier package of sanctions adopted by the eu following russia s recognition of the donetsk and luhansk regions had come into effect on thursday the eu on thursday summoned russia s ambassador to the eu to demand an immediate end to russia s military actions in ukraine speaking in the house of commons on thursday evening british prime minister boris johnson said russian banks would be excluded from london s financial system as part of further sanctions introduced following the invasion overall we will be imposing asset freezes on more than 100 new entities and individuals mr johnson added shaking a resident of kharkiv the closest big city

brovary a town near kyiv authorities there said russia denied reports its aircraft or armoured vehicles had been destroyed russian backed separatists claimed to have downed two ukrainian planes in an early morning declaration of war on thursday mr putin said he had ordered a special military operation to protect people including russian citizens subjected to genocide in ukraine an accusation the west calls baseless propaganda and for this we will strive for the demilitarisation and denazification of ukraine mr putin said russia cannot feel safe develop and exist with a constant threat emanating from the territory of modern ukraine all responsibility for bloodshed will be on the conscience of the ruling regime in ukraine even with a full blown invasion under way and despite such claims mr putin s ultimate aim is obscure the outright annexation of such a vast hostile country could be beyond russia s military capabilities but if the aim is just to replace mr zelenskiy s government it is hard to see ukrainians accepting any new leadership russia might try to install background a democratic country of 44 million people ukraine is europe s biggest country by area after russia itself it voted overwhelmingly for independence after the fall of the soviet union and aims to join nato and the eu aspirations that infuriate moscow mr putin who denied for months he was planning an invasion despite a military build up on ukraine s borders has called ukraine an artificial construct carved from russia by its enemies a characterisation ukrainians see as an attempt to erase their more than 1 000 year old history while many ukrainians particularly in the east speak russian as a native language virtually all identify as a separate nationality three hours after mr

nashville tenn wtvf tennessee lawmakers have joined leaders across the world in denouncing russia s decision to launch a broad military assault on ukraine while some leaders from the volunteer state are condemning russian president vladimir putin others have focused on criticizing the biden administration s response to the conflict u s senator bill hagerty spoke out against president biden s strategy leading up to the invasion ukraine and its people are now under attack the russian dictator has brought war to the european continent president biden s strategy to prevent this invasion has failed despite ukrainian president zelensky s persistent call for pre invasion sanctions the biden administration chose to do nothing until it was too late and must now change course i m calling on president biden to immediately demonstrate american strength by moving to reclaim our energy independence secure our own borders put in place safeguards to protect our critical infrastructure impose decisive economic and financial hardship on putin s regime work with our allies and partners including nato to boost ukraine s capability to defend itself and strengthen nato s own defensive capabilities president biden must recognize the gravity and severity of this moment and do everything in his power to protect the safety and security of the american people sen hagerty u s senator marsha blackburntweeted her prayers for the people of ukraine while also calling for more severe sanctions against russia we pray for the people of ukraine as they defend against putin s attempt to rebuild the old soviet union biden must stand up to putin and immediately levy severe sanctions against russia starting with removal from the swift banking system the usa stands with ukraine sen blackburn u s rep jim cooper called putin the new stalin while calling for further sanctions dictators like putin have a short term advantage particularly in their own back yard but his naked aggression will not be rewarded because the rest of the world sees putin as he is the new stalin nato and our allies must sanction putin until he bleeds president biden has done a good job of rallying the free world against putin dictators never succeed for long we must do all we can to hasten putin s fall rep cooper u s rep mark green said putin has chosen devastation over democracy vladimir putin s end goal has been on display for some time now instead of swift crippling sanctions the biden administration chose the wait and watch approach in the midst of destabilizing russian aggression the time for action was months ago we all witnessed putin s false flag propaganda play out just like u s intelligence officials predicted this invasion has been anticipated for weeks while in kyiv i spoke with many ukrainians they are capable of defending their home they are resilient however despots around the world including china are watching as vladimir putin has his way as the world witnesses this invasion our prayers remain with our fellow americans on the ground in eastern europe including those from fort campbell and with the brave people of ukraine vladimir putin has chosen devastation over democracy and the free world will not forget it rep green in a series of tweets u s rep scott desjarlais largely criticized the biden administration s response to the conflict as we watch this preventable attack occur our thoughts and prayers are with the people of ukraine this administration is failing at home and on the world stage our country is in crisis due to out of touch policies that are being driven by the socialist wing of the democratic party we must unite as americans and reverse course now rep desjarlais u s rep chuck fleischmann called for global leaders to work together to cut off russia s access to international financial markets last night the world witnessed vladimir putin s aggression as he launched a full scale invasion of ukraine by russian armed forces the time has come for the united states to swiftly impose strong crippling sanctions against russia s oil and natural gas production access to international financial markets and work with our allies and partners in nato europe and worldwide to impose the harshest penalties possible on putin and the supporters of his totalitarian regime the united states and our allies must do everything possible to strengthen ukraine s ability to defend itself through military and financial aid and ensure that putin knows that his lawless aggression will not stand rep fleischmann u s rep tim burchett largely criticized biden in his statement calling the administration s sanctions against russia ineffective the disastrous withdrawal from afghanistan and other foreign policy debacles gave vladimir putin the green light to invade ukraine s donbas region in response president biden is predictably continuing to project weakness by imposing ineffective financial sanctions against russian oligarchs and minor banks the biden administration should instead hit russia s economy where it actually hurts by reversing its woke fossil fuels agenda and becoming an energy exporter to european markets rep burchett in a tweet u s rep steve cohen who is currently in europe compared putin to adolf hilter

always i hope that all of you as well as your loved ones remain healthy and safe before going into my main commentary i d like to address the recent geopolitical issue which escalated last night the tense situation in ukraine is regrettable and our hopes are that the conflict ends quickly with minimal impact to the safety and welfare of those in the region we are following the situation carefully as it impacts our voyages in the area we have no vessels in the region until late may and we will be updating guests on our plans and about affected itineraries as needed we have quite a bit to share with you today ranging from our resumption of operations to the impacts of the omicron surge to recent developments with the cdc we ll also cover the booking and pricing landscape in our plans for the return to service of the balance of our fleet so let s get started it seems like just yesterday that we launched our great cruise comeback in late july of 21 after 500 days of no cruise operations in the 5 months that followed through the end of 2021 we safely carried over 230 000 happy guests around the globe everywhere from europe to alaska and points in between delivering the unique and upscale vacation experiences that only our three award winning brands can provide this is evidenced by our brands having achieved the highest customer satisfaction scores in our history and a reflection of the deep commitment from our crew members who are as energized as ever to be back in the high seas serving our guests in addition onboard spend by guests during the quarter continued to exceed all expectations and reached all time highs and we delivered these unparalleled vacation experiences in the safest manner possible with protocols that are unmatched by any other area of the hospitality sector i ll repeat once again that our no 1 priority is and always will be the health and safety of our guests crew and the communities we serve and that commitment has never been more evident than in a month since our return to service with over 230 000 guests sailing on our vessels in 2021 our covid positivity rate was minuscule and certainly a fraction of what has been the case in the population at large our science backed protocols centered on vaccination and preboarding testing provide a safe vacation experience that is not duplicated anywhere in the world today and because of the rapid decrease in prevalence and in severity the prospective view of the pandemic is rapidly changing across the globe municipalities cities states countries schools institutions of all kinds and private businesses alike are all moderating protocols as the public health environment improves in the past protocols were usually pared back slowly and only when cases had receded but we have seen many instances denmark and iceland being one of the best and most recent examples where protocols and restrictions have been moderated despite high or even increasing caseloads this latest normal now takes into account the diminished severity of the virus and balances the extent of necessary protocols with the need to resume daily life the confidence for society to take these actions is mainly due to the availability and widespread uptake of vaccines new therapeutics and broad immunity and an ncl cruise ship is one of the few places in the world where you can be assured that at least 95 of the people around you are fully vaccinated and we re pleased to report that the rapidly improving public health environment has allowed us also to follow the easing of covid related protocols occurring in broader society you can see on the return to service plan on slide 4 a new phase returning to normal that reflects those changes and advances our brands recently announced that effective march 1 masking for guests across our fleet will be optional while taking into account local guidelines if any also beginning march 1 and in conjunction with the new cdc guidelines which i ll discuss in a moment the norwegian brand will begin allowing all guests under the age of 12 to sail on an ship fleetwide these two steps greatly expand the addressable market for our largest and most family oriented brand by allowing families to travel together regardless of age and without the mandate of wearing a mask this announcement was scheduled to provide plenty of time and opportunity for families to plan their summer vacations with us and all this comes at a time when last week we had the lowest number of positive pre embarkation cases per 1 000 guests by far since launching service last july during the delta surge recently we were happy to see significant regulatory progress being made as we received clarification from the cdc on updated protocols for sailing originating from the u s ports back in january our three brands were the first in the industry to opt into the cdc s voluntary covid 19 program for cruise ships operating in u s waters when our brands first opted in the program had not yet been finalized however last week as protocols to the program were confirmed our brands reaffirmed their commitment made in march and mid january of opting into the program demonstrating once again our industry leading and unwavering dedication to health and safety with protocols that appropriately reflects the public health environment the program our brands have opted into calls for at least 95 of vaccine eligible guests and crew be vaccinated given the differences in demographics of our brands a vaccination requirement will differ somewhat with norwegian requiring guests aged 12 and over to be fully vaccinated while oceania and regent will continue to require all passengers to be fully vaccinated regardless we will continue to require that 100 of crew across our fleet be fully vaccinated and are working toward having all crew members boosted by april 1 the new updated protocols also allow for mask wearing to be optional as is the case with more and more societal activities all the industry has ever asked is to be treated the same as other areas of society the cdc s new voluntary program is a positive step in that direction which we expect will lead to further easing of protocols as the pandemic continues its retreat in the meantime we will continue to maintain best in class protocols centered on vaccinations and testing for the health and safety of all onboard and to offer guests the safest vacation experience possible the resumption of service across our fleet was not without its challenges as difficult an endeavor as it was to pause and find safe haven for our entire fleet back in the spring of 2020 it is even a greater feat to smoothly bring back the fleet into operation and to deliver the world class level of hospitality and service our brands are known for i want to thank team members across our organization from shipboard to shoreside for the hard work dedication and passion they displayed in returning our fleet to service i also want to thank our loyal past and new to brand guests for entrusting us with what for many has been their first taste of travel since the pandemic began two years ago and a special and heartfelt thanks to the travel agency community who have weathered the pandemic like no other we stuck together through the industry s toughest times and are now reengaged to bring us all back stronger than ever and finally a thanks to our shareholders lenders shipyard partners and the broader financial community for your support and confidence in our company supporting our growth story and the opportunities that lie ahead the story of the past quarter was obviously all about the omicron wave unfortunately omicron did not pick the best of times to make its appearance just as we were experiencing a solid rebound in bookings during october and november after the delta wave began to wane and buoyed by a very successful black friday and cyber monday promotions the impact of omicron began to appear in early december first a norwegian vessel whose itinerary featured multiple calls to south african port had its operations paused as omicron quickly spread there and additional travel restrictions were imposed canceling targeted sailings on certain vessels operating in the caribbean and south america during the quarter also became necessary as an addition to travel restrictions ports began implementing difficult sometimes onerous requirements for docking concurrently booking volumes slowed and cancellation of existing bookings increased while omicron did impact our business in the near term primarily for close in sailings in the first and second quarters it did provide the opportunity to once again demonstrate our resilience as a company and as an industry our ethos throughout the pandemic has emphasized being nimble and ready to adapt our management team has maneuvered to what no other industry has ever had to do and has done a remarkable job doing so the silver lining to this pandemic is that it has brought our team even closer together and fortified the strong collaborative culture we already enjoyed and that we truly believe is one of our competitive advantages as we return to normalcy that positive culture will only grow stronger now for some good news the impact of omicron are waning week by week while the short term has been impacted the following points illustrate the strong underlying consumer demand that gives us confidence about the trajectory of our business in the future first of the guest cancellations that occurred during december and the january period the majority were for sailings in the first and second quarters of 2022 demonstrating sustained consumer confidence in sailings further out second beginning in mid january net booking volumes began improving and continue to do so and accelerate sequentially week over week third booked position for each quarter in 2022 when compared to 2019 sequentially improved over the prior quarter fourth despite the erosion in booked position due to the delta and omicron surges as of today second half 2022 booked position is in line with what was an extraordinarily strong 2019 while 2023 compared to pre pandemic 2020 is in an even better position in fact a record booked position fifth again as of today pricing for 2022 and 2023 sailings remained higher for the full year versus 2019 and pre pandemic 2020 respectively even when including the diluted effect of future cruise credits our core go to market principle of marketing to fill versus discount to fill is performing like a champ as we have not and will not chase short term occupancy by sacrificing price which only results in long term and perhaps even permanent damage to brand equity as we have seen over the years in other situations sixth despite sailing cancellations and slight changes in our return to service plans due to omicron all of our vessels are expected to sail by early may and in time for the peak summer season and lastly we are seeing our largest and most important distribution channels coming back to full strength every day we are seeing more and more business being booked by our travel partners in a shift which bodes well for the industry as the vibrant travel agent community is vital and amplifies the reach of our message to consumers which translates into more and better bookings i want everyone to recall that in the past our industry was accustomed to successfully managing through bumps in the road whenever there was a natural or geopolitical or some other black swan type event that impacted bookings you could almost count like clockwork that after 8 to 10 weeks of quiet booking patterns would rebound we ve seen this pattern occur twice already during the pandemic once last spring after the initial variant ceded and vaccinations became prevalent and most recently last fall right after the delta surge began to wane with the public still a bit shellshocked by the sudden emergency emergence and equally dramatic decline of omicron what our business needs now is a few weeks of quiet with no new variants or surges for confidence to return and momentum to take hold our experts in the sailsafe global health and wellness council headed by dr scott gottlieb believe we re at that point right now so while omicron did indeed have an immediate but short term impact on our business it was an impact that simply shifted expectations and the timing of our recovery by about three months that shift in timing is coinciding with the shift in societal attitudes that i mentioned earlier from avoiding the virus at all cost to living with it it s something we really didn t see after the delta wave but is gaining more and more momentum post omicron we are seeing more and more living of life and we once again began hearing the term revenge travel being batted about these shifts bode well for our company as vacationers look to once again explore the world but to do so in a safe manner i ll be back shortly with closing comments but for now i ll turn the call over to mark for his commentary and the progress of our financial action plan mark mark kempa executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you frank as mentioned earlier going from a complete standstill to having over 70 of our capacity sailing by year end through not one but two covid variants has been an impressive effort in coordination and logistics i give my thanks and kudos to our operations and hotels teams both shipside and shoreside for executing on this truly herculean endeavor we have been deliberate and disciplined in bringing our fleet back gradually and have kept self imposed load factor limitations in place to ensure the safety of our guests and crew members i am pleased to report that strong ticket pricing and onboard revenue spend drove positive contribution from the fleet that operated in the quarter despite the headwinds we faced from the remnants of delta as well as the onset of the omicron variant this result reinforces our belief in the fundamental strength of the business as we reach 85 of our capacity back in operation during the first quarter and the entirety of our fleet back in service in the second quarter to capture demand for the peak summer travel season based on our current trajectory we expect to reach a key milestone in our recovery as the net cash provided by operating activities is expected to turn positive in the second quarter in addition we expect the second half of 2022 to be profitable for the company on an adjusted net income basis marking an important transition for managing the daily business primarily around liquidity needs to shifting our focus back to maximizing profitability as we exit these unprecedented times that said we remain keenly focused on maintaining a strong liquidity position through this transition period moving to slide 8 our cash and short term investments for the quarter decreased by approximately 200 million on a net basis to 1 75 billion this includes 1 billion of cash burn associated with operations including interest and capital expenditures partially offset by nearly 600 million of advanced ticket sale collections and other working capital changes our quarter ending cash and short term investment balances were also boosted by an incremental 260 million associated with a series of balance sheet optimization transactions we executed in november more importantly our liquidity at the end of the fourth quarter was 2 7 billion including a 1 billion commitment through august 2022 which remains undrawn in addition our latest transaction earlier this month puts us in a strong position to manage the resumption of principal payments that had been deferred during the pandemic furthermore as the environment improves our own cash generation engine will be fully up and running which will further strengthen our balance sheet a key part of that cash generation engine is our advanced ticket sales build in the fourth quarter gross advanced ticket sales increased by 40 to 700 million versus a build of 500 million in the prior quarter on a net basis this was partially offset by revenue recognized for sailings in the quarter and refunds and cancellations associated with omicron we continue to be encouraged by the strong and accelerating advanced ticket sales build as it reflects robust demand for our product as we bring the fleet back to service turning to cash burn our monthly burn in the fourth quarter was 345 million which was slightly better than our guidance of 350 million despite some cost pressures from the global supply constraints as we look ahead to the first quarter we expect cash burn to increase to approximately 390 million as we ramp up to 85 of our capacity in operation by the end of the quarter this cash burn includes costs incurred for ships coming online in the second quarter such as crewing the fleet ahead of the restart restocking of inventory and repositioning of certain ships to their initial home ports as a reminder and consistent with our prior commentary cash burn does not include cash inflows associated with current or future bookings nor contribution from ships that have already restarted service however it is important to note that we expect cash inflows to accelerate as our fleet continues to come online resulting in our cash flow from operations expected to turn positive in the second quarter moving to the balance sheet you may recall last quarter we talked about pivoting to a more offensive approach as part of our financial recovery plan as shown on slide 13 since last quarter our team has executed a series of transactions in november and february to begin the journey of optimizing our balance sheet let me share some key highlights with you which are summarized on slide 10 in november 2021 we completed a series of balance sheet and cash flow optimization transactions which reduced the company s annual interest expense decreased leverage extended the debt maturity profile and may lower diluted shares outstanding incrementally in february the company raised approximately 2 1 billion through a series of debt transactions proceeds from these transactions were used to redeem the remaining outstanding balances of the 12 25 senior secured notes due 2024 and the 10 25 senior secured notes due 2026 and will also be used to make principal and interest payments on scheduled amortization due in the near term this transaction extended our debt maturity profile and released certain collateral consisting of certain vessels private islands and intellectual property the combined benefit of these transactions reduces our annual cash interest expense by approximately 75 million as is evident from the transactions i just covered our treasury accounting finance and legal teams among others have been extremely busy and i want to recognize and thank them for their tremendous amount of work and effort they put in for us to complete these transactions turning to inflation similar to all other industries we are experiencing upward pressure on costs in certain areas such as food perishables and other supplies that are impacted by the global supply chain constraints recent geopolitical developments have also pushed fuel curves higher however as you can see on slide 20 approximately 40 of our total consumption for 2022 and approximately 25 of our consumption for 2023 is hedged and affords us partial protection from the recent spike in prices in addition some of our major costs such as labor also have a long term have long term agreements which provide predictability in our operating cost structure while inflationary pressures persist the most recent consumer spending numbers remain robust at a more micro level we have seen clear evidence of this in the onboard spend from guests aboard our ships and pricing for future cruises that frank touched on earlier in fact onboard spend per person per day continues to be up meaningfully versus record 2019 levels we ve also provided incremental guidance on certain key metrics like depreciation and amortization interest expense fuel consumption and capital expenditures all of which can be referenced on slide 21 as i look ahead i am encouraged by the continued positive news we are seeing including the decline in covid cases the new guidance provided to the cruise industry by the cdc and the steady march back to normalcy in wider society we are confident that the demand for our fantastic brands and unparalleled vacation experiences will continue strengthening back to pre pandemic levels this strength is clearly reflected in our forward booked position for the second half of 2022 and full year 2023 and our growth profile over the coming years is as robust as ever as we take delivery of nine spectacular and margin accretive ships across all three brands between now and 2027 increasing our capacity by 50 compared to 2019 more importantly this management team has time and again generated outsized returns on incremental capacity and we look to continue this trend as we focus on rebuilding and growing our business lastly frank touched on this and i couldn t agree more that a business is only as strong as the people behind it our team has demonstrated incredible resilience working through these unprecedented times we are undoubtedly stronger today than we were before entering the trenches of this pandemic so as we look to the future our team is focused on managing the controllable and staying nimble as the landscape evolves we will continue to adapt and create value for our shareholders team members and communities we serve our management team is ready and eager to return our business back to pre pandemic levels of significant cash flow generation and profitability combined with a strong balance sheet with that i ll turn it back to frank for closing comments frank del rio president and chief executive officer thank you mark and before we wrap up our prepared remarks i d like to provide an update on our global sustainability program sail sustain which slide 14 outlines key accomplishments and milestones we are committed to driving a positive impact on society and the environment through the advancement of this program and we reached several important milestones this past year including releasing our first esg report announcing our long term climate action strategy and goal to reach carbon neutrality we also made several advances since just our last earnings call we took the opportunity during the voyage suspension period to accelerate installation of exhaust gas cleaning systems or scrubbers nearly two years ahead of schedule we successfully completed our nearly 200 million multiyear investment that covered 13 ships representing approximately 70 of our operational capacity with these state of the art systems which improved our environmental footprint by significantly reducing emissions including sulfur oxides and improving air quality in fact ships equipped with this technology can reduce sox emissions by up to 98 allowing the ships to operate these systems within compliance in expanded areas throughout the world investments in technology such as scrubbers are an integral part of our climate action strategy we were also proud to be recognized as a leader in sustainable cruise terminal construction as we were the first in the world to receive the leed gold new construction certification for our flagship terminal at portmiami the team designed our 188 000 square foot terminal which welcomed guests for the first time last year with innovation and sustainability at the forefront creating a platform that optimizes the terminal s energy performance indoor air quality water efficiency utilization of local materials and resources and much more and we will continue to innovate toward our sustainability commitment including further investment at our portmiami terminal where we are partnering with miami dade county to add short power capabilities by fall of 2023 we know that initiatives such as these are important in supporting our goals and our board of directors recognizes that esg is a critical driver in achieving our corporate goals and long term success and for this reason our compensation committee included an esg metric in our annual short term incentive plan for the first time this metric involves the company making sufficient progress in setting greenhouse gas emission reduction targets during 2022 as determined by the technology environmental safety and security or tess committee of the board of directors our board believes that this step toward shared accountability across the organization reinforces our commitment and ultimate goal of reaching carbon neutrality before turning the call over to q a i d like to leave you with some key takeaways which you can find on slide 15 first we remain focused on our voyage resumption plan with 85 of our fleet operational at the end of the quarter and the full fleet ready for the important peak summer season in may despite the impacts of delta and omicron we are pleased with our cumulative booked position for 2022 and 2023 and the strong corresponding pricing that comes with it and lastly our priority remains to execute on our medium and long term financial recovery plans and to capitalize on our attractive growth profile over the coming years we ve covered quite a bit today in what has been an incredibly busy quarter and year so i ll conclude our commentary now and open up the call for your questions operator questions answers operator our first question is from steve wieczynski from stifel please proceed with your question steve wieczynski stifel financial corp analyst yeah hey guys good morning so frank and mark i guess if i look at your daily your per diems they were up if my math is correct somewhere around 20 relative to the fourth quarter of 2019 and if i compare those to some of your competitors which again i might i know it s not directly apples to apples but your competitors seem to be more in that low to mid single digit range so i guess the question is what drove those per diems so much higher not only over 2019 but also versus your competitors as well frank del rio president and chief executive officer and thanks for the question look it goes back to our core going to market principle of market to fill and not discounting to fill at this stage of the recovery having four or five more points of occupancy at the expense of lower pricing which could have a very negative long term effect on the brand s equity is not the right move and so it wasn t hard for us to resist following others and dropping prices to levels that i ve never seen before and so we were happy to see a year over year or 21 compared to 2019 improvement in ticket npds by roughly 10 onboard spend was over the top and you re right on a combined basis our total net revenue on an npd basis was up over 20 some of our competitors had flat improvement so we re very pleased with that and we think that if you re a long term investor and certainly we re a long term management team you would prefer maintaining that pricing structure that pricing power that we ve demonstrated not just now during a pandemic but year after year as you know we lead the industry in ticket yields and in onboard revenue yields in exchange for a couple of points of occupancy in a period where even the best of the operators are performing at roughly half of what they normally would so we ll take that trade any day steve wieczynski stifel financial corp analyst ok gotcha thanks frank and then second question i m going to ask this in a way i hope isn t offensive or get you in trouble but honestly i think if we look at some of the changes the cdc has made relative to the cruise industry versus other forms of travel i mean to us they honestly still seem somewhat archaic and outdated relative to what you guys are already doing from a protocol perspective so the question is i guess why did you guys opt in to this program as it still seems somewhat outdated or is there a confirmation from them that you guys are on the right path and they re essentially going to leave you guys alone moving forward frank del rio president and chief executive officer it s not going to get me in trouble at all steve because i ve been very vocal throughout the pandemic as to the disappointment that we ve all suffered at the hands of the cdc the cdc didn t shut down any other industry for nearly 18 months and the cdc continues to have policies toward us that are not seen anywhere in the industry but we are making progress with them i will tell you that it was not an easy decision to opt in but we think that overall given where we are now with the prevalence where we are with the pandemic and the cdc s commitment to continually look at protocol much more online real time basis so to speak gives us hope that this first step of a volunteer program where masking is no longer required and a few other guest facing improvements that that will get us to where we need to go and so there s going to be another date in the near future where the cdc will once again evaluate the protocols that we re now volunteering to comply with but look at the end of the day we ve always exceeded whatever the cdc s guidelines are i don t need the cdc to tell me how to operate a safe cruise line and our protocols have always exceeded theirs and continue to do so at the end of the day we need to build consumer confidence and i think we re doing that as i mentioned in my prepared remarks the pandemic is waning in several areas vaccinations are up the severity of the cases are down and we as a society are learning to live with this and i think the cdc is mindful of that and wants to get away from being seen as discriminatory toward the cruise industry and being behind the times so i think that in the near future we re going to see a much more friendly environment toward the cruise industry from the cdc steve wieczynski stifel financial corp analyst ok gotcha that s great color thanks guys appreciate it operator our next question is from stephen grambling with goldman sachs please proceed with your question stephen grambling goldman sachs analyst hey thanks with the new protocols how should we think about the path to higher occupancy and as we look out to 2023 will you generally be all the way back to kind of the typical over 100 occupancy or could you still see some lingering social distancing or other measures that you would want to kind of continue frank del rio president and chief executive officer look i think that it s too soon to know exactly i think we re moving in the right direction with covid overall we ve had to endure two surges delta and omicron back to back that certainly shook the confidence of society as a whole if you recall last june when the vaccines were readily available and the case count was really dropping business was booming i remember calling my brand presidents into a meeting and asking them to raise prices stop marketing do whatever they ve got to do to slow down the sales volume because we were going to end up the year without having an inventory to sell and then delta came along and just when we were getting out of delta omicron came along but as we said in our prepared remarks steve the back half of 22 in spite of delta and omicron is in line with the record year of 2019 and 2023 is meaningfully ahead both in price and in load factor so we believe that if you believe that the omicron is the last major surge that s going to cause upheaval in everyday life then that healing period that i referred to has begun and i suspect that unless there is another surge and by the way the experts that we talk to including dr scott gottlieb the former fda commissioner doesn t believe that there will be another major surge there will be variants there will be mutations but quite frankly they will be more endemic than they are pandemic and so i believe that 2023 based on the numbers that i have in the books right now both load factor and pricing and further based on the assumption that we will not see another major delta or omicron type surge 2023 can get the industry and certainly our company back to pre pandemic levels stephen grambling goldman sachs analyst that s helpful and then you had some helpful details on the change in itineraries by region i think focusing on more europe alaska i guess how will that impact net yields kind of all else equal looking at 2022 especially the second half versus 2019 and how are you planning for places like australia and asia pacific given some more stringent covid policies frank del rio president and chief executive officer yes look as you ve heard me say many many times the no 1 driver of yield is itineraries and we strive every day to position our 28 vessels soon to be 29 in the highest and best use for them and so constantly year after year we lead the industry in ticket yields and onboard revenue yields and in total yields and we think that will continue in the back half of 22 compared to 2019 for example we will have encore for the entire year compared to one month in 2019 we ll have regent splendor for the full year versus zero months in 2019 and we will have the new norwegian prima for about five months in 20 back half of 22 compared to zero so those three vessels all very high yielding as mark mentioned improvements to margin will continue to give us the ability to drive higher and higher industry record yields and in terms of australia and in asia in general as you know those are the last geographic areas to come online after the pandemic we believe that they will be online certainly i believe australia and new zealand will be i m not sure about china china quite frankly is an insignificant area for us but we are hopeful that the likes of thailand and singapore and vietnam do reopen in time for the winter 22 23 season so we still have nine 10 months to go before that season begins hopefully as the pandemic winds down and finds its way through that asian geographic area that those countries and those ports will reopen to us mark kempa executive vice president and chief financial officer steve this is mark as we look to 2023 it s also important to remember that we re set up extremely well as frank said we have essentially almost five additional vessels that will be operating the full year or roughly 20 more capacity than 2019 and if we look at those vessels and the economics of those vessels we know they re a big driver to bottom line profitability and margin accretion so again assuming a normal year we are set up extremely well in terms of our profile stephen grambling goldman sachs analyst helpful thanks so much operator our next question comes from james hardiman with citigroup please proceed with your question sean wagner citi analyst hi this is sean wagner on for james i guess on the topic of how should we think of the per berth net cruise costs excluding fuel as we ramp the fleet over the course of the year and is there an opportunity to match or improve on those numbers as we look to 2023 or i guess is there any way to think about kind of margin potential at similar yields or similar revenue levels mark kempa executive vice president and chief financial officer sure this is mark so look we re thinking about that every day like any business and as i said in my prepared remarks we too have pressures like the rest of the world that also comes along comes together with stronger top line but this is a relatively fixed cost business so we re lucky that we re afforded some protection on that front that said as we look as a comparable base back to 2019 and you think about it on a per unit cost basis we do have more efficient capacity coming on we do have more growth so that s going to give us some opportunity there to the extent some of that is offset by continued inflationary pressures that remains to be seen we have started we were prior to today or yesterday we were starting to see some settling on the cost side so we ll have to see how this recent geopolitical event impacts that but all else equal we should be gaining efficiencies that said keep in mind we have not gotten rid of any of our older vessels during the pandemic we have a relatively young fleet and at this time we have no plans to shed any of that capacity so we won t have that optical benefit so to speak versus some of our competitors and i highlight the word optical on that front so but again we ve always run a lean company we will get scale as we continue to bring to grow and bring on efficient capacity and it s in our dna to look at every cost every line item and drive efficiencies where we can sean wagner citi analyst that s very helpful and i guess on the yield end of it or the per diem specifically how much of that premium that you re seeing and i guess the industry as a whole is seeing is due to not having to kind of fill up ships to capacity and kind of how much of that what do you think about your ability to maintain that strength as you do get closer to kind of historical levels of occupancy frank del rio president and chief executive officer well as i mentioned earlier the phenomena that you mentioned is not new in q4 it s something that we ve been able to achieve year after year after year we lead the industry in yields ticket yield onboard revenue yield and we continue to do so primarily because of our go to market strategy where we believe in marketing to stimulate demand we believe in the product you pay for what you get for and we have three industry leading brands the highest luxury brand in regent the highest yielding premium brand in oceania and what we believe to be the highest contemporary yielding brand in norwegian so we re just going to continue doing what we always do because it s a winning strategy mark kempa executive vice president and chief financial officer and sean i think it s a bit of a fallacy to think that we re just getting these premium per diems as a result of lower capacity yes there s some of that mix that impacts onboard revenue yes we ve said that in the past but core fundamental solid ticket revenue pricing is strong we ve maintained pricing that s our strategy market to fill we re going to continue to do that so it s not by accident that we re getting those premiums as a result of our self imposed capacity limits sean wagner citi analyst ok understood thank you very much operator our next question is from fred wightman with wolfe research please proceed with your question fred wightman wolfe research analyst hey guys good morning there was a comment that some vessels could potentially be impacted just from geopolitics starting in late may i m wondering if you could maybe frame the potential impact either on a capacity basis if that s easiest mark kempa executive vice president and chief financial officer sure fred so when we look at obviously we re talking about the baltic region more specifically st petersburg as we look we have roughly about 5 of our total capacity that calls on st petersburg over this course of the summer season and that s heavily weighted more toward our norwegian brand than oceania or regent but it s all in all it s about 50 sailings and we are looking at alternative ports as we speak i mean this is something we ve been thinking about and worst case scenario if we re not able to call on st petersburg or the surrounding areas there s plenty of other ports in the in that scandinavian region that we have the ability to call on so not a huge impact obviously a bit disappointing because that is a premier port but there s other viable very attractive ports that are available fred wightman wolfe research analyst great and then i guess just conceptually is this current situation something that you ve seen actually reflected in booking trends over the past few days or is it still just sort of up and to the right post omicron mark kempa executive vice president and chief financial officer yes look i think it s way too early i mean we definitely did not see anything as of close of business yesterday and this morning i haven t received we haven t received any red flags but like anything you ll probably see a little bit of slowdown here and there around margin that s normal but it s definitely too early to indicate if there s going to be any longer term effects europe is a big continent too so this is affecting a very small portion of europe and there s a lot of other areas that we can operate in especially the med where we have a significant capacity as well fred wightman wolfe research analyst perfect thanks guys operator our next question is from vince ciepiel with cleveland research please proceed with your question vince ciepiel cleveland research analyst thanks could you talk a little bit more about brand performance maybe what you re seeing luxury high end versus contemporary anything differences in booking patterns and then your recent change that i think goes in effect march 1 regarding age under 12 allowed to be unvaccinated i think that s a change from previously being 100 vaccinated and on the contemporary brand curious how that change is being received if that s generating any new interest any thoughts there frank del rio president and chief executive officer vince it s frank look the all three brands are performing very very well as you know from normal times if you ve been following this industry for a while the upscale brands oceania and regent by the nature of their itineraries their psychographic demographics the customer base those itineraries tend to book earlier than the more contemporary norwegian brands in this business everything else being equal the longer the itinerary is the more exotic the itinerary is the further out people book and we re certainly seeing that and so we have great visibility into the second half of 22 and into 23 from especially from those two brands and the news is just fantastic as i said we are in line with 2019 and 2019 was a heck of a year and significantly ahead of for 2023 and at higher pricing so i will tell you that the upscale market is very much alive and well as is norwegian now as far as norwegian goes we believe that the combination of allowing children under the age of 12 and no longer having to wear masks is a big boost to demand we just announced it in the last couple of days as i said earlier business has been trending upward sequentially now for about four weeks and we believe that this announcement will add fuel to that sequential improvement week over week in terms of net bookings vince ciepiel cleveland research analyst great and then i had a follow up question on costs specifically fuel you talked earlier about installing more scrubbers and i m thinking back to pre covid times and with imo 2020 the thought that the percentage of fuel that was mgo that you burn would have to step up i think it was to like 60 or something like that which was pretty high now that you ve kind of digested some of these changes installed more scrubbers what percent of fuel in 2022 do you think will be mgo mark kempa executive vice president and chief financial officer yes roughly we ve now completed our exhaust gas scrubber installation recently and when we look at our mix we re settling out at about 50 hfo versus mgo so right down the middle of the path slightly better than what we were anticipating which is good news vince ciepiel cleveland research analyst great thanks operator our next question comes from robin farley with ubs please proceed with your question robin farley ubs analyst great i wanted to ask about pricing you showed your itinerary mix which would be driving price increases with the higher mix in alaska and europe can you help us sort of think about the same store increases in the caribbean just given the resort hotel rates on land the types of increases we re seeing and how that may be looking for your kind of same store caribbean and then just a follow up too on the potential changes with baltic ships so just to clarify are you saying that baltic ships would not be moved to the med just thinking about potential impact if there was that kind of change in the med closer in so you re saying that s not where baltic ships would go so i just want to clarify that too frank del rio president and chief executive officer robin it s frank no the baltic ships will stay in the baltic the med ships will stay in the med what we said was if we cannot go to st petersburg there are many alternative ports to visit in the surrounding countries we also have the opportunity to overnight in another port so that we don t have to affect the length of the itinerary nor the embark or disembark it is disappointing because st petersburg is one of the crown jewels of the scandinavian itineraries but certainly there are alternatives in terms of the caribbean look we ve seen strong pricing in the caribbean we as we move certain capacity out of the caribbean and into higher yielding itineraries whatever is left for us by definition provides a lift to yield because we have less competition among ourselves we also are seeing that with cost pressures affecting all businesses it s also affecting the land resorts they re having to charge more and so our cruise as the industry s presence in the caribbean theater we believe we re more competitive than ever and it s allowing us at least to raise prices in the caribbean so we like the caribbean especially in the winter but we re always tweaking our deployment such that we can move our vessels to what we believe are higher and higher yields not just ticket yields but also onboard revenue yield so for example a vessel that might generate the same ticket yield in the same month in the caribbean versus alaska you would probably want to move that ship to alaska because we know historically alaska generates more onboard revenue so you ve got to look at the total and i know that analysts and investors don t have the same visibility on onboard revenue yields as you do on ticket yields but i ve got to tell you onboard revenue yield continues to grow becoming more and more important as a part of the overall yield and so we don t look at just ticket yields which is itinerary driven but we also look at onboard revenue yield and if you see it from our lens you ll see why we are constantly tweaking our overall deployment and on a net net basis are moving ships out of the caribbean into places like alaska and in europe robin farley ubs analyst ok great thank you very much operator our next question is from andrew didora with bank of america please proceed with your question andrew didora bank of america merrill lynch analyst frank can you maybe help us understand the booking curve a little bit more when you say back half of 22 and 2023 bookings are ahead of 2019 i guess how much of your budgeted kind of back half of the year and forward year is typically filled right now just trying to get a sense of how much there is left to fill between now and the sell date what how has that looked historically frank del rio president and chief executive officer well there s still a lot to sell as you know we always say that we d like to turn the year somewhere between 60 to 65 certainly we didn t turn 2021 into 22 at that level because of omicron and delta for the full year but it s like i said in line for the back half and certainly today based on what the booked position is for 23 reaching that 60 even 65 for 2023 at year end 22 looks very very doable and at higher prices again it all boils down to is if you believe as we do that the pandemic is receding that the healing process has begun and that momentum is picking up we ve now we saw momentum pick up last late last spring when the original i guess it was called alpha variant was beginning to die down only to be thwarted by the arrival of delta in early july and then just when we thought delta was over in the october november we were cranking again then omicron came if you believe it s over then we re at the cusp of that momentum a hockey stick type of growth in net bookings arriving on the scene and that s what we believe and it s not because i believe it but those who know better our sailsafe panel the experts around the country believe that the combination of omicron receding more and more people being vaccinated more and more immunity in the in society both in the u s and worldwide the new therapeutics coming online that the pandemic will soon turn into an endemic in fact there are countries now iceland denmark who declared the end of the pandemic and an endemic arrival so at this stage and again not because i think i m giving you what the numbers are showing 2023 could be assuming that no other major variants arise in the scene could be a fabulous year to be a record year andrew didora bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it mark just a clarification on the operating cash flow guidance when you say cash from operations will inflect positively in the second quarter does that include your estimate for cash in from customer deposits and then because i think does that differ from your cash burn definition in terms of excluding any deposits am i thinking about that right mark kempa executive vice president and chief financial officer yes cash burn we give the cash burn guidance to help you guys model but cash flow from operations takes all that into account all of your working capital changes essentially write off your cash flow statement cash flow from operations so that s what we re referring to there is no other definition of it just a straight gaap interpretation operator our next question is from jaime katz with morningstar please proceed with your question jaime katz morningstar analyst hi good morning thanks for squeezing me in my first question is on marketing roi and how you guys are planning on your marketing spend over 2022 given the lift obviously that you have seen in spend so far and then just a clarification i think in your prepared remarks you had articulated that some of the refinancing had maybe given you availability to tap into the secured debt markets again if you chose to do so i just wanted to make sure i heard that correct mark kempa executive vice president and chief financial officer jaime yes you are correct so with completion of our recent transaction the series of debt transactions that where we raised 2 1 billion we did free up collateral on two of our vessels as well as i said all of our islands and of course the all sacred intellectual property so going forward we do have secured capacity in addition to what we just issued in the course of the last two to three weeks and i think your first part of the question was on marketing spend look we as we ve always said we market to fill and that s demonstrated in our pricing we demonstrated it in q4 we will market where needed we re always looking for an roi on our marketing of course there s a portion of marketing that is agnostic where you just have to spend where you can t necessarily pinpoint an roi right you have to get a certain amount of load on the ships but beyond that it s very pointed our marketing groups are very sophisticated in that aspect and if we can spend 1 of marketing and get a five to 10x return we ll do that all day long and we watch that we look at that our brand presidents from each area of each brand do that day in day out so again we will market to fill and that s the important strategy frank del rio president and chief executive officer one thing i ll add to what mark just said jaime is that we recognized very early in the omicron wave that consumers were not cruising was not top of mind in consumers mind in december and january so we pulled back our marketing spend considerably at the end of 21 and early 22 believing that it would not have been as effective as it would in other times so we ve got plenty of dry powder that we re going to be deploying over the next few weeks and months ahead as we rev up the marketing machine to get to the booking levels we need to generate the booked position we want so we did two very smart things maybe we were a lot more lucky than smart but we didn t drop prices and that s by design because that s just not what we do and number two we were able to recognize that omicron was going to have an impact on consumer behavior and we reduced our marketing spend during that eight week period or so and so we come out of it with plenty of dry powder to deploy now in a more favorable environment jaime katz morningstar analyst thanks for the color frank del rio president and chief executive officer well thank you everyone as always for your time and for your support we will be available to answer any questions you might have throughout the day and i wish you a good day and a healthy and safety stay thank you so much operator duration 66 minutes

petroleum mr lynn peterson lynn peterson chief executive officer thank you brandon good morning everyone i appreciate you joining us for the call this morning i want to keep all this in perspective in light of what s happening in the world stage above all else we hope peace is restored as quickly as possible you can refer to our 10 k we filed yesterday and our news release for detailed information as well as reconciliations to non gaap measures 2021 was a strong year we exited the year with some momentum and expect to see another good year in 2022 we exceeded our guidance numbers we paid off the balance of our revolver we added inventory in our core areas and we most recently took the first step toward a capital return plan by initiating our first ever regular dividend we re going to take a little different approach this morning from our previous calls and i m going to ask jimmy henderson our cfo to spend some time discussing our fourth quarter and full year results while we were assisted by a rising commodity price environment our team did a great job executing our 2021 program as well as the initiatives we set out at the beginning of the year once jimmy concludes i want to talk about our 2022 program our return of capital approach for 2022 and to answer some questions that arose from our last news release jimmy i m going to turn it over to you for the financial results jimmy henderson chief financial officer all right thanks lynn and i echo your thoughts on as our thoughts and prayers go out to ukrainian people on news that we re all watching here and hope that peace is resolved quickly well i hate to spot off a bunch of numbers i know you all read in our filings already i do want to highlight a few things a few results that are really striking in the fourth quarter of 2021 we had net income on a gaap basis of 292 million or 7 34 per diluted share as compared to 198 million or 5 per share in the previous quarter adjusting for certain items but primarily the mark to market of our hedging transactions we had adjusted net income of 168 million or 4 23 per diluted share in the fourth quarter as compared to 142 million or 3 57 per share for the previous quarter adjusted ebitdax was 226 million compared to 201 million in the previous quarter the increase is primarily due to the better commodity prices and a slight uptick in our oil production quarter over quarter our production on a barrels of oil equivalent basis remain relatively flat quarter over quarter averaging 92 800 boe per day compared to a third quarter production of 92 100 boe per day oil production for the fourth quarter averaged 52 900 barrels of oil per day which is up slightly from 51 800 barrels of oil in the third quarter oil differentials were considerably higher in the fourth quarter as overall basin production levels remain well within total takeaway capacity as we move into 2022 our term commitment levels have decreased resulting in more exposure to spot value premiums that we re seeing now our natural gas prices benefited in 2021 from a premium at our primary pricing point the ventura point as compared to henry hub and ngl prices continued to be strong in the fourth quarter at an average percentage of wti oil of around 37 just for context this compares to less than 20 that we were experiencing in the same quarter last year as noted last quarter the majority of our gathering and processing agreements are structured as fixed fee contracts and therefore receive a more pronounced benefit to our net realized price at current residue gas and ngl benchmark pricing the company invested capex of about 66 million during the fourth quarter to bring 16 gross 12 net wells on to production and we drilled 17 gross 10 4 net operated wells we ended the quarter with 34 gross 20 2 net drilled and uncompleted wells we currently have two rigs running and one completion crew both of those drilling rigs are in the sanish field and our completion crews working in the cassandra area lease operating expense was 62 million for or 7 31 per boe for the fourth quarter of 21 note that loe continues to be impacted by expensed workovers that we ve talked about previously our cash g a expenses were 12 million for the fourth quarter and for the year totaled about 39 million averaging right around 1 16 per boe for 2021 we also disclosed our year end proved reserves in our 10 k and our press release last night we did see a dramatic increase year over year with the estimated total proved reserves totaling 326 million boes with a pre tax pv10 value of 4 4 billion at year end compared to 260 million boe and 1 2 billion at the year end 2020 pricing under sec rules increased by approximately 27 per barrel to 66 56 per barrel at december 31 2021 compared to december 31 2020 gas increased to 3 60 per mmbtu compared to 1 99 for the same two periods obviously these price changes were the biggest factor in the year over year changes but we also added 20 3 million boe through the drill bit and 16 million boe with acquisitions which more than offset the decrease from selling our colorado assets lastly i ll point out that our proved developed properties accounted for roughly 80 of our total proved reserves with approximately 3 6 billion in value it s worth noting that this value is at sec pricing of around 67 per barrel of oil as compared to spot prices today with that i ll turn this back over to lynn and talk a little bit about where we re headed in 2022 lynn peterson chief executive officer thanks jimmy there were a lot of numbers here so i appreciate that again thanks to our entire team for their great efforts during the year divesting of our colorado properties combined with adding meaningful inventory through our acquisition work we ll pay great dividends in future years and we should really start to see the benefits accruing at the end of 2022 and moving into 2023 with our development plan the board and management understand the importance of returning capital to shareholders we have had much engagement throughout the last year by our board and we are excited to lay out our plans as we go through the year as such the board approved a quarterly dividend of 0 25 per share that will be paid beginning in march which was only the first step of our capital return program our board wants to be very thoughtful and measured in developing a plan to that end we have had multiple discussions of stock buybacks and fixed and variable dividends and i am completely comfortable in saying our board of directors is going in this direction and we would expect to lay out additional information that would place the company in the fairway of what we are seeing from returning capital from our peers when we look out over the next four years and consider a 70 price environment for wti crude we see our company generating free cash flow in an amount approximately the same as our current market cap i know we live in a world of instant gratification but again i will state that our board of directors is aligned with our shareholders and we will methodically develop and return a capital plan that should please our shareholders and i want to shift and outline how we thought about our 2022 capital plan and production profile looking ahead we will have a slightly higher activity level we will have larger working interest in the wells drilled and completed in our sanish field due to the acquisitions we anticipate an increased level of non operated activity and we have built in inflationary factors that we are currently experiencing and anticipate throughout the year our supply chain team has done a great job of locking many of the big ticket items for the first half of 2022 however we are less protected in the back half of the year we estimate the inflationary pressure to the program to be in the low double digit percentages but the high end of our guidance has contingency for higher inflation should that become an issue turning to our production profile we have shifted some production from the first half of the year and into the second half due to the drilling and completion activities on a five well pad mentioned in our previous release we had the rig down on the pad in january and we ll be moving back in in march this delay combined with our current activity in the sanish field create somewhat of a hockey stick moderating our overall 22 production but creating impressive growth as we exit the year and move into 23 which should benefit with a sharp increase in production in february we announced the acquisition of non operated assets in our sanish field we negotiate these transactions in the fall of 21 in a lower price environment and we believe they add significant shareholder value we have been able to hedge production from these acquisitions at a much higher wti pricing the acquired interest included wells currently on production wells that have already been drilled and are awaiting completion in 22 as well as significant interest in wells scheduled on our 22 and 23 drilling programs this is a field that we understand very well and i have a high confidence in the well economics supporting our belief that these are highly accretive transactions with excellent risk adjusted returns we re starting 22 in an incredibly strong financial position and i expect to have attractive cash flow from operations during the year with our current hedges in place and using the 70 price for wti and 4 for gas we model over 900 million in ebitda resulting in over 500 million of adjusted free cash flow which demonstrates that we can continue to grow our return to capital program while also continuing to pursue acquisition opportunities that will compete with our current profile by investing in whiting we think shareholders can really have it all and with that i ll turn it back to sara questions answers operator our first question comes from leo mariani with keybanc please go ahead lynn peterson chief executive officer you there leo leo mariani keybanc capital markets analyst yes hello sorry so look whiting obviously had strong production here in the fourth quarter came in above guide i was hoping you could maybe provide a little color around what drove the good fourth quarter here on production lynn peterson chief executive officer i think we continue to see good performance from our wells i ll let chip jump in here as well but the team is trying some different things on completion i think we re seeing some benefits to this chip chip rimer chief operating officer yes appreciate it lynn yes especially in our sanish field our lacey littlefield areas we ve seen going in there we re doing some rifting right next to the wells that we are stimulating the new ones and we re starting to see some impact and so we re seeing wedge production higher than we our original curves and also our base production is staying up there leo mariani keybanc capital markets analyst ok and i guess just in terms of maybe some of those new simulations are you all planning on kind of receiving a lot of that here i assume in 2022 is this pretty broadly applicable across the entire basin is it more just in sanish what can you kind of tell us about that chip rimer chief operating officer yes leo it s a little early to say we re seeing that impact i d like to wait for a quarter or two but we re pleased with what we ve seen so far and we ll see where it goes from here leo mariani keybanc capital markets analyst ok maybe can you just talk about the m a environment a little bit obviously you guys have done a few smaller deals over the past several months which in your wheelhouse are you seeing other type of bolt on opportunities out there or perhaps maybe there s some bigger deals that you re eyeing here in the bakken lynn peterson chief executive officer yes leo clearly we re watching everything looking at many things possible i think you also we got a backdrop of pretty aggressive rise in commodity prices and i think it s made it a bit challenging people are enjoying their cash flow they re seeing off these properties so we also want to make sure we don t buy on the high end here and watch oil drop over time so we re being cautious but we re looking at everything we can leo mariani keybanc capital markets analyst ok thanks guys lynn peterson chief executive officer you bet thanks operator our next question comes from neal dingmann with truist please go ahead neal dingmann truist securities analyst good morning all first question on dips kind of two for here just wondering could you talk about how you re thinking about maybe for jimmy first just speak to the delta on the spot dips this year versus 21 are you still guiding to that through 3 or 4 off versus i think it was about 4 in 21 i think you ve mentioned more exposure to spot this year and i think spot is now in a pretty good place so i m just wondering on that and to tuck into that i know there was some dapl news i don t doubt that has any impact near term but i m just also wondering how you re thinking about this dapl moves down the line on the debt jimmy henderson chief financial officer yes thanks neal i ll start and i ll turn it over to jo ann to correct anything that i say wrong but look at 21 over compared to 22 i mean if you remember 21 we started off the year with concerns about dapl and we re kind of affected this is going into the year and the guidance that we gave was trying to take that into consideration and it certainly got better as we move through the year as things kind of normalize and production levels stayed relatively consistent and within the total transportation capacity and jo ann maybe i ll let you talk a little bit more about the what you see on the america side as well as dapl jo ann stockton vice president commercial sure yes and just a little bit more detail on 2021 i mean we had a mixture of various term length deals utilizing firm transportation on alternative pipeline along with supply commitments into rail markets and really it was strategically aligned with our crude gathering service provider system connectivity to specifically protect our larger producing areas and if you think about how that case unfolded and the timing we really did layer in from q4 of 20 all through up until right in front of the may decision and so from there moving forward into 2022 most of the deals that acted as a physical hedge against an uncertain dapl outcome has rolled off and what remains is a combination of term into various markets with more of a concentration on spot volume relative to last year is what we ve indicated and so with the recent decision of the u s supreme court denying dakota access petition to appeal the lower court decision basically reaffirming that the eis will stand and so we shift ahead and expect a draft version of that here in the next few weeks with the official timing still protects project excuse me for september but we re actually wondering if that timing will slip because you take into account how contentious this issue is and the expectation that the numerous comments that will be filed will need to be addressed and taken into consideration before the eis is finalized we can easily see it slipping out past that date at the end of the day if you re thinking where we stand on the balance of this year we look at it as the army core engineers have the opportunity to go down a different road than they chose not to and as we factor in the macro outlook especially in light of the most recent news along with an existing pipeline with continuous operations we re cautiously optimistic on a favorable outcome and if anything that guided range that we gave me maybe we could see some slight improvement to that lynn peterson chief executive officer we should have given our proper introduction jo ann stockton is our vice president of commercial here for whiting neal dingmann truist securities analyst thanks for the details and then just one follow up maybe jimmy for you you guys have had some outstanding return of capital that to me then appears the market is fully appreciated i m just wondering could you speak to potential additional return of capital that you are seeing for yearly jimmy henderson chief financial officer well we announced the dividend earlier this quarter and that s the first step and i think it s pretty obvious when you look at our cash flow free cash flow generation there s more to come i think we spoke to that quite a bit in the prepared script as we ve talked about consistently over the last year it was it s always been our intent to do this very methodically and thoughtfully and goes one step at a time so we ve done that we ve paid down our debt to 0 we ve been able to do an acquisition which we ll pay off very quickly now we ve announced the dividend and there s more to come on that front we ve been very consistent in laying out with our shareholders neal dingmann truist securities analyst very good thank you all look forward to it lynn peterson chief executive officer you bet neal just to reiterate our board is completely aligned with us on this we just really wanted to do it one step at a time as jimmy said there so it s all good neal dingmann truist securities analyst yes that makes the most sense i m glad you re sort of walking before running on this it makes a lot of sense thanks thanks lynn operator our next question comes from michael scialla with stifel please go ahead michael scialla stifel financial corp analyst good morning everybody maybe just staying on that last topic in terms of return of capital when you said you re having a lot of conversations with the board everybody is aligned i don t want you to try and front run what the board might decide is the best avenue but i guess in looking at share buybacks just how do you think about that from a high level versus where your stock is today and the opportunity to continue to do these bolt on acquisitions how do you view the opportunity set there lynn peterson chief executive officer yeah good morning mike good to hear you i think stock buybacks is probably going to be our next step here we ve talked long and hard about it clearly after we put our last announcement out i wish i had it in place so i mean it would have worked out pretty well so we just we see a lot of noise in the investment world today and we talked to our shareholders both long only and value and everybody we get a different message for everybody some people want us to reinvest in properties some want us to pay dividends some want us to buy our stock back so we re looking at all of these things and again we just laid out the fixed dividend as our starting point here i think the next step would clearly be a stock buyback announcement and then i think you re seeing more of the variable dividends i still i think we ve got more work to do on that one but i think all these make sense in conjunction with you re seeing the free cash flow that we re generating here i mean you ve seen companies pay back 40 50 60 in some cases if we can get into that range i think we ll be very competitive with our peers out there so i m excited what we got to go ahead i mean again people want it today they don t want to wait i get it but at the same time i think i have a lot of respect for position our take on this and we re excited to lay out as we go through the year michael scialla stifel financial corp analyst that s helpful sounds good and i know you ve steered clear of quarterly guidance in the past but i just wanted to see if you could give us any sense maybe from a high level the expected completion cadence through the year should we just anticipate kind of flat production throughout the year or is there going to be any variability given the cadence of completions lynn peterson chief executive officer well again that was kind of the purpose of the comments here i think you re going to see a kind of a slow first half of the year with really ratcheting up as we exit the year and a lot of due to the comment i made earlier about the five well pad that we ve been delayed on a little bit so i think that was kind of the disappointment when we put out our news that people didn t see the production overall and it was just moderated a little bit by this pause or slowness on our five well pad i think as we exit out the year the numbers get pretty significant do you have anything you want to add too jimmy henderson chief financial officer yes no you re exactly right so our telecom is a little bit light on the first half and we re pretty strong in the back half of the year you ll see that in the back half of the year on production michael scialla stifel financial corp analyst great thank you guys lynn peterson chief executive officer yeah thanks mike operator our next question comes from scott hanold with rbc please go ahead scott hanold rbc capital markets analyst thanks good morning all lynn i don t want to beat a dead horse but i feel like i m going to here on dividends versus stock buybacks you obviously made a lot of compelling cases that buybacks make a lot of sense and they do provide a lot of flexibility i guess to a certain extent and maybe at a high level it would be helpful if you could just give us a sense i know it sounds like buybacks are an option you re looking at and it sounds like the next step but why not that be the first step like what was the decision to go with the dividend before the buyback lynn peterson chief executive officer well scott i wish you could be at all these investor calls we have because like i said some guys don t want any dividends others want every 0 01 of free cash flow so these are hard decisions to make and again a lot of comments were investors want the cash in their pocket they can reinvest in the stock if they want to if they want to reinvest in something else they can stock buybacks and maybe we should have combined it i m not saying we did exactly right here we probably should announce the combination of the buyback and a fixed dividend looking back now but again we re going to get there quickly so i m not too concerned we just thought we d do the fixed dividend first and then follow it up with the stock repurchase jimmy henderson chief financial officer yes and probably just to add just kind of the process of getting a dividend we re going to announce it so we can kind of get that get the record date set and get started paying actual cash scott hanold rbc capital markets analyst and then how do you contemplate usage when you think about usage of the free cash flow and look i think it s you guys got a good runway of inventory for at least five years and maybe a little bit longer but obviously when you think about the durability and sustainability of the free cash flow generation i think generally investors would like to see it somewhere in that decade plus if they can and so obviously it feels like that potentially some of that free cash flow could be earmarked for various types of consolidation but like can you give us a sense of like as you look at that free cash flow wall that you re seeing how much of that dry powder do you think make sense to keep in your hands for opportunities if they pick up lynn peterson chief executive officer it s a good question and i think the size of the company matters in this regard i mean i share your comment on our inventory i think we re fine but we re not where we want to be i think that was really what drove us in 21 to pay down our revolver i mean and again i got to you ve got to remember we started the year at 35 40 wti and we were in a totally different world where we ended up at 80 at the end of the year so things have changed dramatically here but we are constantly looking to see if we can find properties that compete against our current properties and we want to have some dry powder to execute on those and i don t know what the right number is again you see companies kind of 40 50 i know there s a few out of 60 of free cash flow in total between fixed stock buybacks and variable dividends so i think ultimately that still allows us to pursue these acquisitions when we find them and keep our balance sheet strong i mean we re trying to do a lot of things here and we re fortunate to have a really strong balance sheet right now we want to protect that but we do want to grow the company at the same time jimmy henderson chief financial officer yes also remember scott that we have an untapped revolver of 750 million of capacity on it so it s not a matter of porting cash to save our pennies for a deal we got a lot liquidity that we can tap to these things scott hanold rbc capital markets analyst would you be willing to use equity to do some of that that made sense or is that a nonstarter discussion lynn peterson chief executive officer no i think we ve used it in the past and i don t have a problem with all with us now if we think our stock inside at a reasonable number i mean again you got to just evaluate the time you are in and where you think your stock is right now we use cash versus our stock because we think our stock is it s below what we think we re worth so we would tend to use more of the cash position scott hanold rbc capital markets analyst understood thank you operator your next question comes from david deckelbaum with cowen please go ahead david deckelbaum cowen and company analyst good morning lynn jimmy thanks for squeezing me in here lynn peterson chief executive officer hey david how are you doing david deckelbaum cowen and company analyst doing well congrats on the operations update you pointed out the delays i think is a five well pad which i believe was in the cassandra area for context as we move forward here particularly with the higher working interest in sanish how long should we be thinking about those two rigs staying in that sanish area or are there going to be more of these sorts of longer lateral developments that get sprinkled into the program lynn peterson chief executive officer maybe i ll let chip take the first shot at that if you don t mind chip rimer chief operating officer yes will do david thanks for the question yes our program has about 65 of our program is in sanish and then we move to the west the hidden bench forming later in the year we re probably close to 35 maybe a little bit more than that or three miles as we go along so that will drive capital efficiency as we go and help to minimize some of the inflation impacts and so that s kind of what the program has us doing right now we ll run back up into that cassandra area later this year and knock out that additional pad that was delayed lynn peterson chief executive officer one of the things that matters a lot to us is all this esg conversation i think as we look bringing these wells on we want to make sure we have the takeaway that s required we re not allowing trying to flare anything and done a great job working with our midstream partners and so some of this movement is dictated because of the commodity takeaway as well chip rimer chief operating officer it was a mechanical issue up in the cassandra not a systemic issue so we ll get it back over there later in the year lynn peterson chief executive officer yep david deckelbaum cowen and company analyst yeah thanks chip and then lynn i know a lot has been asked around this but like one i think it just it seems like you ve been pretty explicit that you think whiting is perfectly capable of paying a 50 rate of its free cash while still maintaining enough cash hoarding and flexibility to pursue m a so it seems like that s a reasonable target as investors compare you to some of your peers lynn peterson chief executive officer yes i m not going to let you put a percentage on me david but i think you see the numbers and you see i think we have a lot of flexibility here and we can do the right thing and we will do the right thing we re excited about that i mean this is not a situation where we re trying to put cash on the balance sheet we want to return it to shareholders and we want to do the right thing but at the same time we are looking for opportunities yes i think your numbers are very reasonable david deckelbaum cowen and company analyst and then i guess in terms of how we should think about how that presents itself over the course of the year did the conversation when the fixed dividend i know we talked about the intention to start kind of small and build into this program but how frequently is the return of capital program being reevaluated and at some point it sounds like we should get another update at least this year but is this something that occurs on like a three month basis or it s just ad hoc lynn peterson chief executive officer yes

the backdrop of global and domestic inflation in the united states was already worrying now russia s invasion of ukraine and the global reaction to it stand to make the situation worse including sending gas prices soaring the conflict has roiled global markets causing stock market turmoil sending oil prices higher and injecting even more uncertainty into an already off balance worldwide economy it s also sparked concerns that inflation already running hot could run even hotter in the united states the consumer price index which measures the average change in prices consumers pay for goods and services was up by 7 5 percent over the past year in january that s a 40 year high the hope was that inflation would soon start to come down and that factors driving it such as high gas prices and supply chain woes would finally pass now it appears that the situation could be quite the opposite what we re observing is essentially an energy price shock and a financial markets shock that comes on the back of this already concerning inflation environment an environment in which global supply chains are already stressed and in which there is already some degree of uncertainty as to the outlook said gregory daco chief economist at ey parthenon it s not just a shock in isolation it s a shock in that context russia is one of the biggest oil and gas producers in the world and any disruptions stand to have a major impact on prices disruptions we re already seeing on tuesday president joe biden announced that the us would ban imports of russian oil natural gas and coal the united kingdom has said it will scrap russian oil imports as well these maneuvers prompted a spike in oil prices which have already been on the rise and the situation is sure to have ripple effects across the global economy in early february jpmorgan analysts projected that disruptions to oil flows from russia could push oil prices to 120 per barrel which indeed it already has for context oil was priced in the 60 per barrel range a year ago and started 2020 in the 70s and 80s some analysts have warned that worst case scenario oil prices could hit 200 and russia has warned that 300 oil prices could be on the horizon depending on what europe which is much more reliant on russian oil and gas than the us does in the us russian oil made up about 3 percent of shipments in 2021 according to bloomberg and when you include other petroleum products that rises to 8 percent that s not a ton but it s not nothing either major oil companies such as shell and bp have said they ll stop buying oil and gas from russia and curb business with the country which is causing volatility and prices changes as well europe is starting to move away from its dependence on russia too americans already dealing with high gas prices and annoyed at the rising costs of heating their homes are in for a bumpy ride gas prices matter not just for people filling up the tanks of their cars but also because of shipping and transportation the conflict could also translate to high diesel prices and jet fuel for airplanes the inflation machine is just not going to slow down said patrick de haan head of petroleum analysis at gasbuddy according to aaa the average price of gas nationally is 4 17 a gallon up significantly from 2 66 a year ago that number now stands to climb even higher especially as the summer months approach which will put more people on the road as the new york times points out the last time gas prices were so high was during the 2008 financial crisis when adjusted for inflation a gallon was priced at about 5 37 joe brusuelas chief economist at accounting and consulting firm rsm told cnn in february that the russia ukraine conflict could push inflation to 10 percent year over year driven in part by gas by his calculation an increase in oil prices to 110 could increase consumer prices by 2 8 percent over the course of a year alan detmeister an economist at ubs told the new york times that oil at 120 per barrel could mean inflation at 9 percent in the coming months it becomes a question of how long do oil prices natural gas wholesale prices stay elevated he told the times that s anybody s guess in remarks at the white house on tuesday president biden acknowledged that the russia ukraine conflict and measures the us and europe have taken to push back against russia will be felt domestically this decision today is not without cost here at home he said referring to the russian oil ban the biden administration has promised to try to protect americans from a spike in gas prices over the weekend secretary of state anthony blinken told cnn that the us is talking to our european partners and allies to look in a coordinated way that prospect of banning the import of russian oil while making sure that there s still an appropriate supply of oil on world markets still the options on oil supply are limited at least in the immediate term the president has insinuated that he s got it he s going to do everything he can said de haan in february but it s not clear what other strings biden can pull on striking a new nuclear deal with oil producer iran could help but it s no silver bullet nor is it clear it s very likely to happen it s no russia in terms of oil supply de haan said the us has also begun weighing whether it could look to venezuela higher oil prices could dampen on economic growth people and companies having to spend more on oil and gas could reduce spending in other areas and that could cut into gdp by one estimate a long term increase in gas prices could cost the typical household in the us 2 000 per year there are other areas where the russia ukraine conflict could show up in consumer prices russia is the largest wheat exporter in the world as the times notes russia and ukraine make up 30 percent of global wheat exports and ukraine is also a major exporter of corn barley and vegetable oil disruptions to any of that could lead to disruptions in the commodities markets therefore pushing up prices eventually at the grocery store the conflict has caused wheat prices to surge bloomberg reported in february that the biden administration isn t yet going to impose sanctions on russia that would impact aluminum which would throw a wrench in the global supply though aluminum and metal prices have already gone up it s a combination of a set of commodities that are being produced either in ukraine or russia that have been affected daco said he warned that if further sanctions are imposed on russia it could affect aluminum and commodities prices even more it s a wide spectrum of agricultural energy and other commodities on tuesday russian president vladimir putin signed a decree banning the exports of some commodities which could have major global ramifications i took a brief moment from the news in the last hour big mistake this will have a dramatic impact on inflation global value chains growth and could cause a global recession elina ribakova elinaribakova march 8 2022 reuters reported that the white house has warned the microchip industry about the possibility that russia will curb access to some of the materials it sources from ukraine and russia and to look into diversifying the supply chain a chip shortage and kinks in the semiconductor supply chain have contributed to higher prices and challenges across a number of industries including cars and phones to be sure there s still plenty of uncertainty around what will happen in the russia ukraine conflict and its economic consequences brusuelas told marketwatch in february that the inflationary pressures depend on the severity of sanctions and what happens on the ground the us and europe have hit russia with severe sanctions that will devastate the russian economy and likely have a widespread impact on economic conditions around the world in other words economic uncertainty including inflation is probably not going away anytime soon in the united states this will be a headache for the federal reserve which is already on track to likely start to raise interest rates in an effort to combat inflation and otherwise roll back some supports for the economy energy prices mean that inflation is going to stay well above the fed s target in 2022 and that s going to stiffen the fed s resolve to normalize monetary policy this year bill adams chief economist for comerica bank told vox inflation was drastically above the fed s target in 2021 and had looked like it was about to slow in 2022 but the surge in energy prices caused by the invasion is going to keep inflation higher for longer adams did however note that the us economy is quite strong at the moment despite inflation jobs are coming back and supply chain problems are being worked out the big picture is that the us economy is strong and is well positioned to absorb a shock like higher energy prices or disruptions to commodity supply from the russia ukraine war he said we re in a better position to absorb this shock than for example in 2006 2007 when energy prices were jumping but consumer balance sheets were much more stressed than they are today still for americans already navigating inflation the current crisis is likely going to push prices up before they come down update march 8 2022 this story was updated to include new economic developments stemming from the war in ukraine
the u s securities and exchange commission is investigating whether recent stock sales by tesla chief executive elon musk and his brother kimbal musk violated insider trading rules the wall street journal reported on thursday citing people familiar with the matter the investigation began last year after kimbal a tesla board member sold shares of the electric carmaker valued at 108 million it came one day before musk polled twitter users asking whether he should offload 10 of his stake in tesla us market regulators are probing whether tesla boss elon musk and his brother violated insider trading rules in connection with the selling of shares last year tesla s stock value fell sharply after elon musk posted a twitter poll asking whether he should sell 10 percent of his stake in the company kimbal musk did not know about the twitter poll ahead of it elon musk told the financial times in an email adding that his lawyers were aware of the poll tesla shares fell sharply in the wake of musk s twitter poll an earlier settlement with the sec required his public statements about the company s finances and other topics to be vetted by the federal financial regulator s legal counsel the sec issued a subpoena on november 16 ten days after musk s poll seeking information related to some financial data the probe is looking into whether elon musk told his brother that he would post the tweet and whether kimbal musk then traded the journal reported the filing said kimbal donated 25 000 shares to charity in addition to selling 88 500 shares after the sale he still owned 511 240 shares the securities and exchange commission launched its probe after kimbal musk pictured sold 108 million in tesla stock last year tesla and spacex chief executive officer elon musk hugs his brother kimbal musk during an event in florida in may 2020 employees and managers of a listed company should not normally buy or sell securities when they are aware of information that has not yet been made public the potential probe would escalate musk s battle with regulators as they scrutinize his social media posts and tesla s treatment of workers including accusations of discrimination the richest man in the world is already in open conflict with the sec because of a 2018 tweet in which he stated that he had the appropriate funding to take tesla off the stock market without providing proof of it his presence on twitter has seen the ceo often make jokes complete with subtle references to marijuana one of his most memorable tweets came in august 2018 when he said he was considering taking tesla private at 420 funding secured it led to criticisms of his impulsive twitter use and he was slapped with fraud charges from the sec for misleading investors musk and tesla were fined 20 million apiece the number 420 is cannabis culture slang for marijuana use elon musk s presence on twitter has seen the ceo often joke complete with subtle references to marijuana and getting high on the drug musk and tesla each agreed in that case to pay 20 million as part of a settlement that also imposed strict rules on his use of social media requiring pre approval from tesla counsel over statements with key financial information a tesla lawyer reignited the battle over the settlement by sending a letter to a judge last week accusing the sec of harassing him and tesla with an endless and unrelenting investigation to punish him for being an outspoken critic of the government the letter also accused the sec of dragging its feet in distributing the 40 million to investors while it has cracked down on musk s use of social media elon musk s share sales in november were automatically executed according to a trading plan he had created on september 14 showed a filing disclosing share sales including stock options that were supposed to expire in 2022 tesla s stock has fallen about 33 since musk began selling billions of dollars worth of shares on november 8 few days after the poll where 58 of voters asked him to sell tesla and kimbal musk have not commented on the report the sec has declined to comment tesla s shares fell for the fifth straight day thursday morning to 700 a piece its lowest evaluation since august amid a global market sell off spurred by fear surrounding the russian occupation which began early thursday it has since rebounded to 768 a share as of thursday afternoon and has continued to hover around that mark
clearly the conflict in ukraine will add massive volatility to global markets and thursday night provided a taste russia s status as a major supplier of oil and gas particularly to europe saw prices of both commodities surge in early trade aluminium nickel and wheat which are also big russian exports jumped too as did the traditional safe haven of gold with inflation already at 40 year highs in the us and elevated in virtually every other corner of the world the obvious concern for investors is that the ukrainian conflict could present a worst of both worlds conundrum to central bankers the logic goes that if commodity prices rise due to the crisis inflation will move even higher potentially forcing central banks to raise rates faster and higher than previously anticipated worse still these increases would occur in an environment where global growth might suddenly be under threat due to the conflict but as the trading session went on these concerns were calmed at least for now advertisement first it became clear that the latest round of sanctions from the united states and europe would be aimed at hurting russia financially but would not threaten oil and gas supplies brent crude the key global benchmark for oil had tested us106 a barrel early on thursday evening but sank back below us100 a barrel as us president joe biden added to the good news on sanctions by saying the us was prepared to use its strategic oil reserves as necessary even gold retreated to end basically flat for the day then came even better news on the federal reserve front loretta mester president of the federal reserve bank of cleveland made it clear she still supports rate increases across 2022 but hinted a 50 basis point rise to us rates some had feared in march was likely off the table given the ukraine conflict geopolitical events add upside risk to the inflation forecast even as they put some downside risk to the near term growth forecast she said the implications of the unfolding situation in ukraine for the medium run economic outlook in the us will also be a consideration in determining the appropriate pace at which to remove accommodation and with that the relief rally was on advertisement dan ives arguably the world s best known tech analyst from us research firm wedbush securities neatly summed up the puzzle global investors are trying to solve as a rubik s cube where a series of inputs inflation earnings economic growth long term trends such as digitisation and now war are constantly changing but as this column said earlier in the week armed conflict of the type we re seeing in ukraine historically leads to short term volatility on markets if the initial market reaction tells us anything it s that every news report video and commodity price movement is going to be interpreted through the prism of what it means for interest rates making federal reserve chairman jerome powell still more important than russia despot vladimir putin at times this will spark relief among investors who believe markets are oversold but as the noted tech bull ives says this is still a risk off market digesting inflation higher than it s been in decades the prospect of six fed rate rises this year and mounting concerns about global growth the potential for sharp retreats on equity markets remains alive and well advertisement the biggest conflict in europe since world war ii isn t bullish for any stocks let alone tech names ives told bloomberg for local investors the puzzle is arguably a touch more difficult they must interpret global market moves and the state of a local economy still emerging from omicron the most obvious stocks affected by the ukrainian crisis include oil and gas giants woodside and santos agribusiness graincorp and a range of miners with perhaps rio tinto at the front of that queue it should benefit from rising aluminium prices although this is complicated by the fact russian giant rusal is a supplier and co owner of a queensland smelter
ukrainian forces battled russian invaders on three sides on thursday after moscow unleashed the biggest attack on a european state since world war two prompting tens of thousands of people to flee their homes after russian president vladimir putin declared war in a pre dawn televised address explosions and gunfire were heard throughout the day in kyiv a city of 3 million people the assault brought a calamitous end to weeks of fruitless diplomatic efforts by western leaders to avert war this is a premeditated attack us president joe biden told reporters at the white house as he unveiled harsh new sanctions coordinated with allies against russian banks oligarchs and state companies putin is the aggressor putin chose this war and now he and his country will bear the consequences he said in his address putin said he had ordered a special military operation to protect people including russian citizens subjected to genocide in ukraine an accusation the west calls baseless propaganda and for this we will strive for the demilitarization and denazification of ukraine putin said by nightfall a picture was emerging of fierce fighting across multiple fronts an adviser to the ukrainian presidential office said russian forces had captured the chernobyl former nuclear power plant just 60 miles north of the capital there was also fighting at hostomel airport just outside kyiv where paratroopers were landed a ukrainian official later said the airfield had been recaptured heavy exchanges of fire were also reported in the regions of sumy and kharkiv in the northeast and kherson in the south the highway heading west out of kyiv was choked with traffic across five lanes as residents fled fearful of bombardments while stuck in their cars the un refugee agency said an estimated 100 000 ukrainians had fled their homes thousands were crossing into neighboring countries including romania moldova poland and hungary new iron curtain the day had begun with missiles raining down on targets across ukraine and reports of troops and armor pouring across the borders from russia and belarus to the north and east president volodymyr zelenskiy called on ukrainians to defend their country and said arms would be given to anyone prepared to fight what we have heard today are not just missile blasts fighting and the rumble of aircraft this is the sound of a new iron curtain which has come down and is closing russia off from the civilized world zelenskiy said putin after referring earlier in his speech to russia s powerful nuclear arsenal warned whoever tries to hinder us should know that russia s response will be immediate and it will lead you to such consequences that you have never encountered in your history asked whether that threat was tantamount to threatening russian use of nuclear weapons foreign minister jean yves le drian said it was indeed understood as such adding that putin should also understand that nato was a nuclear alliance biden has ruled out sending us troops to defend ukraine but washington has reinforced its nato allies in the region with extra troops and planes after consulting counterparts from the group of seven leading industrialized nations biden announced measures to impede russia s ability to do business in the world s major currencies along with sanctions against banks and state owned enterprises britain also targeted banks along with members of putin s closest circle and super rich russians who enjoy high rolling london lifestyles european union leaders said measures would include freezing russian assets in the 27 nation bloc halting banks access to european financial markets and hitting kremlin interests canada and switzerland were among a number of other countries to announce new measures targeting russia china remained out of step however rejecting the description of russia s actions as an invasion russia is one of the world s biggest energy producers and both it and ukraine are among the top exporters of grain war and sanctions will disrupt economies around the world already facing a supply crisis as they emerge from the coronavirus pandemic european stocks dived to nine month lows but us stocks ended higher after biden s sanctions announcement brent oil earlier surged past 100 barrel for the first time since 2014 hang them from bridges putin said he did not plan a military occupation only to disarm ukraine and purge it of nationalists and his endgame remains unclear a senior us defense official said washington believed the invasion was intended to decapitate zelenskiy s government but it is hard to see ukrainians accepting leadership installed by moscow i think we must fight all those who invade our country so strongly said one man stuck in traffic trying to leave kyiv i would hang every single one of them from bridges a democratic nation of 44 million people ukraine is europe s biggest country by area after russia itself it voted for independence at the fall of the soviet union and has recently stepped up efforts to join nato and the european union aspirations that infuriate moscow putin who denied for months that he was planning an invasion has called ukraine an artificial construct carved from russia by its enemies a characterization ukrainians see as an attempt to erase their more than 1 000 year old history while many ukrainians particularly in the east speak russian as a native language virtually all identify themselves as ukrainian there was also some dissent in russia police detained more than 1 600 taking part in anti war rallies in 53 cities and authorities threatened to block media reports carrying false information fight or flee a resident of kharkiv ukraine s second biggest city and close to the russian border said windows in apartment blocks were shaking from constant blasts blasts could be heard in the southeastern port of mariupol near a frontline held by russian backed separatists in eastern ukraine local authorities said 26 people were wounded in shelling and an attempt by russian troops to break through into the city was thwarted civilians in mariupol packed bags we are going into hiding a woman said ukraine s ambassador to the united states oksana markarova said its forces had downed two russian helicopters and seven other russian aircraft and destroyed several russian trucks and a platoon from russia s 74th motor rifles brigade had surrendered russia s defense ministry said it had destroyed 83 land based ukrainian targets and had achieved all its goals according to interfax news agency in kyiv

francis went to the russian embassy in rome on friday to personally express his concern about the war in ukraine in an extraordinary papal gesture that has no recent precedent popes usually receive

ukraine vatican officials said they knew of no such previous papal initiative vatican spokesman matteo bruni confirmed the pontiff wanted clearly to express his concern about the war pope francis was there for just over a half hour bruni said francis has called for dialogue to end the conflict and has urged the faithful to set next wednesday as a day of fasting and prayer for peace in ukraine but

of which use similar non gaap financial measures to supplement their gaap results internally management uses this non gaap measure when evaluating operating performance because the exclusion of the items described above provides an additional useful measure of the company s operating results and facilitates comparisons of the company s core operating performance against prior periods and its business objectives externally the company believes that adjusted ebitda is useful to investors in their assessment of microvision s operating performance and the valuation of the company adjusted ebitda is not calculated in accordance with gaap and should be considered supplemental to and not as a substitute for or superior to financial measures calculated in accordance with gaap non gaap financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the costs associated with the operations of microvision s business as determined in accordance with gaap the company expects to continue to incur expenses similar to the non gaap adjustments described above and exclusion of these items from its non gaap financial measure should not be construed as an inference that these costs are unusual or infrequent the company compensates for limitations of the measure by prominently disclosing gaap net income loss which the company believes is the most directly comparable gaap measure and providing investors with a reconciliation from gaap net income loss to adjusted ebitda microvision has included a reconciliation of gaap net income loss to adjusted ebitda for the relevant periods

obvious in retrospect foley who declined to comment for this story always loomed largest among peloton s five co founders he paid his way through college by working shifts at a mars confectionery factory and at 22 was overseeing the north american manufacturing of skittles and starburst in the mid 1990s he joined the nascent citysearch com before moving to iac to run invitations website evite com but the media group was barry diller s empire not foley s as he later told national public radio by the age of 40 he wanted to be big boutique fitness brand soulcycle didn t want to join forces with peloton getty that didn t happen at his next job running barnes noble s e reader business by then though foley and his wife jill had become hooked on the boutique fitness classes that were exploding in us coastal cities there was soulcycle with its sweat soaked mantras and flywheel which used leader boards to drive competition among riders among others but their popularity meant places in top instructors classes could sell out in minutes foley s idea looks obvious in retrospect beam classes straight into homes via a slick bike equipped with a giant flat screen that resembles a bloom berg terminal just as gaming consoles and pcs killed arcades gyms and studios would never be able to compete from the start foley s enthusiasm met indifference a pattern that would harden his conviction that scepticism should be tuned out john is the kind of person who when you say no is more determined to prove you wrong says dara khosrowshahi the uber chief executive who was a protégé of diller at the same time as foley foley had wanted to stream soulcycle and flywheel classes but neither studio was interested nor were the 400 institutional investors he toured during peloton s first three years when he finally hacked together a bike for a crowd funding campaign on kickstarter in 2013 just 178 people backed the project most of them were friends once people could experience foley s vision peloton took off by late 2019 it was making nearly us1 billion of annual revenue peloton it took thousands of pitches to angel investors to raise the us10 million needed to produce peloton s first bikes and demonstrate them in an upscale new jersey mall but once people could experience foley s vision peloton took off by late 2019 it was making nearly us1 billion of annual revenue with more than half a million of the bikes then priced at us2245 sold and as many buyers paying to stream classes that were turning instructors into celebrities it still lost money but it listed at an us8 2 billion valuation with foley saying peloton was doing nothing short of selling happiness advertisement as that christmas approached peloton hit a crisis that foreshadowed others to come the company s holiday advert seemed to show a woman pedalling furiously on her new bike to please her husband on social media where the brand loomed large it was shredded for looking like a hostage video the advertisement had been misinterpreted peloton insisted but its market value dropped by us1 billion peloton was propelled to a much larger stage than it was ready for says simeon siegel an analyst at bmo capital markets companies and people make mistakes the problem is this company made its mistakes in front of everyone by the time the pandemic had taken hold in 2020 it looked like foley had successfully silenced doubters for the three months to june that year when lockdowns were most widespread in peloton s markets revenue almost tripled and the average bike was used at twice the pre pandemic rate at first peloton s only problem was keeping up with demand soon though it was struggling to keep pace with investors expectations to feed the beast the company needed to continue showing growth siegel says but because of the growth the company began to drink its own kool aid and believed it would last for ever covid 19 he says went from being the best thing that happened to peloton to the worst something special lee baker was one of peloton s pandemic converts a cultural anthropologist at duke university in north carolina the 55 year old grew up cycling from oregon to california on camping trips when his gym closed during the pandemic he ordered a peloton decades after academics started worrying about americans bowling alone baker found that peloton had created a more intense community experience in the digital realm than real life workouts ever had i ve never high fived people in the gym he says but on the peloton there s us and then there s them the non peloton people we are something special because we are together pushing each other and co operating ally love is one of peloton s top instructors advertisement like most peloton enthusiasts baker has a favourite instructor ally love an oprah like figure for a generation that never watched daytime television she has 830 000 instagram followers a modelling career and a business that emboldens women to unleash their inner boss while selling us25 pairs of socks vogue covered love s wedding and her classes attract thousands yet they still seem wildly intimate baker says they re totally manufacturing this experience she s not talking to me but you can fake yourself into thinking the instructor s totally motivating you this is what behavioural economists call temptation bundling explains katy milkman a professor at the university of pennsylvania s wharton business school attractions such as charismatic instructors make us more likely to exercise the bikes are commitment devices milkman adds their high upfront cost inducing guilt about skipping workouts too big too fast there is little doubt that users love what peloton is selling says daniel mccarthy a marketing professor at atlanta s emory university who counts his wife among those with a semi religious devotion to the product the question is how many more potential converts are out there pulling people into the church of peloton has been getting more expensive the company spent almost one third of its revenue on sales and marketing in the last quarter of 2021 revenue shot up from us1 2 billion to us4 4 billion between 2019 and last year but undisciplined spending meant net losses also ballooned from us191 million to more than us1 1 billion they got too big too fast and they believed too much too fast says nate pund a managing director at investment bank houlihan lokey it s really hard to see a profitable future for peloton echoes his colleague jeremy hirsch who leads the bank s fitness advisory group the bikes are commitment devices says katy milkman of wharton business school their high upfront cost inducing guilt about skipping workouts as such criticism grew foley spoke of building a netflix like media company as he struck a content deal with beyoncé and spent a reported us50 million each on studios in new york and london last august he broke ground on a us400 million factory in ohio designed to augment the company s imports from taiwan posing with a shovel beside the state s governor he pledged to create 2100 jobs in the heartland advertisement some of foley s personal spending raised eyebrows too tabloids gossiped when he and jill then head of peloton s apparel business bought a us55 million hamptons house or when they threw a lavish black tie celebration at new york s plaza hotel last december the peloton instructors they invited to the event posted glamorous snaps on insta gram those they didn t fumed like movie stars left off a hollywood mogul s guest list meanwhile peloton was recruiting at a breakneck pace in the two years to last june its headcount grew from less than 2000 to 8662 some of the hiring suggested peloton could not decide whether it wanted to be a mass market company or something more aspirational insiders complained in new york it hired producers to make streaming content for every jim and jane one former employee says they were trying to do 94 different things outsiders also saw risks in chasing a wider audience they are trying to be both toyota and lexus says reid hoffman the linkedin co founder and an investor who has met foley but owns no stake in peloton the question is whether that s possible hoffman adds that he only invests in entrepreneurs who have the courage of their convictions explaining that the great ones make decisions on vision alone because there are no data on new markets but the risk is that you can drive the bus over the cliff lavish spending some people lower down foley s org chart worried about the looming cliff gregory rios joined in 2020 as the stock was climbing and found he loved his job delivering bikes the brand s cachet made interactions with customers something to look forward to not only were the wages and benefits generous but if inventories were scarce rios would get the day off with a full 10 hours pay rios not his real name is one of 17 current and former employees the financial times spoke with to understand peloton s wild covid 19 ride nearly all described it as a great employer but offered myriad examples of lavish spending by early last year rios was thinking it couldn t last customers were waiting four months for deliveries shift cancellations suggested an inability to manage inventories and expenses seemed out of control he could not understand why the company s leaders remained relentlessly upbeat they saw covid 19 as a one off headache for supply but would not countenance that it might be a similarly singular catalyst for demand i m just a regular guy and i could see it wasn t sustainable rios says all you had to do is watch cnbc all day long it tells you this is a pandemic stock two events left rios questioning management s thinking in february foley said the company would spend us100 million on air freight to overcome shipping delays and that may after initially pushing back against a consumer safety body the ceo recalled peloton s us4300 treadmills after one was involved in a child s death before the covid 19 supply chain crisis a bike would be replaced if it had the slightest scratch on it a van driver tells the ft another says they would be sent to fetch a whole new bike if the seat did not fit correctly returned bike frames would often be junked if a simple fix was not possible former warehouse workers say many employees considered such waste insane but warehouses were going through inventories at a rapid clip and some had no space for returned bikes peloton prioritised perfection workers claim so customers would never be sent a refurb advertisement the waste was accepted as a byproduct of blitz scaling or pursuing speed over efficiency in the six years before covid 19 hit peloton s revenue had more than doubled annually during the pandemic blitz scaling s inefficiencies became more ingrained in operations until eventually unchecked costs outstripped slowing demand and escalating losses triggered a crisis they didn t really think financially during the worst part of the pandemic says one warehouse supervisor they were just spending spending spending the culture of perfection began to deteriorate as did company generosity when warehouses spotted that many bike frames arriving from taiwan were corroding internal documents reviewed by the ft show peloton responded with project tinman a series of protocols on how to spot and remove rust while defining what levels were acceptable instead of bikes being thrown out or sent back the pendulum swung the other way many were fixed but seven employees in three states say plenty of bikes rusting from the inside were knowingly sent to customers because of unrealistic quotas and a deterioration in quality controls amid low inventories higher ups responded by throwing money at the problem sending hundreds of gallons of rust sealant to one warehouse we didn t even go through a five gallon bucket the supervisor said they would spend insane amounts of money on things we would never use peloton says it immediately responded to the isolated issue emphasising that the abnormal oxidation was limited to non structural areas of the bikes that had no effect on their quality durability and reliability if we become aware that this specific issue has caused a problem for any member a company spokesman says we will replace the bike rios premonition proved correct in late summer as his guaranteed weekly hours were cut from 40 to 30 then to zero on some days he would set off for work having paid for childcare only to find there were no bikes to ship or pay for the day executives hit hard wall street sentiment had also been turning against peloton and soon the bears had numbers to support their suspicion that pandemic demand would subside as gyms reopened last august earnings fell short and the company signalled slowing subscriber growth by november peloton was cutting its full year sales outlook by as much as us1 billion foley told analysts he had never been more excited about the future but this time they weren t buying it the stock crashed 40 per cent advertisement that hit some peloton executives hard says one person familiar with the matter several had borrowed against their shares allowing them to cash in some of 2020 s stock price gains without incurring a steep tax bill within days they faced margin calls to post more collateral this person says with one executive seeing their net worth fall to us7 million from us35 million unknown to foley another threat was emerging jason aintabi s blackwells capital had been a peloton shareholder on and off since the initial public offering and bike rides had helped him get through the pandemic s early months but november s news enraged him executives had assured analysts at the company s earnings announcement they saw no need to raise more capital even though it had burnt through us561 million of cash that quarter yet 12 days later they did exactly that diluting owners such as blackwells with a us1 1 billion stock offering aintabi felt misled and began plotting to unseat foley after chris noth s character in and just like that died after using a peloton bike the company responded by making an ad with the actor the chief executive had other fires to fight the december 2021 reboot of sex and the city featured a storyline in which the show s mr big died from a heart attack after exercising on a peloton bike social media exploded with jokes about the company killing a beloved character peloton seeming to have learnt from its previous viral debacles responded within 48 hours with a humorous commercial starring the same actor chris noth but before it could blunt the damage noth faced accusations of sexual assault by multiple women he denied them and peloton pulled the ad but the episode cost it us1 8 billion in market value then a month later peloton s shares plummeted further when a leak suggested it was halting production amid collapsing demand foley denied some of the claims but confirmed lay offs were possible even if they would be done with the utmost care and compassion what had infuriated aintabi is that supervoting shares gave foley and seven other insiders effective control of peloton no matter what happened to demand production or the stock foley s position seemed secure aintabi set out to change that publicly urging the board on january 24 to fire foley and put peloton up for sale remarkably the company is on a worse footing today than it was prior to the pandemic aintabi charged as he criticised its spending and asked why jill foley was running its apparel arm the market pressure peloton had evaded for a year suddenly had a face what aintabi did not know was that the board had already engaged headhunters spencer stuart to find a successor wild ride advertisement peloton unveiled its new chief executive barry mccarthy on february 8 while further slashing sales forecasts axing the ohio plant and announcing us800 million of cost cuts almost equal to 2020 s total operating expenses foley stayed on as executive chairman mccarthy jumped to the top of the headhunters list when he was introduced to the board a few weeks earlier by tcv one of the company s earliest investors he had earned the venture capital firm a fortune as chief financial officer of netflix and then spotify mccarthy a forthright somewhat professorial 68 year old makes for a stark contrast with foley he insists he is not erasing the founder from the picture mccarthy describes foley as a visionary like reed hastings at netflix and spotify s daniel ek he traces peloton s wild cost overruns to entrepreneurial optimism that can run ahead of itself but which was also responsible for the company s very existence founders walk this fine line between reality distortion which is the vision of the thing they re trying to build and the capacity to see the world as it is he says did they scale their fixed cost structure proportional to the growth in revenue no why because they assumed covid was the new normal and it wasn t it is undeniable our leadership team made certain decisions during covid regarding the supply chain and operations that did not work a peloton spokesman says new management has hit the reset button but its commitment to excellence in customer service is unwavering the new chief s first staff meeting misfired his introduction to the bark laden strains of who let the dogs out prompted disbelieving comments on employee chats seen by the ft the meeting ended early but what really matters is yet to come within days of telling staff to get real mccarthy was quelling speculation of a bid by nike or amazon saying he would lead for the long term if you follow what do instead of say more often than not they invest in growth over profit he says that growth will come from new content countries and products he believes and some of those products are close to launching insiders shared images of a rowing machine and details of a strength training device with which peloton could seize more of the connected fitness market how these products fare and whether mccarthy s plans work will determine whether peloton is remembered as a comeback story or a cautionary tale barclays analysts warn that peloton may become ordinary with a valuation to match mccarthy disagrees arguing it is not uncommon for extraordinary companies to find themselves staring down the barrel of darkness and despair before rebounding there was a period of time at net flix when the performance was so bad some board members stopped coming to meetings he says reed and i were literally talking about who s going to turn out the lights in the event that we had to shut it down what convinces mc carthy is the customer love peloton commands he says noting that 99 per cent of its customers renew their subscriptions each month it is a religion he says if we can t figure out what to do with that then shame on us financial times
by yuras karmanau jim heintz vladimir isachenkov and dasha litvinova associated press kyiv ukraine ap russia launched a full scale invasion of ukraine on thursday unleashing airstrikes on cities and military bases and sending troops and tanks from multiple directions in a move that could rewrite the world s geopolitical landscape ukraine s government pleaded for help as civilians piled into trains and cars to flee president vladimir putin ignored global condemnation and cascading new sanctions as he unleashed the largest ground war in europe in decades and chillingly referred to his country s nuclear arsenal he threatened any country trying to interfere with consequences you have never seen ukrainian officials said their forces were battling russians on a multiple fronts and had lost control of the decommissioned chernobyl nuclear power plant scene of the world s worst nuclear disaster russia has embarked on a path of evil but ukraine is defending itself and won t give up its freedom ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy tweeted in washington u s president joe biden announced new sanctions against russia saying putin chose this war and that his country would bear the consequences of his action the sanctions will target russian banks oligarchs state controlled companies and high tech sectors he said adding they were designed not to disrupt global energy markets russian oil and natural gas exports are vital energy sources for europe zelenskyy urged the u s and west to go further and cut the russians from the swift system a key financial network that connects thousands of banks around the world the white house has been reluctant to immediately cut russia from swift worried it could cause enormous economic problems in europe and elsewhere in the west zelenskyy who earlier cut diplomatic ties with moscow and declared martial law described russian forces advancing on a series fronts including a difficult situation developing in kharkiv ukraine s second largest city just over 20 kilometres away from the eastern border with russia and russian troops slowly advancing from the north on the city of chernihiv he said a russian airborne unit at an airport just outside kyiv the capital was being destroyed he appealed to global leaders saying that if you don t help us now if you fail to offer a powerful assistance to ukraine tomorrow the war will knock on your door both sides claimed to have destroyed some of the other s aircraft and military hardware though little of that could be confirmed hours after the invasion began russian forces seized control of the zone around the now unused chernobyl plant after a fierce battle zelenskyy adviser myhailo podolyak told the associated press a ukrainian official said russian shelling hit a radioactive waste repository and an increase in radiation levels was reported the official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter a nuclear reactor at the plant 130 kilometres 80 miles north of ukraine s capital kyiv exploded in 1986 sending a radioactive cloud across europe the damaged reactor was covered by a protective shelter several years ago to prevent radiation leaks this is one of the most serious threats to europe today podolyak said the chief of the nato alliance said the brutal act of war shattered peace in europe joining a chorus of world leaders who decried the attack which could cause massive casualties topple ukraine s democratically elected government and upend the post cold war security order the conflict was already shaking global financial markets stocks plunged and oil prices soared amid concerns that heating bills and food prices would skyrocket condemnation rained down not only from the u s and europe but from south korea australia and beyond and many governments readied new sanctions even friendly leaders like hungary s viktor orban sought to distance themselves from putin british prime minister boris johnson said he aimed to cut off russia from the u k s financial markets as he announced sanctions in response to the invasion as the first major world leader to make a big move johnson announced a freeze on the assets of all large russian banks and plans to bar russian companies and the kremlin from raising money on british markets johnson said of putin now we see him for what he is a bloodstained aggressor who believes in imperial conquest a senior u s official said the u n security council was expected to vote friday on a resolution condemning russia for the attack and demanding the immediate withdrawal of its forces the vote will proceed even though the legally binding measure will almost certainly be vetoed by russia said the official who wasn t authorised to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity while some nervous europeans speculated about a possible new world war the u s and its nato partners have shown no indication they would send troops into ukraine fearing that would risk a larger war they instead mobilised troops and equipment around ukraine s western flank as ukraine pleaded for defense assistance and help protecting its airspace nato also reinforced its members in eastern europe as a precaution make no mistake we will defend every ally against any attack on every inch of nato territory said nato chief jens stoltenberg biden said the u s was deploying additional forces to germany to bolster nato the first attacks came from the air ukrainian authorities later described ground invasions in multiple regions and border guards released video of a line of russian military vehicles crossing into ukraine s government held territory european authorities declared the country s airspace an active conflict zone it wasn t until late thursday afternoon that russia confirmed that its ground forces had moved into ukraine saying they d crossed over from crimea the southern region that russia annexed in 2014 after weeks of denying plans to invade putin launched the operation on a country the size of texas that has increasingly tilted toward the democratic west and away from moscow s sway the autocratic leader made clear earlier this week that he sees no reason for ukraine to exist raising fears of possible broader conflict in the vast space that the soviet union once ruled putin denied plans to occupy ukraine but his ultimate goals remain hazy ukrainians who had long braced for the prospect of an assault were urged to shelter in place and not to panic until the very last moment i didn t believe it would happen i just pushed away these thoughts said a terrified anna dovnya in kyiv watching soldiers and police remove shrapnel from an exploded shell we have lost all faith with social media amplifying a torrent of military claims and counter claims it was difficult to determine exactly what was happening on the ground ap reporters saw or confirmed explosions in the capital in mariupol on the azov sea kharkiv in the east and beyond ap confirmed video showing russian military vehicles crossing into ukrainian held territory in the north from belarus and from russian annexed crimea in the south russia and ukraine made competing claims about damage they had inflicted russia s defense ministry said it had destroyed scores of ukrainian air bases military facilities and drones and confirmed the loss of a su 25 attack jet blaming pilot error it said it was not targeting cities but using precision weapons and claimed that there is no threat to civilian population ukraine s armed forces reported at least 40 soldiers dead and said a military plane carrying 14 people crashed south of kyiv poland s military increased its readiness level and lithuania and moldova moved toward doing the same border crossings increased from ukraine to poland which prepared centers for refugees putin justified his actions in an overnight televised address asserting the attack was needed to protect civilians in eastern ukraine a false claim the u s predicted he would make as a pretext for invasion he accused the u s and its allies of ignoring russia s demands to prevent ukraine from joining nato and for security guarantees he called the military action a forced measure stemming from rising security risks for russia anticipating international condemnation and countermeasures putin issued a stark warning to other countries not to meddle in a reminder of russia s nuclear power he warned that no one should have any doubts that a direct attack on our country will lead to the destruction and horrible consequences for any potential aggressor among putin s pledges was to denazify ukraine world war ii looms large in russia after the soviet union suffered more deaths than any country while fighting adolf hitler s forces the kremlin has painted members of ukrainian right wing groups as neo nazis exploiting their admiration for wwii era ukrainian nationalist leaders who sided with the nazis ukraine is now led by a jewish president who lost relatives in the holocaust and angrily dismissed those claims hours before the invasion zelenskyy rejected moscow s claims that ukraine poses a threat to russia and made a

sent energy prices higher and prompted promises of a new round of consequences for russia signals that even people out of immediate harm s way will be affected by what threatens to become the biggest war in europe since world war ii here s how the invasion will have ripple effects far outside the borders of the conflict there could be collateral damage from sanctions on russia this week president biden announced a first tranche of economic sanctions on two russian banks with about 80 billion in assets and five russian oligarchs and their families and prohibited u s entities from purchasing russian sovereign debt more sanctions are expected to follow in response to what biden said is a needless act of aggression against ukraine and global peace and security the forthcoming sanctions could include restrictions on major russian banks that would dramatically affect russia s ability to conduct international business severe u s sanctions could drive up prices for everyday russians or cause russia s currency or markets to crash because the u s does not rely much on trade with russia it is somewhat insulated from direct consequences europe is more directly affected but certain sectors of the u s economy rely on highly specific russian exports primarily raw commodities the premise of sanctions is to hurt the other guy more than you hurt your own interests but that does not mean there will not be some collateral damage said doug rediker a partner at international capital strategies energy prices could rise in the early hours following russia s invasion brent crude oil was trading at more than 100 per barrel for the first time since 2014 and another benchmark west texas intermediate rose nearly 5 to more than 96 per barrel russia is a major exporter of oil and natural gas especially to europe as a result officials have reportedly shied away from severe sanctions on russian energy exports but there are other ways the energy market could be disrupted for one russia could choose to cut off or limit oil and gas exports to europe as retaliation for sanctions nearly 40 of the natural gas used by the european union comes from russia and no european country imports more than germany a key ally of the united states even if russia chooses not to limit exports supplies could still be affected by the conflict in ukraine because multiple pipelines run through the country carrying gas from russia to europe they could simply be casualties of a military invasion rediker said either way if europe s natural gas supply is pinched that could cause energy prices which have already been climbing to rise even further and even though the u s imports relatively little oil from russia oil prices are set by the global market meaning local prices could rise anyway there s a geopolitical premium or call it a fear premium in the price of oil daniel yergin vice chairman of ihs markit told morning edition an expectation that as this crisis spirals worse that supplies of oil from russia are going to be disrupted other industries from food to cars might also be hurt russia is a major exporter of rare earth minerals and heavy metals such as titanium used in airplanes russia supplies about a third of the world s palladium a rare metal used in catalytic converters and its price has soared in recent weeks over fears of a conflict ukrainian economic output and industry will likely be significantly disrupted the country is a major source of neon which is used in manufacturing semiconductors as a result u s officials have warned various sectors including the semiconductor and aerospace industries to brace for supply chain disruptions fertilizer is produced in major quantities in both ukraine and russia disruptions to those exports would mostly affect agriculture in europe but food prices around the world could rise as a result global markets could drop the invasion rattled investors wednesday with dow futures down more than 2 before the markets opened in the united states markets across asia also dropped the invasion sent the prices of traditional investment safe havens higher with gold up more than 1 5 overnight markets are fundamentally not prepared for a land war in europe in the 21st century rediker said it s something people just have not contemplated the u s stock market has already been unusually volatile in recent weeks churning over inflation moves by the federal reserve to curb its stimulus programs and the looming conflict in ukraine historically the market has bounced back relatively quickly after geopolitical events that s what s most likely today too analysts say so the effect on people with 401 k accounts may be short term but if the conflict causes long lasting disruption of energy markets and other exports investors could rethink that conventional wisdom you re potentially at a point where not only are we looking at russia potentially invading ukraine and sanctions and countermeasures but you are also looking at a rise of china that doesn t necessarily agree with the american perspective on the world anyway rediker said last week before the invasion are we looking at a point in which some of the major premises that people take for granted have to be reassessed russia could launch disruptive cyberattacks another way russia could respond to u s sanctions is through cyberattacks and influence campaigns various federal agencies including the treasury and the department of homeland security have warned of possible cyberattacks on targets like big banks and power grid operators they have been warning everyone about russia s very specific tactics about the possibility of attacks on critical infrastructure katerina sedova a researcher at georgetown university s center for security and emerging technology told npr russian cyberattacks have targeted ukraine relentlessly in recent years including attacks on the capital city of kyiv s power grid in 2015 and 2016 but a major escalation could shift focus to u s targets sedova pointed to the russian state backed attack on the it software company solarwinds and a ransomware attack that shut down the colonial pipeline for six days as examples of how major russian cyberattacks could disrupt u s operations the biden administration said it does not believe the russian government was involved in the pipeline attack power grids hospitals and local governments could all be targets she said for now sedova said she is more worried about subtler attacks like influence campaigns that aim to sow discord between us and our allies in our resolve to act jointly against russia oftentimes cyber operations go hand in hand with influence she said they re targeting a change of decision making a change in policy in that direction a change in public opinion a major invasion would likely spark a refugee crisis the invasion could send 1 million to 5 million refugees fleeing ukraine u s officials and humanitarian agencies have warned it will be a continent wide humanitarian disaster with millions of refugees seeking protection in neighbouring european countries agnès callamard secretary general of amnesty international said last month in statement poland which shares a border with ukraine and is already home to more than a million ukrainians would likely see the most refugees polish interior minister mariusz kaminski said his country was preparing for an influx of refugees from ukraine the u s military says that the thousands of soldiers deployed to poland this month are prepared to assist with a large scale evacuation assistance with evacuation flow is something they could do and could do quite well they are going to be working with polish authorities on what that looks like and how they would handle that defense department spokesperson john kirby said last week at the largest scale a refugee crisis would not be contained to europe the u s would likely see refugees seeking asylum too what
