opinion the biggest financial fraud in history is now being inflicted on the american people and others in the form of inflation do you find it odd that banks and other financial institutions provide mortgage loans to millions at an approximately 3 interest rate for 30 years while the government reports that inflation is over 6 at an annual rate and rising are you frustrated that you are a responsible and prudent person who saves for a rainy day or retirement and your savings account only pays 1 or so interest while inflation is many times that do you find it odd that the government official most responsible for inflation treasury secretary and former fed chairman janet yellen several months ago told us that inflation would be mild and transitory neither of which has turned out to be correct do you suspect that she may not know what she is doing particularly when she says that more record government spending will bring down inflation do you find it odd that energy secretary jennifer granholm only laughs when reporters ask how much the oil pipeline shutdowns and abandonments and the significant increases in regulations on oil producers have increased gas and oil prices do you think it is odd that transportation secretary pete buttigieg takes a two month paternity leave during the country s biggest supply chain crisis and offers no meaningful solutions while many dozens of ships are waiting to be unloaded do you think it is odd president joe biden has nominated a woman to be comptroller of the currency who is on record wanting to nationalize banks and desiring to shut down the oil and gas industry before economic energy substitutes are developed when watching interviews with many government officials one wonders if it is really possible they are that stupid or do they have a different agenda it is no secret that many of those in government like to spend other people s money their ability to spend is limited by their inability to extract more tax revenue or by borrowing at some point people reduce the amount of labor and savings they are willing to have taxed often by refusing to work at least in the legal economy or save more given that universal fact governments resort to borrowing as those who provide the loans to the government most often by purchasing government bonds become more concerned about any government s federal state or local etc ability or willingness to pay back the debt and interest they demand higher returns to compensate for the risk this again puts a natural limit on the amount of borrowing a government can do but what happens if the people in government find a way to make the loans they obtain from private parties appear to be risk free or better yet find ways to subsidize them this is now being done on a massive scale the side effects are inflation which reduces the real incomes of workers and savers inflation is an un legislated tax particularly on low income people resulting in a massive transfer of wealth from the poor to those who are rich or well off the beneficiaries are frequently the politically well connected such as union and other interest group leaders government bureaucrats crony capitalists etc to keep the government from just printing money to cover its expenses which most everyone understands would create inflation the federal reserve the u s central bank is subject to several restrictions for instance it is not allowed to buy government debt directly from the treasury so it does an indirect workaround until 2010 the fed banks never held more than one trillion in federal government debt that number is now almost six trillion and is still growing several years ago notable monetary experts such as former federal reserve cleveland bank president jerry jordan and current world bank president david malpass warned that the fed was losing the traditional means to control inflation they and knowledgeable others believe we are now close or even beyond that point banks and others are willing to lend large amounts of money to politically preferred customers home buyers and many large companies because they are lending other people s money including the taxpayer rather than their own at the same time many small businesses and those in the oil and gas business gun dealers etc are having a hard time obtaining loans because the biden administration has let it be known that institutions that make such loans will be critically looked at by the financial regulators we are rapidly moving to a system where the government allocates capital as is done in socialist and communist states rather than the market the result will be misallocating money and theft from lending to friends and political allies resulting in lower growth lower incomes and a significant loss in liberty as inflation accelerates and economic restrictions like price controls multiply people increasingly will acquire and use hard to regulate private money substitute alternatives such as bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies including those with real backing that future is upon us richard w rahn is chairman of the institute for global economic growth and mcon llc

george town cayman islands nov 15 2021 globe newswire consolidated water co ltd nasdaq global select market cwco a leading developer and operator of advanced water supply and treatment plants reported results for the three and nine months ended september 30 2021 quarterly and first nine month comparisons are to the same year ago period unless otherwise noted the company will hold a conference call at 11 00 a m eastern time tomorrow to discuss the results see dial in information below financial and operational highlights retail revenue for the third quarter of 2021 increased 5 to 5 2 million and bulk revenue increased 13 to 6 9 million for the first nine months of 2021 revenue totaled 50 2 million which included bulk revenue up 8 to 19 8 million and services revenue up 6 to 10 5 million as of september 30 2021 cash and cash equivalents totaled 40 4 million working capital was 69 3 million debt was 0 2 million with stockholders equity at 157 4 million paid 1 3 million in dividends in q3 2021 perc water continued to expand its recurring revenues by signing a five year wastewater plant maintenance services contract with a gaming and live entertainment business in southern california management commentary the continued cessation of tourism on grand cayman due to the global pandemic resulted in our retail segment revenue up only about 5 compared to the same year ago quarter on about a 1 increase in volume yet still far below historical levels commented consolidated water ceo rick mctaggart however our bulk water segment increased 13 to 6 9 million performing better than anticipated our manufacturing segment revenue generated by our aerex subsidiary decreased as a result of reduced orders from a major customer although it is important to note that all the manufacturing revenue we recognized for the quarter was from new customers and or products in fact we generated manufacturing revenue of 3 2 million from new customers and products for the first nine months of the year this was the result of a strengthened manufacturing sales team at aerex which is focused on new market sectors to diversify our product mix and customer base like many companies our manufacturing segment has been adversely affected by supply chain challenges including material shortages price increases and logistical delays this has pushed out to next year certain orders we had expected to complete in the last half of 2021 as a result we expect revenue for our manufacturing segment for the second half of 2021 to be about equal to the first half we continue to build manufacturing backlog and have refocused on the municipal water market which has been active and is expected to benefit significantly from the recently passed federal infrastructure funding bill we are actively rebuilding our municipality relationships and sales channels with this supporting greater revenue diversification our services revenue increased 6 to 10 5 million for the first nine months of the year which accounted for 21 of overall revenue compared to 17 for the same year ago period this was driven by growth in our perc water subsidiary during the quarter perc continued to grow its recurring revenues by signing a five year contract to provide operating and maintenance services for the wastewater plant of a gaming and live entertainment business in southern california new project opportunities for perc both sole sourced and competitively bid continue to be strong and include bids for two major projects that were submitted in the first nine months of this year we expect to hear whether perc was selected for these projects by early next year but based on this overall increased bidding activity that reflects strengthening market demand we believe perc s performance for 2022 will exceed this year as new water treatment projects come to market after the lull due to the pandemic near the end of october the cayman islands government announced that the country will reopen its borders for nearly all vaccinated travelers this saturday november 20th we see the reopening as a major step toward the reopening of hotels and resorts in grand cayman and expect a gradual return to normalcy for our retail water segment the bahamas remains open to tourism and we are seeing increased marketing activity to tourists we believe our strong balance sheet and liquidity enables us to ride out the continued adverse economic impacts of the pandemic while enabling us to fund growth initiatives we see the increase in perc s bidding activity and the increased project activity in our markets as potential major catalysts for our growth in 2022 and thereafter q3 2021 financial summary revenue for the third quarter of 2021 declined by 7 to 16 4 million from 17 7 million for the third quarter of 2020 the decline reflects decreases of 141 000 in services segment revenue and 2 2 million in manufacturing segment revenue the decrease in revenue for these segments was partially offset by an increase of 254 000 in retail segment revenue and 807 000 in bulk revenue retail revenue increased due to a 1 increase in the volume of water sold by cayman water the sales volumes for both 2021 and 2020 are significantly below the historical volumes for the retail segment prior to 2020 due to the continuing cessation of tourism on grand cayman resulting from border restrictions initiated in march 2020 in response to the covid 19 pandemic the increase in bulk segment revenue was attributable to an increase in energy costs for cw bahamas which increased the energy pass through component of cw bahamas rates the decrease in services revenue was due to a decline in plant construction revenue of 525 000 partially offset by an increase of 385 000 in revenue from operating and maintenance contracts attributable to new contracts the decrease in manufacturing revenue for the third quarter of 2021 was due to the loss of orders from aerex s former largest customer gross profit decreased 8 to 5 7 million for the third quarter of 2021 from 6 2 million for the same year ago quarter with gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreasing from 35 2 to 34 7 net income from continuing operations attributable to stockholders was 1 4 million or 0 09 per basic and diluted share compared to net income of 1 8 million or 0 12 per basic and diluted share for the third quarter of 2020 net income attributable to consolidated water stockholders for the third quarter of 2021 which includes the results of discontinued operations was 286 000 or 0 02 per basic and fully diluted share as compared to 1 4 million or 0 09 per basic and fully diluted share for the third quarter of 2020 cash and cash equivalents totaled 40 4 million as of september 30 2021 as compared to 41 2 million as of june 30 2021 first nine months 2021 financial summary revenue for the first nine months of 2021 was 50 2 million down 13 compared to 57 5 million for the same year ago period the decrease was primarily driven by decreases of 1 6 million in the retail segment and 7 7 million in the manufacturing segment the decrease in total revenue was partially offset by increases of 1 5 million in the bulk segment and 572 000 in the services segment retail revenue decreased due to the volume of water sold which decreased by 9 this sales volume decrease is due to the continuing cessation of tourism on grand cayman resulting from border restrictions initiated in march 2020 in response to the covid 19 pandemic the decrease in manufacturing segment revenue was due to the loss of orders from aerex s former largest customer the increase in services segment revenue was due to an increase of 2 7 million in revenue from operating and maintenance contracts attributable to new contracts which served to more than offset a decline in plant construction revenue of 2 1 million the increase in bulk segment revenue is attributable to an increase of 3 in the volume of water sold by cw bahamas and an increase in energy costs for cw bahamas which increased the energy pass through component of cw bahamas rates gross profit for the first nine months of 2021 was 17 9 million or 35 6 of total revenue down 19 from 22 0 million or 38 2 of total revenue for the same year ago period net income from continuing operations attributable to stockholders for the first nine months of 2021 was 1 2 million or 0 07 per basic and diluted share compared to net income of 7 6 million or 0 50 per diluted share for the same year ago period net loss attributable to consolidated water stockholders for the first nine months of 2021 which includes the results of discontinued operations was 390 000 or 0 03 per basic and fully diluted share down from net income of 3 2 million or 0 21

london the travel details of the huge number of world leaders company ceos and investors who made their way to glasgow for the latest united nations climate change conference cop26 may seem trivial the carbon footprint of their transport of choice plane car or train or the size of their entourage pales in importance when compared to that of the agreements they hope to achieve but the reality is that without careful planning of the journey it would have been impossible to bring these people together for this essential event the same can be said of the explosion of interest by investors and companies in committing to reach net zero carbon dioxide emissions by 2050 the glasgow financial alliance for net zero initiative launched in april now represents over 450 financial firms responsible for assets of roughly 130 trillion that are committed to achieving net zero by 2050 or sooner these promises are significant but they leave financial markets in an interesting position there is considerable information about companies long term climate goals but very little about the near term steps they will take to achieve them to put this in context imagine that a company publishes a 2050 revenue forecast but provides few details about its 2025 revenue projections how the business will scale over time or its short term strategy in order to appraise the credibility of companies pledges investors need more details on near term planning up to 2025 and how these actions will advance the 2050 net zero goal the emphasis on 2025 reflects that year s potential to mark a tipping point for the net zero transition s p global s platts future energy outlooks indicates that the world must move faster to curb emissions and show concrete progress by that year or risk overshooting a 2 c rise in average global temperatures relative to preindustrial levels to avoid this outcome almost all economic sectors from heavy industry to transport would need to reduce total annual emissions to below 2019 levels by 2025 and supplies from wind and solar would need to increase 133 per cent and 98 per cent respectively from 2019 levels as with any significant transition a balance of risk and opportunity is at play in the green economic transition and demand for comparable and consistent scenario analysis continues to rise as companies seek to unlock capital and investors seek to align their portfolio strategies with the goals of the 2015 paris climate agreement with the world s assets under management increasingly committed to the net zero goal and active engagement by investors supplanting passive stewardship successful companies will be those that share detailed plans for this transition this represents a real opportunity for progressive companies to access capital directly from institutional investors and through increasingly popular environmental social and governance esg or sustainability focused indices assets in european sustainability focused passive funds trebled in 2020 the opportunities for investors in companies engaged in the green transition are clear what about the risks esg factors can and do influence credit quality specifically the ability and willingness of borrowers to meet financial commitments these criteria played a prominent role in creditworthiness and therefore in s p global credit ratings well before they were grouped together and

industry to incorporate several increasingly material risks including the energy transition such risks will be increasingly salient in august un secretary general antónio guterres called the

need access to high quality data and advanced analytics to understand and address climate related risks and develop credible adaptation plans significant progress has been made in the last 12 months but to achieve net zero by 2050 a clearer focus on near term planning and more transparency about strategy is required for the moment the destination has been set but the route to get there is still

an analyst is anticipating that the build back better plan will become law but this remains to be seen what happened shares of electric car charging company blink charging blnk 1 58 rocketed to close 17 1 higher on monday you can thank an analyst at h c wainwright for that so what shares of blink got upgraded to buy with a 50 price target at investment banker h c wainwright this morning as described in a note covered on streetinsider com as analyst sameer joshi explained blink is benefiting from several positive developments not least the passage of president biden s 1 trillion infrastructure bill which includes approximately 7 5b in funding for companies building out electric vehicle ev charging networks in the u s not only that but the administration is also advocating passage of a 7 500 incentive per ev tax refund wrote joshi plus an additional benefit of 4 500 for evs produced in u s factories with union labor and an additional tax benefit of 500 per ev that use batteries produced in the u s now what add it all up and that s as much as 12 500 in government incentives to encourage americans to buy electric cars and then charge those cars at car charging stations such as the ones blink charging is building this dual action of incentivizing evs and the ev infrastructure says joshi should help overcome drivers range anxiety that has thus far hindered ev growth it would also one imagines overcome some checkbook anxiety about the high cost of evs by having the government foot the bill for much of the purchase cost there s just one problem with all the above well one problem in addition to the one that all of this money ultimately has to come from the same taxpayers who are being expected to buy the cars turns out the 12 500 in tax incentives that the analyst is pointing to aren t included in the 1 trillion infrastructure bill at all but rather in the build back better bill the one that was supposed to be linked to the infrastructure bill but has since been decoupled from it that decoupling has hurt its chances of ever getting passed long story short the buy thesis hangs on the tenuous hope that a cash strapped government will soon volunteer to pay 12 500 to help americans buy electric cars suffice it to say that s a very thin reed with which to support the idea of buying an unprofitable car charging stock that trades for 149 times sales
municipals were slightly weaker in light trading monday but still outperformed u s treasuries which climbed higher for the third day putting the five year at a high for the year and moving the 30 year back over 2 triple a benchmarks cut yields by a basis point or two across the curve with more pressure out long in sympathy with the weaker ust ratios fell further on monday municipal to treasury ratios were at 50 in five years at 67 in 10 years and 77 in 30 years according to refinitiv mmd s 3 p m read ice data services had the five year at 49 the 10 at 70 and the 30 at 79 market participants gained some needed clarity following last week s second to last federal open market committee meeting for 2021 as the fed s balance sheet tapering cycle is set to begin later this month while not surprising the decision did eliminate some uncertainty according to jeff lipton managing director of credit research at oppenheimer inc we remain confident that the fed stands ready to take appropriate action necessary to thwart more systemic inflation and we maintain our view that the upside risks to persistent and more permanent inflation should be carefully evaluated lipton said the impact of this inflationary pressure upon ust bond prices may be felt after some counter intuitive yield movement he said despite conflicting messaging the bond market could be signaling a period of slower economic growth and elevated inflation but lipton doesn t believe there will be the onset of meaningful stagflation over the recent trading sessions the muni market held to a very tight trading range after exhibiting noted price support last week lipton said such stepping out has contributed to muni outperformance month to date with positive returns last week provided a true test of muni market resiliency given that investors needed to digest a double digit calendar which could portend heavier weekly volume between now and year end given the arrival of holiday lulls in issuance which effectively limit available marketing time he said munis are outperforming ust month to date coming on the heels of three consecutive months of negative performance now that the higher tax narrative has subsided market behavior can be more reflective of technical conditions if technical expectations play out positive returns can realistically be attained for november and december lipton said munis can enter 2022 from a position of strength he added just prior to the renewed favorable tone there was a meaningful cheapening in relative value ratios that placed 10 and 30 year benchmark ratios at 76 and 86 respectively these ratios have since retreated to below 70 and 80 respectively at the fuller valuations investors were able to capture better relative value he said in our view it would likely take an outside influence beyond the control of the muni bond market to derail the positive momentum fed policy along with fed leadership and evolving fiscal policy could very well influence market sentiment as well as yield curve behavior lipton said while we do not envision liftoff occurring before the end of the tapering sequence developing inflationary conditions and labor market performance will be closely watched for signs of a more accelerated tightening cycle while consumer price index data showed inflation trending at a 30 year high and treasuries sold off considerably on the news municipal yields wavered but ultimately finished relatively unchanged for the week noted a weekly market note from nuveen nuveen agrees it is in the fed s hands now to fight inflation one reason for this stability is the strong demand for tax exempt income cpi is only a snapshot and we believe the fed has time to control inflation first by tapering purchases then raising short term interest rates the report said the onus is on the fed to show that it intends to aggressively fight inflationary pressures otherwise we could see more upward pressure on interest rates in

primary economic topic of discussion federal reserve bank of minneapolis president neel kashkari warned against overreacting to price pressures since they will likely prove transitory we need to take it very seriously but my view is we also need to not overreact to some of these temporary factors even though the pain is real kashkari said on the face the nation television show the high prices that families are paying those are real and people are experiencing that pain right now meanwhile treasury secretary janet yellen also appearing on the show blamed the covid 19 pandemic for price pressures if we want to get inflation down she said i think continuing to make progress against the pandemic is the most important thing we can do but if you look deep into the numbers and the causes of inflation david kelly chief global strategist at jpmorgan funds said the transitory argument is largely correct with inflation measured by the consumer price index falling to 2 3 year over year by the last quarter of next year this is not to argue that the super easy monetary and fiscal policies of the pandemic should be maintained as the pandemic winds down kelly said while easy policies were in order at the height of the emergency keeping them in place as the economy moves to full recovery would only increase distortions in the economy and capital markets reducing long term economic growth and increasing the risk of financial shocks but all eyes should be on the federal reserve said steve chiavarone portfolio manager and equity strategist at federated hermes we think policymakers have been behind the curve and this is a risk if the fed anticipated instead of responding to price pressures would have made it easier for the central bank to move at a slower gentler pace if inflation proves stickier than expected taking that approach in the last several cycles helped the economy avoid inflation and supported longer expansions chiavarone said but it appears too late for that instead by potentially starting taper late relative to today s high inflation readings and with rate liftoff unlikely until june at the earliest there s reason to be concerned about the potential for

of 22 million 22 million compared to a net loss of 8 million 13 million for the same period in 2020 the increase in the loss is attributable to the addition of amortization and financing costs related

earnings of 30 million 19 million for the same period in fiscal 2020 the decrease is primarily attributable to the addition of amortization acquisition and financing costs related to project

on being thoughtful and strategic with your philanthropic dollars this is the time of year when many of us find ourselves on the receiving end of numerous requests for charitable gifts giving tuesday the biggest day in nonprofit fundraising takes place on the tuesday after black friday which is november 30th this year the state s largest single day of giving is colorado gives day slated for tuesday december 7th sorting through the various solicitations associated with these campaigns can be daunting particularly since colorado has so many well regarded nonprofits doing important work i am a huge proponent of giving back to the community but i also believe in being thoughtful and strategic with my philanthropic dollars creating a plan to guide your charitable giving will make the process easier and allow you to narrow down the requests more effectively here are some things to keep in mind when developing your plan where to give i like to give to organizations where i have a personal connection for example i am more likely to support an organization whose board i have served on or a charity that has directly helped my family children s hospital colorado saved my son s life from a near fatal brain aneurism when he was seven years old and i of course have been forever grateful for me an annual gift to the hospital s foundation is now automatic you can also ask friends and family for recommendations many people prioritize giving to organizations that help people most in need after a particularly awful natural disaster or devastating events such as the covid 19 crisis how to give money is certainly the simplest way to give but appreciated stock works as well you can also set up a donor advised fund at a community foundation or a national brokerage firm this is an easy way to give because the funds are kept in a separate account earmarked for the specific purpose of giving to charities annually donating your car or real estate can also be a wonderful way to give a large gift in some instances donating your time is more valuable than writing a check if you are particularly skilled in your profession then your expertise and reputation can be worth its weight in gold helping with the legal or financial aspects of a charity can be invaluable since those are areas where nonprofits may lack expert guidance or funding for expensive business related services one way i have given back to the community is by serving on the investment committees of eleemosynary organizations using my investment expertise to help manage their endowments helping a nonprofit expand its network is also a great way to make an impact maybe your best friend has been incredibly successful and is looking to serve on a board introducing the organization to bright visionary people is always beneficial these contacts may become board members or donors giving away money is an incredibly personal thing so the better a person knows the charity the more likely they will give or quite possibly leave the organization money in their estate how to track it create a spreadsheet or some other system to log your contributions this will help you tally up your donations and will also give you a better sense of where your dollars are going request hard copy receipts for your gifts and keep them in a file to refer back to at tax time check with your tax professionals about deductions since these rules seem to change often the nonprofits i have supported throughout the years have made a significant impact in the community and i feel immense pride in helping them advance their missions having said that everyone s philanthropic journey is different do your homework figure out which charities mean the most to you and why there are a variety of ways to give and finding the best method sometimes takes time and remember being generous to others less fortunate can leave you surprised at how wonderful it makes you feel fred taylor is a managing director and partner of beacon pointe advisors denver office he helps individuals and families build wealth live off their wealth and leave a legacy for future generations a former economic advisor to governor bill ritter fred has more than 35 years of financial services experience
the metropolitan water reclamation district of greater chicago returns to the market this week after a five year absence with a 500 million general obligation deal that offers some of the highest grade local debt with a chicago name the chicago name despite the water reclamation district s lack of ties to the city and governance by its own elected board offers investors a yield kick but heightened attention on infrastructure related bonds also could help rein in some penalties the district which manages waste and stormwater in the chicago region will offer six series including two new money series self designated as green bonds totaling 141 million with the other 359 million refunding debt in two tax exempt and two taxable tranches the metropolitan water reclamation district of greater chicago s stickney water reclamation plant the district is selling 500 million of debt this week bloomberg news jpmorgan is running the books and loop capital markets llc is co senior manager ahead of this deal fitch ratings affirmed the district s aaa rating and s p global ratings affirmed its aa rating after hitting the district with a one notch downgrade last year over its pension burden the district last publicly sold debt in 2016 a portion of which carried a self designed green label and has since relied on the state revolving fund to cover capital needs the illinois environmental protection agency manages the loan program and the illinois finance authority borrows to finance loans the district is fortunate to receive low interest cost loans from the iepa to fund many of its capital projects for the past several years approximately 70 million of loans are bonded each year said mwrd treasurer mary ann boyle the refunding will shorten the average life of the bonds and smooth annual debt service with 154 million of cash flow savings expected and 114 million of net present value savings over the repayment life although debt service increases incrementally in certain years debt capacity is increased and overall present value savings are projected to be substantial fitch ratings said of the refunding plans the district has also budgeted for the prepayment of certain outstanding state revolving fund loans providing additional debt service savings new money proceeds will help pay for the five year 787 million capital program that relies on a total of 633 million of direct and srf district borrowing with other funding coming from the army corps of engineers and stormwater management fund tax levy collections projects include the deep tunnel known as the tunnel and reservoir plan that s designed to capture storm water and prevent flooding bio solids management facility upgrades and intercepting sewers in our view these very high quality bonds can be a core holding of most municipal bond portfolios creditsights wrote in its weekly market preview authored by john ceffalio senior municipal research analyst and patrick luby senior municipal strategist unless the market truly shifts to a risk off mentality that concentrates demand into higher grade bonds we do not envision that spreads could tighten materially but at spreads that are a little wider than for many high grades mwrd bonds could provide a slight boost for income creditsights said mwrd bonds have traded at about a 27 basis point spread to the aaa index that s about 11 bps wider than a broader local go index given the market appetite for infrastructure related investments demand for the taxable bonds could result in spreads tighter than the benchmark levels creditsights said the district operates on a roughly 375 million budget with property taxes its largest revenue source reserves and liquidity remain in healthy shape and the covid 19 pandemic had little impact but its pension burden weighs on ratings as they do on the state and many local governments across illinois despite progress made in recent years the district is carrying 1 1 billion of unfunded liabilities with a funded ratio of 58 5 with airtight constitutional protections against benefit cuts mwrd took early steps ahead of most in 2013 to begin addressing the pension and other post employment retiree healthcare strains with increased funding contributions and setting up an opeb trust the district s proposed 2022 budget sends an additional 30 million to supplement the statutory contribution effective january 1 2022 the district may make revenue transfers in addition to interest income as a result a 30 million advance funding contribution is planned in the 2022 budget which is in addition to the maximum funding amount allowed by the policy boyle said the supplemental contributions bring the payment to an amount above an annual determined contribution and while they must be approved annually the goal is to maintain them to reach a 100 funded ratio in 2050 the opeb trust fund is expected to be fully funded by 2026 the rating reflects our view of mwrd s moderate debt burden and limited future debt needs said s p analyst helen samuelson the rating further reflects mwrd s good incomes and its participation in the deep and diverse chicago metropolitan area economy the district continues to have a significant unfunded pension liability fitch said however annual costs approximately 133 million in 2020 are manageable in the context of overall district operations and considering the separate levy the district has about 687 million of unlimited tax gos and 1 1 billion of limited tax gos the district s coverage area encompasses 5 2 million residents and spans 128 suburbs beyond chicago s borders correction patrick luby is a creditsights strategist his first name was incorrect in the original version of this story

2021 financial results it should be noted that the following financial results represent the consolidation of the company with its subsidiaries duos technologies inc and truevue360 total revenue for the third quarter increased 36 to 1 74 million compared to 1 28 million in the same period last year this was the aggregate of about 1 15 million for technology systems and 587 000 in recurring services and consulting revenue the increase in total revenue was the result of progress in new installations in the technology systems portion of the business following the receipt of an anticipated notice to proceed on a significant upgrade to two key installations some of that revenue was recognized during the quarter resulting in a 58 increase in technology systems revenues in comparison to the equivalent quarter a year ago however certain installations may produce revenues towards the end of the year some of which may ultimately be recorded in 2022 as a result of supply chain delays cost of revenues increased 83 to 2 80 million compared to 1 53 million in the same period last year cost of revenues on technology systems increased during the period compared to the equivalent period in 2020 by a greater amount than the increase in revenues the increase is primarily due to the additional work required to resolve previously identified quality issues most of which are now resolved as well as an increase in cost related to the deployment of an undercarriage technology the company expects costs to be lower going forward as a percentage of the overall system price cost of revenues decreased for services and consulting which comprises equipment labor and overhead necessary to support the implementation of new systems for support and maintenance of existing systems the decrease was due to lower costs in servicing clients as well as the elimination of certain costs related to the it asset management business that were recorded in the equivalent period gross margin totaled 1 06 million compared to 247 000 in the same period last year the decrease in gross margin was driven by higher costs as the result of additional work being necessary on certain of the company s installations to resolve newly identified quality issues which are now mostly resolved as well as higher costs of materials due to supply chain disruptions there was also a significant increase in cost related to the new deployment of an undercarriage technology these higher costs are anticipated to be offset in the fourth quarter and beyond by higher revenues with the net result being a move to a positive gross margin as the business expands the company anticipates an improvement in the overall gross margin for the full year reporting in 2021 with much of the improvement coming in the fourth quarter operating expenses decreased 44 to 1 38 million from 2 46 million in the same period last year the decrease in operating expenses was primarily driven by a substantial decrease in overall administration costs offset by increases in sales and marketing as well as research and development net loss totaled 2 45 million compared to net loss of 2 71 million in the same period last year the improvement in net loss was primarily attributable to the increase in revenue noted previously cash and cash equivalents at quarter end totaled 2 26 million compared to 3 97 million at december 31 2020 total revenue increased 7 to 4 54 million from 4 26 million in the same period last year this was the aggregate of about 2 74 million for technology systems and 1 8 million in recurring services revenue the increase in total revenue was driven by new revenues being recorded after delays in receiving notices to proceed for anticipated new contracts earlier in the year pushed delivery dates into the second half of this year there was a slight decrease in revenue from technology systems which was more than offset by the increase in services and consulting revenue the company is focusing on increasing its business from recurring revenue services and the increase is as the result of new contracts for existing and new systems this trend is expected to continue into 2022 cost of revenues increased 55 to 7 72 million from 4 97 million in the same period last year the increase was driven by increased costs of deployment related to certain installations where new technologies were being deployed for the first time costs for services and consulting increased at a proportionate albeit slightly slower rate than the increase in revenues and this trend is expected to continue as certain economies of scale become evident late in the year and continue into 2022 overhead more than doubled for the period reflecting higher costs for staffing current and anticipated projects although this rate of increase is expected to flatten in the fourth quarter of 2021 and beyond gross margin decreased to 3 18 million from 715 000 in the same period last year the decrease in gross margin was the result higher costs and certain delays related to supply chain issues in addition there were costs involving the company s revamping of its operations to support an anticipated increase in the number of new systems going forward the company anticipates an improvement in the overall gross margin for the full year reporting in 2021 with much of those improvements expected in the fourth quarter operating expenses decreased 27 to 4 04 million from 5 51 million in the same period last year the decrease in operating expenses can be attributed to decreases in administration costs offset by an increase in sales and marketing and research and development net loss totaled 5 81 million compared to a net loss of 6 32 million in the same period last year the improvement in net loss was primarily attributable to the impact of the cares act ppp loan forgiveness and the effect of lower operating expenses during the 2021 nine month period compared to the prior year financial outlook for the fiscal year ending december 31 2021 the company expects total revenue of approximately 8 0 million to 9 0 million the company s guidance is based on contracts in backlog and near term pending orders that are already performing or were scheduled to be executed by the fourth quarter of 2021 management also expects its operations to achieve close to breakeven for the last quarter of 2021 with an expected improved cash liquidity position by year end based on anticipated orders although uncertainties continue in the macro economic climate management believes that 2022 will yield a much stronger financial performance for revenue and be profitable for the fiscal year management commentary this quarter s return to growth was an encouraging step in the right direction while we

interim financial statements and management s discussion and analysis for the three months and nine months ended september 30 2021 filed on sedar at www sedar com non ifrs financial measures management uses both ifrs and non ifrs measures to assess the financial and operating performance of the company s operations these non ifrs measures are not recognized measures under ifrs do not have a standardized meaning under ifrs and are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies the non ifrs measures referenced in this news release include the following funds from operations ffo is a non ifrs measure of operating performance as it focuses on cash flow from operating activities realpac is the national industry association dedicated to advancing the long term vitality of canada s real property sector realpac defines ffo as net income calculated in accordance with ifrs adjusted for among other things depreciation transaction costs gains and losses from property dispositions foreign exchange as well as other non cash items and this is how the company determines ffo the company believes that ffo can be a beneficial measure when combined with primary ifrs measures to assist in the evaluation of the company s ability to generate cash and evaluate its return on investments as it excludes the effects of real estate amortization and gains and losses from the sale of real estate all of which are based on historical cost accounting and which may be of limited significance in evaluating current performance ffo should not be viewed as an alternative to in isolation from or superior to net income or cash flow from operations or results from parkit s comprehensive operations respectively or other measures calculated in accordance with ifrs ffo should not be interpreted as an indicator of cash generated from operating activities and is not indicative of cash available to fund operating expenditures or for the payment of cash distributions ffo is simply an additional measure of operating performance which highlight trends in parkit s core business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on ifrs financial measures parkit s management also uses these non ifrs measures in order to facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period and to prepare operating budgets in addition the company s definition of ffo may differ from that of other issuers about parkit enterprise inc parkit is an industrial real estate platform focused on the acquisition growth and management of strategically located industrial

avery johnson ball state university muncie ind honeysuckle specifically japanese honeysuckle is an extremely common plant that might be found in your very own backyard its sweet powerful aroma and white yellow flowers can look harmless to the eye but this plant is much more problematic than one might realize according to the invasive plant indiana plant species assessment working group it alters the forest structure by overgrowing causing small trees and shrubs to be completely covered by this plant resulting in little to no light reaching the forest floor for native vegetation to grow this is just one of the many other invasive plant species that reside here in indiana all of which are causing more and more problems as this invasive vegetation grows ball state sustainability project lack of private well regulation can cause health issues invasive plants are one of the leading disruptions to the natural ecological process according to a 1999 book titled invasive species and biodiversity management the transport of seed material and products from agriculture pose a serious and continuing threat by unintentionally bringing weeds parasites and disease organisms this damages wildlife habitat insect and plant life cycles and poses as an overall replacement to anything native and natural in the area the main issue with these species is that they can be incredibly aggressive outcompeting most native plants in a battle of natural resources according to the united states department of agriculture throwing it back to middle school science natural resources consist of air sunlight soil and water all of which are necessities for vegetation to successfully grow according to the ipswag invasive plants such as japanese honeysuckle act as a large and dense blanket completely covering anything in its path more bsu sustainability coverage bsu journalism geography project showcases area sustainability efforts cover crops save money and the soil could climate change affect solar energy if plants do not receive sunlight they don t have the ability to photosynthesize the process of converting light into energy making the chances of survival for anything indigenous slim to none native plants are the most successful and sustainable form of vegetation for our environment said jocelyn bonesteel wasson nursery s plant and groundskeeper manager they are actually a part of the larger ecosystem it s about encouraging biodiversity and keeping the current systems that are already in place well balanced state wide protocols are being put in place to help mitigate invasive vegetation the indiana terrestrial plant rule went into effect on april 18 2020 making it illegal for any selling exchanging or transportation of invasive species on the list terrestrial invasive species plants the indiana department of natural resources has a team of 10 experts who travel across the state of indiana to inspect licensed nurseries to ensure there is no selling or bartering of invasive species we have the ability to issue up to a 500 fine per plant per day upon anyone who knowingly brings an invasive species into the state of indiana said megan abraham director of the division of entomology and plant pathology at the dnr we gave businesses a year s notice in which existing invasive plant stock could be removed from the shelves therefore they had time to replace those invasive species with a native or anything that was not listed on our terrestrial invasive species plants rule invasive vegetation not only depletes our natural ecosystem but mitigation tactics come with a hefty price tag according to a 2013 report from the invasive plant advisory committee indiana landowners and agencies spent over 5 million in 2012 just by managing invasives on their land ball state sustainability project muncie forestry leadership plants native trees around city these trends in statewide control costs were noticed by the dnr essentially leading to the creation of the terrestrial plant rule in hopes that this will assist in cutting removal costs in the future the indiana native plant society works alongside the dnr to attack this issue as well the non profit organization is solely based on volunteer work its mission is to promote and protect native plants as well as provide insight on why invasive vegetation poses such a threat to the environment ellen jacquart president of the inps is concerned about what the future could look like if this problem isn t mitigated and she believes it is essential for everyone to learn more about this issue we are going to lose a lot of our natural areas and a lot of our diversity of plants and animals jacquart said i really see it as a battle that needs to be joined by everyone to protect the remaining diversity that we have plants are the basis of all life on earth i ve learned through experience and a lot of research that our native plants are the ones that lead to the greatest diversity of species the great importance of native plants is to support the diversity of all life
detroit take a step back from the picked over store shelves the stalled container ships and the empty auto showrooms and you ll find a root cause of the shortages of just about everything even as the pandemic has dragged on u s households flush with cash from stimulus checks booming stock markets and enlarged home equity have felt like spending freely again a lot and since consumer demand drives much of the u s and global economies high demand has brought goods shortages to the u s and much of the world add the fact that companies are ordering and hoarding more goods and parts than they need so they don t run out and you end up with an almost unquenchable demand that is magnifying the supply shortages that s where a big problem comes in suppliers were caught so flat footed by how fast pent up spending surged out of the recession that they won t likely be able to catch up as long as demand remains so robust that s especially so because americans still hunkered down at home more than they did before the pandemic continue to spend more on goods electronics furniture appliances sporting goods than on services like hotels meals out and movie tickets all that demand for goods in turn is helping to accelerate u s inflation unless spending snaps sharply back to services or something else leads people to stop buying so much it could take deep into 2022 or even 2023 before global supply chains regain some semblance of normalcy demand is completely skewed said bindiya vakil ceo of resilinc a consulting firm that helps companies manage supply chains this has now become more and more painful by the day advertisement one reason people may eventually stop spending so much is that everything simply costs more now consumer prices in the u s skyrocketed 6 2 percent over the past year as food gasoline autos and housing catapulted inflation to its highest pace since 1990 the laws of gravity suggest that the cumulative effect of so much inflation will eventually exert a brake on spending for now though manufacturers foresee no end to heavy demand and no end to beleaguered supply chains or spiking inflation pressures a chronic lack of computer chips has forced ford motor co for instance to revamp its system of ordering parts that require long periods from order to delivery to try to address shortages it s highlighted that the just in time operating model that s been prevalent in autos may not be the right operating model hau thai tang ford s chief operations and product officer told analysts smaller companies too have felt compelled to build up as many supplies as they can so they can still make products moriarty s gem art near chicago a family business for 40 years has been stocking up on gold silver and platinum to make necklaces and rings desperate not to run out of supplies as holiday orders pick up we re ordering a lot more than what we actually have orders for just in case said jeff moriarty the marketing manager even a normal post holiday shopping lull though it might help isn t expected to be enough to unclog ports speed shipping traffic or allow factories to replenish inventories advertisement the baseline expectation for improvement is around the middle of 2022 said oren klachkin lead u s economist for oxford economics but i think the risks of that happening later are fairly high though americans have increasingly ventured out in recent months the balance between spending on goods and services remains skewed the pent up demand that followed the economic recovery is still tilted toward goods like furniture and cars and less toward haircuts concerts and restaurant meals though services spending has grown in recent months it isn t nearly enough to close the gap since april 2020 consumer spending on goods has jumped 32 percent it s now 15 percent above where it was in february 2020 just before the pandemic paralyzed the economy goods account for roughly 40 percent of consumer spending now up from 36 percent before the pandemic u s factories have tried mightily to keep up with demand production rose nearly 5 percent over the past year according to the federal reserve despite periodic ups and downs including disruptions to auto production caused by chip shortages imports have narrowed the gap between what america s consumers want and what its factories can produce from january through september this year the u s imported 23 percent more than in the same period in 2020 in september thanks to surging imports the u s posted a record deficit in goods trade imports topped exports by 98 2 billion voracious demand for goods has accelerated as more people have become vaccinated in wealthier countries yet in poorer countries especially in southeast asia the spread of the delta variant forced new factory shutdowns in recent months and crimped supply chains again only recently did it start to recover advertisement at the same time many u s workers have decided to quit jobs that had required frequent public contact this created shortages of workers to unload ships transport goods or staff retail shops ports clogged up last month 65 ships waited off the california coast to be unloaded at the ports of los angeles and long beach two weeks worth of work the average wait 12 days that has since worsened to 78 ships with an average wait of nearly 17 days despite around the clock port operations beginning in october before the pandemic ships had set arrival times and went straight to a berth for unloading said gene seroka the l a port s executive director now with asian factory output at record highs the port is moving record levels of goods yet it s not enough to meet the demand seroka doesn t foresee the shipments easing even next year retailers have told him they plan to use the slower months of january and february if they actually are slower to replenish inventory as with ports rail lines are moving more goods through early november freight shipped by america s railroads was up 7 5 percent from a year ago truck shipments were up 1 7 percent in september yet there aren t enough drivers or trucks to move all the freight in china too manufacturers are struggling with shipping delays container shortages and cost increases shantou limei international ltd which makes children s toys in the city of shantou expects sales to fall 30 percent this year because of delays and costlier shipping advertisement the most serious problem for us is being unable to deliver goods on time because of the difficulties in securing freight containers said frank xie the company s general manager a lot of things have gone beyond our controls and expectation philip richardson an american who manufactures loudspeakers in panyu near hong kong said orders have increased 400 percent a key reason is increased demand from americans and europeans who have gone on a home electronics buying spree the price to ship goods to u s customers on a 40 foot cargo container meantime more than tripled in july the customer has to bear it or cut back on orders richardson said song wenjie owner of hand in hand electric appliance technology co a manufacturer of home appliances in jiaxing south of shanghai said that soaring cargo prices make it unprofitable to ship some goods the combination of power outages and shipping delays might lead to a 20 fall in production this year song said among european companies grappling with snarled supply lines is shoe zone a british retailer that sources most of its footwear from china shipping container prices have jumped at least five fold in 12 months said anthony smith the chief executive this will continue to impact us for at least a further six months until the issues being experienced in the whole supply chain return to more sensible

performance adjusted net loss and adjusted ebitda have limitations as an analytical tool some of these limitations are although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges the assets being

measure because it believes that adjusted gross margin is beneficial to investors for purpose of measuring the company s operational performance exclusive of certain non recurring non cash items that are not expected to be incurred in future periods specifically in excluding charges relating to the company s inventory rationalization initiatives which the company does not believe are indicative of the company s operating performance adjusted gross margin provides a performance measure that when compared period over period more accurately reflects the company s operational performance adjusted

enterprise focused vr and ar software services solutions announced financial results for its fiscal first quarter ended september 30 2021 fyq1 22 management commentary by president ceo lyron bentovim during our first three months as a nasdaq listed public company we demonstrated remarkable progress highlighted by strong revenue growth additional strategic acquisitions establishment of key partnerships and the fortification of our balance sheet we continued to see robust revenue growth across our businesses and in particular our core vr ar software and services revenue excluding project revenue which grew by over 500 period to period primarily organically as a result our gross margins increased to approximately 85 of revenue furthermore we saw a seismic shift in the awareness of the potential of the immersive industry following facebook s rebranding to meta as well as a wide array of other industry giants such as microsoft amd nvidia dropbox and match group announcing metaverse plans we believe that these will significantly propel the industry forward and serve as a strong accelerant are complimentary and beneficial to glimpse and in alignment with our vision of becoming the premier software and services vr ar company in the evolving metaverse landscape in october 2021 we capitalized on the opportunity provided by these macro tailwinds and completed a 15 million private placement comprised of common stock and warrants in addition to the largely still unutilized ipo proceeds this financing significantly solidified our financial base while providing sufficient capital for us to effectively pursue many of the growth opportunities in front of us importantly this financing was structured in a healthy manner for the company with a select number of institutional investors and at a price that was approximately 43 above our recent july 1 2021 ipo price and with warrants priced at approximately 110 above our ipo price we currently have over 25 million of cash no material liabilities and a controlled and relatively low cash burn we expanded glimpse s global investment profile with the listing of our common shares on the frankfurt stock exchange and several

established glimpse australia as a base of potential future operations in australia on october 1 2021 we acquired xr terra a boston based provider of vr ar teaching training and skills development

partnerships we are working with several of the industry leaders on expanding our existing relationships and are entering into new ones as a recent example our commitment to the development of the metaverse led us to a partnership with d id a leader in artificial intelligence ai driven creative media the jointly developed technologies and products will combine d id s highly realistic ai powered

make good progress in the quarter ended september 30 2021 with the focus subsequent to the quarter on transitioning from construction to commissioning activities pre commissioning testing has already begun for key process plant systems as the plant approaches mechanical completion no load testing of the facility with progression to water testing is expected during november the plant is expected to be commissioned by year end according to operator fresnillo subject to timely connection to the national electricity transmission grid of mexico the connection to the grid is the last step prior to feeding lower grade mineralized material through the grinding mills and mineralized material has been conveyed to the fine ore bin in preparation for processing it has been difficult for the regulators to travel to site for the final connection due to covid travel restrictions but these have now been lifted and additional electrical supply protection equipment is being installed as a priority ahead of the tie in fresnillo expects to obtain the authorization to connect to the power grid on schedule which should allow full load commissioning by year end but there is no assurance that the connection will be timely which could result in delays to commissioning and achieving commercial production the project operator fresnillo has indicated that if there is a delay to the commissioning schedule due to the timing of the tie in the amount of mineralized material that was schedule to be processed through the commissioning period will be processed at the nearby fresnillo plant generating comparable cash flow expected during commissioning a regularly updated photo gallery of construction progress at juanicipio is available at underground development to date at juanicipio is now approximately 42 km 26 miles and underground mine infrastructure is well advanced underground development priorities include continuing advance of the three internal spiral footwall production ramps designed to access the full strike length of the valdecañas vein system due to the poor rock quality on the western section of the upper valdecañas vein cut and fill will be the chosen mining method for the higher levels in this section a trial longhole stope has been in operation for the past six months and this will be the preferred mining method through the main central section and eastern side of valdecañas vein the estimated initial project capital cost on a 100 basis as estimated from january 1 2018 is 440 000 less approximately 350 738 expended since then leaving an estimated 89 262 of remaining initial capital mag s 44 estimated remaining share is 39 275 as at september 30 2021 this remaining funding requirement will be reduced by both existing cash held in minera juanicipio as at september 30 2021 34 180 on a 100 basis and expected cash flows generated from mineralized development material being processed through the fresnillo processing plant until the juanicipio plant is commissioned see underground mine production below labour reform legislation on subcontracting and outsourcing in mexico was published on april 23 2021 and came into effect on september 1 2021 with various restrictions on hiring contractors fresnillo as operator has indicated a need to internalize a portion of its contractor workforce and perform much of the development work directly rather than outsourcing it to contractors and hence invest in equipment either not previously in the project scope or not envisaged to be required until later in the mine life to be utilized in underground operations as well certain underground development expenditures related to processing development material and some small items brought forward from project investments planned in the future are considered sustaining capital by fresnillo the costs incurred are expected to reduce future sustaining capital costs and totaled approximately 16 637 on a 100 basis for the quarter ended september 30 2021 these costs are included in the current juanicipio development costs but are not considered by the operator as part of the 440 000 initial project capital subsequent to the quarter end mag signed a binding commitment letter with the bank of montreal for a fully underwritten 40 000 revolving credit facility facility the facility will be available for general corporate purposes further exploration of its properties and for further investment in minera juanicipio the facility will have a maturity date of december 31 2024 and is subject to definitive documentation and conditions to advances thereunder customary for transactions of this nature underground mine production as of august of 2020 mineralized development material is being batch processed refined and sold on commercial terms at a targeted rate of 16 000 tonnes per month at the nearby fresnillo plant the actual amount of material processed on a monthly basis fluctuates due to the variability of mineralization encountered in the development headings from month to month in the three and nine months ended september 30 2021 57 127 and 137 957 tonnes of mineralized development material respectively were processed through the fresnillo plant realizing commercial and operational de risking opportunities for the juanicipio project the average silver head grade for the mineralized development material processed in the three and nine months ended september 30 2021 was 418 g t and 410 g t respectively the sales and treatment charges for tonnes processed in q3 2021 were recorded on a provisional basis and will be adjusted in q4 2021 based on final assay and pricing adjustments in accordance with the offtake contracts the processing details and the resulting payable metals sold on a 100 basis for the 3 months ended september 30 2021 are summarized in table 1 below by bringing forward the start up of the underground mine and processing mineralized development material at the fresnillo plant in advance of commissioning the juanicipio plant mag and fresnillo expect to secure several positive outcomes for the juanicipio project generating cash flow from production to offset some of the cash requirements of the initial project capital de risking the flotation process through a better understanding of the metallurgical characteristics and response of the juanicipio

with so much competition between buyers for homes these days it s crucial that you stand out when you put in an offer on a home bidding wars are the norm now thanks to the low inventory of houses for sale along with high buyer demand andrew shader advises that if you re preparing to purchase a new home this fall you re going to need every advantage you can get here are three ways to make your best possible offer on a home you want to buy this fall understand the seller but don t sell out when you re ready to make an offer you ll need to keep your own best interests in mind but also be aware of the things that might be attractive to a seller with that being said you don t ever want to waive certain contingencies in an attempt to seal the deal home inspections for example are truly important and shouldn t be waived this is especially true for homes being sold as is because sellers will not pay for repairs if you agree to forego that inspection just because you wanted the seller to accept your offer you might be stuck in a house that requires extensive investment or repairs come up with a fair educated offer gone are the days when all a buyer needed to do to make their offer appealing to a seller was to give a number that was at or near the asking price today that s not enough this fall reports are stating that about half of all offers made on properties have been above the asking price this shows just how competitive the housing market has become between buyers with such competition prices aren t the only things that run high emotions do too it s a good idea to have a real estate agent help you craft a fair offer that has some research behind it instead of relying on instincts and emotions in order to present a truly solid offer you ll need to understand the current buyer demand recent sales trends in the area and the market value of the home you want to buy that s where a real estate agent can really help you be ready to move quickly the incredibly fast pace of sales is definitely a factor that contributes to the competitiveness of the modern housing market homes are staying on the market for much shorter periods of time before they are sold they go fast the average home is now on the market for only 17 days staying on top of the market and moving quickly is essential when homes sell this fast an agent can help you move quickly to get an offer together and give you the best shot at purchasing the home of your dreams about andrew shader andrew shader is an entrepreneur and a successful real estate developer and investor in fort lauderdale florida he got his business management and marketing degree from florida state university after spending years in the insurance industry mr shader decided to shift his focus to real estate andrew specializes in value added properties and boosting property value through investment story by jessica brown

2022 results for the three months ended september 30 2021 and provided a business update all results are reported under international financial reporting standards ifrs and in canadian dollars unless otherwise specified during the quarter field trip progressed its strategy of building a leading psychedelic therapy company field trip health and continued to invest in its drug development pipeline and program expansion field trip discovery field trip discovery ft 104 during the quarter it was announced that the lead indications for ft 104 field trip s lead novel psychedelic compound in development patent pending will be treatment resistant depression and postpartum depression ft 104 is a novel synthetic 5ht2a receptor agonist compound it is currently advancing through preclinical studies with the in vivo portion completed and final results from safety pharmacology and glp toxicology are expected in calendar q4 2021 to date glp toxicology cardiovascular pulmonary and neurological safety pharmacology studies as well as genotoxicity potential all continue to be encouraging in addition final manufacturing of clinical trial material is scheduled for production to enable ft 104 to move into phase 1 clinical trials in the first half of calendar 2022 the company has experienced and may continue to experience delays in initiating phase 1 clinical trials due to the ongoing covid pandemic and delays at its contract manufacturing organization ft 200 group introducing field trip s second novel psychedelic program the company also announced the discovery of a novel molecule that based on in vivo assay details has the structure of classical psychedelics and has demonstrated improved selectivity for the target serotonin 2a receptor 5ht2a relative to ft 104 and psilocybin versus off target serotonin 5ht1a 5ht2b and 5ht2c receptors this is meaningful because off target 5ht2b activity has been associated with increased risk of cardiovascular toxicity based on this discovery the company is expanding the scope of its development pipeline to focus on a new group of molecules termed the ft 200 group which includes the molecule mentioned above that have the structure of classical psychedelics with similar potency at the 5ht2a receptor as ft 104 and psilocybin but with reduced or the absence of activity at the off target 5ht2b receptor the aim of the work is that by reducing or eliminating 5ht2b activity it may allow molecules like those in the ft 200 group to be administered more frequently such as more chronic or chronic intermittent administration or microdosing strategies the first molecule identified in the ft 200 group demonstrates significant promise to maintain 5ht2a activity while reducing off target serotonin receptor activity we are continuing to conduct preclinical work on this molecule and will explore structural analogs within the ft 200 group to better refine and optimize this new family of substances understand their properties better and work towards identifying a lead candidate said joseph del moral field trip s co founder and ceo on october 29 2021 the company filed a provisional patent application in the

increased costs for labor transportation and items such as feed grain and packaging have also created headaches for the company inflation has clearly had an impact on the business said ceo donnie king as rates of inflation continue so will our pricing actions a shopper is seen in the aisles in a morton williams supermarket in april 2020 consumers are now seeing prices rise as inflation is being felt chicken are seen being processed at a tyson foods plant in richmond virginia tyson foods based in arkansas on monday provided a quarterly update and said meat prices were rising the consumer price index shows a rise in prices in every category from used cars laundry equipment furniture to food on monday tyson foods confirmed that their prices were rising with chicken prices up 19 per cent during its fiscal fourth quarter while beef and pork prices jumped 33 per cent and 38 per cent stewart glendinning the chief financial officer of tyson foods said that they have been slow to increase their prices in line with inflation but are now making up for the delay we expect to take continued pricing actions to ensure that any inflationary cost increases that our business incurs are passed along he said on the company s quarterly earnings call our pricing has lagged inflation but we expect to recover those cost increases during fiscal 22 the company posted strong results however with a profit of 1 15 billion an adjusted 2 30 per share on revenue of 12 81 billion the fourth quarter was stronger than expected as analysts surveyed by refintiv were expecting adjusted earnings of 2 16 per share and revenue of 12 75 billion glendinning said that tyson sees fiscal year 2022 revenue growing to between 49 billion and 51 billion up from 47 billion in 2021 stewart glendinning the chief

said that they do not foresee the inflationary challenges disappearing any time soon joe biden on monday signed his hard fought 1 trillion infrastructure deal into law before a bipartisan celebratory crowd on the white house lawn declaring that the new infusion of cash for roads bridges ports and more is going to make life change for the better for the american people the president hopes to use the infrastructure law to build back his popularity which has taken a hit amid rising inflation and the inability to fully shake the public health and economic risks from covid 19 my message to the american people is this america is moving again and your life is going to change for the better he said last week an inflation report showed the largest annual increase in prices in three decades joe biden seen on monday at the signing ceremony of the infrastructure bill at the white house has said that he believes inflation is only temporary the bureau of labor statistics said that prices in october rose 0 9 per cent from september and more than 6 per cent over the past year the largest annual rise in 30 years biden on november 10 said that he appreciated the figures were concerning and he appreciated that the price rise was being felt i m here to talk about one of the most pressing economic concerns of the american people he said and it s real and that is getting prices down number one number two making sure our stores are fully stocked and number three getting a lot of people back to work while tracking and tackling these two above challenges he said he believed the problem was temporary and that the economy would stabilize the consumer price index rose 6 2 percent in october 2021 from one year prior the highest it has been since 1990 people are not going out to dinner and lunch and going to local bars because of covid so what are they doing they re staying home and ordering online and they re buying product biden said well with more people with money buying product and less product to buy what happens the supply chain s the reason the answer is you guys i ll get to that in a minute but what happens prices go up he said that the u s was feeling the effects of a positive sentiment in the economy biden said that more products are being delivered than ever before that s because people have little more breathing room than they did last year and that s a good thing but it also means we ve got higher demand for goods at the same time we re facing disruptions in the supplies to make those goods this is a recipe for delays and for higher prices the dollar climbed to a 16 month high on monday while u s stocks dipped slightly as investors searched for a clearer economic picture persistent concerns that inflation may be rising more sharply and sticking around longer than originally expected weighed on wall street with pessimism weighing on stocks and oil and pushing safe havens like the u s dollar upwards inflation is being driven by the unusual supply shocks tied to the restart we expect these imbalances to resolve over the next year but see inflation as persistent and settling at a higher level than pre covid wrote blackrock analysts in an investor note although price rises are broad based the mix of inflation shows the unusual restart dynamics at play

take a step back from the picked over store shelves the stalled container ships and the empty auto showrooms and you ll find a root cause of the shortages of just about everything even as the pandemic has dragged on u s households flush with cash from stimulus checks booming stock markets and enlarged home equity have felt like spending freely again a lot and since consumer demand drives much of the u s and global economies high demand has brought goods shortages to the u s and much of the world add the fact that companies are ordering and hoarding more goods and parts than they need so they don t run out and you end up with an almost unquenchable demand that is magnifying the supply shortages that s where a big problem comes in suppliers were caught so flat footed by how fast pent up spending surged out of the recession that they won t likely be able to catch up as long as demand remains so robust that s especially so because americans still hunkered down at home more than they did before the pandemic continue to spend more on goods electronics furniture appliances sporting goods than on services like hotels meals out and movie tickets all that demand for goods in turn is helping to accelerate u s inflation get a weekly recap of the latest san francisco bay area housing news sign up for nbc bay area s housing deconstructed newsletter unless spending snaps sharply back to services or something else leads people to stop buying so much it could take deep into 2022 or even 2023 before global supply chains regain some semblance of normalcy demand is completely skewed said bindiya vakil ceo of resilinc a consulting firm that helps companies manage supply chains this has now become more and more painful by the day one reason people may eventually stop spending so much is that everything simply costs more now consumer prices in the u s skyrocketed 6 2 over the past year as food gasoline autos and housing catapulted inflation to its highest pace since 1990 the laws of gravity suggest that the cumulative effect of so much inflation will eventually exert a brake on spending wondering why there are shortages of food cars chips and many more essential products in 2021 here s how covid crashed the supply chain for now though manufacturers foresee no end to heavy demand and no end to beleaguered supply chains or spiking inflation pressures a chronic lack of computer chips has forced ford motor co for instance to revamp its system of ordering parts that require long periods from order to delivery to try to address shortages it s highlighted that the just in time operating model that s been prevalent in autos may not be the right operating model hau thai tang ford s chief operations and product officer told analysts smaller companies too have felt compelled to build up as many supplies as they can so they can still make products moriarty s gem art near chicago a family business for 40 years has been stocking up on gold silver and platinum to make necklaces and rings desperate not to run out of supplies as holiday orders pick up we re ordering a lot more than what we actually have orders for just in case said jeff moriarty the marketing manager even a normal post holiday shopping lull though it might help isn t expected to be enough to unclog ports speed shipping traffic or allow factories to replenish inventories the baseline expectation for improvement is around the middle of 2022 said oren klachkin lead u s economist for oxford economics but i think the risks of that happening later are fairly high though americans have increasingly ventured out in recent months the balance between spending on goods and services remains skewed the pent up demand that followed the economic recovery is still tilted toward goods like furniture and cars and less toward haircuts concerts and restaurant meals though services spending has grown in recent months it isn t nearly enough to close the gap since april 2020 consumer spending on goods has jumped 32 it s now 15 above where it was in february 2020 just before the pandemic paralyzed the economy goods account for roughly 40 of consumer spending now up from 36 before the pandemic u s factories have tried mightily to keep up with demand production rose nearly 5 over the past year according to the federal reserve despite periodic ups and downs including disruptions to auto production caused by chip shortages imports have narrowed the gap between what america s consumers want and what its factories can produce from january through september this year the u s imported 23 more than in the same period in 2020 in september thanks to surging imports the u s posted a record deficit in goods trade imports topped exports by 98 2 billion voracious demand for goods has accelerated as more people have become vaccinated in wealthier countries yet in poorer countries especially in southeast asia the spread of the delta variant forced new factory shutdowns in recent months and crimped supply chains again only recently did it start to recover at the same time many u s workers have decided to quit jobs that had required frequent public contact this created shortages of workers to unload ships transport goods or staff retail shops ports clogged up last month 65 ships waited off the california coast to be unloaded at the ports of los angeles and long beach two weeks worth of work the average wait 12 days that has since worsened to 78 ships with an average wait of nearly 17 days despite around the clock port operations beginning in october before the pandemic ships had set arrival times and went straight to a berth for unloading said gene seroka the l a port s executive director now with asian factory output at record highs the port is moving record levels of goods yet it s not enough to meet the demand america s largest port complex the twin ports of los angeles and long beach are at the center of a white house initiative to deal with the supply chain backlog that has reduced availability of goods and at the same time keeps cargo ships parked outside the harbors patrick healy reports for the nbc4 news on wednesday oct 13 2021 seroka doesn t foresee the shipments easing even next year retailers have told him they plan to use the slower months of january and february if they actually are slower to replenish inventory as with ports rail lines are moving more goods through early november freight shipped by america s railroads was up 7 5 from a year ago truck shipments were up 1 7 in september yet there aren t enough drivers or trucks to move all the freight in china too manufacturers are struggling with shipping delays container shortages and cost increases shantou limei international ltd which makes children s toys in the city of shantou expects sales to fall 30 this year because of delays and costlier shipping the most serious problem for us is being unable to deliver goods on time because of the difficulties in securing freight containers said frank xie the company s general manager a lot of things have gone beyond our controls and expectation philip richardson an american who manufactures loudspeakers in panyu near hong kong said orders have increased 400 a key reason is increased demand from americans and europeans who have gone on a home electronics buying spree the price to ship goods to u s customers on a 40 foot cargo container meantime more than tripled in july the customer has to bear it or cut back on orders richardson said song wenjie owner of hand in hand electric appliance technology co a manufacturer of home appliances in jiaxing south of shanghai said that soaring cargo prices make it unprofitable to ship some goods the combination of power outages and shipping delays might lead to a 20 fall in production this year song said among european companies grappling with snarled supply lines is shoe zone a british retailer that sources most of its footwear from china shipping container prices have jumped at least five fold in 12 months said anthony smith the chief executive this will continue to impact us for at least a further six months until the issues being experienced in the whole supply chain return to more sensible levels he said ____ wiseman reported from washington joe mcdonald and yu bing in beijing kelvin chan in london and mae anderson in new

as the global supply chain struggles to meet demand due to shortages and disruptions people shopping early for the holidays this year were hit with two billion out of stock messages in october this is three times more than in october 2019 electronics is the shopping category most affected by this followed by jewelry clothing home and garden and pet products according to business insider experts point out that days like black friday or cyber monday should now be considered last resort shopping days not the beginning of the holiday shopping season huffpost recommends getting started as soon as possible if you haven t and if you encounter shortages or delays think outside the box instead of a hot ticket item maybe give someone tickets for an experience people rarely remember what gives they get during this time they usually remember how they felt and who they spent the holidays with advertisement why all the shortages americans keep spending share copy link copy take a step back from the picked over store shelves the stalled container ships and the empty auto showrooms and you ll find a root cause of the shortages of just about everything even as the pandemic has dragged on u s households flush with cash from stimulus checks booming stock markets and enlarged home equity have felt like spending freely again a lot and since consumer demand drives much of the u s and global economies high demand has brought goods shortages to the u s and much of the world add the fact that companies are ordering and hoarding more goods and parts than they need so they don t run out and you end up with an almost unquenchable demand that is magnifying the supply shortages that s where a big problem comes in suppliers were caught so flat footed by how fast pent up spending surged out of the recession that they won t likely be able to catch up as long as demand remains so robust that s especially so because americans still hunkered down at home more than they did before the pandemic continue to spend more on goods electronics furniture appliances sporting goods than on services like hotels meals out and movie tickets all that demand for goods in turn is helping to accelerate u s inflation unless spending snaps sharply back to services or something else leads people to stop buying so much it could take deep into 2022 or even 2023 before global supply chains regain some semblance of normalcy demand is completely skewed said bindiya vakil ceo of resilinc a consulting firm that helps companies manage supply chains this has now become more and more painful by the day one reason people may eventually stop spending so much is that everything simply costs more now consumer prices in the u s skyrocketed 6 2 over the past year as food gasoline autos and housing catapulted inflation to its highest pace since 1990 the laws of gravity suggest that the cumulative effect of so much inflation will eventually exert a brake on spending for now though manufacturers foresee no end to heavy demand and no end to beleaguered supply chains or spiking inflation pressures a chronic lack of computer chips has forced ford motor co for instance to revamp its system of ordering parts that require long periods from order to delivery to try to address shortages it s highlighted that the just in time operating model that s been prevalent in autos may not be the right operating model hau thai tang ford s chief operations and product officer told analysts smaller companies too have felt compelled to build up as many supplies as they can so they can still make products moriarty s gem art near chicago a family business for 40 years has been stocking up on gold silver and platinum to make necklaces and rings desperate not to run out of supplies as holiday orders pick up we re ordering a lot more than what we actually have orders for just in case said jeff moriarty the marketing manager even a normal post holiday shopping lull though it might help isn t expected to be enough to unclog ports speed shipping traffic or allow factories to replenish inventories the baseline expectation for improvement is around the middle of 2022 said oren klachkin lead u s economist for oxford economics but i think the risks of that happening later are fairly high though americans have increasingly ventured out in recent months the balance between spending on goods and services remains skewed the pent up demand that followed the economic recovery is still tilted toward goods like furniture and cars and less toward haircuts concerts and restaurant meals though services spending has grown in recent months it isn t nearly enough to close the gap since april 2020 consumer spending on goods has jumped 32 it s now 15 above where it was in february 2020 just before the pandemic paralyzed the economy goods account for roughly 40 of consumer spending now up from 36 before the pandemic u s factories have tried mightily to keep up with demand production rose nearly 5 over the past year according to the federal reserve despite periodic ups and downs including disruptions to auto production caused by chip shortages imports have narrowed the gap between what america s consumers want and what its factories can produce from january through september this year the u s imported 23 more than in the same period in 2020 in september thanks to surging imports the u s posted a record deficit in goods trade imports topped exports by 98 2 billion voracious demand for goods has accelerated as more people have become vaccinated in wealthier countries yet in poorer countries especially in southeast asia the spread of the delta variant forced new factory shutdowns in recent months and crimped supply chains again only recently did it start to recover at the same time many u s workers have decided to quit jobs that had required frequent public contact this created shortages of workers to unload ships transport goods or staff retail shops ports clogged up last month 65 ships waited off the california coast to be unloaded at the ports of los angeles and long beach two weeks worth of work the average wait 12 days that has since worsened to 78 ships with an average wait of nearly 17 days despite around the clock port operations beginning in october before the pandemic ships had set arrival times and went straight to a berth for unloading said gene seroka the l a port s executive director now with asian factory output at record highs the port is moving record levels of goods yet it s not enough to meet the demand seroka doesn t foresee the shipments easing even next year retailers have told him they plan to use the slower months of january and february if they actually are slower to replenish inventory as with ports rail lines are moving more goods through early november freight shipped by america s railroads was up 7 5 from a year ago truck shipments were up 1 7 in september yet there aren t enough drivers or trucks to move all the freight in china too manufacturers are struggling with shipping delays container shortages and cost increases shantou limei international ltd which makes children s toys in

of 2021 compared to an operating loss of 10 246 000 in the third quarter of 2020 the 75 decrease in net loss was largely a result of 8 2 million in ipr d expense recorded in 2020 related to the

by jonathan stempel new york reuters jpmorgan chase co has sued tesla inc for 162 2 million accusing elon musk s electric car company of flagrantly breaching a contract the two corporate giants agreed in 2014 relating to warrants tesla sold to the bank warrants give the holder the right to buy a company s stock at a set strike price and date the suit filed in a manhattan federal court centers on a dispute over how jpmorgan re priced its tesla warrants as a result of musk s notorious 2018 tweet that he was considering taking the carmaker private it is unusual for a major wall street bank to sue such a high profile client although jpmorgan has done relatively little business with the electric carmaker over the past seven years according to tesla s filings and refinitiv data we have provided tesla multiple opportunities to fulfill its contractual obligations so it is unfortunate that they have forced this issue into litigation a spokesperson for jpmorgan said in a statement tesla did not respond to requests for comment according to the complaint tesla in 2014 sold warrants to jpmorgan that would pay off if their strike price was below tesla s share price when the warrants expired in june and july 2021 jpmorgan said the warrants contained standard provisions that allowed it to adjust their price to protect both parties against the economic effects of significant corporate transactions involving tesla such as an announcement the company was going private musk s aug 7 2018 tweet that he might take tesla private at 420 per share and had funding secured and his subsequent announcement 17 days later that he was abandoning the plan created significant volatility in the share price the bank said on both occasions jpmorgan adjusted the strike price to maintain the same fair market value as prior to the tweets tesla s share price rose approximately 10 fold by the time the warrants expired this year and jpmorgan said this required tesla under its contract to hand over shares of its stock or cash the bank said tesla s failure to do that amounted to a default though jpmorgan s adjustments were appropriate and contractually required the complaint said tesla has flagrantly ignored its clear contractual obligation to pay jpmorgan in full the bank said tesla in february 2019 complained that the bank s adjustments were an opportunistic attempt to take advantage of changes in volatility in tesla s stock but did not challenge the underlying calculations jpmorgan said musk s tweets resulted in the u s securities and exchange commission bringing civil charges and 20 million fines against both him and tesla reporting by jonathan stempel in new york additional reporting by anirban sen david henry and matt scuffham editing by chris reese cynthia osterman michelle price and marguerita choy

as the global supply chain struggles to meet demand due to shortages and disruptions people shopping early for the holidays this year were hit with two billion out of stock messages in october this is three times more than in october 2019 electronics is the shopping category most affected by this followed by jewelry clothing home and garden and pet products according to business insider experts point out that days like black friday or cyber monday should now be considered last resort shopping days not the beginning of the holiday shopping season huffpost recommends getting started as soon as possible if you haven t and if you encounter shortages or delays think outside the box instead of a hot ticket item maybe give someone tickets for an experience people rarely remember what gives they get during this time they usually remember how they felt and who they spent the holidays with advertisement why all the shortages americans keep spending share copy link copy take a step back from the picked over store shelves the stalled container ships and the empty auto showrooms and you ll find a root cause of the shortages of just about everything even as the pandemic has dragged on u s households flush with cash from stimulus checks booming stock markets and enlarged home equity have felt like spending freely again a lot and since consumer demand drives much of the u s and global economies high demand has brought goods shortages to the u s and much of the world add the fact that companies are ordering and hoarding more goods and parts than they need so they don t run out and you end up with an almost unquenchable demand that is magnifying the supply shortages that s where a big problem comes in suppliers were caught so flat footed by how fast pent up spending surged out of the recession that they won t likely be able to catch up as long as demand remains so robust that s especially so because americans still hunkered down at home more than they did before the pandemic continue to spend more on goods electronics furniture appliances sporting goods than on services like hotels meals out and movie tickets all that demand for goods in turn is helping to accelerate u s inflation unless spending snaps sharply back to services or something else leads people to stop buying so much it could take deep into 2022 or even 2023 before global supply chains regain some semblance of normalcy demand is completely skewed said bindiya vakil ceo of resilinc a consulting firm that helps companies manage supply chains this has now become more and more painful by the day one reason people may eventually stop spending so much is that everything simply costs more now consumer prices in the u s skyrocketed 6 2 over the past year as food gasoline autos and housing catapulted inflation to its highest pace since 1990 the laws of gravity suggest that the cumulative effect of so much inflation will eventually exert a brake on spending for now though manufacturers foresee no end to heavy demand and no end to beleaguered supply chains or spiking inflation pressures a chronic lack of computer chips has forced ford motor co for instance to revamp its system of ordering parts that require long periods from order to delivery to try to address shortages it s highlighted that the just in time operating model that s been prevalent in autos may not be the right operating model hau thai tang ford s chief operations and product officer told analysts smaller companies too have felt compelled to build up as many supplies as they can so they can still make products moriarty s gem art near chicago a family business for 40 years has been stocking up on gold silver and platinum to make necklaces and rings desperate not to run out of supplies as holiday orders pick up we re ordering a lot more than what we actually have orders for just in case said jeff moriarty the marketing manager even a normal post holiday shopping lull though it might help isn t expected to be enough to unclog ports speed shipping traffic or allow factories to replenish inventories the baseline expectation for improvement is around the middle of 2022 said oren klachkin lead u s economist for oxford economics but i think the risks of that happening later are fairly high though americans have increasingly ventured out in recent months the balance between spending on goods and services remains skewed the pent up demand that followed the economic recovery is still tilted toward goods like furniture and cars and less toward haircuts concerts and restaurant meals though services spending has grown in recent months it isn t nearly enough to close the gap since april 2020 consumer spending on goods has jumped 32 it s now 15 above where it was in february 2020 just before the pandemic paralyzed the economy goods account for roughly 40 of consumer spending now up from 36 before the pandemic u s factories have tried mightily to keep up with demand production rose nearly 5 over the past year according to the federal reserve despite periodic ups and downs including disruptions to auto production caused by chip shortages imports have narrowed the gap between what america s consumers want and what its factories can produce from january through september this year the u s imported 23 more than in the same period in 2020 in september thanks to surging imports the u s posted a record deficit in goods trade imports topped exports by 98 2 billion voracious demand for goods has accelerated as more people have become vaccinated in wealthier countries yet in poorer countries especially in southeast asia the spread of the delta variant forced new factory shutdowns in recent months and crimped supply chains again only recently did it start to recover at the same time many u s workers have decided to quit jobs that had required frequent public contact this created shortages of workers to unload ships transport goods or staff retail shops ports clogged up last month 65 ships waited off the california coast to be unloaded at the ports of los angeles and long beach two weeks worth of work the average wait 12 days that has since worsened to 78 ships with an average wait of nearly 17 days despite around the clock port operations beginning in october before the pandemic ships had set arrival times and went straight to a berth for unloading said gene seroka the l a port s executive director now with asian factory output at record highs the port is moving record levels of goods yet it s not enough to meet the demand seroka doesn t foresee the shipments easing even next year retailers have told him they plan to use the slower months of january and february if they actually are slower to replenish inventory as with ports rail lines are moving more goods through early november freight shipped by america s railroads was up 7 5 from a year ago truck shipments were up 1 7 in september yet there aren t enough drivers or trucks to move all the freight in china too manufacturers are struggling with shipping delays container shortages and cost increases shantou limei international ltd which makes children s toys in the city of shantou expects sales to fall 30 this year because of delays and costlier shipping the most serious problem for us is being unable to deliver goods on time because of the difficulties in securing freight containers said frank xie the company s general manager a lot of things have gone beyond our controls and expectation philip richardson an american who manufactures loudspeakers in panyu near hong kong said orders have increased 400 a key reason is increased demand from americans and europeans who have gone on a home electronics buying spree the price to ship goods to u s customers on a 40 foot cargo container meantime more than tripled in july the customer has to bear it or cut back on orders richardson said song wenjie the owner of hand in hand electric appliance technology co a manufacturer of home appliances in jiaxing south of shanghai said that soaring cargo prices make it unprofitable to ship some goods the combination of power outages and shipping delays might lead to a 20 fall in production this year song said among european companies grappling with snarled supply lines is shoe zone a british retailer that sources most of its footwear from china shipping container prices have jumped at least five fold in 12 months said anthony smith the chief executive this will continue to impact us for at least a further six months until the issues being experienced in the whole supply chain return to more sensible levels he said ____wiseman reported from washington joe mcdonald and yu bing in beijing kelvin chan in london and mae anderson in new york

a version of this story appeared in cnn s what matters newsletter to get it in your inbox sign up for free here cnn if joe biden built a road in a quiet forest would anyone know about it that s the philosophical problem for a president who should be having one of the best days of his presidency but is instead struggling to convince americans he s accomplished anything biden delivered on a promise to get a massive infrastructure bill passed into law one that had evaded previous presidents he did it against all expectations in a bipartisan way the signing ceremony attended by members of both parties monday at the white house should have been a victory lap instead there are foreboding headlines for biden and the democrats new polls suggest americans don t understand his accomplishment and blame him for the state of the economy they re worried about his approval rating never extremely strong for a new president is not too far from donald trump territory palace intrigue cnn s edward isaac dovere and jasmine wright reported this weekend about mutual frustration between the white house and the office of vice president kamala harris i ll just share the first paragraph of the story which is backed up with exhaustive reporting worn out by what they see as entrenched dysfunction and lack of focus key west wing aides have largely thrown up their hands at vice president kamala harris and her staff deciding there simply isn t time to deal with them right now especially at a moment when president joe biden faces quickly multiplying legislative and political concerns these are not the types of stories that trickle out when things are going according to plan white house press secretary jen psaki jumped to harris defense via twitter on sunday night for anyone who needs to hear it vp is not only a vital partner to potus but a bold leader who has taken on key important challenges facing the country from voting rights to addressing root causes of migration to expanding broadband tweeted psaki americans don t get it yet the washington post headline for a new post abc news poll was grim biden approval hits new low as economic discontent rises i asked cnn s director of polling and election research jennifer agiesta how we should be viewing these polls what kind of a drop is this there certainly hasn t been much good news for biden in any of the recent polling his numbers are not in great shape but the way that polls are sometimes reported may make it sound a little worse than it actually is said agiesta while biden has reached new lows recently in several polls the previous comparison points for some of those polls were a while ago so while his numbers have certainly dropped since the summer and around labor day it is unclear if they are currently still declining or if they have plateaued not only do americans question biden s accomplishments there is also concern about his priorities agiesta pointed to a cnn poll conducted by ssrs in early november when 58 said the president has not paid enough attention to the most important problems bottom line biden s approval rating numbers are consistently landing at low points across several major polls but it is unclear if they are currently still declining or if they have plateaued said agiesta and it s impossible to know if his approval has hit its floor it s the economy as usual the problems for biden in the poll are centered on perception and the economy inflation is expected to persist for months so long as americans are preoccupied with the economy it could be extremely difficult for biden to convince them his spending package is helping them according to the post abc poll seventy percent of americans have a negative view of the economy nearly half the country 48 blames biden for inflation more than 6 in 10 americans including 71 of independents say he hasn t accomplished much how does biden s approval compare biden doesn t have the lowest approval rating of any recent president at this point in his first term that dubious honor goes to trump according to gallup but biden 42 approval in october is not far above trump 37 approval at this point in his presidency why infrastructure is a hard sell if you ve read the text of the infrastructure legislation and wondered why there aren t more specifics about what exactly it will do that s because the package by design didn t include specific projects states perhaps dusting off much needed projects for which they had no funding will apply for their cut of the 550 billion in new spending cnn s katie lobosco looks at four potential infrastructure efforts brent spence bridge it s a vital midwest artery but is clogged the legislation could place a second bridge alongside the first and get traffic and trucks moving more quickly over the ohio river between cincinnati and kentucky expanding atlanta public transit dedicated bus lines outside atlanta have been studied and endorsed the new law could free up the 1 billion needed to make them a reality improving chicago s rail hub a quarter of the nation s freight rail traffic moves through chicago but the hub s lines have been described as a spaghetti bowl federal money could help untangle things upgrading the port of baltimore officials want to raise their hands for some of the 17 billion the law earmarks for ports one project they envision will upgrade electric supply feeders and facilitate new electric vehicles including container cranes senate minority leader mitch mcconnell the top elected republican in the country was not at the white house signing ceremony but he has bragged about the funding back in his home state of kentucky where he said it was a godsend it will also be hard for democrats to focus on selling this infrastructure package since they re still arguing over an even larger social spending bill that would have an immediate effect on americans lives by ensuring schooling for us kids starting at the age of 3 rather than 5 if democrats can get that over the finish line they ll have even more to brag about but they ll still need to pierce the frustration voters feel at inflation how taxpayer dollars helped tesla here s one example of where tax dollars go as they trickle out into the economy cnn s chris isidore points out that tesla one of the most valuable companies in the world has benefited from billions in tax incentives it could get billions more if the social spending bill passes into law and the government starts issuing electric vehicle buyers new 7 500 per vehicle tax credits a worthwhile trade if you value having electric vehicles over gas burning vehicles and anyone who is worried about climate change should tax incentives to companies like tesla are probably worthwhile however it is extremely frustrating to see elon musk troll vermont sen bernie sanders on twitter over taxes since musk has received taxpayer help want me to sell more stock bernie just say the word musk tweeted sunday as part of his troll here are isidore s calculations and please read his story to understand more about each of these items tesla has received 5 billion to date from the sales of emissions credits spacex has received 10 billion to date in nasa contracts tesla was able to charge 1 7 billion in higher car prices thanks to tax credits for car buyers add to that low interest loans from the department of energy which tesla now worth more than 1 trillion thanks to investors faith rather than sales has since paid back what to watch being chris christie both political parties are having messaging problems for democrats it s how to sell biden s agenda for republicans it s how to deal with the legacy of trump cnn s dana bash has a new interview show and monday night s episode which airs at 10 p m et features chris christie the former new jersey governor and trump ally who is now critical of the former president s role instigating the capitol insurrection christie is also telling the story of his nearly fatal case of covid 19
new york november 12 ani the un food and agriculture organization fao has said the global food trade should hit an all time record high in both volume and value terms a new report released on thursday said that the global food import bill should extend beyond usd 1 75 trillion by the end of 2021 this will be a 14 per cent increase from the previous year and 12 per cent higher than the previous forecast un news reported according to fao s new food outlook trade in foodstuffs has shown remarkable resilience to disruptions throughout the pandemic but rapidly rising prices pose significant challenges for poorer countries and consumers the increase is driven by higher price levels of internationally traded food commodities and a threefold increase in freight costs according to the report developing regions account for 40 per cent of the total and their food import bill is expected to rise by 20 per cent compared to the year before even faster growth is expected for low income food deficit countries lifdcs in terms of products developing regions are facing sharp increases in basic staples such as cereals animal fats vegetable oils and oilseeds meanwhile in developed regions high value foods such as fruits and vegetables fishery products and beverages are driving the bulk of the increases the report said that prospects for major cereals remain robust with record harvests expected for maize and rice cereals for consumption and animal feed should grow even faster the outlook expects some improvements in the supply situation for oilseeds and derived products but their end season stocks could remain below average world sugar production should rebound after three years of contraction but still be under the global consumption level the report said according to the report meat production should expand triggered by a swift rebound in china especially pig meat a growth slowdown in trade is likely caused by declines in leading importing regions mostly asia and europe it added meanwhile milk production is forecasted to grow with anticipated increases in all major producing regions led by asia and north america ani

hong kong november 15 ani the chinese communist party ccp held its sixth plenum from 8 11 november and chairman xi jinping used this choreographed political theater to further cement his status in the pantheon of chinese communist leaders there are no indications that he wishes to relinquish a single joule of power over the nation but there are occasional signs that this authoritarian leader does face opposition one of the main tasks of this sixth plenum of the 19th ccp central committee was to pass the resolution on the major achievements and historical experience of the party over the past century this is just the third historical resolution in ccp history the preceding two tabled in 1945 and 1981 under mao zedong and deng xiaoping respectively this essentially placed xi among the big three allied to the resolution was whether xi will remain in power indefinitely certainly the communique made no mention of xi being leader for life but the central committee s approval certainly permits xi to remain in office for one if not two or more additional terms lasting five years each support from the committee gives xi an indefinite extension on the reins of power which will surely result in hawkish and insular policies it does not bode well for relations with the usa or with anyone else who does not bow the knee to beijing for that matter the plenum comprised 197 full central committee members and 151 alternates this year was especially significant as it marked the centennial anniversary of the ccp s founding that 100 year history was divided into three historical periods mao zedong laying the socialist foundations from 1949 76 deng xiaoping ushered in an era of reform and opening up while xi introduced xi jinping thought on socialism with chinese characteristics for a new era to pave the way for the great renaissance of the chinese nation according to a china neican newsletter the resolution had three aims first to provide an overarching narrative about the past and a deterministic trajectory for china s future china has gone from weak to strong and under the leadership of xi will finally achieve its rightful place in the sun and in doing so end chinese history second to cement xi s role in the ccp and enable him to retain his paramount position in next year s party congress and third to spell out a vision for the future including common prosperity at home and strength on the international stage in fact more than half the communique about this resolution is devoted to praising xi thus the party has established comrade xi jinping s core position on the party central committee and in the party as a whole this kind of sycophancy by the central committee is frightening essentially xi has been elevated to a position of absolute dominance over china xi may well be enshrouded in a cocoon that ignores conflicting facts and could easily lead to miscalculations and conflict as willy wo lap lam a senior fellow at the jamestown foundation in the usa noted the sixth plenum has apparently achieved what it set out to do which is establishing xi s role as the sole guiding force for the party the government and the army in the 21st century xi s list of glowing achievements included his anti graft campaign the abolition of extreme poverty the attainment of a moderately prosperous society development of deng s open door policy the modernization of china s system and capacity for governance and improvements in china s global status such accomplishments are debatable has xi really improved governance systems and institutions or has he simply personally assumed all authority xi is at the top of the pile and makes all decisions xi has already been nicknamed the chairman of everything for he has a finger in every pie some impetuous decisions involving little or no consultation with others are already visible including preventing jack ma from listing ant corporation on the hong kong stock exchange late last year and in july forcing all private tutorial schools to become non profit organizations instead of consistently promoting broader and deeper reform across the board as claimed in the resolution xi has cracked down on quasi private conglomerates such as alibaba tencent bytedance and several real estate corporations he repeatedly calls for top level design for the economy and forces foreign companies to share intellectual property with local subsidiaries furthermore xi s injection of state funds in infrastructure and real estate projects has accumulated unprecedented debt for the government local enterprises and citizens state controlled media incessantly laud xi as compassionate just wise and an internationalist his aura is godlike capable of no wrong with media and propaganda force feeding the populace this staple diet tight control of information and a vast secret police system prevents any counter narrative historical nihilism i e publicly challenging any aspect of the ccp s version of history is a criminal offence and in february the supreme court made perceived insults against heroes and martyrs prosecutable many do not give a hoot about history but in chinese politics controlling the historical narrative is critical for it grants the power to decide and dominate the future xi is rewriting history in his favor believing that china and he are indispensable to the world regarding xi s indefinite leadership lam assessed backed by the resolution it is very probable that xi will serve for ten more years as ccp general secretary chairman of the central military commission cmc and state president until the 22nd party congress in 2032 when he will be 79 years old after the 22nd party congress xi might emulate deng by remaining cmc chairman the post with the most power in china while relinquishing the titles of party general secretary and or state president this scenario however willupend the party convention of orderly generational succession as stipulated by deng party colleagues born in the 1960s the so called sixth generation will have minimal chance to succeed xi because in 2032 those born before 1964 will have reached the retirement age of 68 and few would be young enough to serve two five year terms on the politburo standing committee lam considered that a seventh generation cadre had the highest chance of succeeding xi are there any possible candidates there lam offered at present only a few dozen odd seventh generation officials who were born in the 1970s have attained vice minister rank due to their relatively junior positions none of those neophyte rising stars have yet demonstrated that they have what it takes to reach the politburo or higher leading seventh generation cadres include the secretary generals of the shanghai jiangxi and shandong provincial or municipal party committees respectively zhuge yujie aged 50 wu hao 49 and liu qiang 50 as well as the head of the jiangsu and yunnan provincial political and legal affairs committees respectively fei gaoyun 50 and liu hongjian 48 notably the resolution made no reference to deng s dictum of taking a low profile and never taking the lead in world affairs xi has traveled far beyond that though china is becoming increasingly isolated globally because of its bullying and impenitent treatment of others china s use of wealth to boost relationships with client states in the developing world makes a mockery of xi s slogan of human community with a shared future it must be noted that there is opposition to xi within the ccp despite his omnipotent position this is perhaps reflected in the inclusion of a paragraph in the resolution that discussed the policies of former leaders jiang zemin and hu jintao who are rivals of xi many of jiang s and hu s adherents now hold offices at the ministerial level or above so this inclusion was a concession to them lam concluded xi has continued to use the anti corruption campaign as a weapon to eradicate real and potential enemies particularly in the sensitive political legal apparatus this lack of party unity below the surface indicates that despite the hagiographic language used to lionize xi s exploits in the resolution the future of his leadership may well depend on whether he can solve the multi faceted problems that bedevil china professor anne marie brady a political scientist at canterbury university in new zealand commented incredible to see xi elevating himself on par with mao deng and elevating xi jinping thought on a par with mao zedong thought in domestic and foreign policy the prc has gone backwards since 2012 xi s primary achievement increasing repression such repression is clearly seen in hong kong where draconian national security laws have snuffed out all political and popular expressions of discontent many have or are seeking to leave the territory rather than live under a suffocating climate of fear and suppression for example the hong kong police set up a hotline so citizens can report acts of resistance so far the hotline has received 200 000 tipoffs averaging 550 per day people are now afraid to express political opinions for fear of being dobbed in to a biased legal system where the government selects judges and is all but assured of convictions the plummeting political and social environment in hong kong shows the true nature of the ccp seeking to control society and the way people think no opposition is brooked in xi s horrifying vision for china hong kong taiwan and the rest of the world xi has been majoring on common prosperity since midyear its tenets summed up in xi s article entitled to firmly drive common prosperity published on 15 october he wrote for example our country must resolutely guard against polarization drive common prosperity and maintain social harmony and stability if we want to achieve common prosperity for 1 4 billion people we must have a firm footing on solid foundations and make unremitting efforts yet xi s retrogression to maoism has sparked divergent views this has become apparent with giant private companies being forced to share their wealth with the less privileged celebrities and star actors actresses have been among the targets too protests erupted in various cities over the looming bankruptcy of the evergrande group real estate company after running up debts of nearly usd300 billion there are fears of a domino effect if this too big to fail company is allowed to crash and destroy the savings of many investors the anger of chinese citizens would become palpable with social unrest rising xi claims to have destroyed absolute poverty but the middle and lower classes continue to see awidening wealth gap between themselves and the elite illustrating his paranoia xi has simultaneously been enacting a purge of china s political legal apparatus that encompasses the police secret police procuratorates and courts he wishes to nail disloyal people who might be taking illegal and improper actions against his leadership indeed xi relies on the military police and legal apparatus to maintain strict control in an ongoing purge of the political legal system a rectification drive netted 178 431 personnel for investigation and or punishment from february july 2021 alone this included 1 258 heads of departments including deputy ministers of public security meng qingfeng meng hongwei and sun lijun the authorities also revealed in september that they had discovered a conspiratorial clique centered on several senior police officers mostly from jiangsu province such admissions are rare but show that not all are enamored with xi s brand of iron fisted rule in xi s view china is rising while the west is in decline amidst a turbulent changing of the guard he believes time and momentum is on his side but taiwan remains a crucial flashpoint in coming years china and the usa have vastly differing visions for taiwan and certainly the majority of taiwanese do not wish to fall under the harsh heel of the ccp china continues to send bellicose signals towards taiwan including relentless military actions furthermore with fewer official contacts between china and the usa something that a virtual summit between joe biden and xi on 15 november will do little to alleviate the chances of miscalculation grow ani

cap lab business unit the company anticipates a significant revenue increase in revenue at provista beginning in the fourth quarter of 2021 and progressively throughout 2022 loss from operations the company recorded an operating loss of 2 497 000 in the third quarter of 2021 compared to an operating loss of 10 246 000 in the third quarter of 2020 the 75 decrease in net loss was largely a result

at provista diagnostics in preparation for an expected surge in covid cases in the fourth quarter of 2021 we expect a surge similar to the one seen in the fourth quarter of 2020 as temperatures cool in the united states and people head indoors to congregate over the holiday seasons in november and december said daniel hirsch cfo of todos medical with the automation at provista complete we expect to capture a greater percentage of our future business from our own testing lab rather than through distribution we expect this to result in increases in revenue and gross margins overall and on a per test basis we are pleased with the progress we have made to have tollovid and tollovid daily approved for sale on the amazon and alibaba platforms we expect that availability through these marquee distribution outlets will help build sales momentum heading into the winter months as people seek to add protease inhibition as a part of supporting a healthy immune system in addition the pending interim data readout in the ongoing tollovir clinical trial in hospitalized covid 19 patients has the potential to substantially increase the value of this important asset heading into the end of the

developing blood tests for the early detection of neurodegenerative disorders such as alzheimer s disease the lymphocyte proliferation test lympro test is a diagnostic blood test that determines the ability of peripheral blood lymphocytes pbls and monocytes to withstand an exogenous mitogenic stimulation that induces them to enter the cell cycle it is believed that certain diseases most notably alzheimer s disease are the result of compromised cellular machinery that leads to aberrant cell cycle re entry by neurons which then leads to apoptosis lympro is unique in the use of peripheral blood lymphocytes as a surrogate for neuronal cell function suggesting a common relationship between pbls and neurons in the brain todos is also distributing certain covid 19 testing materials and supplies
