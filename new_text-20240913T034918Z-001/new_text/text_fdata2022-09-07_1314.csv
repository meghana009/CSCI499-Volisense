make sure that the united states is never again in a position where our national security interests are compromised or key industries are immobilized due to our inability to produce essential semiconductors here at home this past year we saw the impact of the chip shortage on american families when car prices drove a third of inflation because of lack of chips factory workers were furloughed household appliances were often unavailable all because of a lack of semiconductors and as our economy and military become more reliant on technology it s that much more essential that we develop a strategy with values outcomes and structures that enable us to plan for an economy and manufacturing infrastructure that positions us to compete today and into the future so i want to take the next few minutes to lay out for you where we are and how the department of commerce plans to implement the 50 billion in chips funding that we will be overseeing so with the chips funding we re setting out to achieve four primary objectives first to establish and expand domestic production of leading edge semiconductors in the united states today the united states consumes more than 25 percent of the world s leading edge chips and produces zero of those chips number two we want to build a sufficient and stable supply of mature node semiconductors we consume 30 percent produce 13 percent we need to fix that number three invest in research and development to ensure the next generation of semiconductor technology is developed and produced right here in the united states and number four in the process of doing all this we will create tens of thousands of good paying manufacturing jobs and more than a hundred thousand construction jobs this effort will ensure the pipeline for these jobs expands to include people who have historically not had a chance to participate in this industry including women people of color veterans and people who live in rural areas and that is explicitly required in statute and we will carry out congress s intent to achieve these goals chips for america will support three distinct initiatives two of those initiatives which total 39 billion will make investments in domestic chip manufacturing here in the united states first we will make large scale investments in leading edge manufacturing chips for america will target approximately 28 billion in manufacturing incentives to establish domestic production of leading edge logic and memory chips that require the most sophisticated processes available today second we will invest about 10 billion in new manufacturing capacity for mature or current generation semiconductors this will help us increase domestic production across a range of chips including the chips that are used in cars medical devices communication technology and third and finally we re going to make historic investments to strengthen america s research and innovation leadership eleven billion dollars and this is this is not as talked about we always focus on the incentives for the companies but in many ways this could be the most exciting piece of what we re doing eleven billion dollars will go to research and development programs including the creation of a national semiconductor technology center in terms of timeline we expect to be in a position to receive application from companies no later than february of 2023 so we re targeting february of 2023 to put the notice of funding opportunity on the street so companies can begin to apply our priority is funding applications for incentive programs it will be put out on a rolling basis and we will evaluate each application one at a time before i close i want to take a second or minute to send a very clear message about how we plan to protect taxpayer dollars in this program this is not a blank check for companies this is not for them to pad their bottom line there are clear guardrails on this money and the department of commerce intends to be vigilant and aggressive in protecting taxpayers chips funds cannot be used for stock buybacks chips funds are not intended to replace private capital that is key we re going to look after every nickel of taxpayer money taxpayer funds are only used to fill gaps and secure other funding as loan guarantees not to replace private capital these funds are intended to help companies maximize the scale of their projects we re going to be pushing companies to go bigger and be bolder so if a company already has funding now for a 10 billion project we want them to think bigger and convince us how they can go from 10 billion to 50 billion with use of the taxpayer financing we commerce department has the ability to claw back money and make no mistake about it we will use that clawback authority if after giving the money to a company they fail to start their project on time fail to complete their project on time fail to meet the commitments that they ve made we re also going to be implementing the guardrails to ensure those who receive chips funds cannot compromise national security by they re not allowed to use this money to invest in china they can t develop leading edge technologies in china they can t send latest technology overseas these are some of the most stringent taxpayer protections and guardrails we ve ever had and the american people are counting on us to get it right and it s a responsibility that we take very seriously i ll just end by saying by thanking the president and by thanking congress for their leadership no one has done more to revitalize american manufacturing than president biden and chips for america is a key component of that work with this we re going to jumpstart high tech manufacturing and drive economic growth we re going to create the kinds of jobs that will create opportunity for americans high wage jobs that we want our children to have we re going to revitalize an innovation ecosystem that for decades has been withering and will add rocket fuel to our global competitiveness ensuring that america maintains its status as a leader for generation to come first and foremost this is about protecting our national security and providing a blueprint for long term economic prosperity and so we re excited people say to me secretary chips passed what do you do now now we get to work and we re excited to begin that work ms jean pierre all right we re just going to take a couple questions we have to get out of here by a certain time today as you all know go ahead phil q thanks karine thanks madam secretary on your point about taxpayer protections there seems to be kind of a natural tension here in the sense that a huge sum of money very clear urgency on the government side finite universe of private sector entities who can probably take advantage of this walk me through how this actually works in terms of ensuring that those companies don t have leverage given how much the federal government wants to kick this into high gear secretary raimondo yeah great question so today we put out our strategy document which i m sure you ve all read every word of so we put out the strategy document today which sets forth our principles and criteria at a high level and now we begin the work of putting forth between now and february more granular criteria and strings attached so what we know is companies who receive chips fundings can t use those fundings funds to invest in other countries can t use them for stock buybacks companies who receive chip funds can t build leading edge or advanced technology facilities in china for a period of 10 years companies who receive the money can only expand their mature node factories in china to serve the chinese market so there this is what we know what i can tell you is we re also right now recruiting a team at the commerce department of experts we re going to have folks who have a history of hard nosed negotiation from the private sector people who are semiconductor industry experts and we re going to negotiate these deals one at a time and really putting the screws to these companies to prove to us we re going to need proof from them to us in the form of financial disclosures in capital investment plans prove to us the money is absolutely necessary to make these investments they re not going to get any more than necessary to make these investments and as i said in the beginning this isn t money to make them more profitable or pad their bottom line it s the money to make these investments and also invest in the community ms jean pierre go ahead jordan q thanks on a different topic cfius is reviewing the situation with tiktok when do you expect that will resolve itself that review and will the administration after that review take any action to ban tiktok or short of that how would the administration expect to address security concerns presented by the app by the government of china secretary raimondo yeah so as you say it s under review and i have nothing more on that today q on what on another thing that has been a ball in the air china tariffs i know ustr made an announcement about that last week but that wouldn t necessarily preclude the administration from lifting tariffs on some goods where does that stand right now secretary raimondo also i have nothing on that ms jean pierre go ahead alex oh i m sorry laughs q i was actually going to ask those very same questions ms jean pierre okay q if you don t mind if you don t mind though on the tariff question you know it s been in the public domain for quite some time is it fair to assume that s not going to happen before the midterms secretary raimondo i don t have anything else to say ms jean pierre on topic q yes ms jean pierre okay if it s on topic go ahead laughs q it s really on topic you talk about this about this stringent review and the information is going to be posted by february bottom line for us how quickly is an american going to get hired with this money and how quickly before somebody is buying a phone with one of these american made chips in it secretary raimondo yeah so great question you q and then i have a follow up to that secretary raimondo you ve already seen chip companies making big announcements micron is announcing a huge new facility i was just in new hampshire onsemi is breaking ground on a new facility intel announced a new facility these investments have been made by these companies because the chips act passed and they have confidence now that the money will be put out the door so you re going to i can t answer you you know how quickly exactly a specific chip is going to come but the point is you re already seeing it globalwafers made an announcement 5 billion investment in texas so i d say immediately the effects are immediately being felt in terms of our process february like you said we ll begin the process i think you can start i m going to hope to start putting money out the door you know next spring to specific companies here s the thing there s going to be a range of projects there ll be smaller simpler projects maybe for expansion of existing facilities and then there ll be very large complex leading edge projects i think you could see in the spring of next year some of the smaller money going out the door q and do you listed a very stringent list of criteria it can t be invested into stock buybacks can t be for chips that get made or sold in china unless they re for the chinese market a bunch of other things do you know that companies exist right now that are willing to meet those stringent demands do you check that before you publish them secretary raimondo yes q so they re ready to go secretary raimondo yes q with what s there secretary raimondo yes q and do you at the commerce department then have the money necessary to hire those top notch negotiators the specialists secretary raimondo yes q or do you need more from congress because often secretary raimondo yes q what ends up happening we get a big government announcement multibillion dollars here it comes from the federal government and three years later we re writing stories telling stories about how that money was mismanaged and the department that was overseeing it didn t have enough you re saying you do secretary raimondo yes i do what we re doing right now is we re in the process of hiring about 50 people we do have the money they will be expert and i have absolute confidence we will be able to do this also the answer to your first question is again micron wouldn t be announcing a massive expansion in idaho if chips weren t passed so yes they know the strings are attached and yes they will operate under those strings ms jean pierre okay final question ed it s so good to have you back my friend laughs q thank you secretary can you talk a little bit more about the protections or guardrails from doing work with china just you know the administration was reportedly pushing back on intel s plans or publicly announced plans to boost silicon wafer production in china has that has that kind of plans stopped and will that prevent companies like intel from getting this kind of funding secretary raimondo so as as i ve said if they take the money they can t use the money to invest in china they can t build a leading edge fab in china for a period of 10 years if they expand their mature node factories in china it s only to serve the chinese market and by the way if they take money and then do any of those things we ll claw back the money q if if they this was announ as i understand it this was announced previously is there like some type of grandfather clause will they be able to start this production now or does does that does the fact that they had already announced this allow them to make to continue with those plans secretary raimondo we re going to take it on a case by case basis here s what i will tell you the number one objective of implementing this is to protect america s national security every deal we do every criteria that we evaluate these companies against it s going to be with a lens toward protecting national security so we re not going to allow any deals to happen that we think undermine our national security ms jean pierre all right thank you secretary appreciate it secretary raimondo thank you ms jean pierre all right see you in a little bit secretary raimondo all right bye guys thank you ms jean pierre okay thanks everybody thank you secretary raimondo all right i have one thing at the top and as you all know we probably have about 30 minutes or so for the next event that the president has so we all have to get out of here in 30 minutes okay so i just want to take a moment to acknowledge the attack in canada over the weekend it is senseless and devastating i won t get ahead of the canadian law enforcement as they continue their work our thoughts are with the victims of this horrific attack we stand with canada our ally and neighbor and all those affected by this tragedy and condemn this senseless violence with that seung min you want to kick us off q yeah i saw the president s tweet congratulating liz truss the new prime minister of the uk has he spoken with her or does he plan to later today what is his plans ms jean pierre so he s going to speak to her later today this afternoon he s planning to call her to congratulate her the new prime minister and so that that s going to happen later this afternoon q and i have another one on the fatal shooting of journalist shireen abu akleh the israeli military has now said there s a quote high probability that an israeli soldier accidentally killed her but they also said that no one will be held responsible so i wanted to know the white house s reactions to the israeli military s conclusions and also whether it is acceptable to the president that no one will be held accountable in that death ms jean pierre so i know this report came out yesterday as it was reported by the israeli defense forces as you just said we have extended our deepest condolences to the family of shireen abu akleh a renowned palestinian american journalist who was killed in the west bank we strongly condemn this killing as we have for the past several months ms abu akleh was an inspiration to millions and a friend to many in the u s government her death is a great loss and a tragedy we continue to call on all sides to maintain calm and avoid further escalation as you just mentioned and i just said it was reported yesterday that it had con the israeli defense forces had concluded its investigation into the circumstances surrounding her death and stated there was a high possibility that her death was accidentally hit by idf gunfire as you just mentioned seung min we welcome israelis review of this tragic incident and we underscored the importance of accountability in this case such as policies and procedures to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future our thoughts remain with abu akleh s family as they grieve this tremendous loss not only was shireen an american citizen as i just mentioned she was a fearless a fearless reporter whose journalism and pursuit of truth earned her the respect of audience around the world go ahead q thanks karine president biden said last night he didn t think russia should be designated a state sponsor of terrorism even after president zelenskyy in an interview with abc s david muir said he had asked the president about taking that step why does the president think that and is this about keeping limited diplomatic channels open still ms jean pierre so as the president has said as and as we do think as well as you know it is not the most effective or strongest path forward as we have said many times before to hold russia accountable this designation could have unintended consequences to ukraine and the world for example according to humanitarian expert and ngos we have spoken to it could seriously affect the ability to deliver assistance in areas of ukraine another one is it could drive critical humanitarian and commercial actors away from facilitating food exports to help mitigate the global food crisis and jeopardize the black sea port deal that has already led to over a million tons of ukrainian food exports reaching the world including those on the on the horn of africa likely facing famine it would also undercut our unprecedented multilateral condition that has been so effective to holding putin accountable and could also undermine our ability to support ukraine at the negotiating negotiation table so again we do not think this is the most effective way to go or the strongest path forward q there are also concerns about potentially inadvertently punishing allies who might still have trade relations with russia ms jean pierre so look what we have done is we ve already put in place severe consequences in line with those that would be imposed under such designation our sanctions export controls affect efforts to further isolate russia from the global economy or are having a significant impact so that s the way we kind of have seen with the work that we ve already done under this russia defaulted on its foreign debt for the first time in more than a century as we have said we are choking off russia s military supply chains for example russia has to rely on north korea as you all heard and iran for military equipment and just last week the g7 committed to implement a price cap to push down the price of putin s oil and starve him of his main source of revenue to fund this war so again we are of course support we of course are going to support using further tools that will work to promote accountability for russia s war against ukraine and so that s going to be our focus as we move forward go ahead q when the president speaks with the new prime minister of the united kingdom will he discuss the northern ireland arrangements is there an expectation that he ll call on the prime minister to delay implementation of the protocol bill that she has supported that would allow the united kingdom to override the provisions of the agreement between northern ireland and the republic of ireland how s that going to come into the conversation ms jean pierre so i m not going to get ahead or speak to what the president might say or will say on the call i ll say this that we ll have a readout after the call later this afternoon but he has been clear about his continued interest in northern ireland our priority remains protecting the gains of the belfast good friday agreement and preserving peace stability and prosperity for the people of northern ireland again i m not i m not going to get ahead of what the president will or won t say q okay and the uk is obviously going through some serious economic concerns they have an energy crisis that s going on is there any room for aid assistance or more to be done in terms of supporting them on lowering energy costs domestically ms jean pierre so you ve heard us say this that what we see russia is doing we ve been very clear about this is that they re using energy they re weaponizing energy and it s choosing to one of the things that has been out there the shutdown of the pipeline of nord strom 1 so the sanction we ve imposed we believe do stand in the way of the pipeline to continuing operating so the u s and europe have been collaborating to ensure sufficient supplies are available as a result of these efforts european gas shortage will be full by the critical winter heating season so we have more work to do but again we re working closely with our allies on this q and then one final one is there any status update on u s uk trade negotiations and do you expect that to be a topic on the call with the new prime minister ms jean pierre so i don t have any updates on that again i m not going to get ahead of what s going to be on the call with the what the president is going to say to the new prime minister we ll have certainly we ll have a readout for all of you once it s done go ahead q just one question the president tweeted earlier today i want to be clear not every congressional republican is a maga republican he went on to say to talk about an extreme set of maga republicans in congress but he s also said frequently over the last several days talked about how not one republican backed the agenda that he s had in for example the inflation reduction act or the recovery act and more broadly he s talked about how the republican party is not your grandfather s republican party that the whole party has changed so can you talk a little bit about what he s what group of people does he think are maga republicans does he when he says not one republican supported the agenda so does that mean that every republican in congress is essentially a maga republican ms jean pierre so he s been very clear when he s talked about maga republicans ultra maga republicans he s talked about the leadership in the republican party for one of the first time he actually used that term was to talk about rick scott s plan which was to your point using a an agenda that they had which was to put medicare and social security on the chopping block and for him that was an extreme measure that is taking away something that was if you re thinking about it medicare social security very popular that is a majority of americans support that as well as the as well as the inflation reduction act majority of the republi of sorry republicans and democrats and independents support those policies and you have leaders in in the republican party who are offering extreme extreme agenda and so that s what he means and let me just i ll just quote the president on friday he took actually peter s question the only reporter that he took a question from on friday and he said in answering your question about this laughter i know i i m only saying that because peter felt a certain way that i didn t take his question on friday in the briefing room but the president did take your question that day q inaudible feels like that all the time ms jean pierre laughs well i hear you q word travels fast laughter ms jean pierre word word there we go okay so when people vote voted for donald trump this is the this is president biden and support him now they weren t voting for attacking the capitol they weren t voting for overruling an election they were voting for a philosophy he put forward so i m not talking about anything other than it s inappropriate and it s it s not only happening here but other parts of the world where there s a failure to recognize and condemn violence whenever it is used for political purposes failure to condemn an attempt to manipulate electoral outcomes a failure to acknowledge when elections were won or lost and so that is from the president what he thinks he s talking about a the leadership he s talking about the leadership who put out extreme agenda also the also talking in what i just laid out in not condemning violence when there s violence out there q so just one quick follow up but you know while it s you know you can talk about what people meant or didn t mean or by voting in the 2020 election but there are lots of republican just regular republican voters who do support for example rick scott s you know ideas about what to do with the budget or what to do with social security or entitlement programs there s lots of republican voters who do agree with the president that they think the election was with the former president i mean but but that ms jean pierre yeah no i hear you q the election so so does he consider does the president consider all of those people who support these extreme agendas that he s talking about to be the maga republicans that ms jean pierre so he was has been very clear that he s talking about office holders he s talking about elected officials who have these maga ultra maga republican agendas and he s been very clear about that look here s the thing the point that we are making is majority of americans support medicare majority of americans support social security majority of americans support our democracy and want to protect our democracy want to protect our freedom want to protect our rights and that s who the president is going to continue to stand up for and fight for i m going to try and call on people i haven t called on yet go ahead q karine thank you ms jean pierre since we don t have a lot of time q a follow for you on the questions about russia and the president s decision not to designate russia as a state sponsor of terrorism is that a final decision by president biden ms jean pierre yes it is i mean i ll let his words stand for himself he answered it pretty simply i just laid out why we think it wouldn t be the strongest path forward i laid out three reasons also we want to make sure that ukraine has what it needs in case it has to go to the negotiation table so it is very important that we give them the strongest the strongest you know negotiation arm that they can have q and did the president directly convey that to president zelenskyy before publicly saying that he had made that decision and has he conveyed it to members of congress leaders in congress ms jean pierre i can t speak to conversation private conversation specifically on this that the president had with members of congress or president zelenskyy as you know they spoke recently we laid out a readout of what that conver how that conversation went and what was discussed q and what about congressional leaders ms jean pierre again i just said i can t speak to what conversations that the president had private conversations that he s had with members of congress q can you tell us when specifically he made that determination because of this ms jean pierre i don t have a a timeline q or inaudible made ms jean pierre no i well i don t have a timeline on when he made that decision he was asked that directly yesterday he answered that very straightforward in a straightforward way i just laid out what our concerns are with that q and can you just update us karine i know you ve answered some version of this question before but as we re sort of starting in september here has the president or anyone within the administration been briefed on the intelligence community s assessment of the classified or sensitive documents that have been retrieved at mar a lago ms jean pierre no no q and is there a protocol for that i mean given that we are talking about sensitive government documents ms jean pierre so again and i ve said this many times at this podium we have said this many times on your air your airwaves which is we are just we get the interest we understand the interest we re not going to comment on an ongoing independent investigation as anything that s related to it this is something that the president has been very clear about in making sure there is no political interference and making sure that the department of justice has that independence when it comes to investigations so i m just not going to comment anything related to it q one more quick on a different topic but just following up on the questions about the maga republicans the president is very firm in his language and direct saying that the former president and maga republicans he believes pose a threat to america s democracy does he then denounce the efforts by some democrats to prop up republicans who support the maga agenda in the primaries ms jean pierre i m not going to talk about political action or what is happening in the midterms q just broadly speaking ms jean pierre i i m just that is q does the administration see this inaudible ms jean pierre i am not going to talk anything that s related to the midterms or politics as well i cannot standing where i am and also the role that i have i m going to go to the back and then i ll come back front i ll come back q karine thanks ms jean pierre go ahead i haven t go ahead sir q thank you thank you karine thank you very much does does president biden president biden is the current holder of executive privilege and does president biden believe that trump can claim executive privilege for government documents that he took with him to florida ms jean pierre again anything related to the independent investigation again independent investigation that s being done by the department of justice we re not going to comment regardless of content or any underlying material i m not going to comment from here q well the judge judge cannon herself said that biden hadn t weighed in that s refuted in the national archives letter but does president biden have an opinion on and has he exerted his opinion on whether executive privilege applies to former president trump after he left office after he left on january 20th 2021 ms jean pierre not it is i m not going to comment about what the what the judge said yesterday the court has laid out again that is for the department of justice this whole independent investigation i m just not going to comment on it at this time go ahead courtney q thanks karine i wanted to ask you the department of veterans affairs put out an interim rule this morning on access to abortion offering veterans abortion in special instances i know we had the conversation in here shortly after the fall of roe about this idea of doctors performing abortion procedures on federal land and even talked about how that wasn t the best path forward at the time what changed and what do you believe is the legal justification to make this happen at va clinics ms jean pierre so i would leave that to the veterans affairs department that is their decision to make and i would refer you to them on that particular question i m going to get around because we don t have a lot of time at all go ahead q thank you in his independence day speech prime minister inaudible prime minister modi gave a call to communicate india a developed country in the next 25 years at least 2047 when india celebrates its 100 years of independence as you know this year is the 75th year of india s independence in what way u s can u s can help india assist india in making it a developed nation by 2047 or in the next 25 years ms jean pierre so the united states and as you know india and i ve said this to you before in this room will continue to work together every day to deliver opportunities security freedom and dignity to our peoples we are partners in many important areas including defense vaccines climate tech and our ever growing people to people connections the united states will continue to work with india to advance a free and open indo pacific and address the challenges both our countries face around the world that is our commitment that we have in our partnership with india q and secondly what is the president s assessment of the situation in afghanistan right now a year after the taliban took the power there ms jean pierre say that say that one more time q what is the president s assessment of the situation in afghanistan right now a year after the taliban took the power ms jean pierre so we are we are committed to supporting the afghan people and we have said that many times before and we are proud to be the largest single provider of humanitarian assistance to afghanistan we are working closely with the united nations and other partners to provide this assistance directly to the afghan people without benefit to the taliban we will remain vigilant against any terrorism threats directed at the united states or our allies as we have demonstrated just recently in july as you know when we took out the leader of al qaeda and we will continue to prioritize relocation efforts to our afghan allies and welcome our afghan allies to the united states since our commitment to them is enduring so we will also continue to press the taliban for the safe release of mark frerichs and to respect the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all afghans including women and girls and that is our going to continue to be our commitment i m just going to go around to folks i haven t called on and then i ll come down to here peter q thanks karine there are multiple inspector general posts where the president has yet to nominate a permanent ig there may be someone acting there but has yet to nominate a permanent ig at the state department hasn t had a permanent ig since before president biden took office so what is the president doing what is the white house doing behind the scenes to find those permanent igs for those really important positions ms jean pierre so it s a great question i don t have anything here to read out or lay out to you about our process in filling the permanent igs i would refer you to state department specifically on anything on what they have what they have laid out and how they ve worked through that i don t have any updates on any naming anyone or anything that we have to share or to preview to you as well q yes i understand but these are the president s nominees state department doesn t make that ms jean pierre no but you also asked me what is it that we re doing as well so i that s why i said you should go to state department to figure out what is it that they re been doing while we re trying to figure out the permanent igs i don t have anything to preview at this time on our process or where we are on that particular question q and then really briefly on student loans i know the administration has encouraged people who are applying for loan forgiveness when that opens up to do so by november 15th but is there kind of an end deadline when is the last time people can apply for that is there some sort of deadline considering of course that this would already have to be debt that s already been accrued ms jean pierre so we ve we ve talked about this i talked about this last week about the timeline and how that s going to work and you mentioned november 15th so so that s in order we do we are saying that in order to receive before the payment pause which expires on december 31st 2022 so that s why we want as you want to get that relief we want to also and the pause is coming off that s the best way to make sure that as those two things are happening and you re not put in a bind america is not put in a bind that s why we recommend doing it by november 15th but the department of education will continue to process applications as they are received even after the pause expires on december 31st so it ll be continuing the reason why we give the deadline of november 15 is because we know the pause is going to be lifted so to give as we have said we want to make sure that we give americans a little bit of breathing room and that s why we have that deadline q so people can apply into 2023 ms jean pierre yes they can yes okay oh peter go ahead q thanks karine a follow up about the maga republican attention so if we re all in agreement that it is incorrect to say the 2020 election was stolen what about the 2016 election ms jean pierre look i m not going to go back to where we were or what happened in 2016 we re going to focus on the here and now we re going to focus on what s happening today this inflection point that the president pointed out very clearly very decisively in a few speeches about what the country needs to do at this time to bring the country together and he believes that s where a majority of americans are when it comes to protecting our democracy when it comes to protecting our rights and when it comes to protecting our freedoms that s what we re going to talk about that s what we re going to focus on on where we are today q but just in trying to understand the new attention on the maga republicans you tweeted in 2016 ms jean pierre oh i knew this was coming q trump stole an election you tweeted ms jean pierre i was waiting peter when you were going to ask me that question laughs q well great here we go you tweeted trump stole an election you tweeted brian kemp stole an election if denying election results is extreme now why wasn t it then ms jean pierre so let s let s let s be really clear that that comparison that you made is just ridiculous i have been i have been q how is that ridiculous ms jean pierre well you re asking me you re asking me a question q yes ms jean pierre let me answer it q and you said it was ridiculous ms jean pierre i was i was talking specifically at that time of what was happening with voting rights and the what was in danger of voting rights that s what i was speaking to at the time and here s the thing i have said governor kemp won the election in georgia i ve been clear about that i have said president trump won the election of 2016 and i ve been clear about that what we are talking about right now is let s not forget what happened on january 6th 2021 when we saw an insurrection a mob that was incited by the person who occupied this campus this facility at that time and it was an attack on our democracy let s not forget people died that day law enforcement were attacked that day that was the danger that we were seeing at the time that s what the president has called out and that s what he s going to continue to call out so yes when you have maga republicans a extreme part of republicans who for who just deny or do not want to really say what exactly happened on that day or say it was a protest when it clearly was not a peaceful protest that s not what we saw on that day yes the president is going to call that out and here s the thing majority of americans agree with him majority of americans agree with this president on protecting our democracy protecting our freedom and protecting our rights that s what we re talking about today and that s what the president is going to focus on all right we re going to have to move we re going to have to move i m going to call on folks i haven t called on go ahead q thanks karine i m just wondering if you have any sort of preview for the event tomorrow with former president obama and former first lady obama ms jean pierre i do i do so tomorrow president biden is looking forward to welcoming back president obama and michelle obama to the white house for the unveiling of their official white house portraits over the course of their eight years together in office a close partnership between the two men grew through the highs and lows of the job and life and of life president biden and dr biden are honored to have former president obama and former first lady michelle obama back to the white house for the unveiling of their portraits which will hang on the walls of the white house forever as reminders of the power of hope and change q and obviously this ceremony is happening as per in recent history tradition predecessor and successor obviously it didn t happen under the last administration would president biden hold the same ceremony for president trump should his portraits be done before his first term ms jean pierre so we we defer those questions to the white house historical association who actually they lead the process on official portraits for both presidents and their spouses so that question goes lies with them q and is there any more interaction that the former president and current president will have tomorrow or is it just the ceremony ms jean pierre i don t have anything else to share at this time if we if there s more interaction or more to share we certainly will okay go ahead q going back to the new uk prime minister can you talk a little bit about what president biden s relationship is with her has he met with her in the past does he know her well ms jean pierre that s a good question i can go back and actually ask to see if they have a prior relationship but i do want to say this as we talk about the change that s happening the new prime minister our countries have a close longstanding special relationships as friends and nato allies and we are looking forward to continued close cooperation on key priorities including supporting ukraine as it defends itself against russian aggression and addressing the challenges posed by china so we see our relationship not just with the leadership but also the people of the uk q karine is the president planning to call ms jean pierre i m going to try and call on people who i haven t called q is the president planning to call the president of kenya the new inaudible president elect of kenya q thanks karine i want to ask you about the question about migrants and whether they have or haven t been walking across the southwest border senator ted cruz has publicly invited suggested that you come down to see that for yourself ms jean pierre who wait who q senator ted cruz of texas he s he s suggested that you come down and see for yourself whether migrants are actually crossing the border by foot is that something that you would take him up on ms jean pierre so i ve been to the border i went in 2018 i stood outside facilities where the trump administration was separating families tearing babies out of their mothers arms some of those kids still haven t been reunited with their families and so one thing i will say is i certainly don t need lectures or invitations from republicans about the border or border policies and you know and i certainly won t take advice on border from anyone who voted against securing record level of funding for the department of homeland security and and you know and while folks are sending invites i ll use this opportunity to to invite him or anyone else next time to vote for record funding for dhs as president biden has requested so we ll move on q and ms jean pierre nope we ll move on from that q and quick question on the migrants who drowned last week near eagle pass what is the administration doing to avert those kinds of tragedies ms jean pierre so that is a tragic that is tragic when we hear news like that our hearts go out to the families certainly and and that is what we try to work very hard to do to secure the border and make sure that we don t see those types of those tragedies and heartbreaks so i know the department of homeland security is working very hard on to continuing to secure our border to do work that was not done in the past several years and so we re going to continue to focus on that okay go ahead q karine a question on kenya ms jean pierre okay go ahead kenya what s what s going on q since you just spoke about the president calling the new prime minister of the uk is he planning to call the president elect of kenya after it was affirmed his victory was affirmed by the supreme court yesterday and is he also planning to call the new president of angola the president and the president elect inaudible ms jean pierre so i don t have i spoke to angola a couple of times last week and the president actually took a question i know on angola specifically about 10 days or so on on kenya i ll say this we congratulate william ruto on his election as president of kenya we also congratulate the people of kenya on the conclusion of a peaceful electoral process we commend raila odinga and other candidates for abiding by the supreme court filing transparent electoral processes and the peaceful adjudication of disputes are testaments to the strength of democratic institutions the united states and kenya share a strong and longstanding partnership based on a commitment to democracy security economic prosperity we look forward to enhancing this partnership with president ruto and his new government i don t have any calls to read out or preview for you at this time q and then on ethiopia last friday you talked about the special envoy michael hammer going to ethiopia the main problem in ethiopia right now especially around tigray is about the blockade that s been there for almost 21 months is the president is the special envoy going to press prime minister abiy ahmed ali to lift the blockade and grant access to the 6 million people who have been sealed off ms jean pierre so i m not going to get ahead of the special envoy i know we announced that as you mentioned last week i m not going to get into any conversation that he may potentially have clearly this is a priority for this president and when we will have more to share we ll share more i got to q can ms jean pierre i got to jump around q one last question ms jean pierre no no no i got to jump around i got to jump around go ahead go ahead q thank you so much i ve got a question on israel and iran tensions israel is on high alert and the prime minister of israel has talked about taking unilateral action against iran s nuclear program will the biden administration back any israeli action against iran s nuclear program and can you update us a little bit on the mossad chief he s in town who has he been meeting with what s he been doing ms jean pierre so don t have anything to share about mossad being in town it had been announced several weeks now that he would be don t have more to share on that look i m going to when it comes to the jcpoa you know i m going to keep it very very simple here we ve said this many times we have taken a deliberate and principled approach to these negotiations from the start if iran is prepared to comply with comments with its commitments under 2015 deal then we are prepared to do the same the administration along with our allies is preparing equally for scenarios with or and without a mutual return to the to the full implementation of the jcpoa the president will only conclude a deal that he determines in the national security interest of the united states again not going to negotiate not going to have conversations or hypotheticals of what may or may not happen we have been very clear about what we intend here and it s to make sure that iran does not acquire a nuclear weapon and that is our ultimate goal here q can i follow up on president abbas ms jean pierre okay no we re just going to we re going to move around because i literally have two minutes go ahead q i actually want to follow up on the iran nuclear deal question ms jean pierre okay q what is the timeline that president biden is looking at before the state department diplomats sort of say time s up ms jean pierre so i don t have a timeline for you i can give you an update on the status of the negotiations look it s a regular back and forth as we have said we are studying the response in coordination with our e3 allies as you know we have received a response again we re not going to negotiate in public some gaps have closed in recent weeks but others have remained as you all know the president will only again conclude a deal that he determines is in the national security interest of the united states i m not i m not going to get into further detail or negotiate from here i can take one last question one last question q can i ask about shireen my colleague can you you read the message the statement about shireen abu akleh the administration continues to talk about accountability but there hasn t been any there have been no charges what is the biden administration going to do to press for accountability what steps are going to be taken ms jean pierre so what i can tell you is that we have been we have been in constant communication we have been very public about making sure that there is accountability the u s security coordinator the uscc as it relates to the investigation finding that there was no reason to believe the killing was intentional and it was instead the result of tragic circumstances is based on a series of engagements and a review of the totality of the available evidence situational and environmental factors again you know our profound condolences go to the family we hear their concerns we understand their concerns the examin examination was conducted by two members again of the uscc with over 42 combined years of forensic expertise in addition to the forensic and bal ballistic analysis the uscc was granted full access to both israel defense forces and palestinian authority investigation by summarizing both investigation the uscc concluded that gunfire from idf positions was likely responsible for the death of shireen abu akleh the uscc found no reason to believe that this was intentional but rather the result of tragic circumstances again you know our hearts go out to the family members and i m i have to go it s 1 03 q but just very quickly ms jean pierre i ll be back tomorrow i ll be q this isn t accountability i how do journalists in this room read this i mean it feels almost like our government doesn t have our back that an ally can can kill an american journalist with impunity ms jean pierre i i disagree i disagree one thing that this president has been very clear about making sure that we stand up for a journalist we stand up for the freedom that they should be given in order to report whether it s here or across the globe and and the president has always been clear about fighting for human rights that will never change he has talked about it boldly and clearly and and he s talked about it with leaders as well so that is something that he respects the freedom of speech and he ll continue to speak to that all right guys i got to go 1 05 p m edt

after two years of lawsuits a court finally unsealed key evidence from the fbi s 2020 investigation of north carolina sen richard burr for allegedly trading stocks based on nonpublic information public records at the time show that burr abruptly liquidated more than half of his and his wife s equity holdings in february of 2020 when most of the world had yet to focus on the looming coronavirus crisis burr was ultimately not charged with breaking any laws but the newly released records show fbi agents believed burr had committed insider trading and securities fraud the most compelling new evidence is the flurry of calls and texts between burr his wife brooke burr her brother gerald fauth and fauth s wife that took place on the same days that both the fauths and the burrs sold off hundreds of thousands of dollars of stock right before the market plunged washington newly unsealed fbi documents paint a vivid picture of the government s evidence in a 2020 insider trading investigation of north carolina s senior senator republican richard burr burr was ultimately not charged with breaking any laws but the newly released sworn affidavit of an fbi special agent shows that the justice department had probable cause to believe that burr had committed insider trading and securities fraud as chair of the senate intelligence committee burr in february 2020 abruptly liquidated more than half of his and his wife s equity holdings at a time when u s markets and most americans did not yet know how bad the coronavirus pandemic was going to be get southern california news weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc la newsletters given his position burr had information about the virus spread and about america s meager preparation for a massive pandemic that was not available to the public the affidavit was submitted in support of a search warrant application to seize and search burr s phone one that the judge in the case later granted it lays out a startling timeline of calls and texts between burr his wife brooke burr her brother gerald fauth and fauth s wife that took place on the same days that both the fauths and the burrs sold off hundreds of thousands of dollars of stock right before the market plunged a spokesperson in burr s senate office did not respond to a request for comment on the newly unsealed documents an unusual timeline from the start burr has insisted that the only information he relied upon in deciding to sell his stocks was publicly available including reports by cnbc correspondents in asia nonetheless as chair of the senate intelligence committee burr was given access to classified intelligence reports in january and early february that contained dire warnings about the coronavirus on jan 31 burr received nonpublic information from a source whose name is redacted in the fbi documents that same day burr put in orders to sell nearly 110 000 in stock from his and his wife s brokerage accounts on feb 12 burr ordered the purchase of approximately 1 2 million of treasury securities using 76 of the total holdings in burr and his wife s joint account investors often purchase u s treasury funds to hedge against a potential market downturn the fbi special agent brandon merriman notes he also noted that the dow jones industrial average closed at a record high of 29 551 42 on feb 12 one day after burr s big treasury bill purchase burr and his wife unloaded equity shares worth approximately 1 1 million that the burrs sold stock was reported at the time but the value of the sale was only reported within a range monday s filing was the first time the exact amounts had been made public according to the fbi as a result of senator burr s sales on february 13 2020 his portfolio went from approximately 83 in equities to approximately 3 in equities a week later markets began a steep slide as investors panicked over the potential economic damage from the coronavirus gerald fauth the other person in burr s family who sold a lot of stock on feb 13 2020 was burr s brother in law gerald fauth according to the affidavit records show that a series of sell orders were placed into an account belonging to fauth s wife mary fauth just before noon on the 13th amounting to around 159 100 burr s attorney alice fisher told propublica in may of 2020 that burr did not coordinate his decision to trade on feb 13 with mr fauth but the fbi evidence released on monday shows that burr s wife called her brother shortly after 11 a m et on the 13th and they spoke for two minutes twenty minutes after that burr also used his cellphone to call fauth according to records obtained by the justice department just two minutes after fauth s conversation with his brother law ended fauth called his investment manager and they talked for just shy of half an hour in a later interview the adviser appears to have told the fbi that fauth sounded hurried and that he mentioned knowing a senator in washington according to the fbi the burrs stock sell orders were put in between 11 38 and 11 49 a m fauth s orders were put in between 11 55 a m and 11 58 a m mysterious text messages while the fbi affidavit sheds light on many of the questions surrounding burr s stock sales it closely protects at least one relevant piece of information what kind of nonpublic information burr had about the coronavirus and where he got it but there may be some clues specifically the justice department mentions dozens of text messages that burr exchanged with someone whose name is redacted but who appears to be a potential source of nonpublic information according to the fbi between jan 31 2020 and april 7 2020 this person and burr exchanged approximately 32 text messages nearly all of which concerned in one way or another the covid 19 pandemic nearly everything about the text messages is redacted but later in the affidavit the government writes those text messages include those discussed above and included ones regarding other issues such as efforts to provide face masks to the public the global outlook regarding covid 19 and a proposed national lockdown if burr was receiving this information when it wasn t being publicly discussed that could have strengthened the government s case against him it s still unclear why the justice department decided not to prosecute burr or fauth and the department does not typically explain the reasons why it does not prosecute someone but on jan 19 2021 nearly a year after the questionable trades burr said in a statement tonight the department of justice informed me that it has concluded its review of my personal financial transactions conducted early last year the case is now closed i m glad to hear it burr said my focus has been and will continue to be working for the people of north carolina during this difficult time for our nation

by ahmed aboulenein and susan heavey washington reuters the united states is likely to start recommending covid 19 vaccines annually health officials said on tuesday as new boosters designed to fight currently circulating variants of the coronavirus roll out by the end of this week 90 of americans will live within five miles 8 km of sites carrying updated vaccines u s health secretary xavier becerra said at a white house briefing officials said people could get the new boosters this fall or winter alongside their regular annual flu shots president joe biden said separately in a statement that for most americans that means one covid 19 shot once a year each fall white house covid 19 response coordinator dr ashish jha said in the briefing that for a large majority of americans we are moving to a point where a single annual covid shot should provide a high degree of protection against serious illness all year that s an important milestone u s centers for disease control and prevention cdc director rochelle walensky said even with the seven day average of covid hospitalizations down 14 to 4 500 per day annual shots could save thousands of lives modeling projections show that an uptake of updated covid 19 vaccine doses similar to an annual flu vaccine coverage early this fall could prevent as many as 100 000 hospitalizations and 9 000 deaths and save billions of dollars in direct medical costs she said top u s infectious disease expert dr anthony fauci said unless a dramatically different variant emerges annual vaccines should offer enough protection for most people but that some vulnerable groups might need more frequent vaccinations we likely are moving towards a path with a vaccination cadence similar to that of the annual influenza vaccine with annual updated covid 19 shots matched to the currently circulating strains for most of the population he said the redesigned boosters green lighted by u s health regulators last week aim to tackle the ba 5 and ba 4 omicron subvariants which account for over 88 and 11 of circulating viruses respectively walensky said the so called bivalent vaccines also still target the original version of the virus for the last two years this virus has continued evolving while our vaccines have stayed the same but now we have a vaccine that matches the dominant strain out there jha said for the first time since december of 2020 these vaccines are vaccines that have caught up with the virus regulators have so far backed covid boosters for those aged 12 and older from pfizer biontech and moderna nasdaq s updated shot for those 18 and older jha said it was not yet clear when they could be approved for younger children but that there may be an update on the timing later in the fall he said the new vaccines will remain available for free but because congress has not provided enough covid response funding this comes at the cost of pulling other resources like personal protective equipment and at home tests leaving the national stockpile ill equipped to deal with another surge in cases becerra said there was enough vaccine supply for the fall campaign but the future is uncertain we may have the vaccines today for folks for this fall vaccine effort we don t know what s coming next we don t know what the next generation of vaccines will look like if we don t have the resources to continue that research going he said his department last week said the government s vaccine and antiviral treatment supply would run out over the next year meaning they would start being sold commercially sooner than previously expected the government also cited a lack of funding when it said americans would no longer be able to order free at home covid tests from its covidtests gov website

originally posted by mn gordon on economic prism elizabeth warren must be a fool that or she thinks the rest of us are fools the senator recently took to cnn to publicly fret over the federal reserve s rate hikes she s worried they will tip the economy into recession what s warren afraid of her fears have already come true the u s economy already is in a recession gdp data alone shows the economy contracted in both the first and second quarter of 2022 the technical definition for a recession has long been understood to be two consecutive quarters of declining gdp so by definition the economy is in a recession everyone knows this save president biden and warren recessions may not be agreeable but they are necessary in fact the present recession is precisely what s needed to clean up the consumer price inflation mess that warren and her colleagues made there are consequences for mass money printing and they must be reckoned one way or another the fundamental fact is today s consumer price inflation fiasco is a direct result of washington s spending policies the coronavirus hysteria provided the perfect excuse to spew printing press money into the economy warren was one of the greatest advocates the fed for its part merely obliged the wishes of congress it created credit from thin air and loaned it to the treasury in the form of treasury note purchases the treasury then obliged the wishes of congress it used the money that was borrowed from the fed to fund stimmy checks ppp and generous federal unemployment payments this was all to meet the legislative demands of warren and the other knaves in congress money destruction there s never a good time to spew printing press money into the economy but the years 2020 21 were particularly bad that s because governments the world over locked down their economies for no good reason at all the united states europe and nearly every government across the globe took its cues from communist china the coronavirus curve wasn t flattened but the economy was then politicians like warren took a bad situation and made it vastly worse by spewing printing press money everywhere maybe they thought they were helping maybe they believed the promise of modern monetary theory mmt would make all their socialist dreams come true regardless their actions were highly destructive and now we all must live in the discombobulated world they made the critical point is that the creation of greater quantities of money by central planners does not magically increase the quantity of goods and services the addition of newly created money is not readily greeted with a corresponding increase in production similarly newly created money does not magically increase people s claims to goods and services it does not increase how much they can consume rather it dilutes each individual monetary unit which then appears as rising prices the genesis of consumer price inflation can be found in money supply inflation money supply inflation is the direct act of central planners the inflation of the money supply comes first consumer prices then follow especially when the printing press money is injected into the economy via government giveaways broken supply chains the 2020 21 government mandated lockdowns succeeded in disrupting supply chains many links in the chain were broken some supply chains that were incrementally connected over the last 30 years were broken forever there s no going back to the way things were prior to march 2020 yet in addition to the ramifications of government mandated lockdowns and mass money spewing the world continues to change in important ways we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us geopolitical shifts since the start of the russian ukraine war are momentous sanctions imposed on russia have put europe in a position where it can no longer consume cheap abundant russian natural gas this is an example of a supply chain that s broken for good it will never be repaired the implications of this new reality are just setting in as winter appears in the distance germany is particularly vulnerable to disruptions in russian gas before the war started more than half of its gas came from russian imports now germany is having to quickly develop contingencies one option is to restart coal plants that had already been shut down as part of its plan to phase out coal by 2030 but coal is also in a supply crunch in poland for example cars are lining up at the lubelski wegiel bogdanka coal mine people are waiting day and night to stock up on heating fuel in advance of winter demand for coal has forced bogdanka and other mines to ration sales what s going on here how did everything get so screwed up have we entered the new dark ages have we entered the new dark ages unless there s a miracle this winter will be an absolute calamity for europe french president emmanuel macron recently clarified the situation for his cabinet what we are currently living through is a kind of major tipping point or a great upheaval we are living the end of what could have seemed an era of abundance the end of the abundance of products of technologies that seemed always available the end of the abundance of land and materials including water spanish defense minister margarita robles also warned of what s to come saying we are going to have a winter of great suffering both macron and robles fail to mention the source of the great upheaval and winter of suffering that it s elitist policies from the u s and europe that have put everyone in such a pinch in reality there is an abundance of resources and the talent and capability to efficiently deliver them to market but government lockdowns climate change policies and senseless sanctions are standing in the way one example of the absurdity of it all was recently identified by zerohedge who detailed how europe is paying inflated prices for russian liquified natural gas lng that s been laundered through china somehow dirty lng from russia magically becomes clean when it s brokered from china here in the u s these mega disruptions are less pronounced at least for now yet the u s is not exempt not with the current cadre of elitists doing everything they can to inhibit productivity and then paper over it with printing press money via misnomers like the inflation reduction act as noted above the u s is already in a recession the bear market rally has stalled out and reversed just as the calendar turns to september the worst month of the year historically for u s stocks and september is followed by october a month which has delivered several of the most epic stock market crashes on record so as the market slides into the fall and the economy contracts high consumer prices will persist they must elitist policies assure it there is one way out however but it won t be very pleasant as the fed yanks the cheap money rug out from under the economy the recession could turn into a decade long depression and if that doesn t do it a new dark ages will originally posted by mn gordon on economic prism

features 06 09 2022 listen he may not know this and as it is often said ignorance is bliss in the present context however ignorance could very well cost the foolhardy antiestablishment critic his very life and trust me like the widely suspected palace coup and assassination of then incumbent president john evans atta mills by the gonja mafia and the latter establishment s sogakope mafia allies and the rest of the national democratic congress hoodlum pack of moneyed goons there will be nobody left to tell the proverbial tale of how it all came down you see you have to be gapingly and scandalously naïve to facilely conclude as prof ransford yaw gyampo of the political science department of the university of ghana legon did recently that the management and or the proprietors of the kumasi based oyerepa fm and tv stations were weak or lily livered cowards and that was why they docilely consented to shutting down their media enterprise and operations temporarily as counseled by the invested chieftains of the kumasi traditional council ktc see ghana isn t a monarchy chiefs can t shut down radio stations prof gyampo 8 28 22 well for his instructive information or edification chiefs can actually snuff out human lives and actually get away with it like some teflon dons as the american political jargon goes and there will be absolutely no trace about the whodunit and by the way i almost forgot to enlighten prof gyampo about the well known but seldomly spoken fact that the kumasi mafia is by and large the most elaborate and sophisticated network of its kind anywhere in the country as well when we talk about the kumasi mafia or the kumasi traditional council which is diplomatically speaking we are actually talking about the globally renowned and celebrated asante federation the largest and the most powerful traditional political organization or establishment in the country at its height it stretched across the present day asante region and the bono and ahafo regions right into ghana s neighboring ivory coast or la cote d ivoire with remarkable influence on the rest of the akan meta or mega nation and even some quite militarily formidable non akan nations and polities that was why the asante kingdom also used to be called the asante empire that is an intricate network of a vast agglomeration of multiethnic entities or polities i have personally come within a distant stretch of the skin of my teeth to literally being permanently dispatched by hired goons of the kumasi mafia which by the way in the latter context needs to be clearly defined and or distinguished from the kumasi traditional council the two entities are not exactly one and the same although in terms of composition there is a clearly overlapping membership anyway my near fatal encounter with the kumasi mafia occurred in the wee weeks and heydays of the late chairman jeremiah jerry john rawlings led bloody junta of the provisional national defense council pndc that will make it a considerable stretch of 1982 that is right in the wake of the so called 31st december revolution which as it shortly turned out was absolutely no revolution at all but the veritable dastardly and the systematic ethnic cleansing of the country s akan ethnic majority populace from the mainstream of ghana s business industry and the civil and public service at large the core engine of which they indubitably constituted the endgame was to ensure that ghanaians of akan descent in particular ethnic asantes would be drastically reduced in number from the nation s bureaucratic system and be massively if not completely replaced by ethnic ewes in particular anlo ewes from the southeastern tip of the nondescript strip mall that is the volta region plus the present oti region which was also a part of the ewe dominated volta region until the auspicious emergence of president addo dankwa akufo addo and the salutary granting of corporate and civic autonomy as well as the long agitated for restoration of the sovereign dignity of this amalgam of multiethnic communities whose membership and local inhabitants were literally being treated like virtual hostages of the anlo ewe neocolonial collaborative military apprenticeship with the french colonialists and veritable second class ghanaian citizens anyway the event that nearly brought yours truly into the crosshairs of the kumasi mafia occurred when he was put in charge of inventory or taking stock of seized hoarded goods as a group leader of the national youth organizing commission nyoc as the national youth council nyc was known at the time some essential commodities shop owners whose merchandise had been confiscated and taken to the quartermaster s office at the 4th battalion of infantry barracks at bantama the central township of the then kumasi municipality actually adum was central kumasi decided to take their anger out on yours truly he would narrowly escape either being gunned down or macheted to death when a highly connected operative of the goon squad learned to his utter disappointment and alarm that manhyia had specifically issued a directive for these death retailing contractors to stay as far away as possible from the newly arrived young poetry sensation at anokyekrom of the ghana national cultural center gncc yes somebody had discovered just in the nick of time just when it mattered to this unsuspecting fired up wet eared revolutionary that yours truly was the grandson of both the akyem asiakwa paramount chief and otumfuo nana opoku ware ii who by the way yours truly had once met at anokyekrom together with nanabaahemaapanyin afua kobi but never had the privilege of being introduced to at anokyekrom he would later learn that he also had deep roots in the barekese royal family in short these were the bulletproof and machete proof jackets that saved yours truly s life yes there are all these british inherited postcolonial laws that officially govern the country but if prof ransford yaw gyampo really wants to know the real laws that govern the kumasi metropolis and the august asante federation are routinely minted at manhyia not ghana s parliament or the british inherited judicial system you can ask anybody who really knows visit my blog at kwameokoampaahoofejr by kwame okoampa ahoofe jr phd english department suny nassau garden city new york august 28 2022 e

after two years of lawsuits a court finally unsealed key evidence from the fbi s 2020 investigation of north carolina sen richard burr for allegedly trading stocks based on nonpublic information public records at the time show that burr abruptly liquidated more than half of his and his wife s equity holdings in february of 2020 when most of the world had yet to focus on the looming coronavirus crisis burr was ultimately not charged with breaking any laws but the newly released records show fbi agents believed burr had committed insider trading and securities fraud the most compelling new evidence is the flurry of calls and texts between burr his wife brooke burr her brother gerald fauth and fauth s wife that took place on the same days that both the fauths and the burrs sold off hundreds of thousands of dollars of stock right before the market plunged washington newly unsealed fbi documents paint a vivid picture of the government s evidence in a 2020 insider trading investigation of north carolina s senior senator republican richard burr burr was ultimately not charged with breaking any laws but the newly released sworn affidavit of an fbi special agent shows that the justice department had probable cause to believe that burr had committed insider trading and securities fraud as chair of the senate intelligence committee burr in february 2020 abruptly liquidated more than half of his and his wife s equity holdings at a time when u s markets and most americans did not yet know how bad the coronavirus pandemic was going to be get connecticut local news weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc connecticut newsletters given his position burr had information about the virus spread and about america s meager preparation for a massive pandemic that was not available to the public the affidavit was submitted in support of a search warrant application to seize and search burr s phone one that the judge in the case later granted it lays out a startling timeline of calls and texts between burr his wife brooke burr her brother gerald fauth and fauth s wife that took place on the same days that both the fauths and the burrs sold off hundreds of thousands of dollars of stock right before the market plunged a spokesperson in burr s senate office did not respond to a request for comment on the newly unsealed documents an unusual timeline from the start burr has insisted that the only information he relied upon in deciding to sell his stocks was publicly available including reports by cnbc correspondents in asia nonetheless as chair of the senate intelligence committee burr was given access to classified intelligence reports in january and early february that contained dire warnings about the coronavirus on jan 31 burr received nonpublic information from a source whose name is redacted in the fbi documents that same day burr put in orders to sell nearly 110 000 in stock from his and his wife s brokerage accounts on feb 12 burr ordered the purchase of approximately 1 2 million of treasury securities using 76 of the total holdings in burr and his wife s joint account investors often purchase u s treasury funds to hedge against a potential market downturn the fbi special agent brandon merriman notes he also noted that the dow jones industrial average closed at a record high of 29 551 42 on feb 12 one day after burr s big treasury bill purchase burr and his wife unloaded equity shares worth approximately 1 1 million that the burrs sold stock was reported at the time but the value of the sale was only reported within a range monday s filing was the first time the exact amounts had been made public according to the fbi as a result of senator burr s sales on february 13 2020 his portfolio went from approximately 83 in equities to approximately 3 in equities a week later markets began a steep slide as investors panicked over the potential economic damage from the coronavirus gerald fauth the other person in burr s family who sold a lot of stock on feb 13 2020 was burr s brother in law gerald fauth according to the affidavit records show that a series of sell orders were placed into an account belonging to fauth s wife mary fauth just before noon on the 13th amounting to around 159 100 burr s attorney alice fisher told propublica in may of 2020 that burr did not coordinate his decision to trade on feb 13 with mr fauth but the fbi evidence released on monday shows that burr s wife called her brother shortly after 11 a m et on the 13th and they spoke for two minutes twenty minutes after that burr also used his cellphone to call fauth according to records obtained by the justice department just two minutes after fauth s conversation with his brother law ended fauth called his investment manager and they talked for just shy of half an hour in a later interview the adviser appears to have told the fbi that fauth sounded hurried and that he mentioned knowing a senator in washington according to the fbi the burrs stock sell orders were put in between 11 38 and 11 49 a m fauth s orders were put in between 11 55 a m and 11 58 a m mysterious text messages while the fbi affidavit sheds light on many of the questions surrounding burr s stock sales it closely protects at least one relevant piece of information what kind of nonpublic information burr had about the coronavirus and where he got it but there may be some clues specifically the justice department mentions dozens of text messages that burr exchanged with someone whose name is redacted but who appears to be a potential source of nonpublic information according to the fbi between jan 31 2020 and april 7 2020 this person and burr exchanged approximately 32 text messages nearly all of which concerned in one way or another the covid 19 pandemic nearly everything about the text messages is redacted but later in the affidavit the government writes those text messages include those discussed above and included ones regarding other issues such as efforts to provide face masks to the public the global outlook regarding covid 19 and a proposed national lockdown if burr was receiving this information when it wasn t being publicly discussed that could have strengthened the government s case against him it s still unclear why the justice department decided not to prosecute burr or fauth and the department does not typically explain the reasons why it does not prosecute someone but on jan 19 2021 nearly a year after the questionable trades burr said in a statement tonight the department of justice informed me that it has concluded its review of my personal financial transactions conducted early last year the case is now closed i m glad to hear it burr said my focus has been and will continue to be working for the people of north carolina during this difficult time for our nation

messages include those discussed above and included ones regarding other issues such as efforts to provide face masks to the public the global outlook regarding covid 19 and a proposed national lockdown if burr was receiving this information when it wasn t being publicly discussed that could have strengthened the government s case against him it s still unclear why the justice department decided not to prosecute burr or fauth and the department does not typically explain the reasons why it does not prosecute someone but on jan 19 2021 nearly a year after the questionable trades burr

relation to art today comics enjoy wide critical and academic acceptance organizers note but this respectability is only a few decades old literature classes now teach works such as maus and fun home the new york times reviews comics and publishes comics features scholars work both to chronicle comics long history and to describe the medium s grammar and methods american alternative comics 1980 2000 raw weirdo and beyond examines the 1980s and 1990s a transitional time for artistic comics when cartoonists sought to enlarge the medium s potential for artistry and self expression the influential magazine raw promoted comics as ambitious experimental art worthy of galleries and bookstores the anthology weirdo celebrated comics as an outsider form through self disclosive and often self critical narratives a new marketplace and a new generation of publishers and alternative newspapers produced work for a growing readership alternative comics are recognized as a progenitor of today s graphic novels widely studied in literature courses throughout the academy said inaugural robert l and judith t winston director of the mcmullen museum of art nancy netzer a bc professor of

new respectability especially under the labels of graphic novels and sequential art the exhibition is accompanied by a scholarly catalogue edited by the exhibition curators essayists from art historical literary and other fields focus on the role of influential editors and publishers as well as the strategies artists employed to encourage readers to take the art form seriously subjects include the aesthetics of raw and weirdo the punk influenced work of gary panter and the genre breaking work of the hernandez brothers the catalogue also includes recent annotated interviews with

both displayed in the exhibition to document chelsea s notoriously corrupt politicians the fires that raged through its aging housing stock and the celebrated firefighters who fought them long established businesses of european immigrants many of them jewish from eastern europe and the arrivals of immigrants from central america who enriched the city jarmak chronicles these changes in sharply observed portraits of residents lively vignettes of the city s youth and illustrations of community celebrations a testament to the central role a local paper played in the life of a vibrant and complex city according to organizers the opportunity to photograph chelsea was truly a gift given to me said jarmak i am thankful to the people of this city who supported and embraced my work every day at the chelsea record according to exhibition co curator ash anderson a boston college art history faculty member jarmak slyly draws on the intertwined histories of documentary and fine art

dead end in the eighties and nineties cartoonists experimented with form content and marketing by 2000 comics had gained a new respectability especially under the labels of graphic novels and sequential art the exhibition is accompanied by a scholarly catalogue edited by the exhibition curators essayists from art historical literary and other fields focus on the role of influential editors and publishers as well as the strategies artists employed to encourage readers to take the art form seriously subjects include the aesthetics of raw and weirdo the punk influenced work of gary panter

an ethics watchdog group says rep matt cartwright d pa is involved in a potential conflict of interest after visiting general electric s ge research facility in upstate new york last month and holds up to 15 000 in ge stock according to financial disclosures cartwright and rep paul tonko d ny went to ge research in niskayuna new york on august 17 where they toured the facility the schenectady based daily gazette s reported the reporter noted that the two congressmen left the research facility impressed by the work being done in areas such as hybrid electric aircraft propulsion and hydrogen fueled engines bringing cartwright to say there s going to be a revolution in the way people get around in the air over the next 10 or 15 years and you re going to see that revolution right here in schenectady referring to the ge research facility cropley also noted that the visit was cartwright s first time at the ge research facility though tonko is a regular guest and the two helped push through the inflation reduction act which did not help reduce inflation but included hundreds of billions of dollars to fight climate change in fact cartwright appeared to be so excited by his visit to the ge research facility that he later referenced the article on social media with a picture of the two lawmakers at the facility u s rep paul tonko d ny and i were invited to tour the niskayuna headquarters of ge research to learn about the posted by congressman matt cartwright on tuesday august 23 2022 furthermore the visit came just over a week after president joe biden signed the 280 billion creating helpful incentives to produce semiconductors chips act meant to boost domestic semiconductor production ge which reuters reports to be a semiconductor consumer is part of the semiconductors in america coalition siac the coalition penned a letter to congressional leadership on july 28 2021 calling on congress to support funding for incentives for semiconductor manufacturing and increased semiconductor research at ge research semiconductor engineers and physicists tackle the most challenging problems involved when developing commercial devices and systems by applying their expertise in semiconductor device physics device process integration and device testing the company s website states cartwright who is up for reelection this year and voted for the chips legislation holds up to 15 000 in ge stock according to financial disclosures filed on august 15 the federal election commission records show that he has also received 9 000 in campaign contributions from ge political action committees since december 2015 and open secrets reports that the company has been one of tonko s largest donors over the past 15 years cartwright s office did not return a request for comment when asked by breitbart news about the potential conflict of interest around his trip to the upstate new york facility his stock holdings in the company and receiving thousands of dollars in campaign contributions kendra arnold the executive director of the federal government ethics watchdog foundation for accountability and civic trust fact told breitbart news anytime a member takes official action that could impact their personal finances it raises conflict of interest concerns given his specific position in congress and stock holdings there are legitimate concerns arnold added in fact the watchdog group previously dubbed cartwright one of the worst ethics violators of 2019 in a december 2019 press release fact stated that it filed a complaint regarding cartwright with the office of congressional ethics the complaint maintains that cartwright improperly sponsored legislation that would require commercial truck drivers to purchase insurance liability coverage at a 600 hike from the current amount notably cartwright was previously an attorney with a pennsylvania law firm that specializes in personal injury cases involving commercial trucks and advertises itself as the nation s leading truck accident team cartwright s wife marion munley is currently a partner with that firm and both cartwright and his wife have profit sharing agreements with munley law together valued between 2 million and 10 million the many facts in this case show cartwright could not have acted impartially when sponsoring legislation and impugns the integrity of government action in response to all of this cartwright s republican general election opponent jim bognet s campaign called the democrat one of the most corrupt members of congress adding that this latest conflict of interest is just another one in a long line of ethical lapses it s no secret that matt cartwright has a pattern of abusing his power bognet campaign spokesperson kate constantini added from introducing legislation that hurt trucking companies to put money in his families law firm s pocket to selling his office by filming commercials for a top donor in his actual congressional office matt cartwright has always put himself over his constituents last month cartwright was also involved in an ethics scandal when he was seen in a commercial praising his top donor s law firm after he was filmed talking about his newly passed bill about water contamination at camp lejeune members of congress are forbidden to use official taxpayer funded resources to promote themselves for commercial or campaign purposes and cartwright was seen in the video clip praising the multi million dollar law firm parker waichman and a partner jerry parker for their representation of u s servicemen and family members affected by water contamination at marine corps base camp lejeune axios explained parker and his wife have donated the maximum legal amount to the congressman s campaign breitbart news added shortly after the television ad began running cartwright s congressional office sent parker a cease and desist letter on august 9 demanding the firm stop using the clips of him in their advertising and promotional material for the firm axios reported that parker responded to cartwright with an apology calling the firm s move to make the television commercial an overreach and said he is genuinely sorry for any trouble this has caused him the letter from parter noted that the firm s marketing team posted the video to our website and used an excerpt in a television commercial and confirmed that the congressman never authorized the use of his comments however regardless of what the congressman s office and donor stated there are strict ethics rules against lawmakers using taxpayer funded resources for commercial ventures in fact the house ethics manual mentions that communications whether they be private political or commercial use should not be used to indicate an official sponsorship or endorsement in fact the functional government initiative an organization dedicated to improving the american public s awareness about the officials decisions and priorities of their government said on social media that they intended at the time to file an ethics complaint against the congressman nick gilbertson is a reporter for breitbart news write to him at ngilbertson

as has been the case over the past several years the president s newly released budgetary policies addressing homeownership now combined with efforts to contain the damage caused by the collapse of the subprime mortgage market are somewhat disconnected from the financial market factors and the lender borrower behavior that contributed to the mortgage and housing market collapse now underway on the one hand the president s budget proposes to spend 215 million on several borrower owner counseling programs to help keep troubled homeowners in their homes and out of foreclosure while on the other hand it proposes to further loosen federal housing administration fha mortgage lending underwriting standards in ways that discourage households from adopting financially responsible savings and borrowing practices combining the two conflicting components the overall tilt of the proposal is toward financial irresponsibility a better approach would be to encourage a return to more traditional underwriting practices that require borrowers to have an equity stake in their homes the federal government should also link any mortgage assistance to an end to onerous local land use regulations that have caused much of the home price inflation in recent years a nation in debt as for the counseling plans the presumption is that it will help borrowers overcome instances of innumeracy that led some to commit to monthly spending and debt service obligations exceeding their monthly income such counseling would also advise them of the importance of paying their bills on time and teach them to prioritize spending obligations and choices i e meeting the monthly mortgage payment should take precedence over the acquisition of a big screen tv such a focus may be timely macroeconomic data reveal that earlier in this decade american consumers engaged in a massive collective shift from accumulating assets through savings to accumulating debt through borrowing thereby leaving them with little or no degree of freedom to deal with even minor financial setbacks although analysts are still learning about the many factors that contributed to the subprime problems a growing body of evidence suggests that a great many households engaged in a degree of risky financial behavior that is without precedent in the nation s economic history for starters at some point in the early part of this decade households on average stopped saving money and instead embarked on a debt fueled binge of consumer spending including the acquisition of homes that many could not otherwise afford in the absence of excessive debt from 1970 to 1989 each year americans saved more than 9 percent of their personal income in the 1990s the savings rate fell by almost half to a little over 5 percent and since 2000 it has averaged 1 6 percent in 2005 and 2006 the savings rate fell below 1 percent because these savings rates also include contributions to 401 k plans and other retirement savings programs which represent funds unavailable for current spending purposes the discretionary household savings rate including money that could be used for a downpayment on a house or for an unexpected expenditure would have been substantially negative in recent years with the nation awash in easy credit and with many mortgage lenders willing to provide subprime mortgage loans and or risky second mortgages that obviated the need for any downpayment households had little incentive to save and began to spend more than they earned at the same time car loans credit card debt and equity lines of credit became available on similarly generous terms further undermining incentives to save while enhancing a household s ability to spend rewarding irresponsible behavior under the circumstances the most appropriate federal response would be to propose policies aimed at restoring personal responsibility and financial independence instead the administration seems intent on enlarging the share of the mortgage market that it controls by way of the federal housing administration fha mortgage insurance program and doing so by offering more attractive credit terms similar to the underwriting deficiencies heretofore limited to the subprime market hud s fiscal year fy 2009 budget request reads as follows eliminate the current statutory 3 percent minimum downpayment reducing a significant barrier to homeownership fha s existing downpayment requirement does not meet the demands of today s market place in which most first time homebuyers put down 2 percent or less reform would enable the fha to offer a greater variety of downpayment options this is not the first time the administration has proposed legislation to reduce the downpayment required on fha mortgages the american dream downpayment act passed in late 2003 provided 200 million per year in taxpayer funded downpayment grants to eligible fha borrowers the president s fy 2009 budget request seeks another 50 million for the program and proposes ending the 3 percent requirement at the same time that these reductions in fha underwriting standards are being proposed fha in 2007 iii experienced a default rate of 13 52 percent compared to 3 25 percent for prime mortgages and 16 68 percent for subprime loans under the circumstances any further diminution in fha credit standards could boost fha default rates to that experienced by subprime loans given the consequences of the turmoil in the subprime market a proposal emulating some of its diminished underwriting standards would be the wrong way to go unfortunately the proposed fha reforms would reward bad decision making beyond the household level also rewarded would be communities that have engaged in counterproductive planning exclusionary zoning and smart growth practices and have abused the property rights of their citizens in order to limit community access to those with substantial wealth and income as a consequence of the land shortages caused by these practices home prices have soared in many communities the budget request for hud reads increase and simplify fha s loan limits fha s loan limit in high cost areas like california and the northeast would rise from 87 to 100 percent of the government sponsored enterprise gse conforming loan limit california of course is the least affordable market in the nation largely because of four decades of abusive zoning practices and smart growth strategies designed to limit development as a consequence the median priced home in los angeles 588 000 is equal to 11 5 times the income of the median household in the area compared to just 2 8 times the median income in atlanta where property rights abuses are much less severe indeed a recently published housing affordability survey of the united states the united kingdom ireland new zealand and australia found that five of the least affordable housing markets were in california some california metropolitan areas have experienced significant subprime usage and mortgage default rates because many middle income households were forced to take on heavy debt loads to achieve the american dream of homeownership because of the heavy regulation it imposes on land use practices california s homeownership rate was 60 2 percent in 2006 compared to 68 8 nationwide only two other states in the nation hawaii and new york had a lower homeownership rate in effect the president is proposing to substantially expand the scope and intrusion of the federal government into the nation s mortgage market for no other reason than to accommodate the home price inflation induced by decades of property rights abuses in a dozen or so metropolitan areas a better solution and one consistent with the market principles espoused by this administration would be to link the availability of any concessions in federal mortgage programs with substantive deregulation of land use practices in high cost areas conclusion while the president is to be commended for attempting to address the many problems caused by the subprime turmoil a better approach would be to link the availability of federal mortgage assistance to meaningful land use deregulation and to recreate a mortgage market that encourages individual financial responsibility as opposed to the incentives for profligacy embodied in current practices ronald d utt ph d is

the clinton administration is pressuring congress to appropriate an additional 18 billion in funding for the international monetary fund imf supporters of this increase believe that the imf is a necessary tool to stabilize markets establish strong and stable currencies solve the recent asian financial crisis and open foreign markets to trade however not one of these claims is accurate instead countries in asia that have not depended on the imf for assistance have been less affected by the financial crisis and are recovering either more quickly or at least as well moreover the imf s track record both in stabilizing economies and currencies and in promoting trade is disappointing many imf policies such as currency devaluation are not likely to stabilize the economies of countries in crisis and its lending practices are no substitute for fast track negotiating authority and free trade historically instead of helping u s farmers market their products to imf recipients the fund s recommendations and loans by themselves have been far more likely to work against u s exports if congress is interested in promoting sound policies that bolster agricultural exports it should support fast track trade negotiating authority for the president and the efforts of organizations like the world trade organization wto members of congress should oppose further funding of organizations like the imf that have failed to demonstrate the ability to promote economic stability and economic growth the imf s impact on agricultural exports myth 1 the imf is a necessary tool to stabilize markets in financial crisis and this helps to maintain market share for u s exports supporters of the international monetary fund believe that it is uniquely positioned to bring market stability to economies in crisis for example dean kleckner president of the american farm bureau federation recently testified before congress that u s agriculture s ability to gain and maintain market share is based on many factors including the ability to utilize market stabilizing tools such as a properly functioning imf reality the imf is more likely to undermine the market than to bring it stability the very possibility of receiving an imf rescue package creates what economists call a moral hazard bailouts shield investors and politicians from the consequences of poor decisions by socializing risks spreading them across a bigger constituency and thus reducing the costs associated with each failed investment many people end up paying for an investor s errors the costs of failure for the investor are reduced and either directly or indirectly the imf compensates investors when their plans fail imf bailouts encourage speculation of the sort that investors probably would avoid if the imf were not around to shield them from failure bailouts also signal governments that they will not have to bear the costs of failing to reform their economies instead the imf will pay the price of their inaction thus imf activities neither prevent nor cure financial crises they only encourage them the administration has portrayed imf funding as a way to avoid or mitigate the consequences of the asian crisis for u s agricultural exports according to august schumacher jr under secretary for farm and agricultural services at the u s department of agriculture the recovery of u s agricultural exports will depend on the success of imf led efforts however an imf bailout is more likely to work against increasing u s agricultural exports to asia and it may even aid the industry s foreign competitors for example indonesia south korea and thailand are the sources of about 8 5 percent of the agricultural fish and forestry products imported by the united states in fy 1997 indonesia and thailand in fact imported only 1 4 billion of u s agricultural fish and forestry products but they exported 4 5 billion of these products to the united states in 1997 giving these two countries a 3 1 billion trade surplus with the united states on agricultural fish and forestry products this trade surplus is likely to worsen in the wake of the asian financial crisis regardless of imf assistance while trade deficits by themselves are neither good nor bad they do serve as a barometer of trade relations imf assistance will further worsen the u s trade deficit by aiding foreign competitors of the u s agricultural industry myth 2 imf financial assistance is vital for countries trying to establish strong stable currencies supporters of imf funding argue that unstable foreign currencies subject to devaluation can be stabilized with imf assistance for example some 40 agricultural groups and companies argued in a february 1998 letter to members of congress that we are concerned that if the imf does not have sufficient funds to intervene in any future crisis there will be further devaluation in asian currencies reality the imf does not promote strong stable currencies one of the fund s most common economic prescriptions is currency devaluation which often undermines investor confidence and can lead to economic crisis this is precisely what has happened in asia according to business week imf managing director michel camdessus said that he had personally visited indonesia the philippines south korea and thailand numerous times to urge them to devalue their currencies the end result was the successive devaluation of the region s currencies as a wall street journal editorial put it what began as an imf program for stability turned into round after round of competitive devaluation although some of the countries recovering from the asian crisis received imf assistance there is no convincing evidence that imf assistance is necessary or even likely to help countries stabilize their currencies currency stability is much more dependent on a government s economic policies countries with sound economic policies are more resistant to financial crises a fact clearly demonstrated by the relatively minor impact that the asian crisis had on hong kong singapore and taiwan once a crisis has occurred countries must act immediately to address the crisis and implement reform to restore investor confidence korea and thailand took such steps albeit with imf assistance and apparently have arrested the crisis however imf assistance is no guarantee of success nor is it sufficient or necessary to restore investor confidence for example indonesia has received imf assistance yet it remains in crisis because of its resistance to the sort of reform that would restore investor confidence its first two agreements with the imf it is now on its third in eight months failed to rally investor confidence either in indonesia or in the rupiah indeed it was the failure of the suharto government to adopt reform and the failure of private debtors to negotiate with international creditors that failed to restore confidence despite the imf s assistance according to a standard poor s official a resolution of the debt problem and suharto s rededication to other economic reforms are the only things that can save indonesia worse the imf actually works against currency stability when indonesia indicated that it was willing to take independent action to stabilize its economy by announcing its intention to establish a currency board the value of the indonesian rupiah climbed about 30 percent against the dollar however when the imf forced indonesia to abandon this plan the value of the rupiah collapsed at the same time malaysia has restored relative stability to its currency and restored investor confidence without imf assistance for example national power of great britain recently announced a 125 million investment in the malaysian power company malakoff dhl worldwide express plans to invest nearly 27 million to expand its operations in malaysia ericsson a swedish telecommunications company announced that it will invest about 11 million to set up a regional communications hub in malaysia and u s insurer american international group announced a 10 million joint venture software company that will work closely with malaysia s multimedia the imf policy of devaluation is likely to hurt u s agricultural exports because rapid reductions in a country s currency values all else being equal result in more exports for that country and fewer imports for example when a country s currency loses 25 percent of its value its exports become about 25 percent cheaper and imports from all other countries are about 25 percent more expensive the result the country whose currency was devalued will export more and import less in real terms imf policies have made u s exports to indonesia thailand and south korea more expensive than they were before the fund s involvement according to the u s department of agriculture the value of u s agricultural exports is projected to be 2 percent less than in 1997 even assuming a relatively quick recovery in asia myth 3 the recovery of asia depends on imf assistance advocates of increased imf funding often argue that president clinton s 18 billion request for imf funding is needed to help asian economies recover to prevent the spread of the financial crisis and to prevent the recurrence of a similar crisis in other parts of the globe for example an iowa farm bureau press release states that the united states must take immediate action to stabilize the asian financial crisis by providing additional funding to the international monetary fund imf the american farm bureau federation stated that imf led assistance programs are critical to the overall recovery in the region reality countries with little or no reliance on imf loans have been less affected by the recent financial crisis in asia or are recovering at least as well as countries that received an imf bailout although hong kong singapore and taiwan were affected by the asian crisis they have no dealings with the imf and appear to be weathering the problems in asia better than their imf assisted neighbors in fact it is because these countries have pursued wise economic policies that they were largely unaffected by the financial crisis taiwan for example remains independent of the imf and continues to grow a recent heritage analysis observed that as stock markets plummeted during 1997 in thailand indonesia and korea by 55 52 and 42 percent respectively the stock market in taiwan grew by 18 percent in addition the prime lending rate the price of capital and a direct indication of risk in hong kong singapore and taiwan remains lower than in other asian nations 10 percent 7 5 percent and 7 65 percent respectively malaysia indonesia south korea and thailand were hit particularly hard by the asian crisis malaysia weathered the financial storm as well as south korea and thailand and better than indonesia despite being the only one of these countries to refuse imf loans the malaysian ringgit has remained steadier and stronger in value in relation to the u s dollar than the indonesian rupiah the south korean won and the thai baht and malaysia maintains its prime lending rate of 12 percent compared to 36 percent 11 5 percent and 14 75 percent respectively in indonesia south korea and thailand the evidence indicates that pursuit of the sound economic policies not imf assistance is the key to withstanding financial crisis and maintaining economic growth myth 4 the imf is a good tool to open foreign markets particularly since the president s request for fast track authority has not been granted supporters of the imf often argue that since congress failed to provide president clinton with fast track trade negotiating authority the imf is uniquely positioned to help liberalize and open foreign markets to u s exports according to the iowa farm bureau for example a u s contribution to the imf of 18 billion will not only help rebuild foreign economies but keep u s farmers at the trade table as the absence of fast track legislation continues reality neither the imf nor an 18 billion funding increase is an effective substitute for fast track authority and free trade the agricultural industry in general understands the importance of trade liberalizing policies such as fast track authority and free trade and the effectiveness of the world trade organization the lack of fast track negotiating authority threatens the expansion of market share for u s agricultural exports abroad however the imf is not a viable alternative to traditional trade liberalizing vehicles according to under secretary schumacher u s farm and food products can face tariffs of 100 200 and 300 percent or more in some markets our own import duties average less than 5 percent while bound agricultural tariffs worldwide average around 56 percent e need to get these high bound tariffs down further the agricultural industry is understandably concerned that the lack of fast track authority will prevent any progress in reducing these barriers to u s agricultural exports and impede trade liberalization globally however supporting free trade is not the imf s primary goal and recipients of imf aid typically are the most egregious abusers of trade barriers according to research conducted at the heritage foundation the average tariff rate for imf loan recipients is more than 17 percent over five times higher than the average tariff rate of the countries in the european union and japan for example thailand south korea and indonesia received over 35 billion from the imf in the recent asian bailout yet they collectively maintain an average tariff rate of 11 percent over five times higher than japan s and nearly four times greater than tariff rates of members of the european union bangladesh has received five loans totaling 1 125 billion from the imf since 1983 yet it has maintained an average tariff rate of around 50 percent for most of this period india received two loans totaling 2 86 billion from the imf in 1991 and 1992 yet it has maintained an average tariff rate of over 30 percent for most of this period pakistan has received five loans totaling over 3 billion from the imf since 1989 yet it has maintained an average tariff rate of around 47 percent for most of this period by comparison the 15 countries of the european union maintain an average tariff rate of 3 6 percent japan has an average tariff rate of less than 2 percent and hong kong has an average tariff rate of 0 1 percent portugal is the only one of these 17 countries to receive an imf loan in the past 15 years its 1984 loan was for about 600 million non tariff barriers to trade among imf recipients are extremely high and also work to keep u s exports out of these countries based on data compiled and analyzed for the heritage foundation wall street journal 1998 index of economic freedom most non tariff barriers among imf recipients include but are not limited to import bans and quotas corrupt customs officials unnecessary licensing and labeling requirements and unrealistic health and sanitary requirements aimed specifically at keeping out u s exports including agricultural products the index analysis also indicates that these non tariff barriers are more prevalent among imf recipients than non recipients the imf was created in 1944 by the bretton woods agreement along with the world bank and the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt which is now the world trade organization gatt not the imf was created to promote free trade consequently the imf has been ill equipped to deal with trade liberalization issues historically even when the imf has attempted to promote trade liberalization its efforts have been largely ineffectual this makes its assistance more likely to reward countries that have high barriers to trade with loans than to encourage them to lower their barriers to levels maintained by the united states europe or japan

term in an employment contract and the answer is maybe but maybe not it depends on the other side s proclivities perceptions personality and thought process and your ability and willingness to negotiate demand implore never underestimate your opponent is an ol adage from life s playing fields one that many of us constantly relearn in business an equally important aphorism never

appeals court says nc fisheries challenge can continue appeals court says nc fisheries challenge can continue photo mgn bass pro shops youtube raleigh nc ap coastal recreational anglers can keep suing the state of north carolina over accusations that government regulators have devastated near shore fishing stocks in violation of the state constitution the state court of appeals ruled tuesday the coastal conservation association of north carolina and more than 80 individuals sued the state in 2020 alleging it had failed its fiduciary duty to protect the state s fisheries from overfishing their complaint cited constitutional provisions giving people the right to hunt and fish and making it the state s policy to conserve and protect its lands and waters for the benefit of all its citizenry the constitutional right to hunt fish and harvest wildlife was approved by voters in november 2018 the conserve and protect language cited in the lawsuit was added to the constitution in 1972 in particular the anglers blamed the state division of marine fisheries and state marine fisheries commission for allowing excessive for profit commercial fishing and certain fishing methods that they say have led to dramatic declines in certain fish stocks since 1997 the plaintiffs want a court to declare violations have occurred and to force the state to make changes superior court judge bryan collins refused last year to dismiss the lawsuit he rejected arguments by state department of justice attorneys that individual rights haven t been violated in the challenged constitutional provisions which in part only clarifies state policies and functions the state attorneys also said the state hasn t waived sovereign immunity which exempts state government from lawsuits unless an agency consents to be sued the state appealed collins ruling court of appeals judge toby hampson wrote tuesday that state courts hadn t previously ruled until now whether sovereign immunity bars someone from suing to enforce the state s public trust obligations the public trust doctrine states that natural resources are held in the government s trust to benefit current and future generations but hampton said a review of north carolina law by the three judge panel hearing the case determines that sovereign immunity doesn t bar such claims the doctrine of sovereign immunity will not stand as a barrier to north carolina citizens who seek to remedy violations of their rights guaranteed under the north carolina constitution hampson wrote in the unanimous opinion and he said the plaintiffs alleged wrongs the inability to protect public waters and to carry out the right to harvest fish can t be addressed through any other means the coastal conservation association of north carolina praised tuesday s decision which also was agreed to by court of appeals judge hunter murphy and april wood we look forward to proving our case on the merits and ensuring that sustainable coastal fisheries will be there for our children and grandchildren david sneed the group s executive director said in a statement division of marine fisheries spokesperson patricia smith said state attorneys were reviewing tuesday s decision and considering whether to appeal it to the state supreme court the complaint was filed in november 2020 it said fisheries regulators have continued to allow and even facilitated several commercial fishing practices that result in substantial wastage of coastal fish stocks or their prey species or result in critical habitat destruction those practices included shrimp trawling in estuarine waters heavily populated by young fish unattended gill nets and chronic overfishing of popular species according to the association fish stocks that have declined markedly include weakfish atlantic croaker and river herring the conservation group says

british foreign secretary and conservative leadership candidate liz truss arrives for the announcement of britain s next prime minister at the queen elizabeth ii centre in london britain sept 5 2022 we have a reasonably clear idea of what liz truss the new british prime minister would like to do but the real question is whether circumstances will allow her to pursue the path she appeared to make clear during the long campaign to become the next leader of the conservative party and the country truss played to the tory party membership emphatically during the campaign evoking memories of the margaret thatcher era when the former leader presided over a highly liberal economic agenda to supposedly unleash the private sector to drive a more prosperous britain given the never ending popularity of the thatcher legacy among the tory grassroots it was an effective strategy to get herself elected even if it meant ignoring many of the realities of the day truss desire appears to be for a traditional right of center cutting taxes both for income earners and businesses approach with reduced regulation to supposedly unleash the private sector to deliver stronger economic growth and to deliberately allow for yet another period an expansive fiscal policy to help achieve these goals it is conceptually quite ambitious but may run into considerable difficulties the most immediate difficulty is of course the huge rise in gas prices and the enormous pressure on the cost of living indeed in the final days of the campaign truss strongly indicated that she will introduce policies to help avert the worse of any future gas price increases with even talk of an across the board freeze for a year on the weekend she made it clear that she will announce her specific package on energy prices within a week if it were to involve a freeze this could cost the government as much as 100 billion 115 65 billion if implemented for a year threatening her other apparent commitments including some of her desired plans on taxes the fortnight before the end of the leadership race was interesting in view of the renewed focus on the us federal reserve s tightening policy financial markets are paying increasing attention to the inflation challenge again and have specifically singled out the united kingdom as looking a bit lax compared with both the united states and the eurozone as can be seen by the combined underperformance of the pound sterling and the uk gilt prices it will be fascinating to see if this continues into the early days of truss leadership as this itself could both add to the likelihood of more intense inflationary challenges and with it a more aggressive bank of england in terms of tightening monetary policy one would hope that truss s advisers are aware of all of these risks so perhaps they may roll back some of their intended policies to allow for markets to digest the energy support package not least because if the talk of a price freeze is correct inflation could peak much earlier than many recent forecasts which could allow a different mood to appear both in the markets and media commentary in the uk this said truss appears to be quite committed to honouring the desires of traditional tory voters and this means at some stage she will have to deliver on them and given that a general election is legally required to be held in not much more than two years the fact that the party membership retains a huge affection for previous prime minister boris johnson and that tory mp s did not really support her leadership bid truss has to tread a very fine line to remain a respected leader of the conservatives and the emboldened opposition labour party obviously won t make life easy for her there is a broader economic issue that will remain a big talking point beyond the immediate challenges not least because truss has frequently described the preferred economic policies of the past 20 years as failing to facilitate stronger economic growth including what she describes as policies based on redistribution this in my view is an even bigger risky strategy for her to pursue because it isn t really accurate the earlier conservative government she had been part of presided over a significant reduction in government spending and lower corporate taxes policies she claims to prefer and while under the 2015 government of david cameron the conservatives accelerated the earliest of policies focused on devolving policies around england it was modest and coincided with significant spending cuts for many local authorities and while johnson talked endlessly about levelling up his government didn t really commit vast redistributive resources to this endeavour at the same time because of his popularity he created a strong enough impression that it was serious that s how the tories won the last election and if there is now a leader opposed to the pursuit of these policies then he or she may not be in power beyond 2025 or even earlier at the end of the day the uk faces the same challenge as every other country as well as one related to its unique geographical productivity factor long term economic growth is driven by the number of people that work and their productivity the uk is already close to its lowest unemployment rate in nearly 50 years so unless it can significantly boost its woeful productivity it will not be able to generate sustained low inflation growth the productivity of london and the southeast is among the strongest in europe it is the rest of the country that does truly need levelling up in terms of productivity yet it seems unlikely that the new uk leader will reverse her stated priorities and truly deal with this aspect as for relations with china truss once a proud advocate of importing the best of chinese maths teaching standards is likely to support the growing popular voices of caution against all things chinese which when it comes back to economics is not likely to help her other economic ambitions the author is a leading british economist and former commercial secretary to the uk treasury the views don t necessarily reflect those of china daily if you have a specific

after two years of lawsuits a court finally unsealed key evidence from the fbi s 2020 investigation of north carolina sen richard burr for allegedly trading stocks based on nonpublic information public records at the time show that burr abruptly liquidated more than half of his and his wife s equity holdings in february of 2020 when most of the world had yet to focus on the looming coronavirus crisis burr was ultimately not charged with breaking any laws but the newly released records show fbi agents believed burr had committed insider trading and securities fraud the most compelling new evidence is the flurry of calls and texts between burr his wife brooke burr her brother gerald fauth and fauth s wife that took place on the same days that both the fauths and the burrs sold off hundreds of thousands of dollars of stock right before the market plunged washington newly unsealed fbi documents paint a vivid picture of the government s evidence in a 2020 insider trading investigation of north carolina s senior senator republican richard burr burr was ultimately not charged with breaking any laws but the newly released sworn affidavit of an fbi special agent shows that the justice department had probable cause to believe that burr had committed insider trading and securities fraud as chair of the senate intelligence committee burr in february 2020 abruptly liquidated more than half of his and his wife s equity holdings at a time when u s markets and most americans did not yet know how bad the coronavirus pandemic was going to be get dfw local news weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc dfw newsletters given his position burr had information about the virus spread and about america s meager preparation for a massive pandemic that was not available to the public the affidavit was submitted in support of a search warrant application to seize and search burr s phone one that the judge in the case later granted it lays out a startling timeline of calls and texts between burr his wife brooke burr her brother gerald fauth and fauth s wife that took place on the same days that both the fauths and the burrs sold off hundreds of thousands of dollars of stock right before the market plunged a spokesperson in burr s senate office did not respond to a request for comment on the newly unsealed documents an unusual timeline from the start burr has insisted that the only information he relied upon in deciding to sell his stocks was publicly available including reports by cnbc correspondents in asia nonetheless as chair of the senate intelligence committee burr was given access to classified intelligence reports in january and early february that contained dire warnings about the coronavirus on jan 31 burr received nonpublic information from a source whose name is redacted in the fbi documents that same day burr put in orders to sell nearly 110 000 in stock from his and his wife s brokerage accounts on feb 12 burr ordered the purchase of approximately 1 2 million of treasury securities using 76 of the total holdings in burr and his wife s joint account investors often purchase u s treasury funds to hedge against a potential market downturn the fbi special agent brandon merriman notes he also noted that the dow jones industrial average closed at a record high of 29 551 42 on feb 12 one day after burr s big treasury bill purchase burr and his wife unloaded equity shares worth approximately 1 1 million that the burrs sold stock was reported at the time but the value of the sale was only reported within a range monday s filing was the first time the exact amounts had been made public according to the fbi as a result of senator burr s sales on february 13 2020 his portfolio went from approximately 83 in equities to approximately 3 in equities a week later markets began a steep slide as investors panicked over the potential economic damage from the coronavirus gerald fauth the other person in burr s family who sold a lot of stock on feb 13 2020 was burr s brother in law gerald fauth according to the affidavit records show that a series of sell orders were placed into an account belonging to fauth s wife mary fauth just before noon on the 13th amounting to around 159 100 burr s attorney alice fisher told propublica in may of 2020 that burr did not coordinate his decision to trade on feb 13 with mr fauth but the fbi evidence released on monday shows that burr s wife called her brother shortly after 11 a m et on the 13th and they spoke for two minutes twenty minutes after that burr also used his cellphone to call fauth according to records obtained by the justice department just two minutes after fauth s conversation with his brother law ended fauth called his investment manager and they talked for just shy of half an hour in a later interview the adviser appears to have told the fbi that fauth sounded hurried and that he mentioned knowing a senator in washington according to the fbi the burrs stock sell orders were put in between 11 38 and 11 49 a m fauth s orders were put in between 11 55 a m and 11 58 a m mysterious text messages while the fbi affidavit sheds light on many of the questions surrounding burr s stock sales it closely protects at least one relevant piece of information what kind of nonpublic information burr had about the coronavirus and where he got it but there may be some clues specifically the justice department mentions dozens of text messages that burr exchanged with someone whose name is redacted but who appears to be a potential source of nonpublic information according to the fbi between jan 31 2020 and april 7 2020 this person and burr exchanged approximately 32 text messages nearly all of which concerned in one way or another the covid 19 pandemic nearly everything about the text messages is redacted but later in the affidavit the government writes those text messages include those discussed above and included ones regarding other issues such as efforts to provide face masks to the public the global outlook regarding covid 19 and a proposed national lockdown if burr was receiving this information when it wasn t being publicly discussed that could have strengthened the government s case against him it s still unclear why the justice department decided not to prosecute burr or fauth and the department does not typically explain the reasons why it does not prosecute someone but on jan 19 2021 nearly a year after the questionable trades burr said in a statement tonight the department of justice informed me that it has concluded its review of my personal financial transactions conducted early last year the case is now closed i m glad to hear it burr said my focus has been and will continue to be working for the people of north carolina during this difficult time for our nation

new york city is facing its most severe budget woes in decades according to budget watchdogs who on tuesday sounded the alarm on several fiscal dilemmas looming on the horizon the watchdogs along with gov hochul and mayor adams convened at a state financial control board hearing tuesday morning to determine whether the city s budget would pass muster with the board the board approved the city s spending plan but during the hearing both state comptroller thomas dinapoli and city comptroller brad lander pointed out that new york is looking at nearly 10 billion in budget shortfalls in the years ahead mayor eric adams provides remarks to the new york state financial control board on the fiscal year 2023 adopted budget and financial plan in manhattan on tuesday sept 6 2022 those gaps are expected thanks to dwindling federal relief money that began flowing to the city due to covid 19 a cooling off of the stock market that s hurting city pension funds and a projected decrease in city tax revenue as a result dinapoli predicted the city could face a 9 9 billion budget gap by 2026 these are the risks that are straightforward to quantify dinapoli said the city also faces risks that are more difficult to quantify with certainty but they too could be substantial one of those risks is a recession which would send city revenue plummeting while simultaneously putting pressure on the city to put more money into its social safety net for struggling new yorkers the last two recessions led to revenues dropping by 4 2 and 5 9 if something similar were to happen in the near future that could mean a hit to the budget of between 3 billion and 4 5 billion on top of the 9 9 billion shortfall projected for 2026 the uncertainty which adams acknowledged tuesday as all too real is offset by healthy fiscal reserves the city has socked away and that can be tapped in an emergency mayor eric adams provides remarks to the new york state financial control board on the fiscal year 2023 adopted budget and financial plan at the governor s office in manhattan on tuesday sept 6 2022 e j mcmahon a longtime policy analyst with the manhattan institute acknowledged that those reserves are a very good thing but he also suggested that the risks might now outweigh what s been done to prepare for them he noted that the projected 9 9 billion shortfall is the biggest the city has faced since 2002 immediately after 9 11 i don t think they ve ever had credible projections of so much downside risk he said the 8 billion in reserves basically enough reserves to fully cover all the risks if you don t count a recession and pay hike what it means is you have credible risks that are enough to simply drain the entire amount the financial control board was created in the 1970s after the city was rocked by a fiscal crisis since then the board has rubber stamped the city s budget in what has typically amounted to a pro forma affair each year that process could become more complicated if fiscal conditions worsen for the city dinapoli also alluded to the city s budget dance on education funding a controversy that recently wound up in court as not being the best signal for adams and the city council to send to lenders it may soon come to rely on more if the city s financial risks start to become reality new york comptroller tom dinapoli speaks during the new york state democratic convention in new york thursday feb 17 2022 the city cut the education budget due to a reduction in federal funding pegged to school population but council members many of whom approved that spending plan later voiced regrets after much public outcry that eventually led to the plan winding up in court in recent months questions over the budgetary process the rationale behind the set aside of surplus and the use of federal money has highlighted the often understated importance of fiscal planning consistency and transparency dinapoli said to the board these tenets of good fiscal governance were fundamental components of the financial emergency act during another period of uncertainty for the city many years ago which set it off on a path of renewed economic and fiscal strength the city should think long and hard about those lessons now and show the will to further systematize its reserve policy and other procedures dinapoli suggested that such policy refinements would provide additional confidence to credit markets

along with other factors is likely to lead to a financial crisis mei warned the fed s policy will inevitably affect international capital flows raising the cost of financing african countries need to maintain economic activities thus affecting their recovery from the covid 19 pandemic charles onunaiju director of the abuja based center for china studies in nigeria told xinhua news agency the long term u s dollar hegemony has made african economies tie their key economic fundamentals and foreign trade to the currency he said adding this means the u s could transfer inflationary pressure to these countries through its domestic monetary policy one of the challenges that economies in nigeria and africa at large face is inflationary pressure they are all imported inflationary pressures arising from the hegemony of the dollar as a major currency of exchange onunaiju said according to malhar nabar a division chief with the imf s research department emerging economies that have borrowed heavily in u s dollars could find themselves in a difficult position he told xinhua that for those who are already mired in debt if they cannot meet debt service obligations that will create wider problems the volatile international situation plus energy and food crises have already led to social and political instability in some developing countries zhong echoed adding that debt problems in some of them may even deteriorate and result in social disorderâ a vicious cycle risk averse sentiment will rise in the face of a u s economic slowdown or recession josua pardede chief economist at indonesia s permata bank told xinhua adding such sentiment will lead to capital outflows from the financial market particularly in the bond market the shock in the u s economy will drag down the global economy and global trade volume will also decline he said adding that the export performance of indonesia and some other developing countries will go down given the u s is their main trading partner the spillover effects also include stock market volatility currency depreciation rising cost of imported raw materials and other challenges for many emerging markets according to experts all countries including china should remain highly vigilant to the potential impacts on their exports due to u s economic recession and possible capital outflows as the fed has reaffirmed plans for an

british foreign secretary and conservative leadership candidate liz truss arrives for the announcement of britain s next prime minister at the queen elizabeth ii centre in london britain sept 5 2022 we have a reasonably clear idea of what liz truss the new british prime minister would like to do but the real question is whether circumstances will allow her to pursue the path she appeared to make clear during the long campaign to become the next leader of the conservative party and the country truss played to the tory party membership emphatically during the campaign evoking memories of the margaret thatcher era when the former leader presided over a highly liberal economic agenda to supposedly unleash the private sector to drive a more prosperous britain given the never ending popularity of the thatcher legacy among the tory grassroots it was an effective strategy to get herself elected even if it meant ignoring many of the realities of the day truss desire appears to be for a traditional right of center cutting taxes both for income earners and businesses approach with reduced regulation to supposedly unleash the private sector to deliver stronger economic growth and to deliberately allow for yet another period an expansive fiscal policy to help achieve these goals it is conceptually quite ambitious but may run into considerable difficulties the most immediate difficulty is of course the huge rise in gas prices and the enormous pressure on the cost of living indeed in the final days of the campaign truss strongly indicated that she will introduce policies to help avert the worse of any future gas price increases with even talk of an across the board freeze for a year on the weekend she made it clear that she will announce her specific package on energy prices within a week if it were to involve a freeze this could cost the government as much as 100 billion 115 65 billion if implemented for a year threatening her other apparent commitments including some of her desired plans on taxes the fortnight before the end of the leadership race was interesting in view of the renewed focus on the us federal reserve s tightening policy financial markets are paying increasing attention to the inflation challenge again and have specifically singled out the united kingdom as looking a bit lax compared with both the united states and the eurozone as can be seen by the combined underperformance of the pound sterling and the uk gilt prices it will be fascinating to see if this continues into the early days of truss leadership as this itself could both add to the likelihood of more intense inflationary challenges and with it a more aggressive bank of england in terms of tightening monetary policy one would hope that truss s advisers are aware of all of these risks so perhaps they may roll back some of their intended policies to allow for markets to digest the energy support package not least because if the talk of a price freeze is correct inflation could peak much earlier than many recent forecasts which could allow a different mood to appear both in the markets and media commentary in the uk this said truss appears to be quite committed to honouring the desires of traditional tory voters and this means at some stage she will have to deliver on them and given that a general election is legally required to be held in not much more than two years the fact that the party membership retains a huge affection for previous prime minister boris johnson and that tory mp s did not really support her leadership bid truss has to tread a very fine line to remain a respected leader of the conservatives and the emboldened opposition labour party obviously won t make life easy for her there is a broader economic issue that will remain a big talking point beyond the immediate challenges not least because truss has frequently described the preferred economic policies of the past 20 years as failing to facilitate stronger economic growth including what she describes as policies based on redistribution this in my view is an even bigger risky strategy for her to pursue because it isn t really accurate the earlier conservative government she had been part of presided over a significant reduction in government spending and lower corporate taxes policies she claims to prefer and while under the 2015 government of david cameron the conservatives accelerated the earliest of policies focused on devolving policies around england it was modest and coincided with significant spending cuts for many local authorities and while johnson talked endlessly about levelling up his government didn t really commit vast redistributive resources to this endeavour at the same time because of his popularity he created a strong enough impression that it was serious that s how the tories won the last election and if there is now a leader opposed to the pursuit of these policies then he or she may not be in power beyond 2025 or even earlier at the end of the day the uk faces the same challenge as every other country as well as one related to its unique geographical productivity factor long term economic growth is driven by the number of people that work and their productivity the uk is already close to its lowest unemployment rate in nearly 50 years so unless it can significantly boost its woeful productivity it will not be able to generate sustained low inflation growth the productivity of london and the southeast is among the strongest in europe it is the rest of the country that does truly need levelling up in terms of productivity yet it seems unlikely that the new uk leader will reverse her stated priorities and truly deal with this aspect as for relations with china truss once a proud advocate of importing the best of chinese maths teaching standards is likely to support the growing popular voices of caution against all things chinese which when it comes back to economics is not likely to help her other

regulators pressing hundreds of cases in recent years ordering firms to explain their conflicts of interests to clients omitted any mention of a particularly glaring one in two recent enforcement actions finra and the sec settled cases late last month against kovack financial whose ceo sat on finra s board of governors for most of the time at issue in the two matters neither regulator disclosed that their handling of the cases could present a conflict of interest to finra or the agency overseeing it fort lauderdale based kovack financial and subsidiaries kovack securities and kovack advisors agreed on aug 23 and aug 26 to pay a combined 1 1 million in restitution and penalties to resolve the separate investigations which began around the time that ceo brian j kovack started serving on finra s board for six years as a midsize firm representative he completed the second of two terms in august 2021 eventually earning about 90 000 per year from finra for an average workload of four hours a week according to finra s latest available nonprofit disclosure to the irs neither finra s supervisory case against kovack s firm over mutual fund recommendations nor the action by the sec involving wrap advisory accounts includes mention of the ceo s seat on the board kovack s board tenure overlapped with the respective time periods that the regulators say the firm was violating the rules at a minimum finra should have followed the same standards as most publicly traded firms in sharing the existence of its investigation and the steps taken by its board to remove kovack s ceo from any discussions involving either case according to bill singer an attorney and former regulator who writes the broke and broker compliance blog it really presents a laboratory experiment with finra singer said what do you do when you begin investigating a firm that has somebody sitting on the board here it appears they did nothing singer added that he s not accusing kovack personally of any wrongdoing but rather raising the same questions that singer has asked when other finra governors firms had cases in the most infamous example convicted fraudster bernie madoff once acted as the vice chairman of finra predecessor the national association of securities dealers and was a member of its board and chairman of its new york region in addition to several roles overseeing nasdaq representatives for the sec didn t immediately respond to requests for comment finra spokesman ray pellecchia noted that the regulator s website discloses the member firm affiliations of each person on the board of governors and that the regulator and finra personnel abide by a code of conduct that includes addressing conflicts of interest board members and finra staff receive annual training on the topic as well the board of governors receives no information about and has zero involvement in pending enforcement matters pellecchia said if a decision in an enforcement action is appealed to the board any governor for whom that would present a conflict would be recused representatives for kovack financial which didn t admit or deny the regulators allegations in settling the cases referred any questions about finra policies to the regulator the two matters you have asked about are two separate and distinct regulatory settlements that are completely unrelated to each other we recognize that our industry has always been heavily regulated our regulatory and compliance team is among the best in the industry and when regulatory issues arise we address them as expeditiously and completely as possible spokesman donald cutler said in a statement we reached a definitive conclusion to both of these matters so all parties can move forward in a 2018 press release on the launch of kovack s re election campaign to the board of governors kovack said had helped guide finra toward greater transparency efficiency and more open communication on behalf of the firms and advisors i represent as the leader of an independent broker dealer that i helped build from scratch and as someone who has devoted most of my working life to the financial advisory space i am dedicated to doing the heavy lifting on behalf of midsize firms across america he said that s why i m committed to pushing forward with the mission of establishing a regulatory landscape that will both protect and empower firms advisors and investors as they pursue their goals in the years ahead kovack s firm generates more than 100 million in revenue annually with more than 400 producing financial advisors as the no 30 company on financial planning s ibd elite rankings of independent wealth managers in the settlement with finra it agreed to a censure and a fine of 210 000 to resolve the sec case it agreed to pay 899 000 including restitution and interest of 199 000 and a civil penalty of 700 000 finra alleges the firm failed between march 2015 and may 2017 to enforce a system of supervising the sales of certain mutual fund shares whose upfront charges make short term trades unsuitable for some clients the firm also missed the red flags of a barred former kovack broker identified only by the initials m k who recommended 2 1 million worth of such trades to eight clients five of them seniors according to investigators finra didn t divulge the former broker s name but said it barred the representative in 2017 for failure to cooperate with its investigation the firm fired the broker and paid restitution to harmed clients who paid unnecessary sales charges during its eventual investigation according to finra kovack securities relied primarily on one person to conduct daily manual reviews of trading activity in the accounts for all its registered representatives which at the time numbered over 300 according to finra s letter of acceptance waiver and consent in the other case the sec accused kovack s ria of failing between 2015 and august 2018 to review its wrap fee accounts on a regular basis to ensure they were still suitable for clients and to state some of the charges paid by the customers adequately such wrap fee programs cost clients a single asset based fee across many investment management services the firm shut down its program in 2018 the sec has subsequently warned all firms about conflicts of interest with wrap fee accounts such as those without much trading activity warranting the expenses outright mis billing and transactions that reduce costs to rias while increasing them for clients the sec credited kovack with remedial actions promptly undertaken during the investigation but it took the firm to task for botching some basic compliance steps between 2012 and 2015 the firm didn t complete its required annual compliance review and from 2015 to 2017 it didn t even conduct any reviews of client accounts according to the settlement order after the commission s division of examinations began an examination of in 2017 conducted account reviews for the first time in almost two years the order states the allegations and the lack of discussion from either regulator about how to handle enforcement matters involving firms with executives on finra s board doesn t meet the smell test for singer he said he acknowledged the presumption of innocence for kovack s firm but said that finra still needed to disclose at least its investigation how is it that they were investigating a governor in 2018 and nobody knew anything about it until 2022 this is going to pose significant problems going forward singer said why is it that finra always seems to be the dog that s chasing after the car

an ethics watchdog group says rep matt cartwright d pa is involved in a potential conflict of interest after visiting general electric s ge research facility in upstate new york last month and holds up to 15 000 in ge stock according to financial disclosures cartwright and rep paul tonko d ny went to ge research in niskayuna new york on august 17 where they toured the facility the schenectady based daily gazette s reported the reporter noted that the two congressmen left the research facility impressed by the work being done in areas such as hybrid electric aircraft propulsion and hydrogen fueled engines bringing cartwright to say there s going to be a revolution in the way people get around in the air over the next 10 or 15 years and you re going to see that revolution right here in schenectady referring to the ge research facility cropley also noted that the visit was cartwright s first time at the ge research facility though tonko is a regular guest and the two helped push through the inflation reduction act which did not help reduce inflation but included hundreds of billions of dollars to fight climate change in fact cartwright appeared to be so excited by his visit to the ge research facility that he later referenced the article on social media with a picture of the two lawmakers at the facility u s rep paul tonko d ny and i were invited to tour the niskayuna headquarters of ge research to learn about the posted by congressman matt cartwright on tuesday august 23 2022 furthermore the visit came just over a week after president joe biden signed the 280 billion creating helpful incentives to produce semiconductors chips act meant to boost domestic semiconductor production ge which reuters reports to be a semiconductor consumer is part of the semiconductors in america coalition siac the coalition penned a letter to congressional leadership on july 28 2021 calling on congress to support funding for incentives for semiconductor manufacturing and increased semiconductor research at ge research semiconductor engineers and physicists tackle the most challenging problems involved when developing commercial devices and systems by applying their expertise in semiconductor device physics device process integration and device testing the company s website states cartwright who is up for reelection this year and voted for the chips legislation holds up to 15 000 in ge stock according to financial disclosures filed on august 15 the federal election commission records show that he has also received 9 000 in campaign contributions from ge political action committees since december 2015 and open secrets reports that the company has been one of tonko s largest donors over the past 15 years cartwright s office did not return a request for comment when asked by breitbart news about the potential conflict of interest around his trip to the upstate new york facility his stock holdings in the company and receiving thousands of dollars in campaign contributions kendra arnold the executive director of the federal government ethics watchdog foundation for accountability and civic trust fact told breitbart news anytime a member takes official action that could impact their personal finances it raises conflict of interest concerns given his specific position in congress and stock holdings there are legitimate concerns arnold added in fact the watchdog group previously dubbed cartwright one of the worst ethics violators of 2019 in a december 2019 press release fact stated that it filed a complaint regarding cartwright with the office of congressional ethics the complaint maintains that cartwright improperly sponsored legislation that would require commercial truck drivers to purchase insurance liability coverage at a 600 hike from the current amount notably cartwright was previously an attorney with a pennsylvania law firm that specializes in personal injury cases involving commercial trucks and advertises itself as the nation s leading truck accident team cartwright s wife marion munley is currently a partner with that firm and both cartwright and his wife have profit sharing agreements with munley law together valued between 2 million and 10 million the many facts in this case show cartwright could not have acted impartially when sponsoring legislation and impugns the integrity of government action in response to all of this cartwright s republican general election opponent jim bognet s campaign called the democrat one of the most corrupt members of congress adding that this latest conflict of interest is just another one in a long line of ethical lapses it s no secret that matt cartwright has a pattern of abusing his power bognet campaign spokesperson kate constantini added from introducing legislation that hurt trucking companies to put money in his families law firm s pocket to selling his office by filming commercials for a top donor in his actual congressional office matt cartwright has always put himself over his constituents last month cartwright was also involved in an ethics scandal when he was seen in a commercial praising his top donor s law firm after he was filmed talking about his newly passed bill about water contamination at camp lejeune members of congress are forbidden to use official taxpayer funded resources to promote themselves for commercial or campaign purposes and cartwright was seen in the video clip praising the multi million dollar law firm parker waichman and a partner jerry parker for their representation of u s servicemen and family members affected by water contamination at marine corps base camp lejeune axios explained parker and his wife have donated the maximum legal amount to the congressman s campaign breitbart news added shortly after the television ad began running cartwright s congressional office sent parker a cease and desist letter on august 9 demanding the firm stop using the clips of him in their advertising and promotional material for the firm axios reported that parker responded to cartwright with an apology calling the firm s move to make the television commercial an overreach and said he is genuinely sorry for any trouble this has caused him the letter from parter noted that the firm s marketing team posted the video to our website and used an excerpt in a television commercial and confirmed that the congressman never authorized the use of his comments however regardless of what the congressman s office and donor stated there are strict ethics rules against lawmakers using taxpayer funded resources for commercial ventures in fact the house ethics manual mentions that communications whether they be private political or commercial use should not be used to indicate an official sponsorship or endorsement in fact the functional government initiative an organization dedicated to improving the american public s awareness about the officials decisions and priorities of their

told cnbc s squawk box asia pointing toward weaker import data as the driver of the nation s consistent trade surplus she said the latest regulations from the u s ordering nvidia to restrict chip sales to china could work instead as an incentive in some sense it is going to incentivize china to produce more domestically so the production aspect of it especially the trade surplus aspect of it

after two years of lawsuits a court finally unsealed key evidence from the fbi s 2020 investigation of north carolina sen richard burr for allegedly trading stocks based on nonpublic information public records at the time show that burr abruptly liquidated more than half of his and his wife s equity holdings in february of 2020 when most of the world had yet to focus on the looming coronavirus crisis burr was ultimately not charged with breaking any laws but the newly released records show fbi agents believed burr had committed insider trading and securities fraud the most compelling new evidence is the flurry of calls and texts between burr his wife brooke burr her brother gerald fauth and fauth s wife that took place on the same days that both the fauths and the burrs sold off hundreds of thousands of dollars of stock right before the market plunged washington newly unsealed fbi documents paint a vivid picture of the government s evidence in a 2020 insider trading investigation of north carolina s senior senator republican richard burr burr was ultimately not charged with breaking any laws but the newly released sworn affidavit of an fbi special agent shows that the justice department had probable cause to believe that burr had committed insider trading and securities fraud as chair of the senate intelligence committee burr in february 2020 abruptly liquidated more than half of his and his wife s equity holdings at a time when u s markets and most americans did not yet know how bad the coronavirus pandemic was going to be get tri state area news and weather forecasts to your inbox sign up for nbc new york newsletters given his position burr had information about the virus spread and about america s meager preparation for a massive pandemic that was not available to the public the affidavit was submitted in support of a search warrant application to seize and search burr s phone one that the judge in the case later granted it lays out a startling timeline of calls and texts between burr his wife brooke burr her brother gerald fauth and fauth s wife that took place on the same days that both the fauths and the burrs sold off hundreds of thousands of dollars of stock right before the market plunged a spokesperson in burr s senate office did not respond to a request for comment on the newly unsealed documents an unusual timeline from the start burr has insisted that the only information he relied upon in deciding to sell his stocks was publicly available including reports by cnbc correspondents in asia nonetheless as chair of the senate intelligence committee burr was given access to classified intelligence reports in january and early february that contained dire warnings about the coronavirus on jan 31 burr received nonpublic information from a source whose name is redacted in the fbi documents that same day burr put in orders to sell nearly 110 000 in stock from his and his wife s brokerage accounts on feb 12 burr ordered the purchase of approximately 1 2 million of treasury securities using 76 of the total holdings in burr and his wife s joint account investors often purchase u s treasury funds to hedge against a potential market downturn the fbi special agent brandon merriman notes he also noted that the dow jones industrial average closed at a record high of 29 551 42 on feb 12 one day after burr s big treasury bill purchase burr and his wife unloaded equity shares worth approximately 1 1 million that the burrs sold stock was reported at the time but the value of the sale was only reported within a range monday s filing was the first time the exact amounts had been made public according to the fbi as a result of senator burr s sales on february 13 2020 his portfolio went from approximately 83 in equities to approximately 3 in equities a week later markets began a steep slide as investors panicked over the potential economic damage from the coronavirus gerald fauth the other person in burr s family who sold a lot of stock on feb 13 2020 was burr s brother in law gerald fauth according to the affidavit records show that a series of sell orders were placed into an account belonging to fauth s wife mary fauth just before noon on the 13th amounting to around 159 100 burr s attorney alice fisher told propublica in may of 2020 that burr did not coordinate his decision to trade on feb 13 with mr fauth but the fbi evidence released on monday shows that burr s wife called her brother shortly after 11 a m et on the 13th and they spoke for two minutes twenty minutes after that burr also used his cellphone to call fauth according to records obtained by the justice department just two minutes after fauth s conversation with his brother law ended fauth called his investment manager and they talked for just shy of half an hour in a later interview the adviser appears to have told the fbi that fauth sounded hurried and that he mentioned knowing a senator in washington according to the fbi the burrs stock sell orders were put in between 11 38 and 11 49 a m fauth s orders were put in between 11 55 a m and 11 58 a m mysterious text messages while the fbi affidavit sheds light on many of the questions surrounding burr s stock sales it closely protects at least one relevant piece of information what kind of nonpublic information burr had about the coronavirus and where he got it but there may be some clues specifically the justice department mentions dozens of text messages that burr exchanged with someone whose name is redacted but who appears to be a potential source of nonpublic information according to the fbi between jan 31 2020 and april 7 2020 this person and burr exchanged approximately 32 text messages nearly all of which concerned in one way or another the covid 19 pandemic nearly everything about the text messages is redacted but later in the affidavit the government writes those text messages include those discussed above and included ones regarding other issues such as efforts to provide face masks to the public the global outlook regarding covid 19 and a proposed national lockdown if burr was receiving this information when it wasn t being publicly discussed that could have strengthened the government s case against him it s still unclear why the justice department decided not to prosecute burr or fauth and the department does not typically explain the reasons why it does not prosecute someone but on jan 19 2021 nearly a year after the questionable trades burr said in a statement tonight the department of justice informed me that it has concluded its review of my personal financial transactions conducted early last year the case is now closed i m glad to hear it burr said my focus has been and will continue to be working for the people of north carolina during this difficult time for our nation

the covid 19 vaccine is likely to become an annual shot that gets updated each year like the flu vaccine dr anthony fauci said in a white house press briefing on the coronavirus response tuesday in the absence of a dramatically different variant we likely are moving towards a path with a vaccination cadence similar to that of the annual influenza vaccine with annual updated covid 19 shots matched to the currently circulating strains for most of the population said fauci who serves as president biden s chief medical adviser and the head of the national institute of allergies and infectious diseases white house covid 19 response coordinator dr ashish jha called that an important milestone for a large majority of americans we are moving to a point where a single annual covid shot should provide a high degree of protection against serious illness all year jha said but he also noted for our highest risk individuals and here i m thinking about my elderly parents for instance who are in their 80s or one of my close friends who recently had a liver transplantation individuals like that may need more than annual protection the administration has begun rolling out the first updated covid boosters which fight the omicron ba 4 and ba 5 subvariants as well as the original strain of the virus by the end of this week over 90 of americans will live within five miles of these new updated vaccines said health and human services secretary xavier becerra we will be ramping up our education and outreach efforts this month as we head into october when we expect more people to get their updated shots potentially together with their flu shots health officials believe the new booster formula will also offer protection against other strains should another variant arise said cdc director dr rochelle walensky one of the very reasons for this bivalent vaccine is not just because it keeps the great protection of the original strain and because it improves the protection against the ba 5 variant as laboratory data suggests but also that the laboratory data suggests it will improve protection against other variants as well walensky said so it gives us that breadth of protection that we might anticipate should another variant come through these new doses are free and available to all americans age 12 and up while younger kids can get the vaccines previously authorized for their age groups however officials expressed concern that vaccines and treatments for coronavirus may no longer be free in the near future as federal funding is drying up jha emphasized that congress needs to support the ongoing pandemic response in order for the u s to be prepared if a new curveball variant were to emerge congress is aware that if we don t continue to fund response we can easily go backwards he said we had planned on having an adequate stock pile of ppe personal protective equipment should there be another surge we will not have that stockpile we will not have enough tests in our strategic national stockpile should we see another omicron like event congress has not stepped up jha added
