capital provides information about the long term health and profitability of the business relative to the company s cost of capital the company believes that adjusted gross profit and adjusted gross profit percentage are useful to investors because they allow investors to assess gross profit excluding non cash expenses which provides useful information regarding our results of operations and assists in analyzing the underlying performance of our business the company believes that net income excluding gain loss from warrants is useful to investors because it removes the impact of stock

we provide a range of adjusted ebitda that we believe will be achieved we cannot accurately predict all the components of the adjusted ebitda calculation the company provides adjusted ebitda guidance

used by management to measure the profitability of our ongoing operations and analyze our business performance and trends we evaluate business segment performance on adjusted ebitda a non gaap measure that excludes certain items as described in the reconciliation of our consolidated net income loss to adjusted ebitda reconciliation below we believe that evaluating segment performance excluding such items is meaningful because it provides insight with respect to intrinsic operating results of the company we also regularly evaluate gross profit by segment to assist in the assessment of the operational performance of each operating segment we consider adjusted ebitda to be the more important metric because it more fully captures the business performance of the segments inclusive of indirect costs we also evaluate free cash flow a non gaap measure that provides useful information concerning cash flow available to fund our capital allocation alternatives adjusted ebitda we define ebitda as net income loss plus interest income expense income tax expense benefit depreciation and amortization our adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda reflects the following further adjustments to ebitda to exclude certain non cash items and the effect of what we consider transactions or events not related to our core business operations currency gains losses net on monetary assets and liabilities

projects financing costs not classified as interest expense and gains and losses on disposals of property plant and equipment adjusted ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider the measure in isolation or as a substitute for net income loss cash flow from operations or other methods of analyzing the company s results as reported under us gaap some of these limitations are adjusted ebitda does not reflect changes in or cash requirements for our working capital needs adjusted ebitda does not reflect our interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our indebtedness adjusted ebitda does not reflect our tax expense or the cash requirements to pay our taxes adjusted ebitda does not reflect historical cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments adjusted ebitda does not reflect the impact on earnings or changes resulting from matters that we consider not to be indicative of our future operations although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future and adjusted ebitda does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements and other companies in our industry may calculate adjusted ebitda differently limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure because of these limitations adjusted ebitda should not be considered as discretionary cash available to reinvest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be available to

russian state gas company gazprom has informed its utility customers in poland and bulgaria that it will be shutting off their supply penalizing them for refusing to pay in rubles the political decision sends a signal to gazprom s larger customers in germany france italy and the rest of the eu russia intends to press hard for ruble payments to support its flagging currency despite the terms of its euro denominated contracts for many the decision indicates that the era of the purely commercial apolitical russian energy contract is over even for longtime russian allies like bulgaria you have seen today the question of gas dependency on russia european commission president ursula von der leyen told the new york times for now both bulgaria and poland have access to enough gas from their neighbors to tide them over over the long term the shutoff appears likely to add to pressure on the global lng market according to analysts poland built its own lng import terminal years ago in anticipation of this moment and will ratchet up imports likewise bulgaria is expected to source foreign gas via greece s lng receiving infrastructure and pipeline network however there may be limits to how much lng can help fill the gap the eu has limited import capacity and there is only so much lng production to go around all the terminal slots in europe are booked in fact they re diverting some cargoes to asia as we speak said poten partners head of analytics kristen holmquist if russia does decide to send less gas to europe we re really seeing the global gas situation under a lot of strain the price of gas on european markets jumped about eight percent at the news of the shutdown and if russia follows through on its threat and shuts down the gas supply to larger customers like germany the impact on eu gas prices and the global economy could be serious in a recent note to clients goldman sachs analyst samantha dart warned that a full interruption of russian flows to germany would potentially lift european gas prices to over 200 euros per megawatt hour nearly double the current level this could take more than two percent off the top of euro area gdp growth for 2022 according to a previous goldman analysis for now gas flows to germany are stable reported german economy minister robert habeck on wednesday that does not mean that germany intends to remain dependent since the start of the invasion habeck has been scouring the world s energy supply market for alternatives to russian gas traveling to dubai qatar and norway to negotiate alternative sources his team and industry partners have already severed the german market from its dependence on russian oil supplies and may move to nationalize the last german refinery that still imports russian oil like other recent russian foreign policy choices the gas shutoff has created side effects that may not be favorable for russian interests bulgaria has remained neutral in the conflict so far reflecting longstanding ties to moscow it was also heavily dependent on russian natural gas the sudden end of a russian energy partnership may weigh on the debate when bulgaria s parliament takes up the question of providing military assistance to ukraine next week bulgaria holds deep stocks of disused soviet era systems that ukraine could use for the fight in the donbas including hundreds of tanks self propelled guns and armored personnel carriers along with the ammunition and parts to run them
chicago april 27 korea bizwire the removal of in feed antibiotics from poultry and livestock production has left a huge gap in the protection of animals from the devastating effects of enteric disease to help producers recapture this protection amlan international the animal health business of oil dri corporation of america has launched two new natural products phylox feed and neutrapath that help optimize intestinal health and production economics in the absence of antibiotics phylox feed is a natural alternative to anticoccidial drugs and vaccines that can help producers increase profitability coccidiosis caused by eimeria species is an enteric disease that can have a significant economic impact on animal protein production the synergistic blend of bioactive phytochemicals in phylox work together with multiple modes of action to damage eimeria cell structure and function while strengthening intestinal integrity and boosting immunity phylox can be effective for full time use or in rotation and or in a bio shuttle program when resistance is a concern in addition phylox does not need to be withdrawn from feed prior to slaughter phylox is an ideal solution for all poultry species including broilers egg layers and broiler breeders all of which can be sensitive to fungal and bacterial toxins during grow out and egg production when exposed to fecal oocysts that are being shed as coccidia cycle research has shown that phylox can be fed concurrently with anticoccidial vaccines preventing disease breakthrough while immunity is being developed by the bird without interfering with vaccine efficacy the most important goal for producers is to keep animals healthy producers grow animals to a certain size and they don t want to lose them in the last few days of their growth development said fred kao vp of global sales for amlan the launch of phylox and neutrapath will be a huge benefit to the animal protein industry animals can remain healthy and reach their full potential naturally neutrapath is a natural pathogen control product for antibiotic free production that uses multiple modes of action to increase livability and improve feed conversion using a proprietary and co active blend of essential oils fatty acids and amlan s proprietary mineral technology neutrapath reduces pathogenic bacterial load and colonization and improves intestinal health and structural integrity all of which contribute to improved performance and increased production yields managing enteric disease without antibiotics has placed extra pressure on nutritionists and veterinarians to find natural solutions that can achieve the same level of performance observed with antibiotic use said dr wade robey vp of marketing and product development for amlan neutrapath has answered the call for a natural product that targets pathogens and the toxins they produce and it improves intestinal health as well it s the natural alternative to antibiotics that the animal protein industry has been waiting for neutrapath can be used to protect the intestinal health of all livestock species the journal of animal science recently published a study by uc davis researchers on the effects of neutrapath in weaned pigs challenged with enterotoxigenic e coli neutrapath reduced the incidence of severe diarrhea enhanced feed efficiency during the last week of the study and modified fecal and ileal mucosa microbiota diversity both of the new products can be used individually or in a program with amlan s mineral based products like calibrin z and patented varium and neoprime to help support gut health and improve productivity and efficiency phylox and neutrapath are commercially available in select international markets while not available for sale in the united states north american customers interested in neutrapath and phylox can contact amlan for more information on similar feed additives available in the u s that were developed to optimize intestinal health in production animals amlan invests heavily in r d to produce well validated products both in vitro and in animals and they are also working directly with customers to assess the

there now are more than 3 000 minneapolis school age children the majority of whom are children of color that have tested positive for lead and in 2021 the number of new children with lead poisoning rose 15 from the year before the first increase in a decade partly because families stayed home more during the pandemic mayor jacob frey said during his state of the city address earlier this week in 2021 about 90 minneapolis children tested positive for lead according to city officials and that increase came as fewer children were getting tested amid the pandemic the mayor wants to spend 3 million of the city s remaining 43 million federal pandemic relief money to end childhood lead poisoning in minneapolis by 2035 the home should be a healthy place frey said this is not acceptable the main culprit house paint about 70 of the city s housing stock was built before 1978 when lead paint was banned for residential use we are taking on aggressive goals to protect the lives of young children frey said promising that minneapolis will be the first major city in the country to eliminate childhood lead poisoning from housing many of the children who tested positive for lead live in north and south central minneapolis their blood lead levels were above 5 micrograms per deciliter and in a few cases above 20 said lisa smestad the city s lead and healthy homes manager the u s centers for disease control and prevention changed its guidelines for elevated blood levels from 5 to 3 5 micrograms per deciliter studies have shown that some children with lead poisoning have lower iq levels as well as learning and behavior problems in school our motto is we need to stop using children as lead detectors smestad said because we know where the housing is we know the age of housing we know the neighborhoods that are most at risk because many children who get lead poisoning live in impoverished neighborhoods funding from the city and the federal department of housing and urban development would help change that situation smestad said remediation efforts include changing how the city licenses rentals in the most afflicted neighborhoods for example it could send health inspectors with rental licensing inspectors to remove lead hazards from homes the city also refers children to early childhood programs and works with a nurse to conduct developmental evaluations meanwhile the city is looking to work with homeowners to remove and replace lead pipes from their properties about 49 000 minneapolis homes may have lead pipes and the estimated cost to replace them is more than 320 million minneapolis does not own any of the service lines making funding lead replacement projects tricky said annika bankston the city s director of water treatment and distribution services to prevent lead seepage city officials have been applying a protective coating on lead pipes to halt corrosion in st paul the city owns and is responsible for the cost of replacing the pipe that goes from the water main below the street up to the private property line homeowners own the water pipes from their property line to the meter said patrick shea general manager of st paul regional water services removing lead for the nation s water supply systems has become a priority as more information emerges about the risks both the federal infrastructure fund and the american rescue plan earmarked billions of dollars for removing and replacing lead pipes st paul has set a goal to remove all public and private pipes with lead by 2033 at no cost to homeowners minneapolis officials say they are no longer waiting for property owners to decide when to replace lead water pipes and are banking on the federal infrastructure dollars to help offset homeowners costs minnesota is expected to receive 43 million a year for the next five years from the infrastructure bill through the drinking water state revolving fund dwsrf said chad kolstad the minnesota department of health s drinking water fund program coordinator there s a massive need in minneapolis based on the number of homes with lead pipes and the cost of replacing them bankston said with the federal money flowing in she said we can facilitate a way to help the property owners leverage those monies to replace their service lines the city s comprehensive plan includes identifying where to dig up the streets to access the service lines and ramping up outreach to property owners that now is the right time to replace lead pipes bankston said the work would cost homeowners roughly 7 000 she said with federal money used to cut the cost in half bankston also wants to create what she calls a rolling fund program that assesses costs to property taxes or offers short term loans our tap levels of lead are very low where we re shifting to is the concept that no level of lead is safe and that s why getting the lead out makes sense bankston said as part of the plan the city is working on building an online tool that lets property owners check whether their home has lead service lines st paul has already created such a map minneapolis provides a free lead testing kit to residents who request one bankston said residents can call 311 the city s information and services number or look up lead testing on the city s website to get a sample kit sent to them st paul also offers free water testing kits to check for lead call 651 266 1635

by nellie akalp what happens if your business missed the march 15 deadline getty the deadline for existing limited liability companies and c corporations to elect s corporation tax treatment for the tax year 2022 was march 15 so what happens if a business missed the s corp deadline can it still change its llc or c corp tax treatment from its default status to that of an s corporation these are important questions for business owners who are striving to optimize their tax outcomes and maximize their profitability s corporation overview and eligibility requirements what is an s corp before we dig into the deadline issue let s first discuss what it means to be an s corporation an s corporation is not an entirely different type of business entity rather it is a special pass through tax election that an llc or c corporation requests through the irs pass through tax status means that an s corporation s business income losses deductions and credits flow through to its owners while an llc is by default a pass through entity pass through taxation as an s corp is handled a little differently more on that later an llc or corporation must file form 2553 election by a small business corporation to request s corporation tax treatment s corp eligibility requirements a business must meet the irs s criteria to qualify to be taxed as s corporation must be a domestic corporation or llc may not have more than 100 shareholders or llc members may not have owners that are non resident aliens partnerships or corporations all shareholders in an s corporation must be individuals not llcs or partnerships and legal residents of the united states an s corp may have only one class of stock owners must share equally in terms of profits and losses based on their percentage of ownership organizations that are not eligible to be treated as s corps include certain financial institutions insurance companies and domestic international sales organizations c corporation electing s corporation status tax treatment overview normally a c corporation files a corporate income tax return and pays income tax on its profits at the corporate tax rate some of its earnings are subject to double taxation i e some of a corporation s profits get taxed when the c corp earns that income and when the company distributes those profits as dividends which are not tax deductible to its shareholders after the corporation pays income tax on those monies at the corporate tax rates shareholders also report and pay tax on the income on their personal tax returns at their individual tax rates alternatively a corporation that has elected to be treated as an s corporation is considered a pass through entity therefore its profits and losses flow through to its shareholders personal tax returns according to their shares of ownership the shareholders pay tax on that income at the applicable individual tax rates but the business does not pay income tax on the profits therefore s corp taxation eliminates the double taxation that applies to corporations under their default tax treatment shareholders who are employees of the c corporation pay medicare and social security taxes fica taxes only on the wages and salaries the company pays them dividend income they receive is not subject to social security and medicare taxes while a c corp electing s corp status follows a different income tax protocol its corporate compliance obligations for the underlying business entity type c corporation remain the same for example the corporation must adopt bylaws designate a registered agent appoint a board of directors hold shareholder meetings etc s corporation advantages for c corporations avoiding double taxation stands as the primary reason entrepreneurs with c corporations elect s corporation status generally the tax filing process as a pass through tax entity is less complicated too s corporation disadvantages for a c corporation s corp election may not be ideal for every c corporation because it offers less flexibility in certain respects s corp election places restrictions on who is eligible to own the corporation business income or loss is allocated in direct proportion to each shareholder s ownership percentage of the corporation for example suppose shareholder 1 owns 60 of the corporation and shareholder 2 owns 40 shareholder 1 will be taxed on 60 of the profits and shareholder 2 will be taxed on 40 of the profits regardless of other agreements made about dividing profits because an s corp may only have 100 or fewer shareholders the corporation s ability to raise capital and fund growth may be limited these are some of the potential downsides for business owners to consider more articles from allbusiness com llc electing s corporation status tax treatment overview an llc is a pass through tax entity with its profits flowing through to its members personal tax returns llc members must pay income tax and self employment taxes social security and medicare on all the company s profits with s corporation election llc members only pay social security and medicare taxes on income paid to them as wages and salaries the profits the company gives them as distributions are not subject to social security and medicare taxes an llc faces the same llc business compliance formalities regardless of whether it opts for default or s corp tax treatment for example it must maintain a registered agent in the state apply for required licenses and permits and obtain an ein however becoming an s corporation for tax purposes does not burden an llc with c corp compliance requirements like adopting bylaws or appointing a board of directors s corporation advantages for llcs llc members may be drawn to s corp election because it may help them lower their personal tax burden income paid to business owners through payroll is subject to social security and medicare taxes fica while profit distributions are subject to income tax but not fica taxes s corporation disadvantages for llcs on the flip side some potential drawbacks exist the irs restricts who may own an llc llc members who work in the business must compensate themselves with a sensible salary or wage if they try to get away with paying as little fica tax as possible by paying themselves an unreasonably low salary and taking a disproportionate amount of money in distributions it could raise red flags with the irs managing payroll for llc members adds extra work and administrative considerations for llcs that otherwise would not have employees filing taxes as an s corp is more complex than filing as an llc what about the 2022 s corp election deadline to be considered an s corporation for tax purposes in all of 2022 existing llcs and c corporations that follow a january 1 december 31 tax year had to submit an irs form 2553 by march 15 2022 two months and 15 days after the start of the 2022 tax year if they missed that deadline they can still file form 2553 but the election will only be effective for the remainder of the year that means they will have two sets of income tax files to deal with so say an existing llc missed the deadline and filed its form 2553 on may 1 2022 for january 1 april 30 2022 it must file taxes as an llc for may 1 december 31 2022 it must file taxes as an s corp businesses that follow a fiscal year other than the calendar year have until two months and 15 days 75 days after the start of their fiscal year to file for s corp election new llcs and c corporations registered in 2022 have two months and 15 days 75 days from their formation date to file for s corp tax treatment for their first tax year businesses have flexibility if they want their s corp tax treatment to take effect starting with their 2023 tax year they can file their form 2553 anytime during tax year 2022 to make it effective for 2023 leeway for businesses that miss their deadline if an llc or corporation demonstrates it has reasonable cause for not filing form 2553 on time the irs may approve the s corp election retroactively to the beginning of the company s tax year business owners must include an explanation on form 2553 of why they re submitting their filing late should your business elect s corporation status before moving forward with filing for s corp election it s helpful to talk with a tax advisor or accountant and attorney to determine if the change makes sense for your situation there are pros and cons so it s important to understand all the ways s corporation status will impact your company about the author

are we going to be able to pay for these trades today i don t see how we can the deputy s words now immortalized in a federal indictment said it all inside bill hwang s archegos capital management panic was setting in hwang the enigmatic billionaire behind archegos had amassed one of the world s great fortunes in virtual secrecy and that trove a staggering us 160 billion position in stocks was unraveling everywhere all at once that was march 23 2021 and wall street had no idea what was about to go down a year after the collapse of archegos sent shock waves through global finance hwang was arrested wednesday morning and for the first time federal prosecutors offered an official account of what really happened at the secretive family office the chaotic story portrayed in the 59 page indictment charts a rapid rise and fall in riches unlike anything wall street has ever seen until the end hwang a devout christian who despite his wealth lived in modest surroundings in suburban new jersey believed he could single handedly bend world markets to his will prosecutors contend hubris and greed prosecutors say fueled a brazen scheme to deceive major banks and manipulate markets if convicted of all counts hwang faces a maximum sentence of as many as 380 years in prison hwang and archegos s chief financial officer patrick halligan both pleaded not guilty on wednesday to 11 criminal charges including racketeering conspiracy market manipulation wire fraud and securities fraud the gray haired hwang wearing a blue patagonia vest was released on us 100 million bail they re due back in court may 19 according to prosecutors hwang s scheme began to unravel after his personal fortune shot from us 1 5 billion to us 35 billion in the span of a year archegos persuaded major banks to lend the firm vast sums to leverage its bets in the stock market in the end with catastrophic results the downfall his demise came after viacomcbs inc one of hwang s big holdings began to fall after selling new stock archegos likely couldn t make the margin calls setting off panic inside the firm and at the banks that had lent hwang billions hwang s response he demanded his traders buy the stock then buy some more in the end archegos added us 900 million in a day scott becker the chief risk director protested the firm s head trader william tomita made his own plea to hwang only to return with his tail between his legs i spoke to bill and he said to just keep working the orders both have pleaded guilty and are cooperating with authorities it didn t work and archegos s leadership team prepared for margin calls the next day hwang had other ideas instead encouraging traders to use the last of the firm s cash to manipulate certain stocks to prop up their price all the while becker was pulling as much money from wall street banks as possible falsely claiming that the family office had us 9 billion in excess cash while it was running on fumes the charging documents the press conference and the court appearance still left many questions unanswered including the big one how exactly did hwang think this would all end even if archegos wasn t quite another long term capital management as some feared in the moment it left its own scars on the financial world the episode saddled global banks with billions of dollars in losses encouraged a fresh look at disclosure requirements for the investment firms of the ultra rich and inspired a sweeping u s probe into how wall street handles big block trades largely unknown it s all the more impressive considering hwang was largely unknown before archegos s spectacular collapse save for a small group of managers affiliated with hedge fund legend julian robertson hwang worked for robertson at his us 20 billion tiger management until it closed then started his own firm tiger asia he was one of robertson s most successful former employees until he ran afoul of regulators in 2012 after years of investigations the u s securities and exchange commission accused tiger asia of insider trading and manipulation of chinese bank stocks the agency said hwang crossed the wall receiving confidential information about pending share offerings from the underwriting banks and then using it to reap illicit profits hwang settled that case without admitting or denying wrongdoing and tiger asia pleaded guilty to a justice department charge of wire fraud the incident forced him out of the money management industry but he said it served to strengthen his faith he set up archegos a greek word often translated as author or captain and often considered a reference to jesus to manage his own personal fortune as hwang traded his own fortune at archegos he held bible readings on friday mornings at 7 a m when 20 or 30 people would squeeze together around a long table and over coffee and danishes listen to recordings of the bible hwang also set up the grace and mercy foundation which swelled to hundreds of millions of dollars in assets and backed largely christian organizations he also seeded funds run by cathie wood s ark investment management like hwang wood is known to hold bible study meetings and figures into what some refer to as the faith in finance movement covid changes yet as the federal government tells it something fundamentally changed in hwang s investment process as the covid 19 pandemic hit his holdings were once in large and highly liquid stocks but he soon turned to smaller companies including a handful of chinese adrs he increasingly ignored internal archegos analyst research throughout 2020 and 2021 after previously holding weekly strategy meetings according to the charging documents instead hwang frequently spent almost all of his workday with the traders in some cases hwang would instruct traders to sell a stock or enter a short position in the morning which gave the family office more trading capacity to buy when it needed to boost the price hwang referred to this practice as using bullets according to the indictment hwang directed the traders to use the bullets or trading capacity at opportune moments that would create upward pressure on the stock price hwang employed this strategy with increasing frequency as counterparties began to curtail or restrict his access to additional trading capacity as his bets got larger and larger hwang expanded archegos s roster of banks providing him leverage allegedly without the others knowing about it by early 2021 just before its collapse archegos held a greater than 50 per cent position in gsx techedu inc and viacom what s more he was able to further increase his influence by coordinating trades with a person identified as adviser 1 who bloomberg news reported is tao li the head of teng yue partners a new york based hedge fund that oversaw us 4 billion as of last year li also bet heavily on gsx with banks placing limits on how many shares they were willing to hold in one company hwang allegedly told adviser 1 to move his gsx position to another bank freeing up capacity for hwang to increase his own bet according to the indictment li and teng yue haven t been accused of wrongdoing by u s authorities and teng yue didn t respond to messages seeking comment in the end the losses from archegos swept across the globe as banks were forced to dump large blocks of stock into the market in japan nomura holdings inc took a us 2 9 billion hit credit suisse group ag suffered a us 5 5 billion blow and in new york morgan stanley revealed a us 911 million loss the banks in the government s telling of the archegos episode were the victims of his fraud but among the most enduring elements of its collapse is the way it inspired federal regulators to dig into the way wall street went about unwinding hwang s massive portfolio that led them in turn to start looking at the way morgan stanley and potentially other banks dealt with block trades the u s attorney s office for the southern district of new york which is prosecuting hwang is now gathering evidence around whether or not banks engaged in illegal activity particularly whether some market participants were getting tipped off ahead of time when a large transaction was coming to market
the founder of archegos capital management was arrested wednesday and charged with racketeering conspiracy securities fraud and wire fraud for orchestrating a multibillion dollar market manipulation scheme that resulted in the u s hedge fund s collapse bill hwang was indicted in the southern district of new york along with former archegos chief financial officer patrick halligan chief risk officer scott becker pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy to commit racketeering conspiracy securities fraud and wire fraud in relation to the alleged scheme while head trader william tomita also pleaded guilty to similar charges plus market manipulation the four individuals also face charges announced by the securities and exchange commission sec the commodity futures trading commission cftc charged archegos and halligan becker and tomita becker and tomita each admitted their roles to the cftc and agreed to cooperate with the agency archegos collapsed in march 2021 resulting in significant losses for many of the firm s largest lenders most notably credit suisse the scheme the sec s complaint alleged that from at least march 2020 to march 2021 hwang purchased on margin billions of dollars of total return swaps as alleged hwang frequently entered into certain of these swaps without any economic purpose other than to artificially and dramatically drive up the prices of the various companies securities which induced other investors to purchase those securities at inflated prices the sec stated as a result of hwang s trading archegos allegedly underwent a period of rapid growth increasing in value from approximately 1 5 billion with 10 billion in exposure in march 2020 to a value of more than 36 billion with 160 billion in exposure at its peak in march 2021 one example specifically cited was archegos s position in viacomcbs stock at one point hwang effectively controlled more than 50 percent of the freely trading shares of viacomcbs which nobody outside archegos knew about according to the department of justice how much the viacomcbs position constituted archegos s capital was often misrepresented on calls with risk personnel from counterparties according to the sec which noted the figure at more than 60 percent as of january 2021 when viacomcbs lost nearly half its value archegos s risky bets backfired the firm quickly collapsed reportedly losing 8 billion over the course of two weeks in march 2021 we allege that hwang and archegos propped up a 36 billion house of cards by engaging in a constant cycle of manipulative trading lying to banks to obtain additional capacity and then using that capacity to engage in still more manipulative trading stated gurbir grewal director of the sec s division of enforcement but the house of cards could only be sustained if that cycle of deceptive trading lies and buying power continued uninterrupted and once archegos s buying power was exhausted and stock prices fell the entire structure collapsed allegedly leaving archegos s counterparties billions in trading losses halligan and becker were archegos s primary points of contact for the credit and risk review functions at its counterparties according to the sec the agency cited a handful of situations when becker allegedly misrepresented liquidity and capital positions to these counterparties often claiming the firm s largest position was only 35 percent of its then total capital today s announcement demonstrates the department s unwavering commitment to hold accountable individuals who distort and defraud our financial markets including those who occupy the c suite stated deputy attorney general lisa monaco that is especially true for this kind of crime the kind that leaves a financial crater in its wake the sec s complaint filed in federal district court in manhattan charged hwang and the other defendants with violating antifraud and other provisions of the federal securities laws the complaint seeks permanent injunctive relief return of allegedly ill gotten gains and civil penalties the sec also seeks to bar individual defendants from serving as a public company officer and director the cftc s complaint charged archegos and halligan with fraud the agency is seeking restitution disgorgement of ill gotten gains civil monetary penalties permanent registration and trading bans and permanent injunctions against further violations of the commodity exchange act and other regulations the cftc s settled orders with becker and tomita found the two engaged in the scheme to secure additional capacity for archegos to enlarge its swap trading positions to obtain or maintain favorable margin rates and to attempt to satisfy margin calls becker and tomita each entered into cooperation agreements with the cftc s enforcement division the orders impose immediate cease and desist obligations against becker and tomita the cftc stated and further sanctions will be determined in future proceedings as a family office archegos was exempt from reporting requirements from both the sec and cftc both agencies have explored whether to revisit the family office exemption in the aftermath of the firm s collapse
wilmington del ap a delaware court sided with tesla ceo elon musk in a bitter legal battle over whether he acted against the best interest of other shareholders when he steered the electric car maker into a 2 6 billion acquisition of a solar panel maker founded by two of his cousins the 132 page decision issued wednesday by delaware chancery court vice chancellor joseph r slights vindicated musk who appeared on the witness stand last summer during two days of often combative testimony musk defended his reasons for thinking it was a good idea for tesla to buy solarcity in november 2016 even as some analysts and some stockholders questioned the deal s wisdom musk decided to fight the lawsuit even after other directors on tesla s board at the time of the deal reached a 60 million settlement without an admission of fault had the delaware court ruled against him musk could have been ordered to pay 2 billion or more at the same time he is trying close a 44 billion acquisition of twitter musk has pledged to cover 21 billion of the price in the twitter deal which was struck earlier this week the long running shareholder lawsuit alleged that musk breached his fiduciary lawsuit by pursuing the solarcity deal despite glaring conflicts of interest musk was solarcity s largest shareholder at the time tesla struck the deal but slights ruled the acquisition was entirely fair even while conceding that elon was more involved in the process than a conflicted fiduciary should be while shareholders had argued musk grossly misrepresented the value of solarcity s technology for tesla slights disagreed pointing to evidence showing tesla has been able to cross sell solar and home battery storage products to consumers who also bought tesla cars the preponderance of the evidence suggests that the acquisition was and is synergistic the judge wrote tesla s stock price has increased by 22 fold since the solarcity purchase was completed creating more than 850 billion in shareholder wealth that apparently wasn t lost on slights who observed that tesla s value has massively increased following the acquisition
at the casper city council meeting on tuesday the council heard from city manager carter napier about how the city plans to pay for the 7 2 million the council will need to pay over the next 20 years get our free mobile app get our free mobile app the need for the money comes from a recent bill passed by the wyoming legislature which secures funding for pensions for firefighters who served before 1981 by combining payments from the state and cities to cover the 20 million price tag over the next 20 years the way napier suggested the city pay for the pension on casper s end is to set up a sinking fund which would set aside a little under 5 million now which with an average annual 4 interest would be able to pay off the entirety of the money the city owes over the next 20 years with payments of 364 705 each year while it would normally be difficult to have those kinds of funds on hand without having to siphon them off other projects napier said that because of a recent audit the city did they were able to find enough money to be able to pay into the pension fund in total napier said that from the draft of the audit they found an extra 1 6 million from revenues that performed better than they expected and an extra 2 7 million from expenditures performing better for a total of 4 3 million with money from the budget being used to shore up the difference to get to 4 9 million councilmember jai ayala sutherland asked napier what the money from the audit could have been used for and napier said in response that it could have been used to renovate the new police or fire buildings the biggest piece of direction that i would probably seek with that money is probably to dedicate to some capital project napier said the police building for example is large on my mind right now and 5 million would go a long way in terms of having to seek funds elsewhere to make that project happen the rehabilitation primarily another one would certainly be fire station 1 5 million would go a long way to helping fire station 1 come to reality these dollars have not been encumbered and that is the value of these dollars it s not like we re taking it away from our obligatory reserves anywhere or are arpa funds those have been untouched with this proposal according to the city census results from march 2022 showed that of the 255 total pensioners 93 are retired from casper and thus are eligible for benefits while the city anticipates an annual rate of return of 4 they mention that if returns drop below that percent the city may need to inject more money into the fund in the future napier said that there is an attempt to change the wyoming constitution which would allow cities and towns in the state to invest more of their money and more into stocks and equity which could help the sinking fund the city is proposing to get a higher return on investment

a winnipeg expert in roads says more can be done to improve manitoba s pothole ridden streets and keep them in better shape for a longer period of time but it would require more money in the budget for infrastructure costs city of winnipeg crews are patching 700 potholes a day with temporary fixes ahead of road construction season but ahmed shalaby a professor of civil engineering who specializes in pavement design and highway materials says the interim fixes are just band aids we have a stock of roads that are at the end of their service life or approaching the end of their service life and at some point it becomes not cost effective to use the same old techniques to fill more and more potholes he said part of the issue is planning said shalaby who leads the u of m s pavement research group which focuses on analyzing pavement structures materials and systems the majority of roads in the province were built in the last 50 or 60 years things that were designed a long time ago they were never designed for the level of traffic we have today the types of vehicles we have today the demand on these roads have changed over time he said when we go into a phase of rebuilding and reconstructing this has to be also considered ahmed shalaby is a professor of civil engineering at the university of manitoba cbc but infrastructure renewal is a challenge for all municipalities shalaby said the cost that goes with this is quite significant and the municipalities really operate on fixed budgets for road repairs so the problem is growing at a faster rate than the budgets are growing shalaby says there s a backlog of roads that need renewal and the city of winnipeg and the province have been catching up but it s a problem that continues to grow especially as the city sprawls no matter how much catching up you can do it s still exceeding what you can plan for and also the public expectations are higher he said that includes adding active transportation routes as well as meeting newer and better standards he said shalaby s lab is looking for better ways to build and maintain roads including testing new materials to the breaking point that includes looking at possible solutions like mixing plastic waste with asphalt he says the city has taken the lab up on some but not all of its innovations road construction in general is a very conservative business and no one is willing to take a risk they do not need to take and sometimes there is also very little reward for innovation shalaby said 33 000 potholes patched st boniface coun matt allard the chair of winnipeg s infrastructure and public works committee says in his time in office he s never seen potholes as bad as this year s the city said in a statement on tuesday it has patched 33 000 since january but some have had to be repatched allard says city council has pledged 525 million for infrastructure in 2022 thanks to help from the provincial and federal governments but agrees with shalaby that those improvements won t happen overnight the real solution is to fix the roads at some point we ll catch up and things will get better but despite this council spending a lot on roads there s a lot of work to do he said in a wednesday interview with cbc manitoba s up to speed coun matt allard says the city of winnipeg is committed to improving infrastructure including fixing potholes like this one but road issues have snowballed in the last several years cbc allard says council is open to innovation and knows winnipeggers expect more of their infrastructure a quick hop across the border into north dakota can look like a whole different world shalaby says municipal and state governments there are building roads that are thicker with higher quality materials and replacing them before their condition deteriorates too far they re much better quality at their end of life than our roads are we accept our roads to deteriorate to a level that they would not accept he said however shalaby says the comparison to manitoba isn t fair because the governments in north dakota have far more money in their budgets to cover such repairs the u s also considers infrastructure maintenance a key part of its national security he says even so the civil engineer hopes for a future with smoother streets here i think we re seeing the difference being made we re seeing improvement in the quality of the designs and construction he said that s not to say that more cannot be done definitely more can be done and we hope to be able to be part of that work when it s done

russian state gas company gazprom has informed its utility customers in poland and bulgaria that it will be shutting off their supply penalizing them for refusing to pay in rubles the political decision sends a signal to gazprom s larger customers in germany france italy and the rest of the eu russia intends to press hard for ruble payments to support its flagging currency despite the terms of its euro denominated contracts for many the decision indicates that the era of the purely commercial apolitical russian energy contract is over even for longtime russian allies like bulgaria you have seen today the question of gas dependency on russia european commission president ursula von der leyen told the new york times for now both bulgaria and poland have access to enough gas from their neighbors to tide them over over the long term the shutoff appears likely to add to pressure on the global lng market according to analysts poland built its own lng import terminal years ago in anticipation of this moment and will ratchet up imports likewise bulgaria is expected to source foreign gas via greece s lng receiving infrastructure and pipeline network however there may be limits to how much lng can help fill the gap the eu has limited import capacity and there is only so much lng production to go around all the terminal slots in europe are booked in fact they re diverting some cargoes to asia as we speak said poten partners head of analytics kristen holmquist if russia does decide to send less gas to europe we re really seeing the global gas situation under a lot of strain the price of gas on european markets jumped about eight percent at the news of the shutdown and if russia follows through on its threat and shuts down the gas supply to larger customers like germany the impact on eu gas prices and the global economy could be serious in a recent note to clients goldman sachs analyst samantha dart warned that a full interruption of russian flows to germany would potentially lift european gas prices to over 200 euros per megawatt hour nearly double the current level this could take more than two percent off the top of euro area gdp growth for 2022 according to a previous goldman analysis for now gas flows to germany are stable reported german economy minister robert habeck on wednesday that does not mean that germany intends to remain dependent since the start of the invasion habeck has been scouring the world s energy supply market for alternatives to russian gas traveling to dubai qatar and norway to negotiate alternative sources his team and industry partners have already severed the german market from its dependence on russian oil supplies and may move to nationalize the last german refinery that still imports russian oil like other recent russian foreign policy choices the gas shutoff has created side effects that may not be favorable for russian interests bulgaria has remained neutral in the conflict so far reflecting longstanding ties to moscow it was also heavily dependent on russian natural gas the sudden end of a russian energy partnership may weigh on the debate when bulgaria s parliament takes up the question of providing military assistance to ukraine next week bulgaria holds deep stocks of disused soviet era systems that ukraine could use for the fight in the donbas including hundreds of tanks self propelled guns and armored personnel carriers along with the ammunition and parts to run them

by timothy gardner washington reuters an official with the u s nuclear power regulator has ordered staff to supply documents that could lead to a review of a 2020 approval of a new type of nuclear power reactor after an engineer raised concerns about its ability to withstand earthquakes documents showed on wednesday dan dorman the executive director for operations at the nuclear regulatory commission nrc reviewed a complaint by john ma an engineer at the agency about its approval of the design of nuscale s nuclear power plant nuscale majority owned by construction and engineering company fluor corp nyse which got approval for the design of a 50 megwatt small modular reactor smr is hoping to build the carbon free power project with multiple reactors at the idaho national laboratory nyse with the first coming online in 2029 and full plant operation in 2030 some see smrs such as nuscale s as a way to cut emissions from fossil fuels and to potentially reduce europe s dependency on russian oil and gas nuscale also wants to build the plants in poland and kazakhstan in an internal document ma wrote to nrc officials soon after the 2020 approval he alleged the design of the building intended to enclose the reactor units and its spent fuel pool did not provide assurance it could withstand the largest earthquake considered without collapsing and may be vulnerable to smaller earthquakes collapse of the reactor building could potentially cause an early and large release of radioactive materials into the atmosphere and ground which could kill people ma wrote in february dorman wrote to ma that he concluded the nrc s basis for accepting nuscale s measure of strength for the reactor s building design was not sufficiently documented documents posted on the nrc website on wednesday showed dorman ordered the agency s office of nuclear reactor regulation to document its evaluation of nuscale s stress averaging approach and if necessary to update the application and evaluate whether there are any impacts to the 2020 design approval it was uncertain whether the additional actions would affect the project s timeline which has been delayed several times scott burnell an nrc spokesperson downplayed the move saying dorman wanted staff there to better document their work on the reactor s earthquake protection the bottom line is that the agency s standard design approval remains valid for the nuscale 50 mw module design he said in an email dorman did not respond to a request for comment diane hughes vice president marketing and communications at nuscale said the nrc s consideration of professional opinions such as ma s are an important part of a strong nuclear safety culture she said the robustness of nuscale structures is one aspect that makes the nuscale smr the safest design ever approved by the nrc a science advocacy group said the concerns ma raised were troubling nuscale s business case is based on its assertion that it is a safer nuclear reactor now it s time to prove it by addressing these safety concerns said edwin lyman director of nuclear power safety at the union of concerned scientists

samantha renck on april 27 2022 a potential chinese invasion of taiwan would be devastating to the u s economy experts told the daily caller news foundation due to american dependence on semiconductors manufactured in the country when you look at chips the chips are in everything tennessee republican rep mark green told the daily caller news foundation it would take years to replace the capacity that taiwan has been making chips if it were to be knocked offline chris miller a visiting fellow at the american enterprise institute told the daily caller news foundation china s escalating aggression toward taiwan the world s largest producer of semiconductors has sounded the alarm among both democrats and republicans about what could happen to the u s s economy and national security if china invaded taiwan is the global hub of semiconductor manufacturing accounting for over 60 of the world s chip market share with major nations including the u s heavily reliant on the country lawmakers and experts have highlighted the catastrophic impact a chinese invasion of taiwan would have on the u s economy and national security due to the effect on semiconductor supply is home to a company called tsmc which makes the most advanced logic chips in the world and it is also the largest producer of this type of in the world chris miller a visiting fellow at the american enterprise institute told the daily caller news foundation so it would take years to replace the capacity that taiwan has been making chips if it were to be knocked offline in terms of dollar values the cost would number in the trillions because the impact would be not only felt on semiconductor companies themselves miller said but from smartphones to pcs to data centers to dishwashers to cars almost everything we use today relies on semiconductors and a substantial portion of those semiconductors are made in taiwan tsmc produces upward of 90 of the world s advanced semiconductors reuters reported while u s chip production has declined 25 over the last 30 years according to the white house the white house spoke with u s lawmakers earlier this month to discuss the urgent need to invest in made in america semiconductors as well as research and development that will protect our economic and national security according to a readout of the meeting ohio sens rob portman and sherrod brown also introduced the chips for america act which is included in the united states innovation and competes act in an effort to bolster u s semiconductor manufacturing and make the u s less dependent on taiwan when you look at chips i mean the chips are in everything tennessee republican rep mark green told the dcnf we re talking about a massive disruption of the economy covid will look like chump change compared to a disruption if china were to attack taiwan because people would be fighting a war just like they are in ukraine green said a chinese takeover of the semiconductor industry would in the near term cause significant international supply chain and manufacturing disruptions in the long term obviously china would control that he said to think of china economically who they are as a country an authoritarian regime led by a coercive and privacy violating freedom violating genocidal leader we re talking about serious again disruptions to the supply chain costs and then you have to think about the national security implications of it green said because china would control the chips that we use in our military weapon systems so this is a huge threat both economically for the prosperity of the world for the prosperity of americans and for the national security of americans the length of the war would also determine how the industry is affected according to dean cheng a senior research fellow in the heritage foundation s asian studies center i would analogize it to the impact of the russia ukraine war on wheat which is to say that it doesn t mean the end of wheat production or the end of semiconductor production but it would be incredibly disruptive cheng told the dcnf and you would probably see significant hikes in prices depending on how long the war lasted and what the impact was unlike the wheat market it would vary by the type of microprocessor and semiconductor because especially do you think china continues to trade with the rest of the world he said does chinese chip production stay purely at home or do they continue to sell to say europe right do they sell to south korea so i think all of that would be part of the question cheng further discussed the impact of a chinese invasion on the semiconductor industry and in turn u s national security saying it partly depends on what you think the impact globally is going to be it really sort of depends on whether you think that this is world war iii in which case we re talking about massive industrial mobilization 24 7 three shifts a day cheng said you re going to draw down your microprocessor and semiconductor stocks really fast right especially if you don t think there was any early warning

alderan resources anticipates assays from the holes drilled at drum next month with drilling to re start in august us focused explorer alderan resources asx al8 has closed out a maiden drilling campaign at its flagship detroit project in the drum mountains region of western utah eight diamond holes for 868 6m were completed at the historic drum oxide gold deposit and one hole was drilled at the mizpah prospect 2 kilometres to the north the campaign aimed to verify and extend remnant oxide mineralisation at both locations assays have indicated that remnant high grade mineralisation is open down dip below the southern and northern ends of the east pit at drum a step out diamond hole completed 350m northwest of mizpah was drilled to a depth of 164 89m and intersected 69m at 0 18 grams per tonne gold alderan managing director scott caithness said the result showed the mineralised system could be much larger than past work suggested early assays have confirmed that thick and high grade oxide gold zones remain below the northern and southern ends of drum s east pit we are optimistic that assays will also contain gold mineralisation he said the hole at mizpah demonstrated that the gold system is greater than 50m thick 350m down dip from the historically drilled deposit suggesting that it could be significantly larger than historically defined remnant mineralisation the drum mine produced 125 000 ounces of gold between 1984 and 1989 but had seen no modern exploration until alderan commenced work there late last year the company aimed to test for oxide gold left behind when mining ceased while investigating the potential for down dip extensions to the mineralised horizons the remnant mineralisation was modelled from drill hole data collected by western states minerals and jumbo mining between 1982 and 1989 the data indicated that the mineralisation at drum primarily occurs in the lower tatow unit and the upper chisholm formation within a northeast southwest trending structural corridor bound by two steeply dipping faults both units consist of fine grained calcareous shales siltstones and carbonates and are separated by the massive and unmineralised howell limestone detroit mining district the detroit project is one of four alderan assets in utah state and lies within the detroit mining district which contains numerous historical copper gold and manganese operations the district has been explored for copper and gold in the past by major mining companies including anaconda copper and bhp group asx bhp but none of them were able to build a significant contiguous land position to enable large scale modern exploration mr caithness said alderan would complete an environmental assessment at drum which is a requirement on federal land when ground disturbance activities such as drill site preparation and access track construction exceeds approximately five acres the company is currently able to drill in excess of 10 holes from already permitted sites within the drum acreage mizpah is on utah state land which does not have the same environmental assessment requirements and permitting of drill sites is proceeding

mysterious child hepatitis outbreak creeps closer to australia here s what to watch for and how to avoid catching it an acute liver disease outbreak has crept closer to australia with cases in asia top infectious diseases expert said a regular virus could cause hepatitis in kids the doctor has revealed what all australians must do to keep their kids safe symptoms include yellowing skin fever fatigue and joint pain among others health officials are investigating 169 cases of sudden onset hepatitis in children a baffling outbreak of hepatitis affecting children and spreading across the globe has crept closer to australia with new cases reported in asia the origins of the outbreak are unknown but there are now more than 169 cases of affected children in europe and america the acute liver disease has now been detected closer to australia in japan while canada investigates similar cases the children have been aged between 1 month and 16 years old and most weren t vaccinated against covid 19 ruling out a link between the vaccines and hepatitis the leading theory is viral infection probably with a strain of adenovirus a family of common viruses that can cause cold like symptoms including fevers and sore throats one kind of adenovirus commonly causes acute gastroenteritis and there have been reports of it causing hepatitis in immunocompromised children but never previously in healthy children the world health organisation reported that the adenovirus was found in at least 74 of the infant hepatitis cases worldwide while 20 cases had covid 19 there were an additional 19 cases that were co infected with covid 19 and the adenovirus professor peter collignon pictured is an australian microbiologist and infectious diseases expert public health scotland s director jim mcmenamin said work was underway to establish if the adenovirus involved had mutated to cause more severe disease or if it could be causing the problems in tandem with another virus including possibly sars cov 2 the virus that causes covid 19 infectious diseases expert professor peter collignon said children who weren t exposed to typical viruses due to two years of covid lockdowns could be at risk of the condition if you get infections when you re very young you seem to have better immune protection he told daily mail australia professor collignon warned of the key signs families should keep an eye out for saying the disease causes a range of unpleasant symptoms from dark urine to fatigue and joint pain basically hepatitis is inflammation of the liver so you go a yellow colour the whites of your eyes go yellow and you often feel unwell professor collingnon told daily mail australia the yellowing of the skin and eyes known as jaundice is caused by higher levels of bilirubin also associated with the darkening of urine if anybody has hepatitis the only way to know that is to do a blood test but what makes you suspicious is that they ll feel unwell they ve got a tinge of yellow in the whites of their eyes and their urine has gone a darker colour the best way to protect your family professor collingnon said is to ensure children are following good hygiene practices like washing their hands pictured before eating food among the varieties of the disease hepatitis a b c d and e some are transmitted blood to blood others can spread like covid through the respiratory system types a and e travel via the faecal oral route where they can spread like cholera through faecal material fingers food and even via flood waters professor collingnon said if the the current hepatitis strain circling the world is from an adenovirus it could be spread via the faecal oral route or the respiratory route it may be a mixture but we don t know enough about this particular strain that may or may not be causing it he said professor collingnon believes in the short term the best protection for families with young children is to stay away from others who are sick and maintain good hygiene standards the bottom line is that you need to have good hygienic practices all the time he said what it means is washing your hands before you eat and avoiding contaminated water that decreases your risk of the faecal oral transmission the thing for the respiratory route is mainly to keep away from people who are sick and be outdoors more than indoors children appear to be especially susceptible to the disease after years of covid 19 restrictions stock image health officials in the uk are investigating 108 cases of sudden onset hepatitis in children since the beginning of the year eight were so ill they had liver transplants the bbc reported the european centre for disease control also said a number of childhood hepatitis cases have been

criteria commentary sampling techniques core samples are obtained from core drilling hq and nq diameter diamond core was drilled on a 3 4 5m or 6m run core was cut using an automatic core cutter and half core sampled at 2m intervals cover sequences were not sampled drilling techniques core drilling was advanced with hq3 hq nq3 and nq diameter coring configuration core from inclined drill holes are oriented on 3 4 5m or 6m runs using an electronic core orientation tool reflex actiii at the end of each run the bottom of hole position is marked by the driller which is later transferred to the whole drill core run length with a bottom of hole reference line drill sample recovery core recovery is systematically recorded from the commencement of coring to end of hole by reconciling against driller s depth blocks in each core tray with data recorded in the database drillers depth blocks provided the depth interval of core recovered and interval of core drilled core recoveries were typically 100 with isolated zones of lower recovery logging geological logging recorded qualitative descriptions of lithology alteration mineralisation veining and structure for all core drilled 17 543m in 20 holes all holes intersected mineralisation except for 10 dedicated geotechnical holes including orientation of key geological features geotechnical measurements were recorded including rock quality designation rqd fracture frequency solid core recovery and qualitative rock strength measurements magnetic susceptibility measurements were recorded every metre all geological and geotechnical logging was conducted at the red chris mine digital data logging was captured validated and stored in an acquire database all drill cores were photographed prior to cutting and or sampling the core sub sampling techniques and sample preparation sampling sample preparation and quality control protocols are considered appropriate for the material being sampled core was cut and sampled at the red chris mine core processing facility half core samples were collected in plastic bags together with pre numbered sample tags and grouped in wood crates for dispatch to the laboratory sample weights typically varied from 5 to 10kg sample sizes are considered appropriate for the style of mineralisation drill core samples were freighted by road to the laboratory sample preparation was conducted at the independent iso 9001 certified and iso 17025 accredited bureau veritas commodities canada ltd laboratory vancouver bureau veritas samples were dried at 650c and crushed to 95 passing 4 75 mm and the split to obtain up to 1kg sub sample which was pulverised using lm2 to produce a pulped product with the minimum standard of 95 passing 106µm duplicate samples were collected from crush and pulp samples at a rate of 1 20 duplicate results show an acceptable level of variability for the material sampled and style of mineralisation periodic size checks 1 20 for crush and pulp samples and sample weights are provided by the laboratory and recorded in the acquire database quality of assay data and laboratory tests assaying of drill core samples was conducted at bureau veritas all samples were assayed for 59 elements using a 4 acid digestion followed by icp aes icp ms determination method ma250 gold analyses were determined by 50g fire assay with icp es finish method fa350 carbon and sulphur were determined by leco method tc000 and mercury using aqua regia digestion followed by icp es ms determination method aq200 sampling and assaying quality control procedures consisted of inclusion of certified reference material crms coarse residue and pulp duplicates with each batch at least 1 20 assays of quality control samples were compared with reference samples in the acquire database and verified as acceptable prior to use of data from analysed batches laboratory quality control data including laboratory standards blanks duplicates repeats and grind size results are captured in the acquire database and assessed for accuracy and precision for recent data due to the limited extent of the drilling program to date extended quality control programs are yet to be undertaken whereby pulped samples will be submitted to an umpire laboratory and combined with more extensive re submission programs analysis of the available quality control sample assay results indicates that an acceptable level of accuracy and precision has been achieved and the database contains no analytical data that has been numerically manipulated the assaying techniques and quality control protocols used are considered appropriate for the data to be used for reporting exploration drilling results verification of sampling and assaying sampling intervals defined by the geologist are electronically assigned sample identification numbers prior to core cutting corresponding sample numbers matching pre labelled sample tags are assigned to each interval all sampling and assay information were stored in a secure acquire database with restricted access electronically generated sample submission forms providing the sample identification number accompany each submission to the laboratory assay results from the laboratory with corresponding sample identification are loaded directly into the acquire database assessment of reported significant assay intervals was verified by re logging of drill core intervals and assessment of high resolution core photography the verification of significant intersections has been completed by company personnel and the competent person

meet our updated group fy22 guidance which reflects the addition of brucejack and our operating and financial performance to date with the cadia sag mill motor operating at full capacity and an improved performance at lihir gold and copper production increased for the third consecutive quarter driving the continued decline in our all in sustaining cost it was also very pleasing to see further reductions in our injury rates and progress made against our sustainability commitments in march 2022 we completed the pretium acquisition adding the world class brucejack mine to our already exceptional asset portfolio generating immediate gold production and cash flows this quarter we have commenced the early stages of our three phase transformation program at brucejack to maximise its long term potential and unlock further value for our shareholders we are also focused on exploring the significant near mine extensional and district scale opportunity across the brucejack district the excellent drilling results released today already support the potential for significant resource growth beyond the valley of the kings deposit as well as expanding the footprint of high grade mineralisation at golden marmot said mr biswas overview gold production was 10 higher than the prior period5 driven by higher mill throughput at cadia following completion of the sag mill motor

of 4 1 recordable injuries per million hours was an improvement on the prior period with visible felt safety leadership and other improvement plans continuing to be an ongoing focus gold production of 150koz was 30 higher than the prior period driven primarily by higher mill throughput with the sag mill returning to full capacity in december 2021 following its successful replacement and upgrade in the prior period gold head grade also increased in the quarter with a higher proportion of high grade stockpile fed to the mill to reduce stockpile levels following the sag mill motor replacement in the prior period mining rates were also impacted by a scheduled underground shutdown in march 2022 cadia s aisc of negative 205 oz was significantly lower than the prior period driven by higher gold and copper sales volumes and a higher realised copper price copper concentrate shipments were disrupted by the partial closure of the rail network in new south wales following significant rainfall during the quarter the rail network reopened in late march 2022 with additional rail services being utilised to transport the copper concentrate backlog to port heavy rainfall continues in the region however stock levels are expected to return to normal volumes during the june 2022 quarter4 commissioning of the molybdenum plant was completed during the period with the focus now on ramping up mill throughput and improving recovery the first molybdenum concentrate shipment is scheduled for the june 2022 quarter which will deliver an additional revenue stream for cadia and a by product credit to aisc4 in march 2022 cadia commenced early consultation with the community for a proposed modification to the footprint of the southern and northern tailings storage facilities the modification also includes construction of a new access road realignment of an existing road and other minor infrastructure changes in addition it includes an option to potentially restart the ridgeway underground mine which could provide further optionality of ore supplies pending further studies reviews and assessments16 the two stage cadia expansion project is on track for completion during the september 2022 quarter with key activities well progressed including the development of panel cave 2 3 increasing mill capacity to 35mtpa17 improvements to enhance gold and copper recovery and other associated

head grade and recovery reflecting an increase in higher grade expit ore feed from phase 15 as mining progressed into the orebody this was partly offset by lower mill throughput due to planned and unplanned shutdowns there was a significant improvement in mined volumes in phase 14 compared to the prior period despite heavy rain continuing throughout the quarter additional pumping capacity is now operating effectively at the bottom of the pit along with an improved set up of the mining benches and other successful water diversion strategies to enable access to higher grade ore lihir have also commissioned two new shovels and the truck re build program is nearing completion which will further improve equipment availability and increase mining rates during the june 2022 quarter mining will continue to focus on phase 14 and phase 15 to increase delivery of higher grade ore to the mill which is well supported by resource definition drilling in these targeted ore zones mill throughput is also expected to improve in the june quarter following completion of a scheduled plant shutdown in march 2022 together with the increased mining rates higher gold head grade and lower maintenance schedule lihir is expected to deliver around the bottom of its original production guidance range 700koz for fy224 lihir s aisc of 1 533 oz was 9 lower than the prior period mainly due to lower site operating costs this was partly offset by higher sustaining capital expenditure and inventory movements associated with an increase in gold in circuit and lower stockpile feed during the quarter the number of covid 19 cases at lihir decreased during the period with the site successfully moving to the endemic phase of covid 19 resulting in reduced isolation requirements and improved productivity

prior period driven by lower recovery and mill throughput following unplanned downtime to the sag mill during the quarter combined with freezing of a tailings line this was partly offset by higher grade as expected in the mine plan red chris aisc of 1 537 oz was 5 lower than the prior period driven by higher gold and copper sales volumes a higher realised copper price and lower sustaining capital expenditure drilling continues to expand the footprint and continuity of the higher grade mineralisation at east ridge which is outside of newcrest s initial mineral resource estimate and strike extents of this prospect remain open to the east and at depth the latest drilling results for red chris are included in the march 2022 quarterly exploration report which was also released today fruta del norte ecuador newcrest acquired the gold prepay and stream facilities and an offtake agreement in respect of lundin gold inc s fruta del norte mine for 460 million in april 2020 in the march

newcrest has updated its group guidance for fy22 following completion of the pretium transaction on 9 march 2022 and to reflect its operating and financial performance to date key changes to group guidance are outlined below gold production is expected to be higher reflecting the addition of brucejack for newcrest s period of ownership and the expectation that lihir will deliver around the bottom of its original production guidance range 700koz for fy22 production from fruta del norte is also expected to be higher reflecting actual performance for the nine months to 31 march 2022 and newcrest s estimated attributable production for the june 2022 quarter based on lundin gold s cy22 guidance 6 all in sustaining cost is expected to be lower reflecting the benefits of a higher realised copper price and the weakening australian dollar against the us dollar on australian dollar denominated operating costs this is partly offset by the addition of brucejack for newcrest s period of ownership in fy22 production stripping sustaining and non sustaining is expected to be lower due to reduced activity at lihir and red chris major capital non sustaining and exploration

for the red chris block cave feasibility study are also expected to be awarded in the next quarter with the feasibility study on track for completion in the second half of fy234 the latest drilling results at red chris are included in the march 2022 quarterly exploration report which was also released today havieron western australia the havieron project is located 45km east of newcrest s telfer operation and is operated by newcrest under a joint venture agreement jva with greatland gold plc newcrest holds a 70 interest in the havieron project and has an option to acquire an additional 5 joint venture interest at fair value newcrest continued to progress the process to determine the option price for the 5 interest in accordance with the jva during the period the development of the exploration decline continued to experience poor ground conditions during the quarter with 313 metres complete as at 20 april 2022 advance rates have been significantly impacted by unfavourable geotechnical and hydrogeological conditions requiring extensive local and surface dewatering pre excavation ground treatment and substantial ground support installation changes in the design of the decline have been made bringing the first downward spiral to the current chainage which will allow the decline to transition into better ground conditions at depth sooner as a result of this change development rates are expected to improve towards the end of the next quarter first ore is now expected in the second half of fy244 previously anticipated during fy24 work is ongoing to understand the impact on the overall project schedule as well as assessing options to recover some of these delays and minimise the associated cost increases newcrest is also reviewing the impact of inflationary pressures on future capital expenditure and operating costs as part of the feasibility study further updates will be provided once this work is complete drilling of the blind bore shaft is now complete and liners have been installed to design depth this milestone marks a significant reduction in risk to shaft stability during construction key contracts for the havieron feasibility study have been awarded and works to progress the necessary approvals and permits required to commence the development of an operating underground mine and associated infrastructure are ongoing the growth

png government to progress permitting of the wafi golpu project and obtain a special mining lease several meetings have been held between representatives of the png government and the wafi golpu joint venture regarding the potential terms of a mining development contract which is required for a special mining lease the discussions have covered a range of fiscal and non fiscal matters and continue to be constructive exploration see the separately released quarterly exploration report for the march 2022 quarter sustainability update newcrest continued to progress its sustainability commitments during the period the development of the group net zero emissions roadmap continued to progress and will outline the key steps for newcrest to deliver its goal of net zero carbon emissions by 2050 scoping and planning for the trials and studies to support the roadmap are currently underway other key initiatives for fy22 are progressing in line with expectations including ongoing actions for the site greenhouse gas management and site water efficiency plans covid 19 update to date newcrest has not experienced any material covid 19 related disruptions to production or to the supply of goods and services the number of covid 19 cases at lihir decreased during the period with the site successfully moving to the endemic phase of covid 19 following a thorough risk review including extensive consultation with the png government and local lihirian community since adopting this approach case numbers have remained low and productivity has improved with an increase in workforce availability following reduced isolation requirements while some project activities have experienced a level of disruption efforts have been made to minimise their impact on the overall cost and schedule newcrest continues to maintain strong covid 19 controls at lihir focusing on containment through testing contact tracing isolation procedures and continuation of the vaccine rollout there remains a risk of covid 19 further impacting production at lihir and this continues to be closely managed covid 19 cases have also been recorded at cadia red chris telfer and brucejack during the quarter with no material impacts to production however some project activities have been disrupted as previously highlighted all of newcrest s operations have business continuity plans and contingencies in place which seek to minimise disruptions to the operations in the event that a significant number of operational employees and or contractors contract the virus it is expected that these plans will enable operations to effectively manage the covid 19 risk to production schedules and if there are any material impacts newcrest will inform the market in line with its continuous disclosure obligations as previously announced newcrest expects that the total cost of managing covid 19 for the 2022 financial year will be in the order of 50 60 million up from the 35 45 million estimated at the start of the financial year the increase in covid 19 related costs is driven by lihir and reflects the impacts of government restrictions on travel absenteeism isolation requirements and logistical challenges

human rights lawyer and environmental activist steven donziger was released on monday after serving 993 days under house arrest stemming from his decades long fight against the global oil industry and chevron s industrial poisoning of the amazon rain forest and the people who live there after he walked free from his apartment in new york city for the first time in more than two and a half years donziger tweeted it s over just left with release papers in hand completely unjust that i spent even 1 day in this kafkaesque situation not looking back onward donziger has been subjected to a vindictive campaign against him by the us district court in manhattan including disbarring him in new york state and sentencing him to 45 days in jail and home confinement on trumped up contempt of court charges two new york city federal court judges who have close ties to the us oil industry retaliated against donziger for his legal victory against chevron in an ecuadorian court in 2011 the class action lawsuit resulted in 9 5 billion in damages awarded to 30 000 farmers and indigenous people who live in the lago agrio oil field in northwestern ecuador speaking to gizmodo on monday donziger said i am exhilarated to be able to live fully again extremely excited to be able to make the normal choices people in a free society get to make i m also stunned that i just spent two years and seven months of my life in detention in retaliation for my work in the climate justice field amnesty international along with the un high commissioner for human rights called donziger s arbitrary detention a violation of international law daniel joloy senior policy adviser at amnesty international said following donziger s release he should have never been detained for even one day as it has been clear the whole process against him has been in retaliation for his human rights work that exposed corporate wrongdoings joloy added that donziger s release is not the end of the injustices against him and others corporations must not be allowed to continue abusing the us justice system to silence and intimidate human rights defenders or anyone else exposing their wrongdoing donziger began his work to expose the criminal industrial practices of texaco acquired by chevron in 2001 in ecuador in 1993 the giant us oil corporation which was founded in 1902 and expanded into oil exploration and production in latin america by the 1930s began drilling for oil in ecuador in 1964 and between 1972 and 1992 operated oil wells in the northeastern region of the country following the completion of the trans ecuadorian pipeline in 1972 ecuador became the second largest oil producer in south america and joined the organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec originally in a consortium with gulf oil texaco exploited the considerable reserves in the jungle of ecuador and over 20 years pumped 1 7 billion barrels of oil from the lago agrio fields following the restructuring of the ecuadorian oil industry and the creation of the national oil corporation petroecuador texaco s contract expired in 1992 and was not renewed during the two decades however the us based oil monopoly destroyed the ecological systems in the region by dumping 16 billion gallons of toxic wastewater into the rain forest causing water pollution soil contamination and deforestation the class action lawsuit that was launched in 1993 and became associated with donziger sought to force texaco to clean up the area and provide for medical care for the 30 000 inhabitants who were suffering from significant health issues including a wave of cancers miscarriages and birth defects texaco initially responded to the crisis in the 1990s by making an agreement with the ecuadorian government to spend 40 million in a faux clean up operation in exchange for being released from liability donziger and a group of attorneys brought their class action lawsuit in new york city and the corporation responded by saying the remaining problems were the responsibility of petroecuador after chevron bought texaco in 2001 the us court agreed to move the case to ecuador in exchange for a promise from the corporation that it would accept the decision of the ecuadorian judicial system donziger then participated in a campaign to inform the people of ecuador about the devastating impact of the pollution in the amazon region by the oil corporation this included appearing in a documentary in 2009 called crude which reviewed two years of the case and exposed the corrupt practices of chevron in attempting to manipulate the ecuadorian courts a provincial ecuadorian court found chevron guilty in 2011 and awarded the class action plaintiffs 18 billion on appeal the verdict was affirmed all the way up to the ecuadorian high court the national court of justice although the damages were reduced to 9 5 billion of course chevron then immediately reneged on its promise to abide by any ruling in ecuador first by moving its assets out of the country the plaintiffs then filed enforcement actions in canada brazil and argentina seeking to confiscate chevron s assets while these efforts were unsuccessful in 2018 the permanent court of arbitration in the hague ruled that the ecuadorian judgment should not be recognised or enforced by the courts of other states this was followed by counter litigation launched by chevron against donziger in new york city using the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico to bring a raft of charges against him including racketeering extortion wire fraud money laundering obstruction of justice judicial bribery coercion witness tampering and arranging for experts reports to be ghostwritten with us district judge lewis a kaplan assigned to hear the rico case filed by chevron against donziger a judgment was rendered that the company could not be forced to pay the ecuadorian award in the us donziger responded by pointing out that judge kaplan should have recused himself because he held shares of chevron stock appeals filed by donziger against some of judge kaplan s pretrial rulings were upheld by the second circuit court of appeals and the charges of contempt against him were filed while his appeals are still pending when donziger was ordered by the judge to turn over his computer and other electronic devices to chevron so the company could search them for evidence he refused donziger has vowed to continue the fight against chevron he told democracy now on tuesday that the campaign for the people of ecuador was strengthened during his detention he explained we re ready to move on to the next part which is really try to get the judgment that the people of ecuador won complied with by chevron so they can clean up the toxic pollution on their ancestral lands that s where we re going to be focused now

bill hwang the enigmatic investor behind one of the most spectacular trading debacles in wall street history was arrested wednesday morning over what federal prosecutors characterized as a vast criminal scheme to mislead banks and manipulate markets a year after the collapse of hwang s private investment firm archegos capital management sent shock waves through global finance prosecutors provided their first full account of what happened inside the firm and new details about the scale of hwang s trading and the origins of his strategy hwang was charged with fraud and patrick halligan the chief financial officer of archegos was also arrested and charged with fraud if convicted of all charges hwang faces as many as 380 years in prison both men pleaded not guilty in a lower manhattan courtroom wednesday and were released on bail the collapse of archegos hwang s family office that was virtually unknown even on wall street exposed gaping holes in how major banks manage their risks as well as in how regulators oversee wall street a year on credit suisse ag among others is still coping with the fallout hwang s spectacular gains and losses extended to such well known stocks as entertainment giant viacomcbs inc the two men were charged with 11 criminal counts including racketeering conspiracy market manipulation wire fraud and securities fraud according to an indictment unsealed wednesday the u s securities and exchange commission and the commodity futures trading commission filed related civil complaints as well some of the allegations made by prosecutors have been known since archegos s implosion such as hwang s use of swaps to keep the fund s stock positions below 5 to avoid triggering required disclosures and his misleading banks about his portfolio composition and the specific stocks he wagered on but authorities wednesday revealed the extent of the fraud hwang allegedly inflated the value of his portfolio from 1 5 billion to more than 35 billion in one year and brought the total size of archegos s market positions including borrowed money to a whopping 160 billion at its peak not business as usual the scale of the trading was stunning damian williams the u s attorney for the southern district of new york told reporters wednesday this was not business as usual or some sophisticated strategy it was fraud the documents also reveal a shift in hwang s investment process that began after his move to remote work with the covid 19 pandemic spending more time communicating with traders than analysts prosecutors also allege that hwang coordinated certain trades with a close friend and former colleague at an unnamed hedge fund to maximize his market impact the fund manager identified only as adviser 1 is tao li the head of teng yue partners bloomberg reported wednesday li an acolyte of hwang s and teng yue haven t been accused of wrongdoing and the firm didn t respond to messages seeking comment bill hwang is entirely innocent of any wrongdoing his lawyer lawrence lustberg said in a statement there is no evidence whatsoever that he committed any kind of crime let alone the overblown allegations that pervade this indictment lustberg said hwang had been cooperative with investigations into archegos the cfo s lawyer mary mulligan said in a statement pat halligan is innocent and will be exonerated with his sweptback salt and pepper hair and donning a face mask green turtleneck and tan pants hwang appeared in court wednesday afternoon to enter his not guilty plea he agreed to pay 5 million in cash and pledged two properties to secure a 100 million bond while halligan agreed to 1 million bail both men agreed to restrict their travel the indictment said archegos s positions were inflated with the use of borrowed money and derivative securities that required no public reporting when the market turned against the positions in march 2021 hwang directed the fund s traders to go on a buying spree in an attempt to prop up their price federal prosecutors charged in addition to hwang and halligan the u s named william tomita and scott becker former senior executives at archegos as conspirators they have pleaded guilty and are cooperating with authorities the men who were named as defendants in the sec suit have also agreed to work with the cftc and sec speaking at a white collar crime conference in new york wednesday morning deputy u s attorney general lisa monaco said the case against hwang 57 and halligan 45 really typifies and exemplifies the focus we are placing on holding individuals accountable when it comes to corporate crime and when it comes to corporate malfeasance archegos imploded after amassing a concentrated portfolio of stocks by using borrowed money it collapsed after some of the shares tumbled triggering margin calls from banks which then dumped hwang s holdings banks lost more than 10 billion prompting the departures of several senior executives and probes into the way firms monitor the risks run by their businesses serving hedge funds fortunes diverged among the firms that archegos dealt with credit suisse nomura holdings inc and morgan stanley incurred some of the steepest losses others including goldman sachs group inc wells fargo co and deutsche bank ag escaped relatively unscathed prosecutors said hwang and halligan repeatedly made materially false and misleading statements about archegos s portfolio of securities to numerous leading global investment banks and brokerages which encouraged them to trade with and extend credit to archegos the government said authorities said hwang was aware that archegos could move the market in june 2020 when an archegos analyst texted him whether the increase in viacomcbs s stock price that day was a sign of strength hwang responded no it is a sign of me buying followed by a tears of joy emoji in addition to viacomcbs which has since been renamed to paramount global the securities allegedly manipulated by hwang were discovery communications inc tencent music group texas capital bancshares inc and rocket companies inc the criminal conduct allegedly involved concealing and deceiving the true size of the fund s positions liquidity and concentration from counterparties by spreading the trades around with several different banks when the banks began asking the fund about the size of its positions it typically claimed any single holding was no more than 35 of its capital in truth prosecutors said its holdings in viacom at one point were equivalent to 96 of its capital it also involved buying up shares purely to keep their price aloft prosecutors charged the scheme began to unravel on march 23 of last year prosecutors said the day viacom announced a secondary stock offering shares began to decline in anticipation of more stock coming onto the market viacom was such a key holding to archegos that hwang attempted to defend the price by engaging in an extraordinary amount of trading in an effort to overpower the market though halligan questioned the strategy hwang told his traders to just keep working the orders according to the indictment the effort failed prosecutors said hwang typically invested through cash equity purchases until the size of his positions approached 5 of the outstanding shares of a company once it neared that threshold he would then switch to a new method of trading to avoid public disclosure of his holdings using a so called total return swap he would then enter into contracts with banks that would pay out if share prices increased but impose costs if they went down in some cases his positions equated to more than 50 of the outstanding shares of the companies he invested in according to the indictment they lied a lot u s attorney williams said wednesday they lied about how big archegos investments had become they lied about how much cash archegos had on hand they lied about the nature of the stocks that archegos held they told those lies for a reason so that the banks would have no idea that archegos was really up to a big market manipulation scheme
and how often is protesting your appraisal successful and what kind of reduction is possible example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video dallas are you ready for a fight you in one corner the appraisal district in the other if so calm down and consider an emotion free fact based approach to protesting your property tax appraisal experts including dallas realtor ben lauer say part of a successful effort is how you approach appraisers for informal protests and appraisal review boards for formal protests they don t want to deal with contentious people so when you re talking to them be nice this is a human being said lauer with so many appraisals increasing by so much this year keeping a level head may be especially crucial this time around there could be a record wave of protests in texas this year so those hearing the challenges will likely already be getting an earful how to make your case for a lower property tax appraisal so the latest installment of how to in 22 how to make your case for a lower property tax appraisal and you should think of it as building a case and gathering evidence you want to tell them the story of your individual home s value remember mass appraisals are done with computer programs appraisers didn t exactly study your individual house in detail lauer points out that they used sales of comparable homes around you they say well this area went up x amount and so your house went up x percent he said many homeowners might feel intimidated about protesting probably not long after you received your appraisal more mail started arriving from firms offering to fight your appraisal for you some of them offer the service in exchange for a fee others offer to fight your appraisal and only collect a percentage of the amount they get it reduced before signing up with any firm look online for ratings from others if they have a better business bureau profile check that it will include a complaint history also ask around on neighborhood social sites and ask friends family and neighbors you likely know quite a few people who have protested in the past and can recommend a company or warn you about their prior experience realtor ben lauer is once again offering a free service to help homeowners who are considering a protest we just make sure that you re not being over assessed said lauer he is concentrating again on dallas county and this year he is also expanding to include homeowners in collin and rockwall counties too click here to go to the site lauer has set up to walk homeowners through the process important note lauer expects many people will take him up on his offer so he insists anyone who is interested must go through the instructions on the site prior to may 1 more helpful information about property tax appraisal protests in my full interview with ben lauer here realtor chandler crouch who has become notorious for helping tens of thousands of people protest their appraisals each year is also offering his services free of charge again but only for homeowners in tarrant county here is the site he has set up to assist homeowners with the protesting process things to keep in mind if you protest your appraisal remember any realtor can help you find sales of nearby homes comparable to yours make sure they are looking at sales that go all the way back to jan 1 of 2021 since your value is based on all of 2021 since prices consistently escalated as the year went on some of the sales prices from earlier in the year may have been lower and lower prices for homes around you benefit you when you are trying to convince appraisers that the value is not as high as the one they assigned to your property if you protest you are entitled to know from the appraisal district which homes they re comparing yours to ask for that information it may already be on the central appraisal district s website when you look up your address and your appraisal go look at those homes to see if they are substantially different from yours maybe they are situated on a greenbelt or a golf course and your house is next to a loud busy highway and a huge radio tower lauer and crouch say you want to explain your flaws lauer said things like if your fence is falling over and you ve got deferred maintenance or there s cracks inside take pictures of any worn out or damaged parts of your home if you have expensive repairs that need to be done you might consider getting estimates to prove that your home needs costly work or if you have recent estimates or estimates that were made last year those might suffice too if you made major repairs this year but the damage was there even part of 2021 find the receipts and make that part of your case proving that in the year your home was appraised it had damage or flaws that would have reduced its value you have limited time to appeal as the texas comptroller pointed out in most cases you have until may 15 or 30 days from the date the appraisal district notice is delivered whichever date is later see more info and read the faqs about that here why this may be the best year yet to protest your property tax appraisal realtor chandler crouch shares more of his expertise on best practices for protesting your appraisal he joined us on our y all itics texas political podcast this week and offered a lot of valuable insight listen here crouch said that it s often the case that you can do a lot less work and get the value down with just an informal meeting with the appraiser that may be especially true this year if we see the record deluge of protests some are predicting lauer noted that the more people who file protests the more pressure it will create for reviewers to work expeditiously since they have to meet deadlines so there is that motivation for them to just get it through and get it done said lauer crouch has the same take i think your odds of winning this year are higher than ever before just because they are trying to churn through the numbers they want to make you happy so they can get you out of their office and get to the next person how often do protests succeed and how much do they typically knock off not all central appraisal districts are very responsive when i ask them for exact figures on this but let s get to two that are collin county and denton county in collin county last year 27 195 protests made it to the appraisal review board almost half of them 13 068 resulted in a change in valuation in denton county they say that out of about 90 000 total protests 70 80 had a reduction in value lauer who has helped many homeowners with their protests said i think we knocked about 40 000 off the originally assessed value on the average person that we disputed last year one easy thing you can do to lower your property tax burden your property tax appraisal value will eventually be multiplied by the tax rate set by the various taxing entities where you live to determine your property tax bill homeowners have an easy and unique way this year to lower their property taxes in the future on the ballot for local elections on may 7 there are two propositions here is a plain english explanation of what they would do one proposition would allow for a reduction of property taxes for elderly or disabled persons the other would increase the homestead exemption from school district taxes which would be an added savings in property taxes for all texas homeowners who have gotten a homestead exemption on their property

maggioncalda thanks cam and good afternoon everyone today i m pleased to share that coursera had a strong first quarter of 2022 as we celebrate 2 significant milestones first this month marks the 10 year anniversary of andrew and daphne s bold experiment and it is inspiring to reflect on our evolution over the past decade what began as a few popular computer science programs on the internet has grown into a global learning platform where anyone anywhere has the power to transform their life through learning for a decade coursera s catalog of world class content and credentials has broadened access to educational opportunity allowing individuals across the world to learn from anywhere the pandemic worsened inequality across the world but the legacy of the pandemic could do the opposite over the past 2 years online learning accelerated and we were ushered into a new world of remote and hybrid work with online learning anyone anywhere has more equal access to learning opportunities and with remote work anyone anywhere has more equal access to job opportunities that s why we believe that the combination of online learning and remote work hold the promise of a more just world increasingly learners are coming to coursera for high quality affordable education that can unlock access to high quality jobs even if those jobs are not in their city their state or even in their country this brings me to the second milestone i m excited to report that we have surpassed more than 100 million registered learners coursera s 1 goal has been and always will be to serve learners our world class catalog of branded content and credentials helps our learners discover build and demonstrate job relevant skills required by employers to address the evolution of work as you ll hear in this quarter s highlights and more importantly in the slate of public announcements planned in connection with coursera s conference next week we re working with our ecosystem of partners and institutions to broaden access for more learners for more countries around the globe this is how we intend to deliver on the promise that andrew and daphne imagined 10 years ago turning to our results in q1 we grew revenue 36 to 120 million this was our 12th consecutive quarter growing above 30 which we believe reflects our differentiated business model and admittedly strong tailwinds that have propelled the growth of our business our diversified offerings and global distribution to individuals businesses governments and campuses exposed us to multiple growth levers being driven by the need for new skills in a rapidly changing digital world let s discuss the latest on the key trends that we see at play the first major trend is digital transformation the forces of technology globalization and increasingly remote and hybrid work are transforming industry after industry the impact of these forces have amplified the criticality of technology and digital tools caused businesses governments and campuses to redefine the way that they operate and reshaped both the supply and demand for jobs globally in its simplest form this ongoing transformation has created an accelerated rate of change that we believe will be a permanent feature of our increasingly digital world the requirement for all of us to keep pace with this accelerating change leads to my second major trend skill development businesses are rapidly automating jobs that are repeatable and predictable while investing to upskill reskill and benchmark their talent developing a competitive workforce requires that employers better understand the skill proficiencies of their team members while creating both internal and external talent pipelines to fill in demand roles governments are looking to scale up their public sector employees and prepare their citizen workforce for a growing knowledge economy while addressing unemployment was one initial use case we are seeing larger more strategic national and statewide initiatives focused on developing equitable workforces and driving long term economic growth campuses are realizing that they must enhance the quality of their offerings ensuring that students graduate with job relevant skills and deliver stronger employability outcomes more cost effectively and just about every individual in every job will need to keep learning throughout their life to stay relevant in a changing workforce we believe this new hybrid model of adult learning and work will require a flexible affordable and responsive system of higher education that can keep pace with skill requirements as they evolve this leads me to the third trend driving our business the transformation of higher education and adult learning more broadly as technology and automation accelerate a changing skills landscape a new and inclusive lifelong learning model must meet this challenge with rapid speed and scale technology is a key driver of change but it is also the means by which society is adapting with online education and remote work but technology is only part of the solution adapting to change will also require institutional collaboration between academic institutions industry leaders and governments to meet the needs of this new digital world that s why we frequently speak about the importance of coursera s 3 sided platform which connects learners educators and institutions in a global learning ecosystem our platform has 3 distinct advantages that we continue to deepen and scale first are the leading educator partners including world class universities and global industry leaders who ve created a vast catalog of branded content and credentials and the second is the global reach of coursera and the third is the data and technology that powers our unified platform let s discuss recent highlights for each of these first educator partners more than 250 educator partners have come to coursera to teach the world and we re proud to have recently welcomed more in the middle east we added 3 top tier universities bringing our total number of partners in the region to 8 these include al faisal university in saudi arabia khalifa university in the uae and the jordan university of science and technology the upcoming courses created by these universities have been curated to align with the region s broader skills development agenda in particular equipping learners with the essential digital skills they need to contribute to a growing knowledge economy in addition to bringing on new partners we also expanded our relationships with existing partners pontificia universidad catã³lica de chile or uc chile has announced 4 master s degree programs on coursera these programs build on the success of their 35 open courses to now provide spanish speaking students with world class degrees in business analytics data science investments and applied finance and global public health next the university of illinois announced 2 stackable graduate certificates the certificates created by the gies college of business stack directly into their 3 existing master s degree programs providing learners with job relevant skills today and the building block toward a degree in the future finally hubspot a longtime coursera industry partner with several existing courses launched its first entry level professional certificate the sales representative certificate prepares the learner for a new or growing career in sales this includes hands on projects using hubspot s crm software to apply skills as well as the creation of a portfolio to present to future employers this is our 19th entry level professional certificate and sixth industry partner to offer a credential in this rapidly expanding category we are excited to share more on our catalog in connection with next week s coursera conference coursera s second major advantage is the global reach of our platform we have consistently added approximately 5 million registered learners each of the past 6 quarters additionally we ve grown the number of paid enterprise customers to over 900 institutions this large growing learner base attracts educator partners looking to teach both individuals and institutions around the world but it also provides a unique set of advantages that allow us to compete differently first our high quality premium content enables us to attract learners at low cost and serve them at a range of price points as these learners look to progress in their careers we aim to maximize lifetime value with premium credentials from our partners including specializations professional certificates and college degrees from accredited universities second our learner base provides leads for our rapidly growing enterprise channel and third the rich data generated by our learners including catalog performance learner insights and feedback from our institutional customers enable our business customers to benchmark their talent and our educator partners to prioritize the content and credentials that they create for their students now our final advantage the ongoing product innovation on our unified platform the coursera learning platform includes several core capabilities that are leveraged globally across our offerings and segments they include our sales and marketing system the broad catalog of content and credentials our technology and tools and the data generated by millions of worldwide learners including our proprietary skills graph these capabilities allow us to build products features and services that better meet the needs of our learners let me share a few recent examples last week we announced an exciting new chapter for coursera immersive learning experiences powered by augmented mixed and virtual realities we are working with the university of michigan one of our first university partners to create 10 extended reality or xr courses exclusively on coursera these new courses will embrace xr technology to provide a new level of learning immersion including a social learning environment for role playing simulations and the ability to expand the access and affordability of practical skills training in higher risk fields such as mobility manufacturing and health care training the first 3 courses are scheduled to debut in early 2023 importantly all courses will be accessible on mobile devices requiring no vr headset to benefit learners worldwide next we announced an expansion of levelsets for our enterprise customers as the rate of innovation accelerates the development of new skills will be imperative levelsets provides businesses with deeper visibility into the skills of their workforce and the ability to create tailored development paths for employees the initial levelsets offering announced this past fall enabled skill assessments of more than 20 data and analytics focused skills the recent expansion grows this assessment capability to more than 60 skills allowing employees to test proficiency in other domains such as technology finance and marketing finally we introduced our content ingestion solution for educators last year which significantly reduces the time needed to author and launch a course on coursera more than 110 courses from over 25 partners have been ingested to date and we recently enhanced the functionality to include self service canvas ingestion a more efficient way for educators to import their existing content and courses from one of the most popular learning management systems our learning platform has expanded significantly over the past 10 years but we believe the transformation of higher education is just getting started with many opportunities to drive growth in coursera s next decade let me highlight some of the key strategies for growth that we re focused on first we will continue to invest in our fast growing enterprise segment focusing on both new customer acquisitions and expanding existing relationships this quarter i d like to share 2 recent coursera for government deals in march we announced our largest workforce development partnership to date with the milken center for advancing the american dream the 3 year initiative is designed to prepare 200 000 americans from underserved communities to enter well paying digital jobs while earning credit eligible towards a college degree at no cost to the learner it includes 8 of our entry level professional certificates from industry partners as well as degree pathways to partners like the university of north texas wraparound student support services and job opportunities through the partners hiring networks next we shared earlier in the quarter that coursera is partnered with k mooc and the national institute for lifelong education to launch a nationwide upskilling program in south korea through this partnership learners across south korea will have access to 70 job relevant korean language courses from top university and industry leaders worldwide including yale google and deeplearning ai the program supported by the ministry of education aims to help thousands of adult learners in korea on the k mooc platform to develop the high demand digital skills needed to advance their education or career in the new economy in each of these programs 3 key features of coursera play a critical role including our scale and reach particularly our ability to serve an entire state or nationwide workforce initiative the collaboration between academic institutions industry and government fostered by our 3 sided platform and the world class content and credentials from leading university and industry brands these programs demonstrate coursera s distinctive ability to deliver on the promise of online learning at scale second we are investing in the beginning stages of growing our degrees segment with several focus areas in the years ahead they include expanding our program catalog including the types of degrees offered and a greater variety of subject matters and languages growing the number of students in current programs and continuing to expand our pathways for learners with increasing stackability and removing admissions barriers with innovations like performance pathways our third area of growth we will continue to broaden our entry level professional certificate catalog sourcing new partners and expanding with existing industry leaders working with our partners we re adding features like degree and career pathways as well as securing ace credit recommendations across the catalog and finally we will continue to scale the coursera platform investing and growing our registered learner base increasing our network of educator partners and their content and credentials and expanding our reach into more countries and to more learners around the world and now i d like to turn it over to ken kenneth hahn thanks jeff and good afternoon everyone i m pleased to report we had a strong first quarter with results that reflect the durable demand we continue to see for high quality online learning in q1 we generated total revenue of 120 4 million which was up 36 from a year ago on the sustained strength in our consumer and enterprise segments as jeff and i have discussed there s a global trend of both individuals and institutions increasingly turning to online learning to supply the digital skills required to compete in today s economy for individuals our broad catalog of job relevant content and credentials from recognized world class brands is helping to meet the needs of learners no matter the stage of their career and for institutions products like our skillsets academies and levelsets powered by the data from millions of coursera learners worldwide are helping businesses governments and campuses better understand the in demand skills of today and where they need to invest for tomorrow please note that for the remainder of the call as i review our business performance and outlook i will discuss our non gaap financial measures unless otherwise noted our non gaap adjustments remove only stock based compensation and related payroll tax nothing else gross profit was 78 2 million or 64 9 gross margin up 58 from a year ago this margin was nearly 9 percentage points higher than the prior year period due to the drivers we ve discussed in the past several quarters as a reminder there are 2 components of our cost of services first is our content costs which vary based on both the revenue mix amongst our 3 segments as well as the content margin rate within each segment our enterprise and degrees segments accounted for 43 of our overall revenue mix this quarter up a couple of percentage points from the prior year additionally we have continued to enjoy the positive changes in the consumer segment content margin our consumer segment content margin rate increased from 57 in the prior year to 71 this quarter learners have continued to consume a larger proportion of industry partner content which tends to have a lower than average content cost this positive variance also impacted the enterprise segment content margin although less pronounced the second component of our cost of services is our noncontent costs which were 9 4 of total revenue this quarter total operating expense was 92 9 million or 77 of revenue compared to 71 in q1 of last year sales and marketing expense represented 38 of total revenue up from 35 in the prior year period as we invest more in expanding our enterprise sales force capacity and marketing programs research and development expense was 23 of revenue in line with the prior year period on a percentage basis and general and administrative expense was 16 of revenue up from 13 in the prior year period given incremental costs associated with being a public company remember we were a private company in q1 of last year net loss was 15 8 million or 13 1 of revenue and our adjusted ebitda loss was 11 million or 9 1 of revenue now turning to cash performance and the balance sheet free cash flow was a use of 42 2 million compared to 8 6 million in the prior year with the decline driven primarily by the timing of receivables and incremental year end vendor spend paid in q1 so primarily working capital related much of which we expect to reverse in future quarters we continue to maintain a strong cash position and expect to end the year with approximately the same cash balance with which we began as of march 31 we had approximately 780 million of unrestricted cash cash equivalents and marketable securities with no debt now let s discuss our segments in more detail our consumer segment continues to grow rapidly at scale with attractive economics consumer revenue was 68 1 million up 31 from the prior year we continue to see strong demand for our job relevant portfolio of entry level professional certificates and the ongoing adoption of our coursera plus subscription offering segment gross profit was 48 3 million or 71 of consumer revenue as we continued to benefit from a lower content cost rate associated with higher consumption of industry partner content and we added another 5 million new registered learners for a total base of 102 million next is enterprise enterprise revenue was 39 million up 59 from a year ago on broad strength across the business government and campus customers the total number of paid enterprise customers increased to 917 up 91 from a year ago and our net retention rate for paid enterprise customers was 109 segment gross profit was 28 million or 72 of enterprise revenue up from 68 in the prior year and finally our degrees segment degrees revenue was 13 3 million up 11 from a year ago on an increase in student cohorts in new and existing programs given the extended revenue model for degrees the slower start to the year was consistent with our expectations outlined in our previous earnings call in february our total number of degrees students grew 22 from a year ago to 16 481 as a reminder there s no content costs attributable to the degrees segment so degrees segment gross margin was 100 of revenue now on to our financial outlook for q2 we are expecting revenue to be in the range of 128 million to 132 million this represents a growth rate of 27 at the midpoint of the range for adjusted ebitda we re expecting a loss in the range of 15 million to 18 million our q2 outlook for adjusted ebitda includes an approximately 2 3 million impairment expense related to the likely partial sublease of our mountain view office with a nonbinding loi which we expect to consummate in lease but it is not guaranteed in the spring of 2020 we moved to a work from anywhere strategy for our global team members resulting in complete flexibility for our workforce and the ability to source and retain talent from anywhere in the world as a result we are optimizing our facility footprint after 2 years of learning and observing allowing us to redeploy capital to accelerate our work from anywhere strategy and provide additional programs for in person connection for full year 2022 we will see a net benefit of the sublease in q3 and q4 so that the total impact is about 0 5 million for the year in 2023 and 2024 we ll see a benefit of about 6 million with much of the savings expected to be redeployed to fuel our talent strategy and elevate the coursera workforce experience now our outlook ranges for full year 2022 we anticipate revenue to be in the range of 538 million to 546 million or 31 growth at the midpoint of the range this updated full year outlook reflects approximately 2 points of headwind resulting from the suspension of business in russia announced in early march we manage coursera for high growth across our business however we will not look to profit from operating in the region amid this humanitarian crisis so in summary we are still increasing the midpoint of our revenue range despite absorbing these impacts given the strong start to 2022 and for adjusted ebitda we re expecting a loss of 45 5 million to 51 5 million or a negative 8 9 adjusted ebitda margin at the midpoint of revenue and ebitda guidance ranges our messaging and operating framework with regards to the ebitda margin has been consistent we plan to demonstrate scale and leverage while targeting ebitda margin improvement over time at the start of the year we set an annual ebitda margin target and work within that plan to maximize our growth opportunities for instance a significant investment in marketing our job relevant credentials particularly our increasingly successful portfolio of entry level professional certificates we do not optimize the business for any single quarter and we will strategically invest throughout the year to position coursera for the long term before jeff s closing comments let me recap the 3 key highlights of our financial framework first we have a unique set of strategic assets that allow us to compete differently second we expect to have increasingly better forward visibility on our top line in the years ahead as our mix of revenue evolves and third in addition to our rapid growth we expect structural gross margin expansion over the long term we believe that our results continue to reflect a differentiated business model that benefits from our 3 sided platform it provides diversification and exposure to multiple levers of growth and it provides us with a unique vantage point that encompasses the needs of learners employers and educators in order to promote institutional collaboration and navigate the trends shaping higher education i ll now turn the call back to jeff jeffrey maggioncalda thanks ken at coursera we believe that learning is the source of human progress and we are committed to ensuring that learners everywhere have access to the highest quality education before we open up the call to questions i want to highlight 2 recent initiatives first we announced several actions that we are taking to support learners in ukraine amid the growing humanitarian crisis these include partnering with the ministry of education and science of ukraine to offer coursera for campus for free to all ukrainian higher education institutions and their students to date 7 000 learners at 95 ukrainian academic institutions have logged over 40 000 hours of learning on coursera we re also making our coursera for refugee program available for free to nonprofits actively working to support ukrainian refugees we re also offering individual learners the ability to receive financial aid or scholarship waiver through the coursera platform second in march we announced that coursera has joined forces with the u k prime minister boris johnson and 10 other partners including accenture microsoft pearson pwc and others to deliver a gbp 20 million initiative to improve girls access to education and employment in developing countries this is the u k s first partnership of its kind the girls education skills partnership will deliver high quality skills training to around 1 million girls initially in the countries of nigeria and bangladesh the initiative will focus on stem skills needed for in demand sectors like technology and manufacturing with coursera providing 10 000 scholarships for our entry level professional certificates at no cost the u k government believes that private sector involvement will help to ensure that the training delivered corresponds to the requirements of employers and our entry level professional certificate catalog is precisely designed to help prepare these learners with no college degree or industry experience to enter digital careers this is how leading institutions on coursera are moving from ideas to action technology is one part of the solution but it also requires institutional collaboration bridging public and private sectors university and industry partners and national and regional borders to meet the needs of our evolving world together we are providing greater access to world class learning and more equal opportunity for all together we are moving humanity forward and with that let s open up the call to questions thank you question and answer session operator with that we ll take our first question this afternoon from rishi jaluria with rbc rishi jaluria wonderful wanted to start by looking at the nrr within the enterprise segment obviously enterprise continues to show nice growth but that nrr figure did tick down a little bit from q4 q4 itself was down from earlier in the year can you maybe help us understand some of the drivers of that number how much of that is comps versus maybe just mix shift and going more towards government that might have a slower expansion rate and then i ve got a follow up jeffrey maggioncalda yes rishi this is jeff it s a few things there s a little bit of it is institutional deals in russia that we have suspended and so that s part contributor and then you kind of put your finger on it the different types of enterprise deals that we have with businesses with governments and with campuses are at different levels of maturity so one of the things i will say is that the nrr is not the same among those 3 and i guess what i would say generally is in segments where we are earlier to market and customers are experimenting with different use cases of how to use the content on coursera to provide the learnings that they want to provide some are more standard and mature and more predictable and we they have a problem we deliver it and it s pretty predictable in others it s a little bit more sort of experimentation and they re trying this or trying that sometimes it works a little bit better sometimes it doesn t so i think part of what it s reflecting is the early stage of some of these markets in the enterprise space rishi jaluria great that s really helpful and then on the degrees side i just wanted to turn to looking at the students surprisingly it looks like that number actually was up about 280 sequentially in spite of you shutting off a number of universities in russia and that was a big surprise to us can you maybe talk a little bit about what you re seeing within that segment outside of russia and specifically within u s universities and then maybe any insight you d be able to share on what you expect in the coming academic year which would fall under this fiscal year jeffrey maggioncalda yes no problem so it definitely is the case that we are seeing what has historically been true which is that degrees generally are countercyclical when there s a really strong labor market people will sometimes defer their expensive more expensive long term education credential investments and go into the labor market and make more money in a job we are seeing some of that we think in the u s like you said russia is clearly what it is we suspended our operations there in other non u s non russia markets we re still in the earlier stages but we ve got degrees in latin america for a while we just announced a couple more and we are not quite seeing the same kind of headwinds because i think the economies and employment rates are in different sort of levels of intensity the u s i will say is exhibiting those countercyclical qualities that they have before i mean clearly there s a lot of job availability and that s showing up across the board in the u s across many providers and higher education institutions in the u s operator we ll take our next question now from josh baer at morgan stanley joshua baer i wanted to ask a couple on margins we ve sort of gotten used to seeing the consumer segment margins coming in higher than expected driven by the professional certificates mix in the enterprise segment that jumped quarter over quarter year over year what s causing that big swing up in enterprise segment part 1 and part two on margins is beyond the mix of professional certifications is there anything else that you re doing more proactively to work on the segment margins are you taking on more parts of the content generation process that would potentially have more favorable economics and revenue share for you jeffrey maggioncalda yes ken kenneth hahn josh it s ken yes thanks a lot great questions so firstly well firstly we ve enjoyed this margin expansion far earlier than expected so the trending has been really nice and consumer has continued to i guess unexpectedly though we should start to expect it done well the on the enterprise side it s really a lot of the same it s consumption which is how we measure and how we allocate the cost to our partners or their revenue our cost it s based on consumption so we continue to see these higher margin specializations continue to be more popular and hence drive up the margin because they have a lower content cost so really enterprise to a lesser degree the same result as the consumer but it s based on content usage whereas consumer it s purchasing secondarily on the mix and what we re doing even within consumer we are starting to do a few things differently certainly as these certs have taken off we ve looked to do more certs there s it s amazing how well it s done but we have also started to think based on that success about sponsoring more of the content helping pay and so those are other things we do that can drive the margin up over time and i expect we ll continue to do it it makes it easier lower risk for some of the partners and for us it s proprietary which is not usually where we go but proprietary content so anyway that s a little bit more on what we re doing there joshua baer got it and then just wanted to clarify or highlight maybe some of the comments on the cash balances ending 22 i mean with some capex in there is that sort of an implicit guidance for positive operating cash flow for 2022 kenneth hahn it s to be honest we re not trying to be exactly precise on it what we ve been saying is we burned minimal cash last year we expect that to continue to be the case on the operating side there is a mix though of still stock exercises and stock sales we ll do some incremental investment in some of our programs that may end up on the balance sheet so roughly yes i d agree with your statement but i just want to be clear our intent is not to be that precise we have 800 780 million in the bank and we have minimal cash burn we re solving for growth but as a result in seeing with the growth we re seeing and some of the leverage we re seeing yes we expect the cash burn to be minimal on the opex side it s not an immediate focus but that s the result we re seeing operator we go next now to terry tillman at truist securities terrell tillman yes jeff and ken congrats on the consumer and enterprise strength and just all the color on this call there s a lot of detail really much appreciated i have two questions the first one actually has two parts and maybe it s for you jeff anything you can call out in terms of certificate strength that s like really kind of surprising you and outlier oriented and then the second part of that first question is just where are we with coursera plus and any more kind of quantification on the kind of success you re having and then i have a follow up for ken jeffrey maggioncalda yes really quickly on the certificate strength it is as we ve talked about a major factor that s been driving good performance of consumer segment revenue growth part of that is good conversion characteristics it looks like people who are thinking about switching careers have a little bit more intent to not just watch a 10 minute video but to really learn skills to get in a new job and they d like to have a credential that they can show to an employer that says hey i don t have a college degree i don t have any experience in this prior experience in this industry but i completed this course of study i ve learned the skills over the course of maybe 4 or 5 courses with the professional certificate i ve got the certificate that says i ve demonstrated my skills increasingly we have projects built into them where there s a portfolio of work that someone can show to land that job and i think that those learners are more likely to buy and more likely to retain and so part of what we re seeing is a margin enhancement because as we talked about we invest a bit more in producing these we ve seen better conversion rates we ve been seeing better retention rates on the question of coursera plus i think we continue to see interest in that as people are maybe thinking about switching careers they re not sure what career they want to get into but they just know they want more flexibility in their job and they want higher pay they might explore 3 different jobs or careers and so that would be a consumption across multiple professional certificates for which coursera plus really helps so yes we re seeing that are there any particular outliers i mean obviously google it support certificate was the first back in january of 2018 they have followed that up with 3 additional certs in the first quarter of last year they continue collectively to do really well but we are really excited about the number of jobs for which we now have professional certificates and these professional certificates have been increased we mentioned hubspot but the number of different brands and different domains that are helping prepare someone who wants to switch jobs to a greater range of possible career options all of which are digital jobs that pay well they don t require a college degree they don t require prior experience and increasingly the skills can be learned online and the jobs can increasingly be done online so we re just really leaning into these sector tailwinds that we don t think are going to abate anytime soon all right and then maybe one for ken you said terrell tillman yes ken i m going to ask you the real hard question in terms of the net revenue retention there was a question on it i think jeff maybe you talked about it look there s actually 3 tails to that story in terms of the 3 different parts of the enterprise business and they do have varying kind of retention rates and just different kind of maturity dynamics but as we look through the rest of the year should we expect maybe kind of stability is that what you re modeling for nrr or could it drift a little lower or maybe just a little higher just any color there would be helpful kenneth hahn yes sorry firstly it s something difficult to forecast but we ve looked at the numbers i d expect it around where it is now for the rest of the year most importantly that mix that jeff was talking about in the area that s newer hence most volatile almost by definition that s growing quite rapidly and so my guess is we ll stay right around these levels the other businesses as we start to grow the other businesses on a relative basis i think we ll start to see some expansion there but i d look for that a year out i would tag on however to the conversation around coursera plus just to give you a little bit more data we talked about it being 25 of consumer revenue a couple of quarters ago i think is when we were talking about that and at the time we said look we re not focused we re happy with the result it s done a lot for visibility around the business and really utility for the consumer if you think about the economics around that pricing and as jeff mentioned it s been driven a lot by people wanting to see multiple career related specializations and so that has continued to grow we re seeing north of 30 there now of consumer revenue so again nice from a stability standpoint and visibility standpoint on the consumer segment we re not forecasting that going up or down necessarily but we re really very very pleased with that result jeffrey maggioncalda yes one other thing i ll just add terry that might not be obvious to folks there s obviously a lot of content out there that s pretty obvious the vast majority is short form content created by lots of different people it turns out it takes a lot of money to build a full college degree that this is a 2 year program it also is a considerable investment to build a 5 course professional certificate that s not short form that s not something that a bunch of individuals will sort of piece together there s a really nice sort of i think combined effect of long form learning to get into a new career that creates higher monetization longer persistence and also it s a more distinct type of content and the credential matters because you re trying to get into a job that s where the brands matter so another reason we really like these professional certificates is they re pretty distinctive they re not the only things in the world that kind of are bigger than a 30 minute video and shorter than a college degree but we re seeing a really nice big segment of long form credential branded learning for career advancement that we re leaning into pretty hard operator we ll go next now to stephen sheldon with william blair stephen sheldon so the consistency of registered learner growth i think has been pretty notable so it would be great to get some more detail on maybe 2 things one what s kind of working on the marketing side to support this and how you re finding learners or i guess maybe it s more that they re finding you and then two anything notable about the location and demographics of recent learner additions or has it been pretty broad based jeffrey maggioncalda yes i think that with respect to registered learner growth it s been interesting to watch some of the other big announcements during this earnings season and those are those that are more subject to kind of stay at home activities seeing some headwinds as i think the pandemic gets under more control and people go outside and they re doing relatively fewer things online than they were doing during the midst of the lockdown we are seeing some of the same things too i mean i think that to some degree the consumer revenue growth does not reflect a lot more people coming to coursera than say during the pandemic i think it shows the kinds of things that are coming from the propensity to pay the propensity to persist are higher that being said what seems to be working has been what s working in the past we do not spend very much money on paid marketing we never have now you look at the content fees and the reason we pay the content fees is we have these great partners with great brands who are investing money and building courses and putting it out there the videos can be seen by individuals for free that free high quality content just watching the videos not the credentials draws a lot of people to coursera and then also the urls the authors of this content have very high domain authority on search engines and so when they back link to their courses we enjoy some of that benefit and so i would say that seo and other organic means of attracting learners continues to stay quite strong because we don t really want to be spending too many dollars in the paid media business because it s pretty tough out there to be buying customers these days you asked about the location i don t think that there s really any major tilt in any region ken you see anything on that kenneth hahn exactly it s been fairly even across the board i think the one thing i d highlight is india and asia pac have been growing a little bit faster than the other 3 but it s been relatively evenly distributed the overall growth stephen sheldon got it yes that s really helpful and then just as a follow up i just would love an update on where you guys are at in terms of expanding the availability of local language content on the platform jeffrey maggioncalda yes so there s a few different ways that we do that the easiest the least expensive highest volume way to do it is with machine learning and there are certain language pairs that are easier to translate with machines and there are certain domains that are easier to translate as well where the language is more commonly used by people that the big cloud companies use to train all their algorithms what we are mostly doing is creating subtitled language pairs using machine learning and that is good and getting better we have like 5 000 no maybe 3 000 in arabic most of those have been done through machines on the subtitle side there are often cases where big institutional customers want the full course to be translated with a high degree of accuracy in those cases we ll use human translation services of the full course that and that includes assessments and everything else those are a lot more expensive i don t know that that s ever going to become a really high scale activity for us i think what you re going to find and what we re counting on is the machines get better and better and better and the humans become less and less important in this process i will say and this is as a strategic matter the core part of our catalog with all these great global brands most of whom teach in english we re not going to try to replicate every major title natively in every language that we just don t think that is very cost effective but also it really forfeits the ability on quality and brand to do that we d much rather do translations of these big global brands and then supplement it with shorter form native language content and so what we ve been doing more and more of that s working quite well is the big content that longer form branded content we ll translate subtitles and then we ll pair it with native language say 30 to 60 minute hands on projects by a subject matter expert in region who can crank out the local context with local tools and the local language local businesses et cetera and we could do that at dramatically lower cost and so it s a bit of a bifurcated language strategy that we ll be taking on that counts a lot on machines to do better and better at this so we feel pretty good about where we re going we do think that these techniques will open up larger and larger markets with higher quality and low cost operator we ll go next now to brian peterson with raymond james brian peterson so jeff there were a lot of partnerships that you guys announced this quarter and the michigan one is near and dear to my heart but curious on i guess the breadth of the number of i guess university partnerships that you may look at for degrees and how has that changed versus a year or 2 ago and i know you expanded or enhanced the canvas partnership there what do you think the impact could be of that enhanced data ingestion jeffrey maggioncalda yes it s interesting but at a really big level brian the basic idea we made a strategic bet well before i got here 5 years ago it was really daphne and andrew at the very beginning when they launched coursera they launched coursera with 5 universities from its inception coursera has been an institutional play and they believe that institutions have a number of things that they do well one is of course having the resources and the brand to create high quality content but we re also finding obviously that institutions are a great way to reach a lot of people so the kinds of so we have lots of institutional partnerships on the content side it s the brands that and the institutions that create the content on the distribution side it is working with governments and also working at multiple levels so we mentioned the ministry of education in ukraine is connecting us with each academic institution in ukraine that then connects us with learners who have been displaced in ukraine and then you can imagine which we see let s say in the philippines where we re working with government agencies who coordinate with businesses who coordinate with campuses to make sure that the educational policies and skill development is producing graduates that the businesses really want so and what s happening now what we re sort of seeing is more and more institutions are coming to us because they want to play in some part of this institutional ecosystem on the authoring side with these professional certificates you can imagine with the great resignation and the interest in especially tech companies of training up developers and certifying them and also being known in multiple societies as job creators they want to be in the education business of course businesses who are helping upskill their employees are seeing a great competitive advantage to upskilling and then campuses are like yes we re in the education business too and we got to move online so it s really a wide range of reasons why institutions are partnering with us you mentioned the degree partnerships we are seeing more interest in degrees more nationally i think the u s was ahead of everybody else to some degree with online traditional online program managers i think other countries post pandemic are starting to see wow we should be offering online degrees as well in india there s a lot of regulatory support for creating online degree programs and so we re seeing some tailwinds there canvas is a different kind of sort of institutional relationship where we re really looking at the ability to more easily allow institutions to get content that they created in one system to get it into our system and so that s really more about lower cost and faster hosting publishing of content on coursera because it was created on one platform that we can just ingest it more quickly and get it available to learners on the coursera platform brian peterson understood and maybe just a follow up there on coursera for government you mentioned some more large wins this quarter i m curious how many of those like large or let s call it 6 figure learners are in the platform are those i guess are we seeing more of these large deals like go up in the pipeline i m just curious to get your thoughts there jeffrey maggioncalda yes i do think that part of what s happening i mean we could talk about institutions kind of one institution at a time with certain universities the university will do a deal with us and each school has a different dean and they ll sometimes start with one school and like a business school will say hey i need to teach my business school students java and computer science well the professors over the other school aren t really available to teach those students and so we re seeing a lot of multidisciplinary applications within the university on the government side what s interesting is you take a set of institutions like academic institutions and those things are a system a higher education system and so what we re starting to see is not only institutional leverage and change but system level leverage and change where a ministry of education can say hey i want to try to upgrade 50 institutions at once i m going to change policy i m going to help support this financially and i want to make sure that my entire higher ed system is starting to avail themselves of the kinds of workforce development and other job related skilling that you guys can do online that maybe my system of higher education would take longer to accomplish and that systems level change is where we re seeing the moes the ministers of education come more into the picture and yes we are this is like this is a pretty interesting phenomenon and it really i think we are seeing an unrelenting pace of acceleration in digitization in the world and institutions including institutions that are responsible for systems of institutions are saying we need to move more quickly to be responsive to this global change and we are again we re leaning right into that operator we go next now to eric sheridan with goldman sachs eric sheridan maybe i wanted to follow up on the conversation from last quarter where you talked about wanting to lean in against investments for the longer term because you continue to see the opportunity set continue to expand and you talked a lot about the learner base and how that creates a flywheel effect can we get an update on how you re thinking about balancing investments versus harvesting for profitability against the growth opportunity for the long term we noticed that continues to come up as a pretty consistent investor debate broadly across all of technology but i wanted to bring it back to what we talked about last quarter thematically jeffrey maggioncalda yes sure eric and i ll start kind of with the way we re thinking about it and then ken you can maybe just go through what that might imply for some of the ratios but we are continuing to invest in the longer term ken and i have a very like mind as does the board we just met with the board yesterday i think we had a board meeting we all want to make sure that we re pacing ourselves for growth i mean we want to invest when we know that there s going to be a reasonable time frame and a reasonable certainty of path on that growth we are growing well so we re continuing to invest fairly aggressively you look at our r d as a percentage of revenue you compare it with a lot of other folks we re not just a content company like we don t think that content is going to be the way that you win it s content it s credentials it s content from big brands and it s also a lot of technology that supports sort of institutional scale administration measurement of skills benchmarking of skills and things like that we are brian mentioned michigan we are starting to lean into some new pedagogies associated with vr and xr technologies of course we re investing in sales force because we see a big opportunity across many regions and business and government and campus so that s a pretty big investment there but i would say maybe i ll turn it over to ken that we re trying to invest in those areas of most growth some of them like this xr were a little bit ahead and it might not pay off for a while we think we can afford to do this and ken maybe you could just talk a little bit about what that might mean for some of the operating margins and percentage of revenue as we go through the year kenneth hahn sure no and i ll do because we never stop reminding on how we think about and how we manage the company for profitability it s based on an ebitda margin for the year and so we continue to evaluate our investment opportunities during the year we spend more or less in a given quarter and we tend to update that as you know and as we exhibited last year but it was true even when we were a private company we tend to throughout the year make adjustments to get to the final goal as we look at some of the opportunity and to jeff s point i think the most important thing is we don t want to constrain the growth but we re certainly building the business to scale it s incredibly important as jeff said we re in complete alignment in how to think about that as is the board and we re getting to a point where the scale is going to start to create margin expansion whether we want it or not and so i do think we re going to see more scaling as we go into next year and we d consider this year if we continue to overachieve as we did in the past but it s we don t want to commit to any of that on the front end because if there s growth opportunity there where we can have meaningful competitive advantage and start to win these markets we ll continue to invest again expect improvement no matter what but it s just the rate of improvement that we re going to monitor and really maximize around the growth operator and ladies and gentlemen we have time for one further question this afternoon and that question will come from ryan macdonald with needham ryan macdonald congrats on a great quarter impressive to look at the reiteration of the outlook despite a two point headwind to growth given the macro environment here i d be curious maybe for ken as well to understand how you think about the 3 segments of growth i believe last quarter we talked about sort of 20 50 and 20 across the 3 segments obviously some strong outperformance on the consumer side but maybe you can perhaps give us an update and if there s any updated thoughts on how you think of that segment to growth rate and perhaps maybe what segments are expected to feel the brunt of that headwind kenneth hahn sure well relevant question as we rolled out some guidance to try to be helpful for everybody as they put models together for the year so that you were in our shoes and knew how you thought about our view on the different segments one of the things i think we emphasized was we didn t expect to have ongoing 3 segment guidance but we can still give you a little color because it s been consistent with what we have expected we ve continued to do great on the consumer side it s kind of the standout in the space frankly enterprise continues to be a robust market we re really excited about each of the 3 subverticals and what they re doing there degrees has not been as strong from a growth perspective but we told you that was going to be the case last quarter so nothing s changed what we said on the degrees side specifically is that the first two quarters we expect it to be slower and then approximately a 20 growth rate for the year plus or minus again we won t reiterate guidance but i think in the near term it will be shorter but that s how i think we re feeling similar to where we were three months ago it s early in the year operator and mr macdonald did you have anything further sir we lost your audio cam carey so we can wrap up the q a for today great so a replay of the webcast will be available on our investor relations website along with the transcript in the next 24 hours we appreciate you joining us today operator and again ladies and gentlemen thank you for joining us and that will conclude today s coursera s first quarter 2022 earnings conference call you may now disconnect

this press release we may refer to shell s net carbon footprint or net carbon intensity which include shell s carbon emissions from the production of our energy products our suppliers carbon emissions in supplying energy for that production and our customers carbon emissions associated with their use of the energy products we sell shell only controls its own emissions the use of the term shell s net carbon footprint or net carbon intensity are for convenience only and not intended to suggest these emissions are those of shell plc or its subsidiaries shell s operating plan outlook and budgets are forecasted for a ten year period and are updated every year they reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next ten years accordingly they reflect our scope 1 scope 2 and net carbon footprint ncf targets over the next ten years however shell s operating plans cannot reflect our 2050 net zero emissions target and 2035 ncf target as these targets are currently outside our planning period in the future as society moves towards net zero emissions we expect shell s operating plans to reflect this movement this press release may contain certain forward looking non gaap measures such as cash capital expenditure and divestments we are unable to provide a reconciliation of these forward looking non gaap measures to the most comparable gaap financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those non gaap measures to the most comparable gaap financial measures is dependent on future events some of which are outside the control of shell such as oil and gas prices interest rates and exchange rates moreover estimating such gaap measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort non gaap measures in respect of future periods which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable gaap financial measure

jeff cioletti has a job that many will envy he s a professional drinker more accurately he s a professional writer who focuses on the drinks trade a long time magazine editor and journalist and contributor to all about beer magazine as well as a filmmaker and world traveler the new jersey native has just released his first book the year of drinking adventurously and sat down over a few cocktails to discuss the state of the drinks world john holl describe the book what can people expect when they buy it and start to dig in jeff cioletti it s really a breezy guide conversational not pedantic for people who want to expand their drinking horizons we ve all had that point in our lives when we either had no clue what to order at a bar or were just so overwhelmed by the number of unfamiliar choices that we retreated to our not so exciting comfort zones i decided to structure it across a single year there are 52 chapters each one represents a different drink for each week of the year it covers everything from the different whiskey traditions to more obscure beverages like japan s sake and shochu china s baijiu and chicago s malört there are also some chapters on beer that offer styles beyond what many consider mainstream you have an extensive professional background writing about drinks and spirits but what surprised you while researching and writing this book how much there still was to learn there were so many things that i ve taken for granted particularly about the history of some of these beverages take something as accessible as whiskey for instance whiskey s in the midst of a colossal renaissance at the moment and the styles that most connoisseurs have been gravitating to have been things like bourbon rye and scotch but interestingly there was a time into the early 20th century when irish whiskey was considered the best of the best it kind of got overshadowed by scotch by the mid 20th century luckily though it s become one of the fastest growing styles led by jameson and now drinkers are looking to dive deeper into that category that s creating an opportunity for modern irish distillers enabling it to slowly return to its former glory i was also surprised by just how much of a role context plays in the drinking experience for instance i was never much of a rum person but get me in a tiki bar and i m in love with it same thing with mulled wine i was never crazy about it when we d heat red wine on the stove and add spices like cinnamon and clove but take me to an outdoor holiday market in germany austria or switzerland and there s nothing i would rather drink than a steaming cup of gluhwein standing at a highboy table when it s 20 degrees out the title of the book especially drinking adventurously seems to indicate that by in large people are timid drinkers is this the case and if so why there are different levels of timidity i guess there certainly are well rounded drinkers out there who are open to trying a lot of things but for the most part they still have their comfort zone they gravitate toward one beverage more than others and often become experts on that particular drink that s kind of how i used to be with beer when i first discovered amazing beer craft specialty whatever you want to call it i immersed myself in that world learned as much as i could about it and traveled to many places overseas with the sole purpose of drinking good beer at the source but at the same time i was shutting myself off from spirits and other beverage categories ultimately my tastes evolved and i opened myself up to other drinks but before that i actually considered myself an adventurous drinker because i was always trying new beers in style categories that varied wildly but i really wasn t because i was still cocooning myself in that beery comfort zone the same holds true for anyone who s an expert on whiskey gin wine cider what have you they may be so devoted to one category that they re putting the blinders on about others so that s a form of timidness whether we care to admit it or not and then of course there are the folks who never gave much thought to what they were drinking or were too shy to expand beyond the simple like a vodka tonic or vodka cranberry that s kind of the person i was in the late 90s i was still new to the world of legal drinking and i wanted to break away from the really cheap beer i drank in college so for me a basic gin and tonic sounded like a grownup drink trouble was it was a well drink i really didn t care what kind of gin was going in the glass and in those days there weren t many options anyway and of course since it was the cheapest drink you could by it was incredibly watered down i honestly didn t even know what gin tasted like i figured it tasted like quinine because all i was getting was the tonic and the ice water and i was too timid to ask for a good recommendation i was probably a little indifferent too i didn t think alcohol was supposed to be such a complex flavor experience the fact that it very much is one of the key takeaways i hope in the book if someone spends the next year working through the book taking each chapter as a lesson what should they expect by this time next year they should have a better understanding of what they like and what they don t like and perhaps be surprised by things they thought they d never like believe me no one s going to like every drink in this book some of the drinks i d say are actually pretty hard to like but it s more about taking that leap and trying something new whether it s the most delicious thing you ve ever experienced or gut wrenchingly vile by the time the holidays roll around next year they ll probably have a pretty impressive liquor cabinet for their home entertaining when they re out for a drink they ll probably find themselves scanning all of the bottles behind the bar some of what s back there may seem like old friends by then they re also likely to impress their bartenders a bit being able to converse authoritatively about much of what the bar has in stock that ll lead to a better rapport which often will lead to preferential treatment that could mean better drinks it also means that if they get a special bottle in that s hidden below the bar or in the back room they re more likely to let you in on the action getting into the busy holiday gathering season what is one simple thing people can do to elevate their drinking experience or show off some great hosting skills on the entertaining side i usually want to be best friends with the people whose assortment of bottles makes my jaw drop i was at a halloween party a few weeks back at the home of a couple i didn t know too well when i saw the vast and impeccably curated collection of whiskeys beers gins bitters ciders they had i told them they should ve been the ones writing my book as far as going out and enjoying the season at a cozy bar find a place that has not just a printed wine list but physical well appointed spirits and beer lists if it s a place that only has a beer and wine license make sure the beer gets the same kind of fanfare that the wine gets those are the types of places that take their beverages seriously and they love serving people who do as well and there s probably no better holiday gift than a bottle of something amazing you just have to drop the right hints to santa john holl is the editor of all about beer magazine

may 2 2022 4 41pm et story updated last month the commodity futures trading commission cftc sought public comment on a request from ftx us to modify its derivatives clearing organization dco license to offer a new kind of crypto margin trading to u s retail customers ftx us is requesting the ability to use a new kind of non intermediated model of crypto derivatives trading meaning there is no intermediary used to hold customer s funds as crypto exchanges typically take collateral from the customer directly the ftx us model would directly custody the margin from retail customers and liquidate positions held by the exchange on a 24 7 365 basis under the ftx us model the customer s positions will be reviewed for potential margin calls every 30 seconds sam bankman fried the ceo of ftx recently described this model to congress as a 24 7 risk engine that is unlike the traditional system where there needs to be separate risk models for overnight weekends and holidays where hours can go by with no ability to mitigate risk to the system the cftc appears to be taking its time in deliberating over the proposed model and confirming these promised benefits with the extension of a public review process that ends next wednesday may 11th from a recent hearing where the ftx us proposal came up congress is expecting the cftc to move cautiously on crypto derivatives market regulation as well below is a timeline of the events regarding the ftx us proposal followed by an interview with brett harrison the president of ftx us timeline january 4 2022 rostin behnam is sworn

without using a fcm intermediary the cftc also announces the reviewing a formal request from ftx us derivatives ftx to amend its registration to modify its existing non intermediated model that currently clears futures and options contracts on a fully collateralized basis to clearing margin products for retail participants while continuing with a non intermediated model the cftc requests public comment on ftx that is set to be due in 30 days march 24 2022 the cftc announces that it is extending the request for public comment on ftx to 60 days moving the due date to may 11 comments can be provided through a link from the cftc and a link with materials that can be reviewed from ftx us is available here march 31 2022 the house agriculture committee holds a hearing called state of the cftc where chairman rostin behnam of the cftc is a witness chairman david scott d ga of the committee opens the hearing with a statement about his love and affection for the world s greatest financial system as well as his background as a graduate of the wharton school of business scott mentions all of this to convey to those watching the hearing can understand the concern that i have with this cryptocurrency situation stated scott house agriculture committee hearing youtube in questioning benham scott notes there is a proposal pending at the cftc by a cryptocurrency exchange that is seeking approval to operate a new and untested exchange and i m very concerned about this very much concerned about this proposal and the broad implications it poses scott further announces that he is organizing a hearing in the house agriculture committee on tuesday may 17 about the ftx us proposal scott noted the hearing will include traditional clearinghouses for derivatives such as the chicago mercantile exchange cme and the intercontinental exchange ice on how they feel about this new method of margin clearing and that he had invited the ceos from both organizations to testify what to expect may 11 2022 this date is the deadline to respond to cftc about the ftx us proposal according to the site where stakeholders can provide comments on the proposal there are an astounding 931 responses posted as of may 2 may 17 2022 the date that scott has promised a hearing with the ceos of the commodity mercantile exchange cme and the intercontinental exchange ice to listen to the traditional clearinghouses provide their views on the non intermediated model of cryptocurrency derivatives margin clearing by ftx us may 25 2022 the cftc announces a roundtable of cftc staff that will meet with stakeholders such as dcos fcms fcm customers end users academics proprietary traders public interest groups and others to discuss the impacts generally of using non intermediated models with derivatives clearing interview with brett harrison president of ftx us brett harrison ftx us jason brett can you tell us about the significance of the cftc s decision to review your application to amend the dca registration that would allow for a new kind of clearing process for derivatives between ftx us and your customers brett harrison the story and the significance hasn t really been picked up but i think it is an important topic of for the crypto industry i think the significance really can t be overstated in crypto 97 or more of that derivatives volume happens offshore or outside the united states and that is because for crypto native companies to be able to offer derivatives in the u s they must obtain the appropriate cftc licenses to be able to offer crypto derivatives products but those licenses can be difficult and take a long time to obtain ftx us obtained the licenses through the acquisition of ledger x but ledger x s license designation required full collateralization of products so the point of our application is to amend the dco designation to be able to remove the need for fully collateralized crypto from the requirements to allow people to post margin and to take leverage on positions and by doing this ftx us will be able to really compete as a derivatives exchange in the u s brett why do you need to modify the license from the cftc how are cryptocurrency derivatives different harrison the way in which ftx conducts derivatives trading with customers is novel in three different dimensions one is what we describe as a direct to retail or direct to customer margin model the way that every crypto exchange in the u s or globally works is that customers onboard with the exchange and they directly post collateral with the exchange when all the collateral is posted directly to the exchange it also allows that crypto exchange to fully measure the risk in the system today it is basically impossible to know the full risk that is in the commodities mercantile exchange cme clearinghouse because the cme relies on the diligence that the futures commission merchant fcm has already done on behalf of their customers for example the creditworthiness of the customers is based on how much the fcm is likely to be able to receive in the case of a margin call that s not the case with ftx us all the collateral is posted directly from the customer to the dco ahead of time number two cme and ice have a daily margining system where the institutions compute the initial margin requirements for the next 24 hours which is once per day five days a week during normal trading hours the ftx us derivatives margin model is proposing to compute that risk every 30 seconds 24 hours a day seven days a week this is real time risk calculation and margining and the strong belief that we hold here is that this will result in a much safer system for financial markets because instead of worrying you are on a position on 3pm on a friday and some catastrophic global event happens on saturday you suddenly must wait 24 48 or 72 hours before margins are going to be reassessed which ultimately results in large dislocations and people being liquidated instead we can liquidate people s positions piece by piece in a continuous fashion we can flush risk from the system again in a continuous fashion and this is ultimately a safer more effective way to be able to manage risk and this is empirically been proven by the fact that we ve been able to operate this model with many billion dollars per day in the overseas derivatives market with ftx where we ve encountered large price movements with assets such as bitcoin btc and ether eth the third dimension is the margin model itself a new market model has not been approved in a very long time and in general it takes a very long time for new margin models to be approved by regulators so having a new margin model approved for us through this exchange would be a significant event not to mention ftx us would be the first crypto native company to be able to offer margin products in the u s with cme you are not able to post bitcoin for collateral you must post cash and so there is a capital efficiency problem if you want to trade bitcoin versus bitcoin futures our aim is to be able to integrate the spot and the derivatives platform together under one roof brett harrison ftx brett is it your opinion that your way is a healthier way for financial markets in general to operate harrison the short answer is ftx us is a safer system a bigger concern is for people who keep waking up at 4am to find that 10 of their position got liquidated it is the farmer who bought a corn future and suddenly because of three days worth of price movements wakes up by monday to find that the price of cows has suddenly moved 10 in a very discontinuous fashion and their entire position gets liquidated at once and the farmer does not have enough time to post more collateral and must basically re enter the position as opposed to being liquidated in small batches in a real time fashion this gives individuals the opportunity to come back and post collateral so ftx us thinks that this is a healthier way of operating markets in general and not just for crypto derivative markets i think that the 24 7 nature of crypto markets results in a much less discontinuous type of events that you see under normal circumstances where large news can come out overnight for securities or derivatives in such a way that people can t express their opinion and enable price discovery and either put on or take off risk in an efficient fashion brett are you hopeful that the 97 of crypto derivatives trading that currently occurs offshore is a benefit to our country harrison for the majority or plurality of the volume trades in the u s think about equity index futures or bond futures so much of that volume occurs in the u s and the strong belief behind this is the u s has some of the best regulated markets in the world investors have the confidence to be able to trade in large quantities at low latencies in a market where they know that there is proper regulation and oversight so by and large it is better and healthier for the global crypto markets and derivative markets in general for that volume to be trading in the u s under the oversight of the u s federal regulators and right now because of ambiguity or difficulty obtaining certain licenses or just historically in how u s regulators approach new products much of that volume is happening offshore and it would be better for the health of the entire ecosystem for a lot of that volume to move onshore into the u s market it does not make sense that only 2 to 3 of the total crypto futures volume is trading in the u s that s what we want to change and so at ftx us we ve been taking an approach by saying we want to be regulated we want to walk into the front door of the regulatory system and get licensed by the existing framework and not wait for something new to happen in the future we want to be licensed now with whatever current paths exists and be able to bring as much of that trading on u s shores as possible brett can you tell me a little bit about yourself for the readers to get to know you harrison sure so i joined ftx us in may of 2021 before we first engaged with ledger x about considering acquiring them my journey to ftx came through sam bankman fried he and i worked together for four years at jane street capital jane street when he was a trader and i was an engineering manager i spent the better part of eight years of my career at jane street my exposure to crypto started when i was exchange trading when they were forming their crypto arbitrage desk and so i went on my separate way for a while and sam went off to start alameda research and later ftx knowing that there was such a large hole in the crypto market in the united states and sam being from the u s he really wanted to engage in the u s market and started ftx us as a separate company to engage in the licensed and regulated path in the u s to be able to eventually offer services like futures and options to u s customers and sam wanted to bring someone in who could help lead those efforts and sort of pull together a proper business here and that s where he first engaged with me and recruited me to come be the president of what is now ftx us brett right thank you so much for your time
