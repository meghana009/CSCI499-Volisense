arizona is forging ahead with its plan to pull the state s funds from blackrock due to concerns over the massive investment firm s push for environmental social and governance esg policies that have led other states to take similar actions arizona treasurer kimberly yee said in a statement released thursday that the state treasury s investment risk management committee irmc began to assess the relationship between the state s trust fund and blackrock in late 2021 part of the review by irmc involved reading the annual letters by ceo larry fink which in recent years began dictating to businesses in the united states to follow his personal political beliefs yee wrote in short blackrock moved from a traditional asset manager to a political action committee our internal investment team believed this moved the firm away from its fiduciary duty in general as an asset manager esg fallout blackrock ceo larry fink should resign says state treasurer in response to those findings yee noted that arizona began to divest over 543 million from blackrock money market funds in february 2022 and reduced our direct exposure to blackrock by 97 over the course of the year yee added that arizona will continue to reduce our remaining exposure in blackrock over time in a phased in approach that takes into consideration safe and prudent investment strategy that protects the taxpayers although the state will continue to hold some blackrock stock through shares in a passive index of the top 1 500 american corporations arizona will have minimal direct exposure to blackrock amounting to less than 1 tenth of one percent of our total assets under management as of the end of november yee said that arizona intends to vote its shares in the index in an effort to change the political activism of blackrock we will continue to fight back against the dangerous path of companies pushing their social issues and wokeism inside of the investment space and return to traditional money management that puts the people first yee s statement concluded blackrock s esg push puts ceo larry fink in activist crosshairs blackrock is currently the world s largest asset manager with roughly 8 trillion under management and is one of several major financial institutions that have led the charge for the adoption of esg standards in recent years the esg movement broadly seeks to promote a green energy transition and left wing social priorities through the financial sector critics of the esg movement argue that its focus on green investments runs contrary to the fiduciary responsibility of firms to pursue the best possible returns for investors blackrock pushed back against criticisms of its investment strategy in a statement to fox business which read in part over the past year blackrock has been subject to campaigns suggesting we are either too progressive or too conservative in how we manage our clients money we are neither we are a fiduciary we put our clients interests first and deliver the investment choices and performance they need we will not let these campaigns sway us from delivering for our clients the statement added in the u s alone clients awarded blackrock 84 billion of long term net inflows in the third quarter and 275 billion over the last twelve months desantis praised for pulling money from blackrock over esg concerns illegal leftist scam the esg policies advanced by blackrock have drawn the ire of some investors and state policymakers alike florida s chief financial officer announced recently that the state s treasury is taking action to remove about 2 billion in assets from blackrock s stewardship before the end of this year in october louisiana and missouri announced they would reallocate state pension funds away from blackrock which amounted to roughly 1 3 billion in combined assets taken together with arizona s divestment roughly 3 8 billion in state funds have been divested from blackrock by those four states alone additionally north carolina s state treasurer has called for blackrock ceo larry fink s resignation and the texas legislature has subpoenaed blackrock for financial documents get fox business on the go by clicking here the investment firm has also taken heat from activists who argue blackrock isn t doing enough to follow through with its esg commitments new york city comptroller brad lander wrote to fink in september citing an alarming contradiction between the company s words and its deeds lander wrote blackrock cannot simultaneously declare that climate risk is a systemic financial risk and argue that blackrock has no role in mitigating the risks that climate change poses to its investments by supporting decarbonization in the real economy blackrock has insisted that its role in the transition is as a fiduciary to our clients and to help them navigate investment risks and opportunities not to engineer a specific decarbonization outcome in the real economy fox business breck dumas contributed to this story editor s note this story has been updated to clarify that arizona s divestment from blackrock occurred in the permanent land endowment trust fund and the state s investment pools not the state s pension plan

luxury retailers like lululemon are beginning to feel the pain of inflation which has been squeezing the budgets of american families leaving little room for luxuries and amenities for years lululemon has been growing by leaps and bounds shaking off the challenges that came on its way including the pandemic recession and it continued to grow in the third quarter of 2022 with sales up 28 senior management cheered the strong demand for the brand in the third quarter we continued to deliver strong and balanced results across the business demonstrating the significant potential for our brand said ceo calvin mcdonald in a statement accompanying the release of financial results mcdonald credited the ongoing sales momentum to the innovative products deep community relationships and the hard work and dedication of our talented teams around the world moreover he expressed his satisfaction with the early holiday season performance and his confidence as the company continues to execute the power of three 2 growth plan we are proud to have delivered another quarter of strong sales and earnings growth despite an operating environment that remains dynamic said chief financial officer meghan frank these results illustrate the strength and differentiation of our omni operating model and position us well to deliver ongoing value for our stakeholders but shareholders weren t terribly happy with lululemon s financial results the company s price of shares on friday declined by 13 what s troubling stockholders is that sales for the quarter didn t grow as fast as management expected leaving 1 7 billion on the shelves almost twice as much as the third quarter of 2021 and that could be a significant financial burden in the future shoppers weren t as thrilled to pay the premium price for the company s merchandise as inflation remains elevated at multi year high and personal debt is soaring in addition with many companies announcing hiring freezes and lay offs some shoppers might have thought twice before heading for the cash register or clicking the buy button on the company s site then there s the possibility that lululemon s customers have joined the chorus of shoppers who have been trading down substituting more expensive brand name products for less costly no brand name products this new economic reality leaves lululemon with one option join other luxury merchants and hold a fire sale to eliminate the excess inventories it s only natural that luxury athletic gear takes a hit said ben waterman co founder and coo at strabo a global portfolio tracker they will be keen to sell the extra come christmas time and the stock may well bounce back in as little as a week stephan schambach founder and ceo of boston based retail tech company newstore thinks wall street overreacted to lululemon s inventory problem excess inventory can force retailers to offer steep discounts to clear their shelves so it isn t hard to understand why the market would get spooked by this schambach said

summary auckland city council could sell its 18 share in auckland airport the mayor no longer considers the airport to be a strategic asset large numbers are being floated but its comparative value could be less than sydney s there is no certainty it would have the support of the local population the airport has been selling off other assets now only one other airport on the books auckland could raise nzd2 billion from the sale of its stake in the airport auckland s mayor wayne brown said at the beginning of dec 2022 that the sale of the council s stake in auckland international airport could raise almost nzd2 billion usd1 27 billion it is not the first time mr brown has spoken of a potential sale recently and last month a mayoral spokesman said that selling airport shares was an option to address the council s financial shortfall as in many other countries the economic impact of covid 19 and rising inflation and interest rates are likely causes impacting the city s revenue base including the airport not regarded as a strategic asset and doesn t offer a seat on the board the mayor does not regard an 18 share in a company that isn t paying dividends to be a strategic asset but others including some councillors may still want to make the case that it is the sale would result in an annual reduction of the debt servicing cost to taxpayers of at least nzd88 million usd56 09 million decreasing the 2023 general rates rise in the city by almost one third and plugging an nzd270 million hole in his first budget the council s airport stake is its largest financial holding with the sale forming part of mr brown s budget proposal for 2023 2024 however the shareholding is too small to give the council a seat on the board thus directly influencing its strategic direction but it is the largest shareholder moreover while auckland international airport ltd aial was floated on the australian stock exchange in feb 1999 making it one of the first gateway airports globally to be listed publicly the city is its largest shareholder although having built up its holding it has reduced it a little latterly to the current 18 another local council manukau is a minority shareholder manukau ward councillor alf filipaina has been quoted as saying previously that he was opposed to selling the council s stake in the airport adding we ve kept the shares because of the benefits the airport brings to manukau and auckland the growing expectation in auckland is that a sale could raise up to nzd2 billion based on the recent share price auckland council s 18 stake is valued at nzd2 166 billion a figure which could vary considerably according to bid speculation or the lack of it aial share price six months to 02 dec 2022 in financial year 2021 revenues were nzd281 million 50 compared to fy2020 and ebitdafi earnings before interest taxation depreciation fair value adjustments and investments in associates ebitdafi is a statistic used mainly in new zealand was nzd171 5 million giving an ebitdafi margin of 61 a figure many other airports in the world would happily aspire to in fy2020 the result was revenues nzd567 million ebitdafi nzd260 4 million margin 46 the earnings multiple might be less than in the case of sydney either set of statistics could be used in calculating what the earnings multiple would be in the fy2021 instance if the sale price matched the market valuation it would be 12 6 times the ebitdafi broadly requiring 12 years of profits to pay back the investment and in the case of 2020 8 3 times both of those figures are lower than the average in the years immediately before the pandemic approximately 18 times annual earnings and stand in contrast to the deal which secured sydney s kingsford smith airport earlier this year that represented a multiple of 44 times its earnings in the year ending 30 dec 2020 and 35 times earnings in the year ending 30 dec 2019 reminiscences of 2007 when it was vastly overvalued the sale talk has dug up the audacious attempt by the fledgling dubai aerospace enterprise dae in 2007 to buy up to 60 of auckland airport at an earnings multiple in the stratosphere of over 60 times which was unheard of at the time the only certainty is that dae would not be returning to revisit its bid although it still exists it opted out of airport investment long ago aial has been selling off other assets aial has been more concerned in recent years with selling off other external assets in mar 2018 it completed the sale of its 24 5 holding in cairns airport and mackay airports in australia via north queensland airports nqa for a total of aud370 million the ceo at the time said that the revenue from the sale would be recycled into supporting the significant investment in aeronautical infrastructure at auckland airport over the next five years and that the sale of our shareholding ensures that we can focus on growing our new zealand travel trade and tourism businesses but of course that was before the covid 19 pandemic and the establishment of new zealand as one of the most locked down and travel restricted countries in the world before then in 2015 auckland council s finance committee had passed a resolution to review the city s financing structure including strategic assets such as the port of auckland and auckland airport the evaluation undertaken by independent consultants considered a partial or full divestment of holdings in the airport as well as leasing arrangements and outsourcing mechanisms so this is not an entirely new situation by any means the proposed sale now is likely to be controversial ratepayers are likely to be happy if 2023 s rates are cut by nearly a third and they are no longer expected to stump up extra cash cutting the ratepayers burden has never been a tool to promote privatisation that was employed in for example the us where airports and their infrastructure are financed differently and where using revenues from a lease would more likely be to shore up pension funds repair the sewers or improve waste disposal services all of those have been proposed in the past in cities like chicago st louis and los angeles in part two of this report capa will consider that the local population may be wary of a sale to the private sector potential interest from infratil that auckland airport acts as the nation s tourism gateway and how capacity is returning only slowly

ma xuejing china daily editor s note the global economy has changed significantly over the past few years in the way that it is organized and governed by collaborating nations these changes have repercussions that not only affect the flow of goods and services between countries but also monetary and financial policies four experts share their views on the issue with china daily world must avoid fragmentation by gita gopinath now is a particularly challenging time for the global economy with the outlook expected to darken in 2023 three powerful forces are holding back the global economy the conflict between russia and ukraine the need to tighten monetary policy amid the cost of living crisis and persistent and broadening inflation pressures and the slowdown of the chinese economy during the international monetary fund s annual meetings in october we projected global growth to slow from 6 0 percent last year to 3 2 percent this year and for 2023 we lowered our forecast to 2 7 percent 0 2 percentage points lower than projected a few months earlier in july we expect the global slowdown to be broad based with countries accounting for one third of the global economy contracting this year or next the three largest economies the united states china and the euro area will continue to stall there is a one in four chance that global growth next year could fall below 2 percent a historical low in short the worst is yet to come and some major economies such as germany are expected to enter recession next year let s take a look at the world s largest economies in the united states tightening monetary and financial conditions mean growth could be about 1 percent in 2023 in china we have lowered next year s growth forecast to 4 4 percent due to the weakening property sector and weaker global demand in the eurozone the energy crisis caused by the russia ukraine conflict is taking a heavy toll reducing our growth projection for 2023 to 0 5 percent almost everywhere rapidly rising prices especially those of food and energy are causing serious hardships for vulnerable households despite the slowdown inflation pressures are proving broader and more persistent than anticipated global inflation is now expected to peak at 9 5 percent in 2022 before decelerating to 4 1 percent by 2024 inflation is also broadening beyond food and energy the outlook could worsen further and policy trade offs have become acutely challenging here are four key risks the risk of monetary fiscal or financial policy miscalibration has risen sharply at a time of high uncertainty turmoil in financial markets could cause global financial conditions to deteriorate and the us dollar to strengthen further inflation could yet again prove more persistent especially if labor markets remain extremely tight finally the hostilities in ukraine are still raging further escalation would exacerbate the energy and food security crisis increasing price pressures remain the most immediate threat to current and future prosperity by squeezing real incomes and undermining macroeconomic stability central banks are now focused on restoring price stability and the pace of tightening has accelerated sharply where necessary financial policy should ensure that markets remain stable however central banks around the world need to keep a steady hand with monetary policy firmly focused on taming inflation the strength of the us dollar is also a major challenge the dollar is now at its strongest since the early 2000s so far this rise appears mostly driven by fundamental forces such as the tightening of monetary policy in the us and the energy crisis the appropriate response is to calibrate monetary policy to maintain price stability while letting exchange rates adjust conserving valuable foreign exchange reserves for when financial conditions really worsen as the global economy is headed for stormy waters now is the time for emerging market policymakers to batten down the hatches eligible countries with sound policies should urgently consider improving their liquidity buffers including requesting access to precautionary instruments from the imf in addition the us could reactivate currency swap lines to eligible countries as it extended at the start of the pandemic this would provide an important safety valve in times of currency market stress too many low income countries are close to or already in debt distress progress toward orderly debt restructurings through the g20 s common framework is urgently needed to avert a wave of sovereign debt crises for china low inflation and weakening growth allow for greater support for vulnerable households which together with strengthening social safety nets would promote consumption the new rules to loosen covid restrictions will help mitigate the policy s economic impact and will be critical to sustain and balance economic recovery in the property sector urgent action at the central government level is needed to safeguard financial stability these efforts will be good for china for the economic well being of the chinese people and good for the world there is one other final risk to global prosperity that should be mentioned over the longer term geo economic fragmentation could undermine the gains from globalization as we know trade has been a key driver of growth and integration we can t now let trade policy become a source of fragmentation which hurts all countries but especially the most vulnerable people and communities guardrails need to be put in place to defend existing avenues of global collaboration and to make progress on climate policies debt resolution and other global issues the global community led by the major economies must step up to put the necessary guardrails in place and prevent geo economic fragmentation the world desperately needs cooperation to tackle key vulnerabilities including climate change food insecurity and elevated debt burdens the author is first deputy managing director of the imf

the world bank has projected that debt servicing will gulp 123 4 per cent of the federal government s revenue in 2023 this was according to a presentation made by the new world bank lead economist for nigeria alex sienaert in november 2022 which was obtained by our correspondent the document was entitled nigeria public finance review fiscal adjustment for better and sustainable development results the document projected that debt servicing would gulp 100 2 per cent of federal government revenue by the end of 2022 this was a decline from the earlier projection in its october africa s pulse report which is a biannual analysis of the near term macroeconomic outlook for the region published during the world bank imf spring and annual meetings in april and october in the africa s pulse report the washington based bank had said that nigeria s debt service to revenue ratio could stand at 102 3 per cent by the end of 2022 it had described the public debt in nigeria as concerning due to the rising debt service to revenue ratio however the situation would be dire in 2023 as debt surviving would exceed 118 per cent of revenue reported in the first four months of 2022 in his presentation document the world bank lead economist for nigeria noted that borrowing more money was not the solution for nigeria the document read borrowing more is not the solution debt costs are rising rapidly squeezing non interest spending debt servicing has surged over the past decade and is expected to continue increasing over the medium term crowding out productive spending the punch recently reported that nigeria s public debt rose to n44 06tn in the third quarter of 2022 with the country struggling with a repayment burden according to a press statement published on the website of the debt management office the total public debt stock rose from n42 84tn recorded in the second quarter to n44 06tn in the third quarter of 2022 this showed that there was a 2 85 per cent increase quarter on quarter with nigeria acquiring n1 22tn debt within three months the dmo said that the increase in public debt was due to new borrowings by the federal government to part finance the deficit in the 2022 appropriation act alongside new borrowings by sub nationals it also noted that the total public debt stock consisted of domestic debt of n26 92tn and external debt of n17 15tn the world bank recently said that nigeria s debt which might be considered sustainable for now was vulnerable and costly according to the washington based global financial institution the country s debt was also at risk of becoming unsustainable in the event of macro fiscal shocks the bank had said nigeria s debt remains sustainable albeit vulnerable and costly especially due to large and growing financing from the central bank of nigeria while currently the debt stock of 27 per cent of the gross domestic product is considered sustainable any macro fiscal shock can push debt to unsustainable levels however the debt to the gdp in nigeria is rising quickly and the total stock of debt in absolute value has almost doubled between 2016 and 2020 and without a policy change is expected to reach 40 per cent of the gdp by 2025 the bank further expressed concerns over the nation s cost of debt servicing which according to it disrupted public investments and critical service delivery spending speaking at the launch of the world bank s nigeria development update titled the urgency for business unusual the minister of finance zainab ahmed had admitted that nigeria was struggling to service its debt she said already we are struggling with being able to service debt because even though revenue is increasing the expenditure has been increasing at a much higher rate so it is a very difficult situation a professor of development macroeconomics at the university of lagos prof olufemi saibu criticised the government for over borrowing he said i think we are over borrowing we continue to rely on international benchmarks which make us lazy in terms of revenue generation
treatment sequencing post hoc analysis of outcomes in patients treated with any cellular immunotherapy including yescarta in third line further support previously reported zuma 7 study data showing benefit of earlier second line treatment with yescarta additional analysis reports improved outcomes with yescarta versus standard of care across both high and low levels of metabolic tumor burden santa monica calif business wire kite a gilead company nasdaq gild today announced findings from two new analyses of the landmark zuma 7 trial of yescarta axicabtagene ciloleucel the largest and longest follow up of a car t cell therapy versus standard of care soc in patients with relapsed or refractory large b cell lymphoma r r lbcl these results include an analysis of outcomes for patients who received subsequent treatment for their lymphoma following second line yescarta therapy or soc therapy as well as an exploratory analysis of the association between metabolic tumor volume mtv and clinical outcomes the data were presented orally at the 2022 american society of hematology ash annual meeting exposition on december 11 and 10 respectively abstracts 659 and 259 data from the pivotal zuma 7 trial supported the u s food and drug administration s fda expanded approval of yescarta in april 2022 as initial treatment in adults with r r lbcl that is refractory to first line chemoimmunotherapy or that relapses within 12 months of first line chemoimmunotherapy and led to a similar approval by the european medicines agency in october 2022 this year marks yescarta s 5th anniversary from the initial approval by the fda in 2017 as the first car t cell therapy for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory lbcl after two or more lines of systemic therapy these further analyses from the zuma 7 study show consistent benefit of yescarta versus standard of care in the second line r r lbcl setting including for those who require subsequent third

by gita gopinath angel talavera dave woodward and bruno carrasco china daily updated 2022 12 12 07 18 ma xuejing china daily editor s note the global economy has changed significantly over the past few years in the way that it is organized and governed by collaborating nations these changes have repercussions that not only affect the flow of goods and services between countries but also monetary and financial policies four experts share their views on the issue with china daily world must avoid fragmentation by gita gopinath now is a particularly challenging time for the global economy with the outlook expected to darken in 2023 three powerful forces are holding back the global economy the conflict between russia and ukraine the need to tighten monetary policy amid the cost of living crisis and persistent and broadening inflation pressures and the slowdown of the chinese economy during the international monetary fund s annual meetings in october we projected global growth to slow from 6 0 percent last year to 3 2 percent this year and for 2023 we lowered our forecast to 2 7 percent 0 2 percentage points lower than projected a few months earlier in july we expect the global slowdown to be broad based with countries accounting for one third of the global economy contracting this year or next the three largest economies the united states china and the euro area will continue to stall there is a one in four chance that global growth next year could fall below 2 percent a historical low in short the worst is yet to come and some major economies such as germany are expected to enter recession next year let s take a look at the world s largest economies in the united states tightening monetary and financial conditions mean growth could be about 1 percent in 2023 in china we have lowered next year s growth forecast to 4 4 percent due to the weakening property sector and weaker global demand in the eurozone the energy crisis caused by the russia ukraine conflict is taking a heavy toll reducing our growth projection for 2023 to 0 5 percent almost everywhere rapidly rising prices especially those of food and energy are causing serious hardships for vulnerable households despite the slowdown inflation pressures are proving broader and more persistent than anticipated global inflation is now expected to peak at 9 5 percent in 2022 before decelerating to 4 1 percent by 2024 inflation is also broadening beyond food and energy the outlook could worsen further and policy trade offs have become acutely challenging here are four key risks the risk of monetary fiscal or financial policy miscalibration has risen sharply at a time of high uncertainty turmoil in financial markets could cause global financial conditions to deteriorate and the us dollar to strengthen further inflation could yet again prove more persistent especially if labor markets remain extremely tight finally the hostilities in ukraine are still raging further escalation would exacerbate the energy and food security crisis increasing price pressures remain the most immediate threat to current and future prosperity by squeezing real incomes and undermining macroeconomic stability central banks are now focused on restoring price stability and the pace of tightening has accelerated sharply where necessary financial policy should ensure that markets remain stable however central banks around the world need to keep a steady hand with monetary policy firmly focused on taming inflation the strength of the us dollar is also a major challenge the dollar is now at its strongest since the early 2000s so far this rise appears mostly driven by fundamental forces such as the tightening of monetary policy in the us and the energy crisis the appropriate response is to calibrate monetary policy to maintain price stability while letting exchange rates adjust conserving valuable foreign exchange reserves for when financial conditions really worsen as the global economy is headed for stormy waters now is the time for emerging market policymakers to batten down the hatches eligible countries with sound policies should urgently consider improving their liquidity buffers including requesting access to precautionary instruments from the imf in addition the us could reactivate currency swap lines to eligible countries as it extended at the start of the pandemic this would provide an important safety valve in times of currency market stress too many low income countries are close to or already in debt distress progress toward orderly debt restructurings through the g20 s common framework is urgently needed to avert a wave of sovereign debt crises for china low inflation and weakening growth allow for greater support for vulnerable households which together with strengthening social safety nets would promote consumption the new rules to loosen covid restrictions will help mitigate the policy s economic impact and will be critical to sustain and balance economic recovery in the property sector urgent action at the central government level is needed to safeguard financial stability these efforts will be good for china for the economic well being of the chinese people and good for the world there is one other final risk to global prosperity that should be mentioned over the longer term geo economic fragmentation could undermine the gains from globalization as we know trade has been a key driver of growth and integration we can t now let trade policy become a source of fragmentation which hurts all countries but especially the most vulnerable people and communities guardrails need to be put in place to defend existing avenues of global collaboration and to make progress on climate policies debt resolution and other global issues the global community led by the major economies must step up to put the necessary guardrails in place and prevent geo economic fragmentation the world desperately needs cooperation to tackle key vulnerabilities including climate change food insecurity and elevated debt burdens the author is first deputy managing director of the imf

from december 13 to 15 about 49 heads of state and government or their representatives and other top government officials from africa will be in washington dc on the invitation of united states president joe biden for a second summit of the us and african leaders the first of such summit was convened in 2014 by former president barack obama with a follow up summit coming eight years after the first one according to the us government the summit will demonstrate the us enduring commitment to africa and will underscore the importance of us africa relations and increased cooperation on shared priorities the summit will be coming against the backdrop of the new us strategy toward sub saharan africa released about three months ago in which the us acknowledged that sub saharan africa is critical to advancing our global priorities being one of the world fastest growing populations largest free trade areas most diverse ecosystems and one of the largest regional voting groups in the united nations the strategy reframes the region s importance to us national security interests however major concerns for africa which are mostly investments and trade peace and security inclusive and sustainable development are vital categories in dealing with the issues of poverty social and political challenges in africa have considerably nosedived in africa us relations at least since the first summit was held the violent us led nato regime change intervention in libya which left the country in complete chaos following the brutal killing of its leader seriously undermined peace and security in africa especially in the sahel western and central regions of africa the brutal insurgency of the boko haram sect in nigeria and the rise of other criminal elements in the region were largely inflamed and driven by the flows of illicit weapons from the huge libyan military armoury flung wide open and left unsecure by the us led nato military intervention it should never be forgotten that the us led violent regime change in intervention in libya in 2011 came against the background of a concerted effort of africa through the regional body the african union to pursue a negotiated settlement of libya s political conflict on the economic front washington needs to step up because the facts and figures are brutally abysmal the us export of goods to africa was 26 7bn in 2021 a 30 per cent drop from a high of 38 1bn in 2014 two way trade in 2021 was just mere 1 per cent of us total global commerce at 64 3bn down from a high of 141 9bn in 2008 prior to the first summit in 2014 former president bill clinton has initiated the africa growth and opportunity act in 2000 it was a trade preferential programme and part of wider legislation clinton designed to strengthen us trade ties with africa and the caribbean however despite the early enthusiasm that greeted the act africa us trade has remained underdeveloped and very modest after the initial jump exports fell to their 2000 level with less than 1 per cent of imports of the us in 2019 coming from sub saharan africa apart from south africa whose mostly automotive exports constitute more than 50 per cent of the total region s export with the us in 2021 the slump in exports from other countries in the region was obvious for example textiles and apparel observed as the most agoa related job generating sector especially in east africa considerably slumped agoa which was renewed in 2015 will expire in 2025 its process and trajectories since its inception have been tainted by political maneuvering by the us the second president of the american institute for foreign trade william schurz stated that borders frequented by trade seldom need soldiers would the us convert its perennial obsession with security and geopolitics to trade and investment especially in its relations and cooperation with africa already in her new strategy toward sub saharan africa washington craftily set the stage to launch africa into a theatre of geopolitical competition among major powers it claimed that the people s republic of china sees the region africa as an important arena to challenge the rules based international order advance its own narrow commercial and geopolitical interests undermine transparency and openness and weaken us relations with african peoples and governments in the same breath the new strategy accused russia of viewing the region as a permissive environment for private military companies often fomenting instability for strategic and financial instability it is no gainsaying that africans and their respective governments see either the partnership with china or cooperation with russia differently from the way washington has crafted it and using any forum whether of the upcoming leaders summit or any other one to impose such toxic definitions of the relations between africa with china or russia will not fly especially in the face of what africans know and experience about the relationship any such effort by the us to canvass its view of africa s relations with china on africa would be utterly counterproductive during the same period in 2021 when africa s two way trade with the us was at a historic low of barely 64 3bn china has maintained the momentum of africa s largest trading partner with two way trade reaching a historic high of 254bn in 2018 at the 3rd summit of the forum of china african cooperation in beijing china announced the establishment of the china africa economic and trade expo to be organised biennially by its ministry of commerce to deepen economic and trade cooperation with africa despite the outbreak of the covid 19 pandemic the expo has held on schedule at the second edition of the expo which was held last year about 176 items in trade investment project contracting and strategic cooperation with a value of 15 93bn were signed also during the eighth ministerial conference of focac held in senegal last year president xi jinping announced nine cooperation programmes between africa and china among which is the iconic trade promotion under which beijing would open green lanes for african agricultural exports to china measures would be taken by china to speed up the inspection and quarantine procedures and further increase the scope of products enjoying zero tariff treatment in a bid to reach 300bn in total imports from africa in the next three years from 2021 in addition china will build a pioneering zone for in depth china africa trade and economic cooperation and a china africa industrial park for belt and road cooperation in china while beijing does not engage in the perennial ideological luxury of lecturing africa about whose activities on the continent are harmful and why she is a preferred friend the facts on the ground in africa speak louder than voice in the u s africa leaders summit in washington this week it is most likely that african leaders will demonstrate their openness for meaningful credible and purposeful partnership with the world also the us and washington can use the moment to demonstrate genuine goodwill beyond lofty rhetoric to define a practical roadmap in supporting africa to tackle the challenges of poverty through trade and investment and not just humanitarian aid the us can through this summit breathe life into its fledging build back better world initiative by outlining specific undertakings in infrastructure construction in africa the belt and road initiative china s flagship framework of international cooperation has significantly boosted the construction of critical infrastructure in africa fostering connectivity within and across countries in the region africa s largest economy nigeria has just commissioned her first ever deep sea port built under the framework of the belt and road partnership cooperation which nigeria signed in 2018 the historic deficit of infrastructure connectivity which has previously hobbled the pan african notion of regional integration and unity is gradually being overcome with the continent s pragmatic cooperation with china the us can add momentum to the process of enigmatic africa s renaissance through trade investment and infrastructure construction which are critical indices for social and political stability and democratic resilience in the region the us africa cooperation has bright prospects but must be nurtured through a process of mutual respect and acknowledgement of the different and unique historical trajectories of the two sides while working together to secure and expand common grounds the us africa leadership summit will be more mutually rewarding if it finds institutional ambience in washington s routine schedule rather than just an arbitrary convenience of any us leader after eight years of ceaseless changes in africa following the lacuna since the first summit in 2014 washington might just be learning the reality of china s historic opportunity to the continent for which africa is diligently and dutifully engaging a report by a us based international management consortium mckinsey company in 2017 from a field study on how africa and china are evolving in their engagement stated we evaluated africa s economic partnerships with the rest of the world across five dimensions trade investment stock investment growth infrastructure financing and aid china is in the top four for africa in all these dimensions no other country matches this depth and breadth of engagement the broad sentiment in africa to the expectations of the washington summit is that it should deliver on the tangible and practical needs of the continent especially in trade and investment beyond the effusions of lofty rhetoric

brickle was a chocolate coated toffee confection first sold in 1924 by john g woodward co a candy manufacturer in iowa since then countless adaptations and variations of the recipe have appeared most of them with the slightest variations i m going with the version my mother made i don t know where her version came from or if she adapted the recipe but it s been around for a long time you can make a kosher version of this by using matzo and kosher butter or margarine in place of the soda crackers and regular butter either way this recipe is fast simple and an absolute winner be warned though it s horribly addictive this is a recipe you ll want to bake eat repeat over and over again i break mine up into small chunks and place it into a tin layered with parchment or wax paper and freeze it in

southeast asian markets are in for a bungee jump in 2023 according to jpmorgan southeast asian markets will move in a trajectory resembling that of a bungee jump next year taking a plummet before surging in the second half of 2023 jpmorgan wrote in a report that is likely to bee characterized by a sharp fall followed by a rapid increase in altitude bear market rally followed by another decline until eventually markets come to rest at rock bottom analysts led by rajiv batra wrote they attributed that to weakened purchasing power in light of monetary policy tightening lower savings and the higher cost of borrowing additionally jpmorgan forecasts the msci asean index will re test this year s lows and potentially move even lower in the first half of 2023 on the back of tightening

by w vishnu gupta it seems people have resigned to believe that aragalaya effectively became a beragalaya to facilitate the installation of well known machiavellian as the nation s executive president unwittingly machiavellians tend to be demonic and can use military force or violence to quell peaceful struggles waged by innocent people due to injustice hunger poverty and the hopelessness faced their families moreover machiavelli argued fear restrains men because they are afraid of punishment and this fear never leaves them on 2nd december 2022 joe biden the president of the united states of america tweeted i just want to make a few things clear the holocaust happened hitler was a demonic figure a well timed remark by a respectable democratic world leader furthermore the press release issued by ms samantha power s office after meeting ali sabri who was on a mission to the usa recently with the begging bowl says administrator power who visited sri lanka in september reiterated the u s commitment to supporting sri lanka to help resolve its complex crisis including addressing the urgent needs of sri lanka s most vulnerable and marginalized communities she underscored that political reforms need to accompany economic reforms in sri lanka it appears ranil and ali sabry have no time to heed the advice of americans on required political reforms as they are fixated in shielding away those who committed economic crimes and human right violations from a credible judiciary it is normal for a demonic person to speak ill about the people struggling to feed their own families cloth them and provide shelter and security a demonic figure always depends on corruption brutal force support of similar minded persons such as rajapaksas and deceptive tactics to achieve his political and personal objectives ranil has been a very active member of the oligarchy that existed since the departure of british colonialist and responsible for economic crimes he is accused of being the leader who operated the infamous batalanda torture chambers in 1980 s his recent remarks about the deployment of security forces to quell any opposition that may sprung up in the country against his regime installed with the help of a constitutional coup confirms his beliefs in the machiavelli approaches specifically the norm end justifies the means he has continuously defiled buddhism by denigrating maha sangha and misquoting selected phrases of sacred buddhist text according to his conveniences what a charade to divert the attention of people from his incompetent administration though his mother was a buddhist it looks like he has made every effort to hide that he hails from a rich anglican christian clan his father esmond wickremesinghe was a devout christian and the paternal uncle lakshman wickramasinghe was the bishop of kurunagala anglican church from 1962 to 1983 his aunt mukta wickramasinghe and her children rajiva and anila are christians ranil wickramasinghe the present unelected politician was thrust into the position of the executive president by the political struggle known as aragalaya waged by an uncoordinated leaderless bunch of men and women driven by many agendas it is alleged that there were many dubious characters funded by political dirtbags and ngos some were staying in five star hotels and others pretending to be ordinary citizens who were concerned about the unbearable economic difficulties but taking directions from the most unpopular and corrupt political leaders currently occupying the parliament of sri lanka accusations were levelled against many political parties chief among them were the unp slpp and jvp it seems those who participated in the aragalaya were nothing but headless chickens running around they did not achieve anything positive rajapaksas are back and living lavishly in mansions funded by the people ranil wickremesinghe got his dream job without any effort ranil s inner coterie including the chicaneries sagala ashu saman ratnapriya silva another dubious man who misled aragalaya and vajira got their personal agendas and dreams fulfilled it is highly unlikely to expect political reforms from a demonic leader who advocates brutality and suppression of freedom of people and vouched to use military means no western democratic country neither imf nor other world organization should assist a demonic regime fake friendly countries like china india and japan will hesitate and then completely ignore and abandon sri lanka if their demands are not met rasamanickam has put foot in his mouth again the recent comments made by tna mp rasamanickam another alleged canadian citizen sitting in the parliament of sri lanka has warned that in the event the chinese embassy and its government fail to look after the citizens of sri lanka and refuse to restructure the debts he is ready to lead a chinagohome campaign with all 22 million sri lankans similar to what was seen at the gotagohome aragalaya to chase the chinese i would like to warn the chinese there will be a china go home soon and i will lead it rasamanickam must be reminded of his bravado in the parliament is great to entertain the pollical gallery those words are highly counter productive it will be better if he starts to grow fingernails to scratch his rumps before threatening a superpower like china the speaker should have admonished this tna mp for the comments made against another country that has helped sri lankans during many difficult times in this incident whether rasamanickam is in the payroll of another international sponsor is irrelevant but he has embarrassed the entire nation only a dimwit politician of a bankrupt country alleged to be a citizen of another country will think of antagonising a superpower especially china which has given enormous development loans nearly 20 percent of the country s public external debt without any strings attached it is also highly infuriating comment at a time when the government is attempting with china sri lanka s largest bilateral creditor and with india and japan to restructure the country s debt staff expenditure of mahinda and maithripala the former presidents mahinda and maithri have been living like drunkard sailors with unbelievable number of personal staff at the expense of citizens of the nation it was reported last since 2010 they have spent over rs 1480 million only on personal staff it is surprising to note that maithree has spent more than mahinda according to a new report former president mahinda rajapaksa had deployed a personal staff of 2 578 from 2010 to 2014 at a cost of more than rs 630 million and former president maithripala sirisena had a personal staff of 1 317 from 2015 to 2019 at a cost of more than rs 850 million although maithripala as usual has denied the charges alleging the media and lionel guruge for reporting the extravagant expenditure incurred by these two failed politicians obviously they have misused people s money for glorification of their pollical careers maithripala has claimed that some of the funds were given out to smart sri lanka program to distribute 1000 computers to divisional secretaries the proper procedure should have been reallocation of the funds or returning the funds to the treasury these devious politicians have been using state funds for nearly seven decades to promote their personal image among sri lankan gullible voters and to improve the chances of electability of their corrupt political parties jr ranil premadasa channdrika maithree and mahinda have always followed the unholy traditions of stealing from the treasury under different guises 225 1 are unresponsive to the sufferings of the people the temporarily elected 225 1 men and women of the current parliament have totally forgotten the needs and wants of 22 million of citizens in the country as it was evident from the recently presented budget a fresh report published by the world food programme wfp says about three out of 10 households nearly 6 26 million sri lankans are uncertain of where their next food will come from more than 60 of households are resorting to rationing their food and do not obtain sufficient nutrition as one sri lankan woman said these days we don t have a proper meal but eat only rice and gravy in june 2022 wfp deputy regional director for asia and pacific anthea webb explained pregnant mothers need to eat nutritious meals every day but the poorest find it harder and harder to afford the basics furthermore unicef has warned of a humanitarian crisis it has found depleting food stocks gas and medical supplies have forced 70 of sri lankan families to reduce food intake in 2022 the crisis may be well hidden by ignoring the reports coming out of villages and small towns it is suspected that some families have not eaten for many days just like the 225 1 currently focussing on tactics to ensure their political survival the established media houses too have paid very little attention to the plight of ordinary sri lankans the ensuing useless budget debates and cabinet priorities clearly shows that there is a huge gulf between the government objectives and the needs and wants of the people for instances people did not ask or never have asked for guns boots or huge mechanized military force in the country it looks like these temporarily elected men and women mps have bent over and shown the rumps to 22 million of citizens gleefully that may be the reason why they have opted to perform circuses in the parliament with acts such as defiling buddhism by ranil controversial diana s cannabis project kanchana s threats rambukwella s denunciations susil s sweet talk but no books for children sabry s begging trips wijedayadasa s noncommittal comments and equally reprehensible opposition parties lukewarm response to the government s budget proposals all these 225 1 scheming political figures have performed very well in the diyawanna circus to ensure their survival and knowing very well that none of them truly represent will of the people the role played by the opposition is also highly questionable the duplicity nature off the opposition parties was further confirmed by not coming to the parliament to defeat the tax bill passed on the 9th of november they conveniently took a passive stand on the matter the donor countries too have become wary about the credibility of 225 1 consequently india china japan and the usa know very well that most opportune time to acquire and control the highly strategically important geopolitical assets in sri lanka is now and there will not be any formidable opposition in the parliament because it is rigged highly in their favor by dubious devious and demonic 225 1 persons in the executive and legislative branches of the government of sri lanka the politicians have put our nation in peril the state is stuck between a rock imf and a hard place countries vying for supremacy in the indian ocean the bankrupt state is helpless as the oligarchies and their conniving political cohorts have committed economic crimes since 1956 mainly lead by bandaranaikes jayewardenes rajapaksas ranasinghes and a slew political leaders such as nm perera sirisena ranil anura ranawaka vasu badurdeen hakeem and wimal let us not forget that the un high commissioner s report in october this year it has clearly stated among many other reasons impunity for human rights violations and economic crimes by officials as the underlying reasons for the economic crisis furthermore unhcr has called for the government to investigate and prosecute former and current public officials who triggered the country s worst financial crisis in more than seven decades plunging the population of 22 million into soaring inflation currency depreciation and severe food medicine and fuel shortages therefore sri lankans should be prepared to encounter misery until fresh elections are held to introduce much needed political reforms in other words the system change demanded by the genuine proponents of aragalaya
london britain set out a raft of measures on friday to bolster the city of london s role as a global financial center under strain since brexit ushered in new competition from amsterdam paris and frankfurt the planned reforms also include a review of rules put in place following the financial crisis over a decade ago to make bankers accountable for their decisions and easing capital requirements for smaller lenders after much lobbying by banks finance minister jeremy hunt said it would be wrong to describe the 30 measures as a big bang a reference to deregulating the stock market in the 1980s that will unravel tougher rules introduced after the global financial crisis we have to make sure that we don t unlearn the lessons of 2008 but at the same time recognise that banks today have much stronger balance sheets he told an event hosted by the financial times the city has been largely cut off from the european union eu by brexit putting pressure on the government to ease rules as amsterdam overtook london to become europe s top share trading centre adding to competition from new york and singapore leaving the eu allows britain to write its own rules but as it hosts scores of international banks it has little room to diverge radically from international norms the government s approach to reforming the financial services regulatory landscape recognizes and protects the foundations on which the uk s success as a financial services hub is built agility consistently high regulatory standards and openness the finance ministry said in a statement hunt set out his plans at a meeting with financial sector officials in edinburgh now dubbed the edinburgh reforms the proposed reset had been trailed as big bang 2 0 raising expectations of a big deregulatory push which left banks fearing costly systems changes but the emphasis has shifted to reviewing and tweaking rules while remaining aligned with global standards rather than any wholesale dismantling of regulations the batch of planned reforms include a review of securitization and short selling rules overhauling prospectuses issued by companies when they list and a plan for repealing and reforming rules that were introduced when britain was in the eu other plans include a consultation in coming weeks on a central bank digital currency a project that prime minister rishi sunak was keen on as finance minister there will also be a consultation on regulating compilers of ratings on company s environmental social and governance esg impacts it is important for people not to overplay this there is no sense of any move back to a pre financial crisis world said jonathan herbst a lawyer at norton rose fulbright the eu is updating its own financial rules to reduce remaining reliance on london and is ahead in areas like crypto assets accountability the reforms target two sets of rules introduced by britain in the aftermath of the financial crisis over a decade ago when the government had to bail out undercapitalized banks while few individual bankers were punished the first set known as the senior managers and certification regime smcr requires banks and insurers to name individuals responsible for specific activities making it easier for regulators to punish them when things go wrong bankers have complained that regulators take too long to vet these senior appointments the second set of rules requires banks to ring fence their retail arms with a cushion of capital to insulate deposits from a blow up in riskier activities such as trading derivatives the ring fencing regime will be reformed to free retail focused banks and ease unnecessary regulatory burdens on firms while maintaining protections for depositors banks have lobbied to either scrap the rule or significantly raise the deposits threshold which triggers the requirement the changes are likely to ease burdens on smaller banks to help britain s longstanding attempts to increase competition in a sector dominated by hsbc barclays lloyds and natwest bank of england deputy governor sam woods said in 2020 that he would defend the ring fencing rules to his last drop of blood the boe said on friday it would work with the ministry to ensure a safe and competitive financial system the ministry will also review eu era stock and bond trading requirements known as mifid ii in particular a rule requiring brokers to itemise or unbundle their customer charges for research on stock picks and for executing stock orders britain had already set out initial reforms in its financial services and markets bill being approved in parliament it includes giving regulators an extra objective of paying heed to the city s global competitiveness when writing rules sophie lund yates lead equity analyst at hargreaves lansdown said london s financial center has been severely held back since brexit sadly the allure simply isn t there with many of the uk s brightest companies being snapped up by overseas investors and london losing its top share dealing status she said other reforms already announced include scrapping a cap on banker bonuses and easing capital rules for insurers a public consultation on regulating crypto assets has also been flagged reuters

cash crops dutch use bitcoin mining to grow tulips this photograph taken on december 7 2022 shows bert de groot 35 bitcoin engineer and owner of bitcoin brabant shows on his smart phone graphics representing bitcoin miners activity on the braiins pool mining app in a greenhouse heated with bitcoin miners near amsterdam a dutch flower growing business is using bitcoin mining machines to warm their greenhouse in order to grow tulips and other flowers for the export market the bitcoin machines in turn are powered by solar energy in which the farmer and the bitcoin business owners say is better for the environment amsterdam netherlands tulips and bitcoin have both been associated with financial bubbles in their time but in a giant greenhouse near amsterdam the dutch are trying to make them work together engineer bert de groot inspects the six bitcoin miners as they perform complex sums to earn cryptocurrency filling the air with a noisy whine along with a blast of warmth that warmth is now heating the hothouse where rows of tulips grow cutting the farmers reliance on gas whose price has soared since russia s invasion of ukraine the servers in turn are powered by solar energy from the roof reducing the normally huge electricity costs for mining and cutting the impact on the environment meanwhile both the farmers and de groot s company bitcoin brabant are earning crypto which is still attracting investors despite a recent crash in the market we think with this way of heating our greenhouse but also earning some bitcoin we have a win win situation flower farmer danielle koning 37 told afp the netherlands love of tulips caused the first stock market crash in the 17th century when speculation bulb prices caused prices to soar only to later collapse now the netherlands is the world s biggest tulip producer and also the second biggest agricultural exporter overall after the united states with much grown in greenhouses improving the environment but the low lying country is keenly aware of the effect of the agricultural industry on climate change while farmers are struggling with high energy prices mining for cryptocurrency meanwhile requires huge amounts of electricity to power computers leading to an environmental impact amid global efforts to tackle climate change de groot 35 who only started his business earlier this year and now has 17 clients including restaurants and warehouses says this makes bitcoin and tulips a perfect fit this operation is actually carbon negative as are all the operations i basically build says the long haired de groot sporting an orange polo shirt with his firm s logo we re actually improving the environment he is also selling tulips online for bitcoin via a business called bitcoinbloem the collaboration started when koning saw a twitter video de groot had made about bitcoin mining and called him up now there are six servers at their hothouse whose exact location koning asked to keep secret to avoid thieves targeting the 15 000 euro machines koning s company owns half of them and keeps the bitcoin they produce while de groot is allowed to keep his three servers there in exchange for monthly visits to clean dust and insects out of the servers fans with a 20 degree celsius difference between the air entering the machine and leaving them this provides the heat needed to grow the tulips and to dry the bulbs that produce them no worries the most important thing we get out of it is we save on natural gas says koning secondly well we earn bitcoin by running them in the greenhouse huge energy costs have driven some dutch agricultural firms that often rely on greenhouses to stop growing this year while others have even gone bankrupt says koning meanwhile the philosopher nassim nicholas taleb who developed the idea of the unpredictable but historic black swan event has compared bitcoin to the tulipmania that engulfed the netherlands nearly 400 years ago this saw prices for a single bulb rise to more than 100 times the average annual income at the time before the bubble burst in 1637 causing banks to fail and people to lose their life savings the cryptocurrency sector is currently reeling from the collapse of a major exchange with bitcoin currently worth around 16 300 per unit down from a high of 68 000 in november 2021 but de groot isn t worried i have absolutely no worries about the long term value proposition of an immutable monetary system he says bitcoin will last for ever
in this article we will take a look at 15 countries that produce the most solar energy if you want to see more countries that produce the most solar energy go directly to 5 countries that produce the most solar energy thanks to improvements in technology and increased economies of scale solar energy costs have decreased substantially while the cost of utility scale pv fixed tilt was 4 75 per watt in 2010 the cost was just 0 94 per watt in 2020 for the future it is likely solar costs will decline further with solar already being cheaper than coal and some other fossil fuels in many parts of the country solar could potentially gain even more economies of scale with improvements in technology solar panels could be more efficient and the cost per watt could decline further with improvements in battery technology battery costs could decline and solar systems could be more useful to many people in addition many governments have policies to actively support solar growth the u s department of energy for instance announced in 2021 nearly 128 million in additional funding to lower solar costs and to improve the speed of deployment of solar energy technologies other countries such as china also have considerable subsidies according to reuters in 2021 china s 2022 renewable power subsidy was 607 26 million with the majority of the subsidy going to solar power stations there s demand from corporate america too as many of the world s leading companies are helping support solar growth to help offset their carbon emissions as a result of solar s increasing economic competitiveness supportive government policies and support from leading companies solar energy is already america s fastest growing power source and solar accounts for over 40 of all new electricity generating capacity in the world s largest economy the growth is likely far from over as analysts estimate total u s solar capacity will increase by a factor of 4 over the next decade it is likely that many other countries will increase their solar capacity substantially over the next 10 years as well in terms of cost goals the u s department of energy said in march 2021 to that end doe is accelerating its utility scale solar 2030 cost target by five years setting a new goal of driving down the current cost of 4 6 cents per kilowatt hour kwh to 3 cents kwh by 2025 and 2 cents kwh by 2030 green energy in addition to helping diversify the world s energy mix growth in solar energy production will help fight global warming senator edward j markey said following the march 2021 u s department of energy announcement to meet our bold zero emissions goals by 2035 we need to unleash major investment in solar energy and technologies i am excited to see the biden harris administration and the department of energy grant the massachusetts institute of technology mit this research and development funding today to help the commonwealth scale up our clean energy deployment and innovation u s representative eddie bernice johnson added during the same announcement as chairwoman of the house science space and technology committee it is thrilling to see my constituents selected to advance technologies that will play a critical role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the electricity sector not only will these awards help the united states achieve the deep decarbonization needed to mitigate the growing impacts of climate change but they will put many americans in my district and around the country back to work in the midst of the covid 19 pandemic given the rise in global temperatures over 70 countries including china the united states and the european union have set a net zero target sometime in the next four decades net zero means cutting greenhouse gas emissions to as close to zero as possible with any remaining emissions re absorbed from the atmosphere by oceans and forests for instance according to the united nations given the green energy needed to transition to net zero many analysts think solar energy demand is likely to rise substantially in the future as a result methodology for our list of 15 countries that produce the most solar energy we took the 15 largest countries by solar capacity according to the bp statistical review of world energy 2022 we then ranked each country by their installed photovoltaic pv power statistic for the 2021 year for those of you interested also check out 20 countries that produce the most electric power 15 countries that produce the most solar energy 15 ukraine installed photovoltaic pv power 8 06 gw ukraine ranks 15 on our list of 15 countries that produce the most solar energy with installed photovoltaic power of 8 06 gw in 2021 which is around 1 of the world s total solar capacity given government policies ukraine s solar energy capacity has increased by an average growth rate per annum of 45 6 from 2011 to 2021 with the war in the nation this year solar growth in the country may not be as strong in the near term 14 brazil installed photovoltaic pv power 13 05 gw brazil has increased its solar capacity from 0 1 gw in 2016 to 13 1 gw in 2021 as the cost of solar has become more competitive in many areas of the country versus traditional energy sources according to some estimates brazil surpassed 15 gw of total installed solar as of april 2022 and the country could have as much as 54 gw of total solar capacity by 2026 13 spain installed photovoltaic pv power 13 65 gw spain is one of the leading european solar generators given its installed photovoltaic power of 13 65 gw in 2021 given its latitude the country gets more hours of sun than many other european nations and as a result spain has substantial potential for future solar capacity growth according to pv magazine in september spain could already have surpassed the 20 gw of solar level this year given new capacity additions 12 united kingdom installed photovoltaic pv power 13 69 gw the united kingdom ranks 12 on our list of 15 countries that produce the most solar energy given its installed photovoltaic power of 13 69 gw as of last year considering the increasing competitiveness of solar energy the country s solar capacity has increased by an average growth rate per annum of 29 9 from 2011 to 2021 there could be more growth in the future as the uk government said in april of this year we will also look to increase the uk s current 14 gw of solar capacity which could grow up to five times by 2035 consulting on the rules for solar projects particularly on domestic and commercial rooftops 11 netherlands installed photovoltaic pv power 14 25 gw the netherlands is one of europe s largest solar energy producers with installed photovoltaic power of 14 25 gw in 2021 according to pv magazine solar accounted for 25 5 of the netherlands august total electricity demand thanks to more sun and lower electricity demand given the decreasing cost of solar energy it is likely that solar will account for an even larger percentage of the country s total electricity generation in the future 10 france installed photovoltaic pv power 14 71 gw although it gets most of its electricity generation needs from nuclear france is nevertheless a leader in solar with installed photovoltaic power of 14 71 gw last year in the future france has a goal of increasing the amount of solar energy produced in the nation by 10 fold to reduce its carbon emissions further interestingly the french senate mandated this year that large parking lots in the nation be covered with solar panels in the future 9 vietnam installed photovoltaic pv power 16 66 gw vietnam is a leader in solar capacity given its growing economy and its geography with its developing economy electricity demand has increased substantially and solar has been one of the best choices for the country in many areas given its costs solar costs are lower than some other countries given vietnam gets more sun than many other countries do as of 2021 vietnam had installed photovoltaic power of 16 66 gw 8 south korea installed photovoltaic pv power 18 16 gw south korea is a leading solar energy producer with installed photovoltaic power of 18 16 gw in 2021 over the past decade the country s solar capacity increased substantially thanks to supportive government policies and decreasing costs from 2011 to 2021 south korea solar capacity increased by an average annual growth rate of 37 9 per annum thanks to subsidies and the decreasing cost per watt of solar in the future the country s solar energy capacity is likely to increase further given south korea s goal of reducing its carbon emissions 7 australia installed photovoltaic pv power 19 07 gw in 2021 australia had an installed photovoltaic power of 19 07 gw in 2021 up 10 3 year over year considering australia s government has a goal of renewables accounting for 82 of the national electricity market by 2030 the country s solar capacity will likely

november the bank s survey of of consumer expectations showed consumers expected one year inflation to run at a 5 2 pace down 0 7 percentage point from october on tuesday the november consumer price index will be released and traders will be looking for a sign that inflation is slowing the same day the federal reserve will begin its two day meeting and is expected to announce another rate hike on wednesday though traders anticipate a smaller move than in recent months in addition to the expected rate hike the fed s updated economic projections and chair jerome powell s press conference could be key signals for what the central bank wants to do in the coming months financial conditions have eased dramatically since the october cpi reading released last month so the fed will likely use the december fomc meeting to walk those back said cliff hodge chief investment officer for cornerstone wealth we think the markets are too sanguine on rates after the first quarter and we expect powell to

etfs ceo and chief investment officer sylvia jablonski told cnbc investors will be watching the data closely for a better sense of the likelihood of an end of year rally it is arguably the last hope for that year end rally that we ve all been anxiously awaiting she said today s market seems to be pricing in the idea that cpi will be as expected and potentially that the 50bps is what we will see regardless of cpi the market could swing viciously in either direction depending on this date if the results turn out to be worse than feared not all is bad she added with pessimism at an all time high earnings starting to come in bond market pricing in a recession it may be bad in the short term but it won t be the end value creation happens in markets like this in times like this any surprise

points tanaya macheel don t trust the market bounce from the november low goldman sachs says the s p 500 has jumped more than 6 since hitting a closing low on nov 3 but goldman sachs cecilia mariotti isn t ready to trust this bounce the rally in risky assets has likely forced a reversal of some of these positions and likely triggered some short squeeze mariotti said in a note monday despite the rebound of our positioning indicator we are not convinced we are past the true trough in positioning temporary relief from bearish levels can drive large reversals in equities but we think a favorable

stanley reiterates overweight rating on disney morgan stanley is staying overweight on disney saying the parks businesses should help it meet already lowered expectations for the 2023 fiscal year while analyst benjamin swinburne reiterated the rating he did lower the price target by 10 to 115 that reflects an upside of 23 2 still he noted returning ceo bob iger has to handle significant headwinds related to driving down expenses creating a new succession plan and refocusing on content but swinburne said the new targets for 2023 are reachable given earnings potential from its park business which has strong forward bookings despite the softening economy the expectations have also already been reduced given the weakening backdrop he noted swinburne said the company could start driving revenue through media by fiscal year 2024 if the business is reorganized and content is strong the returning ceo arrives with disney facing known but real secular and cyclical headwinds he

the demand for transparent sustainable and socially responsible practices is on the rise this is because stakeholders such as investors customers employees and regulators want to have information on a company s impact on the world environmental social and governance esg analysis can provide valuable insights and have a significant impact on the financial metrics of a company and hence influence investment decisions however collecting measuring and reporting these non financial data can be complicated and time consuming first high quality data might be hard to collect as this data tends to be decentralised wide reaching and unverifiable it comes from different departments and suppliers in different formats second due to the lack of standardised esg disclosure obligations businesses might find it difficult to choose which different templates and standards to report on their esg activities to meet these challenges there is a rapidly growing industry of esg data management and reporting software to help companies capture record analyse and report such data across portfolios in the united states the software industry within the esg sector is expected to reach 571 74 million by 2028 according to a new market research study here are the three main ways esg software can help companies on their sustainability journey data gathering esg software can help companies to gather esg data in one place an esg platform can act as a centralised repository for companies to manage their esg related data and tasks it provides consistent historical data that allows for companies to monitor their esg growth and streamlines the auditing process on such a system data collection is automated and a company s sustainability team needs to spend less time and resources manually chasing down data moreover the contributors reviewers and approvers of such data are transparent and traceable making for a trustworthy and secure system what is esg reporting esg reporting refers to the disclosure of reporting in environmental social and governance areas of a company e the environmental part consists of how the company uses their resources across the board taking into account energy efficiency climate change carbon emissions biodiversity air and water quality deforestation and so forth s social criteria include company culture such as gender diversity labour standards and employee engagement g governance considers a company s internal systems controls practices and procedures and its leadership anti corruption policies companies need to ensure transparency and industry best practices which includes dialogues with regulators customers and stakeholders integrated data and software platforms such as servicenow s esg management esgm solution simplify and streamline the collection of esg data and automates it for internal audiences and for external disclosure requirements such software can be especially helpful for companies from traditional industries such as manufacturing oil and gas whose data collecting can be slow and unreliable without a central automation system says gaurav mahendru senior manager of solutions consulting at servicenow when they need to look up the diversity ratio within their organisation responsible procurement resource planning customer satisfaction scores or even manage their utility bills they find that there is a delay if they collate their data via manual methods he says if they have a central esg management framework into which such data is naturally entered and kept track of the reporting process can be streamlined and they can better communicate esg performance to external and internal stakeholders it also lends a sound foundation to their decarbonisation aims like going net zero and eventually help them get access to capital markets and secure their licence to operate reporting esg platforms can switch between sustainability frameworks and audiences as there is no global agreement on disclosures there is a wide range of standards and frameworks such as the global reporting initiative gri the sustainability accounting standards board s sasb standards and the task force on climate related financial disclosures tcfd to help companies keep track of disclosure requirements esg software can monitor major sustainability frameworks and standards and ensure that the platform is updated some solutions can integrate data metrics across multiple standards so that the company can see their progress against different frameworks and generate specific reports if needed the multi standard switchability also ensures that the company has a consistent esg narrative across all disclosure frameworks finally esg platforms can be automated and customised for the different audiences they re looking to present their data to not just their internal audiences such as boards or stakeholders but also for the external disclosures they might need to make operations data driven insights to guide business data is a crucial part of business intelligence effective esg software can transform data into valuable insights such as industry benchmarking allowing for detailed comparison among related companies credible high quality data can also allow companies to identify disclosure or management gaps and hence guide esg strategy and shift operations where necessary certain esg platforms provide further convenience as they can be integrated with other applications and software such as in human resources and customer service so that esg strategy can be integrated into other company processes such as sourcing planning and waste disposal servicenow s gaurav mahendru gives the example of a large pharmaceutical company wanting to prioritise sourcing from sustainable vendors using servicenow s esg solution the company can connect with another servicenow solutions for evaluating vendor risk and identify the most environmentally friendly vendors the road ahead more mandatory disclosures not less while most current esg disclosure frameworks are voluntary the trend is that the world is moving towards standardisation and mandatory disclosure the eu has introduced more stringent regulations in recent years for example it introduced the new sustainable finance disclosure regulation in march this year which requires financial market participants to disclose 18 mandatory indicators and another two of 46 optional indicators moreover the international sustainability standards board issb announced in october this year that reporting companies are now required to disclose their scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions scope 3 emissions encompass those that are not produced by the company themselves and are not the result of activities or assets owned by the company but by those responsible up and down the value chain in a climate conscious business environment where esg disclosure requirements are getting stricter efficient and credible data management will be increasingly crucial and companies can leverage on technological solutions to support them on their esg journey
an employee works at a plant in xiaoshan district of hangzhou zhejiang province on june 27 editor s note the global economy has changed significantly over the past few years in the way that it is organized and governed by collaborating nations these changes have repercussions that not only affect the flow of goods and services between countries but also monetary and financial policies four experts share their views on the issue with china daily now is a particularly challenging time for the global economy with the outlook expected to darken in 2023 three powerful forces are holding back the global economy the conflict between russia and ukraine the need to tighten monetary policy amid the cost of living crisis and persistent and broadening inflation pressures and the slowdown of the chinese economy during the international monetary fund s annual meetings in october we projected global growth to slow from 6 0 percent last year to 3 2 percent this year and for 2023 we lowered our forecast to 2 7 percent 0 2 percentage points lower than projected a few months earlier in july we expect the global slowdown to be broad based with countries accounting for one third of the global economy contracting this year or next the three largest economies the united states china and the euro area will continue to stall there is a one in four chance that global growth next year could fall below 2 percent a historical low in short the worst is yet to come and some major economies such as germany are expected to enter recession next year let s take a look at the world s largest economies in the united states tightening monetary and financial conditions mean growth could be about 1 percent in 2023 in china we have lowered next year s growth forecast to 4 4 percent due to the weakening property sector and weaker global demand in the eurozone the energy crisis caused by the russia ukraine conflict is taking a heavy toll reducing our growth projection for 2023 to 0 5 percent almost everywhere rapidly rising prices especially those of food and energy are causing serious hardships for vulnerable households despite the slowdown inflation pressures are proving broader and more persistent than anticipated global inflation is now expected to peak at 9 5 percent in 2022 before decelerating to 4 1 percent by 2024 inflation is also broadening beyond food and energy the outlook could worsen further and policy trade offs have become acutely challenging here are four key risks the risk of monetary fiscal or financial policy miscalibration has risen sharply at a time of high uncertainty turmoil in financial markets could cause global financial conditions to deteriorate and the us dollar to strengthen further inflation could yet again prove more persistent especially if labor markets remain extremely tight finally the hostilities in ukraine are still raging further escalation would exacerbate the energy and food security crisis increasing price pressures remain the most immediate threat to current and future prosperity by squeezing real incomes and undermining macroeconomic stability central banks are now focused on restoring price stability and the pace of tightening has accelerated sharply where necessary financial policy should ensure that markets remain stable however central banks around the world need to keep a steady hand with monetary policy firmly focused on taming inflation the strength of the us dollar is also a major challenge the dollar is now at its strongest since the early 2000s so far this rise appears mostly driven by fundamental forces such as the tightening of monetary policy in the us and the energy crisis the appropriate response is to calibrate monetary policy to maintain price stability while letting exchange rates adjust conserving valuable foreign exchange reserves for when financial conditions really worsen as the global economy is headed for stormy waters now is the time for emerging market policymakers to batten down the hatches eligible countries with sound policies should urgently consider improving their liquidity buffers including requesting access to precautionary instruments from the imf in addition the us could reactivate currency swap lines to eligible countries as it extended at the start of the pandemic this would provide an important safety valve in times of currency market stress too many low income countries are close to or already in debt distress progress toward orderly debt restructurings through the g20 s common framework is urgently needed to avert a wave of sovereign debt crises for china low inflation and weakening growth allow for greater support for vulnerable households which together with strengthening social safety nets would promote consumption the new rules to loosen covid restrictions will help mitigate the policy s economic impact and will be critical to sustain and balance economic recovery in the property sector urgent action at the central government level is needed to safeguard financial stability these efforts will be good for china for the economic well being of the chinese people and good for the world there is one other final risk to global prosperity that should be mentioned over the longer term geo economic fragmentation could undermine the gains from globalization as we know trade has been a key driver of growth and integration we can t now let trade policy become a source of fragmentation which hurts all countries but especially the most vulnerable people and communities guardrails need to be put in place to defend existing avenues of global collaboration and to make progress on climate policies debt resolution and other global issues the global community led by the major economies must step up to put the necessary guardrails in place and prevent geo economic fragmentation the world desperately needs cooperation to tackle key vulnerabilities including climate change food insecurity and elevated debt

the views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer and do not necessarily reflect the views or positions of any entities with k2radio news or townsquare media when i was a little kid i always loved going to my grandparents house on christmas they pulled out all the stops in the morning me and the other kids would wake everyone up running through the house like wild animals brightly wrapped gifts spilled out from under the tree and onto every piece of furniture in the living room we were lucky little people grandma had a giant black garbage bag on the ready for all the cardboard and plastic and paper that went flying through the air i still love christmas i do i lovelovelove it especially re creating some of those memories for my own small children so don t get me wrong but as a grown up sometimes it can feel like a month long marathon of exhausting labor and excess spending leading up to an explosion that leaves everyone feeling vaguely sick earlier this year like last year and the year before i set aside what i feel is a reasonable amount of money from my tax refund as my christmas budget and let s be honest i ll probably end up spending even more once it s all said and done because there s always something or someone i forgot according to wealth experts 1 000 bucks is the average most american households will spend whether they ve planned on it or not tiny shopping cart canva in 2020 holiday retail sales surpassed a trillion dollars that s twelve zeros in 2014 the overall figure was just over 842 billion dollars meaning that christmas spending increased by over 160 billion dollars in less than five years between gifts parties and decorations the christmas season in america seems to be getting more and more superfluous but on january 1st if i don t get in front of this thing i ll check my bank statements step on the scale look around the house and feel a little guilty then i and a legion of others will plunge head first into a deep pool of resolution in attempts to rectify the damage that s been done and resolve to do things differently on the next go round this year as christmas approaches i consider how this holiday got so commercialized in the first place if history is not your thing skip to the end for nearly two millennia people around the world have observed the holidays with practices that are both religious and even agrarian in scandinavia the norse celebrated yule from december 21st through january scholars say that the pagan yule time included traditions of the yule log sitting by the fire with loved ones feasting and singing get our free mobile app get our free mobile app in fact december was a perfect time for celebration in most areas of europe too because that was the time when many of the animals were slaughtered people would have had an abundance of fresh meat and the wine and beer that was prepared earlier in the year was finally ready for drinking sometime around the middle of the nineteenth century modern christmas as we know it was invented a big driver in the spread of christmas trees were women s home magazines both the stories and the ads created christmas lore that quickly became holiday mainstays trending in godey s lady s book the most widely read magazine at the time there s a picture of queen victoria and her family gathered around a tree as with dianna princess of wales and her hats queen victoria started a lasting fad in the english speaking world says karal anne marling a professor of art history and american studies around the same time charles dickens one of the most popular writers of the victorian era created the much beloved tale of ebenezer scrooge dickens strongly detested industrialism and thought the modern world was becoming too cruel and that an obsession with money was preventing people from truly enjoying life dickens was the first to teach us that true gift giving shouldn t derive from snooty pity but from an overflowing generosity yet by making gift giving such a central part of his story dickens ironically wedded christmas to the very industrial commercial world he despised said marling charles dickens canva within dickens own lifetime entrepreneurs began selling christmas cards to create a market for the newly invented color printing technology cementing symbols of christmas like the tree ornaments saint nick and other figures into pop culture with that department stores began to stock ornaments in the same shapes they appeared in magazines and cards in 1862 macy s claims to have hosted the first real live santa drawing in crowds of eager children with their parents and checkbooks following behind but the guy in the red coat who we know and love today wasn t fully developed until the 1930 s when an illustrator named haddon sundblom was paid to craft an image of a wholesome santa loosely based on clement clark moore s poem the night before christmas for coca cola advertisements even rudolph the red nosed reindeer was created as a marketing strategy to boost holiday sales a department store known as the montgomery ward commissioned a children s rhyming book about the outcast reindeer that became an instant success selling over two million copies the first year and spawning the song and claymation cartoon rudolph the red nosed reindeer full movie christmas vibes movie time youtube from santa claus and rudolph the red nosed reindeer to the iconic decorations of christmas marketing and business not only influenced our experience of the holiday season it created it and we bought it we can trace the commercialization of christmas back to the mid 1800s to see exactly how much marketing impacts our culture and ultimately the power of money over our social trends whether you are religious or can just appreciate that the darkest days of winter will soon be over might we do christmas without the excess of food presents and décor do we really need a bunch of sugar jewelry and gadgets to put a smile on our loved ones faces i m not suggesting we throw out all the commercial aspects of it it is after all evident that christmas spending is good for the economy and sociologists tell us that reciprocity giving and receiving is the life blood of any functioning society that said how long can we keep driving the expense and expectations up higher and higher do we really need to spend 1000 a year on christmas presents or are we just perpetuating vapid trends is it really necessary to get your coworkers or that one random friend who always gets you a gift a gift where does it end i tend to agree with dr seuss that christmas will still come without packages boxes or bags maybe christmas doesn t come from a store maybe christmas perhaps means a little bit more if this piece sent you into a rage and you now wish to find out where i live and eggnog my house first please don t second this is just my humble opinion if you share similar feelings about the holiday here s my tips focus on gratitude for comfort and warmth the danes have a word called hygge pronounced hoo ga that focuses on warmth light and enjoying the little things they do this with candles savory stews warm socks and cuddles although we don t have a specefic word for it i think we can still run with this sentiment give generously to those who need it not just to the people who expect it and if you re up for it ask your loved ones to forgo getting you a present this year you can always direct people to a charity of your choice if they insist read also casper family donates dozens of bags to stuff the van just cook what you need don t give in to the urge to make ten different kinds of cookies that will inevitably go stale before they re all eaten by the way nobody likes fruitcake stop making fruitcake and finally express joy and make laughter relax unwind and if you re lucky enough to have time off from your job appreciate it a bosom buddies christmas story

tulips and bitcoin have both been associated with financial bubbles in their time but in a giant greenhouse near amsterdam the dutch are trying to make them work together engineer bert de groot inspects the six bitcoin miners as they perform complex sums to earn cryptocurrency filling the air with a noisy whine along with a blast of warmth that warmth is now heating the hothouse where rows of tulips grow cutting the farmers reliance on gas whose price has soared since russia s invasion of ukraine the servers in turn are powered by solar energy from the roof reducing the normally huge electricity costs for mining and cutting the impact on the environment meanwhile both the farmers and de groot s company bitcoin brabant are earning crypto which is still attracting investors despite a recent crash in the market we think with this way of heating our greenhouse but also earning some bitcoin we have a win win situation flower farmer danielle koning 37 told afp the netherlands love of tulips caused the first stock market crash in the 17th century when speculation bulb prices caused prices to soar only to later collapse now the netherlands is the world s biggest tulip producer and also the second biggest agricultural exporter overall after the united states with much grown in greenhouses but the low lying country is keenly aware of the effect of the agricultural industry on climate change while farmers are struggling with high energy prices mining for cryptocurrency meanwhile requires huge amounts of electricity to power computers leading to an environmental impact amid global efforts to tackle climate change de groot 35 who only started his business earlier this year and now has 17 clients including restaurants and warehouses says this makes bitcoin and tulips a perfect fit this operation is actually carbon negative as are all the operations i basically build says the long haired de groot sporting an orange polo shirt with his firm s logo we re actually improving the environment he is also selling tulips online for bitcoin via a business called bitcoinbloem the collaboration started when koning saw a twitter video de groot had made about bitcoin mining and called him up now there are six servers at their hothouse whose exact location koning asked to keep secret to avoid thieves targeting the 15 000 euro machines koning s company owns half of them and keeps the bitcoin they produce while de groot is allowed to keep his three servers there in exchange for monthly visits to clean dust and insects out of the servers fans with a 20 degree celsius difference between the air entering the machine and leaving them this provides the heat needed to grow the tulips and to dry the bulbs that produce them the most important thing we get out of it is we save on natural gas says koning secondly well we earn bitcoin by running them in the greenhouse huge energy costs have driven some dutch agricultural firms that often rely on greenhouses to stop growing this year while others have even gone bankrupt says koning meanwhile the philosopher nassim nicholas taleb who developed the idea of the unpredictable but historic black swan event has compared bitcoin to the tulipmania that engulfed the netherlands nearly 400 years ago this saw prices for a single bulb rise to more than 100 times the average annual income at the time before the bubble burst in 1637 causing banks to fail and people to lose their life savings the cryptocurrency sector is currently reeling from the collapse of a major exchange with bitcoin currently worth around 16 300 per unit down from a high of 68 000 in november 2021 but de groot isn t worried i have absolutely no worries about the long term value proposition of an immutable monetary system he says bitcoin will last for ever

world bank world bank senior economist for zimbabwe stella illieva says the country has one of the lowest investments globally due to a number of macroeconomic factors zimbabwe received foreign direct investments worth us 745 million in 2018 falling to us 280 million the following year us 194 million in 2020 and us 166 million in 2021 this lack of investment has left industry and business requiring at least us 2 billion to retool upgrade restructure and support production according to several business membership organisations investment in zimbabwe is 10 of gdp gross domestic product it s one of the lowest investments in the world so fixing the macroeconomic issues will certainly support this investment that is needed for retooling industry investment that is needed to upgrade infrastructure and help zimbabwean companies become productive and more competitive illieva said at the launch of the zimbabwe national chamber of commerce second edition annual state of industry and commerce survey 2022 currently because of the global situation and these multiple crises many countries are facing the dilemma of how to support growth and control high inflation unfortunately there are not many options to keep this balance to control inflation and i think for zimbabwe its an even bigger challenge due to already high inflation levels and very limited fiscal space to mitigate the impact of multiple global shocks she said next year s elections were likely to create further pressures as the government would be forced to spend outside the budget resulting in increased money supply and eventually inflation levels and high inflation coupled with worst than expected crops will affect consumption will also affect investment and will reverse the good poverty reduction that we have seen over the past several years illieva said some of the major reasons for the poor investments are the depreciating local currency high inflation failure to repatriate earnings outside the country owing to tight central bank controls high tax regime corruption and red tape in doing business also the declining service delivery in utilities such as power and water along with policy inconsistency negatively affect investor sentiment illieva said investors needed incentives to invest fitch solutions global market analyst chiedza madzima said we rank markets based on the competitiveness of their business climate so out of 201 countries zimbabwe ranks 184th our neighbouring country zambia ranks 164th south africa 67th and on the other end of the spectrum singapore ranks 1st all these countries in the region and globally are competing for the same global pot of capital so it s important to keep sight of what is it that investors not just local but foreign investors really want for their business environment so it s aspects like sound money clear and predictable policy environment market access as well as bankable projects so i think the government of today does recognise the need for painful reforms and implementation in some areas is wanted but you know these are reforms that really should have started decades ago and what seems to complicate a lot of the decision making work of policy makers in zimbabwe is the extent to which the country is locked out of international financial markets she said zimbabwe was now vulnerable to external and commodity head shocks as that remained its main source of revenue adding that it was either booms or busts yet business wanted something in the middle there is this deep confidence gap to navigate especially in the foreign investor community and a lot of internal policy scepticism but if you bring that sort of global aspect into play zimbabwe is a country that cannot lie on its laurels anymore in terms of relying on the export of primary sector goods in agriculture mining exports madzima said fitch solutions is an america based global market research firm
vancouver the effects of climate change are taking a toll on christmas tree farms across canada with one forestry expert and the head of the canadian christmas tree association saying the sector that s already undergoing shifts will need to adapt vancouver the effects of climate change are taking a toll on christmas tree farms across canada with one forestry expert and the head of the canadian christmas tree association saying the sector that s already undergoing shifts will need to adapt the festive trees take eight to 12 years to reach the size most people look for and young seedlings are particularly vulnerable to climate risks said richard hamelin head of the forest conservation sciences department at the university of b c much of the province has experienced prolonged drought and extreme heat over the last two summers and the seedlings have shallow root systems that don t reach beyond the very dry layers of soil near the surface hamelin explained meanwhile their older counterparts may survive but lose their needles or turn brown as a result of extreme heat and drought he said in an interview seedlings and their shallow roots are also at risk of being inundated during flooding while wet cool soils increase the risk of root diseases hamelin noted record breaking atmospheric rivers of rain caused extensive flooding throughout southwestern b c in november 2021 but shirley brennan the executive director of the canadian christmas trees association said farmers in the province reported their seedlings mostly appeared fine and the extreme heat had been much harder on the trees the effects of flooding however may become clearer over time right now the seedlings look ok but it s whether or not the root system is strong enough to grow into that tree and that s what we don t know brennan said quebec ontario and nova scotia lead the country when it comes to producing christmas trees and brennan said farmers in those provinces have also been grappling with the effects of increasingly extreme unseasonable weather brennan said she has spoken with tree farmers from across southwestern ontario and the greater toronto area some of whom told her they lost upwards of 40 per cent of their crops as they didn t receive rain between may and august this year christmas tree farmers are no strangers to drought brennan added drought is part of farming she said mother nature is a silent partner in any farming commodity whether it s christmas trees or whether it is corn the difference brennan said is the extreme unseasonable nature of recent droughts and other climate related events including intense late spring frosts in nova scotia in 2018 followed by eastern ontario and western quebec in 2020 brennan said she expects more tree farmers will start planting seedlings in both spring and fall when they would normally favour planting in one season hamelin noted climate change is also causing warmer weather that fuels activity among pests which can plague trees already weakened by drought or disease just like humans when we are stressed or when we re more tired we re more susceptible to diseases well trees are the same way he said all this added stress from all this heat and flooding make the trees more susceptible to pests and pathogens climate change is not the only factor challenging farmers and threatening canada s stock of real christmas trees which has been declining for several years since the trees take about a decade to reach the desired size the closure of tree farms in canada and the united states during the 2008 recession is now being felt the closures have continued since then data from statistics canada shows the total area of christmas tree farms shrunk by nearly 20 000 acres between 2011 and 2021 the average age of a tree farmer is between 65 and 85 years old and younger generations aren t entering the sector as longtime farmers retire brennan noted hamelin said the high cost of land and competition with crops that yield revenue more quickly than festive trees may also be inhibiting factors for the sector in b c he pointed to some options that could help christmas tree farmers weather the effects of climate change including genetically selecting and breeding the strongest trees among classic canadian speciesor importing different species from parts of the world where fir trees are better adapted to sweltering heat such as turkey the plantation like approach to christmas tree farming is also completely unnatural leaving seedlings and young trees exposed to the sun he said christmas tree farmers could consider letting some trees grow taller or planting seedlings in areas where more mature trees could provide some shade he said i think there are some solutions we just need to scratch our head and realize that things are different and in the future we just need to change the way we do things this report by the canadian press was first published dec 11 2022 brenna owen the canadian press

ma xuejing china daily editor s note the global economy has changed significantly over the past few years in the way that it is organized and governed by collaborating nations these changes have repercussions that not only affect the flow of goods and services between countries but also monetary and financial policies four experts share their views on the issue with china daily world must avoid fragmentation by gita gopinath now is a particularly challenging time for the global economy with the outlook expected to darken in 2023 three powerful forces are holding back the global economy the conflict between russia and ukraine the need to tighten monetary policy amid the cost of living crisis and persistent and broadening inflation pressures and the slowdown of the chinese economy during the international monetary fund s annual meetings in october we projected global growth to slow from 6 0 percent last year to 3 2 percent this year and for 2023 we lowered our forecast to 2 7 percent 0 2 percentage points lower than projected a few months earlier in july we expect the global slowdown to be broad based with countries accounting for one third of the global economy contracting this year or next the three largest economies the united states china and the euro area will continue to stall there is a one in four chance that global growth next year could fall below 2 percent a historical low in short the worst is yet to come and some major economies such as germany are expected to enter recession next year let s take a look at the world s largest economies in the united states tightening monetary and financial conditions mean growth could be about 1 percent in 2023 in china we have lowered next year s growth forecast to 4 4 percent due to the weakening property sector and weaker global demand in the eurozone the energy crisis caused by the russia ukraine conflict is taking a heavy toll reducing our growth projection for 2023 to 0 5 percent almost everywhere rapidly rising prices especially those of food and energy are causing serious hardships for vulnerable households despite the slowdown inflation pressures are proving broader and more persistent than anticipated global inflation is now expected to peak at 9 5 percent in 2022 before decelerating to 4 1 percent by 2024 inflation is also broadening beyond food and energy the outlook could worsen further and policy trade offs have become acutely challenging here are four key risks the risk of monetary fiscal or financial policy miscalibration has risen sharply at a time of high uncertainty turmoil in financial markets could cause global financial conditions to deteriorate and the us dollar to strengthen further inflation could yet again prove more persistent especially if labor markets remain extremely tight finally the hostilities in ukraine are still raging further escalation would exacerbate the energy and food security crisis increasing price pressures remain the most immediate threat to current and future prosperity by squeezing real incomes and undermining macroeconomic stability central banks are now focused on restoring price stability and the pace of tightening has accelerated sharply where necessary financial policy should ensure that markets remain stable however central banks around the world need to keep a steady hand with monetary policy firmly focused on taming inflation the strength of the us dollar is also a major challenge the dollar is now at its strongest since the early 2000s so far this rise appears mostly driven by fundamental forces such as the tightening of monetary policy in the us and the energy crisis the appropriate response is to calibrate monetary policy to maintain price stability while letting exchange rates adjust conserving valuable foreign exchange reserves for when financial conditions really worsen as the global economy is headed for stormy waters now is the time for emerging market policymakers to batten down the hatches eligible countries with sound policies should urgently consider improving their liquidity buffers including requesting access to precautionary instruments from the imf in addition the us could reactivate currency swap lines to eligible countries as it extended at the start of the pandemic this would provide an important safety valve in times of currency market stress too many low income countries are close to or already in debt distress progress toward orderly debt restructurings through the g20 s common framework is urgently needed to avert a wave of sovereign debt crises for china low inflation and weakening growth allow for greater support for vulnerable households which together with strengthening social safety nets would promote consumption the new rules to loosen covid restrictions will help mitigate the policy s economic impact and will be critical to sustain and balance economic recovery in the property sector urgent action at the central government level is needed to safeguard financial stability these efforts will be good for china for the economic well being of the chinese people and good for the world there is one other

recent years while different local state and federal agencies are trying to protect families and stop these criminals many social media influencers are also changing the focus of their videos to try catch these child predators in the act themselves but can both of these groups effectively and legally carry out their investigations at the same time police say they cannot a department of one brandon poor is a detective for the grand prairie police department he has always been motivated to protect the most vulnerable especially when they are young there s no more innocent victim that we can protect as police poor said of children this is a big reason why he created the internet crimes against children unit within the police department in 2016 poor said he was already working a lot of crimes involving abuse of children as well as child homicides so it was an easy transition there was not a dedicated unit working this he said so after discussing it with our chain of command they agreed that yes there is a big necessity for this to be handled and investigated poor is the only officer in his department and mainly deals with a lot of digital evidence when you walk into his office you ll see many large monitors multiple hard drives and copious usb flash drives plugged into computers poor spends his days looking through thousands of messages photos and documents that are sent from adults to minors that could result in potential sexual exploitation people hide things in computers in plain sight poor said most of the crimes poor deals with happen through text messages dating site conversations or other online communications poor said he wants to find adults not only talking to minors in sexual manners but attempting to meet in person to have sex with them real kids are online poor said we know predators go where real kids go and that s where they re meeting up poor said this happens way more than parents realize that s also why along with his work for the police department he hosts a podcast called catfish cops in which along with another detective he discusses the issues surrounding online child predators no matter what they re online poor said speaking about these predators we always tell parents anywhere someone can communicate with another person that s an opportunity for a person that has bad intentions to go after a child a rise in online predators as the beginning of the covid 19 pandemic in 2020 sent people back into their homes it also forced many to become more connected to their computers and the internet consequently child predators started taking advantage of this the national center for missing and exploited children is the largest child protection organization in america the organization in part works to protect children from predators and provide resources to families wanting to keep their children safe the non profit also collects data and statistics related to issues involving child exploitation according to a recently released report there were more than 21 7 million reports of suspected child sexual exploitation made to the national center for missing and exploited children s cybertipline in 2020 that s the highest number of reports ever recorded in the organization s 36 years of existence in terms of online enticement the non profit said there were 37 872 reports in 2020 a 97 5 increase compared to 2019 19 174 the trend also goes beyond messaging and predators the internet watch foundation reported that in 2021 it took action against 252 000 urls that it confirmed contained images or videos of children being raped and suffering sexual abuse in total the internet watch foundation investigated 361 000 reports of suspected criminal material involving these potential types of images and video in 2021 that s more than the organization dealt with throughout the entire first 15 years of its existence 335 558 the organization said that younger people relying more on the internet during the pandemic has made them more vulnerable to criminals looking to find and manipulate children into recording their own sexual abuse on camera poor said he has also noticed a rise in online predators in the past few years some of those conversations will be forever secret and may not come out at all poor said that s of course the worse fear we have to learn more about the 2020 exploitation stats from the national center for missing and exploited children s cybertipline report you can click here to learn more about the 2021 exploitation stats from the internet watch foundation you can click here from social media influencers to vigilantes the rise of social media has also brought with it plenty of ways to create content from youtube to tiktok to instagram people online can create videos that attrack millions of followers a michigan based youtube content creator who goes by the name skeeter jean has accomplished that he has 478 000 subscribers and 30 525 001 views on his 47 videos on youtube with the ad revenue he makes on each video jean said making youtube videos is how he makes a living i was always browsing youtube when i was very young jean said it just looked like a really cool job i guess you could say so i figured i d try my hand at it jean has a very focused approach and message in nearly all of his videos however he creates stings to try and catch child predators in the act he s a part of a growing trend of content creators trying to expose others online in this way too the inspiration all comes from binge watching to catch a predator on youtube back in the day jean said jean starts most of his videos by providing some context for what led up to his sting his process begins with creating a profile on several dating apps in which he poses as a younger looking person then through conversation he eventually tells adults who reach out to him that he is 13 or 14 years old jean said he never messages his marks first he said he just waits for predators to come to him then once these conversation turns inappropriate or sexual things usually quickly move to the other person wanting to meet in person one thing leads to another and boom we re there at a local meijer or walmart with me jean said i have the blazer and the binder and a camera confronting them about why they are there to meet up with a minor in the binder jean brings he has screenshots of their conversations and will usually read out the parts where it was established that jean posing as a minor said he was a minor and that the other person expressed interest in some form of sexual activity jean generally remains fairly calm in his videos he doesn t yell or curse at the person he s confronting however along with a cameraman he usually brings one other person as a security precaution in case the person he s confronting tries to get violent a lot of my videos there tends to be a lot of drama in them jean said what i hope happens is first of all they don t run away from me in the store and they have the conversation with me i like to do sort of a deep dive into the why they re there and what they were thinking behind the context of the actual messages and pictures they were sending to who they thought to be a 13 year old girl jean said when he hears people say or reads in the comments that he s just doing it for clicks his response is that these videos are doing more good than harm we re getting people s eyes on this situation jean said the general public knows about these people complications in taking predators to court while there are content creators across the country jumping on this growing vigilante trend it can t be forgotten many of the people they are exposing have committed or are committing a crime so are the people being exposed in these online videos being prosecuted or going to jail dallas county district attorney john creuzot said it s more complicated than you might realize cruezot cites article 38 23 in texas code of criminal procedure which prevents evidence obtained by an officer or a civilian from being used in court if it was stolen or obtained illegally when dealing with text messages photos and video that is clouded in fake dating profiles and meet ups established on misconceptions or lies some might view that as a violation of texas code of criminal procedure indicting someone for a case you can t prove is fruitless so we re going to look at it all the way through cruezot said we re going to look at what we have what the police have put together the strength of it and we re also going to look at any possible defenses if there are any cruezot said his team will still look at video and evidence provided by online vigilantes but he advises against others replicating these youtubers efforts with the potential for violence and things suddenly going wrong while meeting in person he said these types of situations can be dangerous trained professionals like the police or the fbi are much better equipped to handle such a scenario cruezot said we would not encourage an average citizen to do this there s too much danger cruezot said the person is expecting a child and an adult shows up if that person has a gun or knife or wants to get violent then we have a problem where somebody could get injured or killed and we re not looking for that jean said that after he shoots his sting he always hands over his video and evidence to the police but he doesn t work with the police beforehand he said even if the people he exposes don t end up going to jail he s still doing good by exposing them to the public through hundreds of thousands and sometimes millions of views online just because they re not being prosecuted doesn t mean it s doing more harm than good jean said but the danger goes beyond just the content creators or the people in the sting video very often poor said people who are willing to potentially do something sexual with a minor will try to do it again the next time they ll just be savvier in how they attempt to do so and in some cases they will want or need more validation they ll do it much more cautiously poor said they require much more validation and so in the long run you re actually causing a child to get harmed because the offender wasn t held accountable for what happened the first time and many times we don t know that this person is doing this behavior again until after they ve offended against a child and a child has to go through that trauma and abuse before we can hold that person accountable that s why poor said getting law enforcement involved as early as possible can give the best chance to put the potential predator behind bars we don t want you engaging a predator as a child or otherwise because we don t want a real child put in harms way poor said it s just like any other crime i don t want someone that s walking through their neighborhood to try to stop something if there s the chance for law enforcement to get involved what to do if you are a victim one of the hardest parts of poor s job is having to deal with the aftermath when a minor has been sexually assaulted or caught up in this online solicitation shame can be a large obstacle in stopping illegal behavior or reaching out for help more than 50 of kids and parents mostly or exclusively blame the child in the photo when nudes are leaked according to international anti human trafficking organization thorn kids you know they don t want to get in trouble poor said they re good at hiding things they have multiple accounts outside of the office poor said he frequently visits schools churches and other places where he can talk to children and families about what is happening online and where they can go to get help if they need it sometimes poor said teenagers don t even know they re victims until after the get out of a conversation or predatorial relationship said poor very often we hear from victims after the fact that say y know i just didn t realize what i was in and what was happening to me often people don t know that it s happening right in their backyard the internet watch foundation said that internet sex predators are targeting and grooming younger and younger children with a sharp rise in content showing the abuse of children aged between 7 and 10 years old

moscow is developing arms based on new principles former president declares russia is boosting efforts to produce sophisticated weaponry for its military to deter western countries that are supporting kiev in its fight with moscow former russian president dmitry medvedev said on sunday his comments were apparently a response to aleksey danilov the head of ukraine s national security and defense council who claimed on saturday that kiev does not rule out strikes inside russia adding that its enemy occupies the territory spanning everywhere from the former ukrainian regions that have voted to join russia to the city of vladivostok on the pacific coast writing on telegram medvedev who currently serves as the deputy chairman of russia s security council claimed that moscow s enemies are not only in kiev but also in europe north america and a number of other locations whose allegiances lie with contemporary nazis therefore we are increasing the production of the most powerful weapons and munitions including those based on new principles the ex president added medvedev s comments come after the times citing a us defense source reported on friday that the pentagon had allowed kiev to conduct long range strikes inside russian territory earlier this month ukraine launched a raid on two russian air bases in ryazan and saratov regions both several hundred kilometers from kiev controlled territory using a number of soviet made drones according to russia s defense ministry in september russian foreign ministry spokeswoman maria zakharova warned washington that should it provide kiev with long range weapons this would cross a red line and make america a direct party to the conflict in late november russian defense minister sergey shoigu announced that moscow would significantly boost defense spending russia s state defense orders would increase by almost 50 next year he said adding that special emphasis would be put on artillery and missile systems in september russian president vladimir putin noted that virtually all stocks from nato arsenals were thrown in to support the kiev regime he added however that russia s equipment is performing well in the standoff with western weapons rt com
the story of how a persistent silicon valley upstart named travis kalanick joseph gordon levitt would go on to change the way the world moves with the creation of uber it was far from smooth sailing however because even as outside threats constantly tried to cripple uber before it could take off kalanick s own hubris greed and dude bro attitude almost destroyed the company from within even as those exact same attributes made uber what it is today it s kind of astonishing how the big short a scrappy little film about the ins and outs of the 2008 stock market crash by the guy who made anchorman get hard and talladega nights has proven to be one of the most important influential films of the century so far the way that adam mckay and his co writer charles randolph used every stylistic trick in the book and margot robbie in the bath to make the incredibly convoluted financial crisis not just understandable but breathlessly entertaining has been copied by countless films since not least by mckay himself in a series of similarly socially conscious but less successful follow ups to the big short super pumped the battle for uber is yet another in a long line of films and tv shows about silicon valley but its debt to the big short in the way it tells its story is undeniable across the miniseries seven hour long episodes brian koppelman and david levien both arguably best known for the long running tv drama billions stuff super pumped with all the needle drops flashy graphics fourth wall breaks non linear storytelling and voice overs by quentin bloody tarantino that money can buy this is nice and all but whereas the big short used its bag of magic tricks to make an incredibly complicated story both comprehensible and enjoyable super pumped does the same to hide that the story it s telling is both fairly straightforward and more than a little familiar they re neat tricks to be sure and sometimes they even work very well but they only emphasise the unavoidable truth that while the series is compelling enough once you get past a dull first couple of episodes and even occasionally pretty excellent it s a frustratingly uneven affair that desperately struggles to find its target the first few episodes are presumably supposed to be a whirlwind ride built around the euphoric days of travis kalanick taking this small idea of an alternative to the new york cab system and turning it into a huge company that would change the world but they are by far the weakest part of the series uber is undoubtedly an incredible creation but the story of its creation is far too familiar to be particularly exciting and to match the smug douchebaggery of kalanick himself the way the story is told is fairly insufferable from the mega annoying tarantino narration as a narrator and as an actor qt is an excellent filmmaker to the sub sub sorkin dialogue the social network and steve jobs are obvious reference points here to the fourth wall breaking gimmicks the opening three episodes are a real slog frankly had i not needed to review it i wouldn t have made it past half way through episode one if there is one thing that s interesting about these early episodes it s the way that billionaire investor and apparently decent human being bill gurley a nicely understated kyle chandler buys into kalanick s schtick believing him to be a fellow mensch and someone who shares his vision of a better world when kalanick is clearly a repugnant opportunistic arrogant dude bro here s the problem though i m not entirely sure if the creators want us the audience to be equally charmed by kalanick s good guy charisma or if we re supposed to see through him immediately if it s the former then boy have they failed on every imaginable level and if it s the latter then it s incredibly difficult to believe that a veteran businessman like bill gurley would be taken in by kalanick for a second i m inclined to think it s the first option based on the way we are told over and over again what a good guy he is by everyone around him but he never comes across that way for a second and he certainly doesn t come across as charming joseph gordon levitt who is clearly relishing his biggest role in years may be very charming in real life and in most roles but there s nothing charming about his travis kalanick and the often insufferable dialogue does nothing to win us over to his side it s a fatal flaw that runs throughout the series with the central character arc of a decent man corrupted by his success ringing entirely hollow some of his moral shadings in the later episodes are much more effective the series plays with the idea of whether he is a goodish guy acting the douche or just a douche and even he not being entirely sure but the parts of the series that are supposed to make us care about kalanick and be excited by his success never ever hit their target the show does however pick up considerably with the fourth episode as the series shifts its focus away from the rise of uber and towards the massive moral failings at the heart of both the company and its founder and towards the question of just how much we as consumers are willing to sell our souls for the sake of convenience and while the series never convinces in presenting kalanick as either charming or decent it s on much surer footing when it dives into kalanick s awfulness while at the same time showing glimpses of the humanity behind the narcissistic monster over the course of these remaining four hours the series is actually fairly effective at showing how between an increasingly toxic work environment a culture of misogyny woeful treatment of drivers shocking breaches of privacy and some horrific crimes happening in ubers all over the world kalanick s fantastically successful and influential company proved to be a microcosm of everything that s wrong and occasionally right about silicon valley it s also largely quite good at presenting the idea that not only does it take a manipulative narcissist like travis kalanick to create something that is as largely positively world changing as uber but that kalanick is hardly the worst example of this pity then that it feels the need to spell this whole thesis out with a long winded and smug monologue from kalanick directly to the camera in the closing moments of the final episode the series is never better though than in the second to last episode when the whole thing snaps into place as it focuses on the sexist side of uber s business culture told from the point of view of susan fowler billions eva victor in powerful form fowler plays an uber programmer who is exceptionally good at her job and tries to tough it out despite blatantly sexist attitudes from both her male co workers and a female hr rep what works so well about this episode which simultaneously focuses on an interrogation of kalanick by apple ceo tim cook hank azaria about the same issues is that it s hardly a total shock that a dude bro work environment is horrible to women it also shines a spotlight on the more subtle and under handed sexism that can be overlooked in an era when the metoo movement focused so heavily and rightly on much more blatant sexual harassment it s good passionate stuff that makes use of the many gimmicks and tricks that the clearly expensive series has at its disposal just the needle drop soundtrack must have cost an absolute fortune to actually feel fresh and incisive a nice departure from the same bag of tricks being used to aggressively try hard effect in the earlier episodes it s the easy high point of the whole series but it s also emblematic of how much better the second half of the series is than the first it s hard not to feel the whole thing would have been far better with having the opening salvo of episodes condensed into one exposition heavy prologue if this sort of series is at all your sort of cup of tea i highly recommend barrelling through those obnoxious first few hours to get to the good stuff that is a bit of an ask though where to watch showmax cast joseph gordon levitt kyle chandler

the pandemic associated with covid 19 or coronavirus has significantly disrupted daily life all over the world and the united states as the number of reported cases has increased congress has passed both an emergency appropriations bill and the families first coronavirus response act ffcra which provides tax relief for paid leave as well as additional resources for social programs aimed at alleviating the spread of the disease and any economic consequences of the epidemic ref the trump administration has also taken a number of administrative steps aimed at improving the public health systems by reducing barriers for medical professionals to deliver a more appropriate level of care finally the federal reserve has taken a number of actions to prevent the coronavirus epidemic from leading to a broader economic breakdown earlier this week both congress and the administration launched discussions regarding a large fiscal stimulus package that is intended to prevent a recession as we have specified in several papers over the past two weeks any policy response by congress to address the adverse economic consequences of the coronavirus epidemic should be targeted temporary and directed at aiding public health efforts ref at the same time any fiscal response should not increase spending permanently unfortunately the coronavirus aid relief and economic security cares act that was released on the afternoon of march 18 fails to meet many of these objectives for instance the bill provides over 200 billion in special assistance to specific industries in a way that will likely encourage political abuse that said the cares act also provides a number of beneficial reforms with regard to labor tax health and education policy it also includes small business loans that will function more like grants but are probably necessary if governments at all levels are encouraging businesses to stop operating for some period of time in order to slow the spread of the coronavirus epidemic however the senate should take great care to improve on the cares act by amending it based on the recommendations in this paper these include expanding the paid leave credit included in ffcra and creating a new program that allows the federal government to prepay anticipated future expenses of businesses directly affected by the coronavirus epidemic to help mitigate the fall in revenue that is associated with people having to change their behavior dramatically over a limited period of time special assistance to specific industries overnight the bill would make the u s treasury department one of the largest investment banks in the country authorized to make loans to guarantee loans to and take equity positions in businesses of all types section 3102 authorizes 208 billion in loans and loan guarantees for three groups 50 billion is provided for passenger air carriers 8 billion for cargo air carriers and 150 billion for other businesses the loans and loan guarantees would be in such form and on such terms and conditions and contain such covenants representatives warranties and requirements including requirements for audits as the secretary determines appropriate ref and made at the discretion on the secretary ref the government is authorized to enter into contracts under which the federal government contingent on the financial success of the eligible business would participate in the gains of the eligible business or its security holders through the use of such instruments as warrants stock options common or preferred stock or other appropriate equity instruments ref thus the government can be expected to take large equity positions in airlines and other businesses increases in compensation and bonuses for highly paid employees are limited until march 1 2022 if a firm takes these loans ref a bailout of this magnitude of large firms and with so few taxpayer protections is unwarranted furthermore turning the treasury department into a large investment bank with almost unlimited discretion is a recipe for cronyism favoritism poor results and taxpayer losses at the very least firms should be able to secure loans only in amounts that are demonstrated to be directly related to their crisis related losses there are many ways that these provisions could be reformed to protect this program from abuse for instance the firms should be required to demonstrate that they cannot obtain credit from private sources on commercially reasonable terms and the legislation should establish detailed criteria for what is deemed commercially reasonable there should be collateralization requirements the legislation should require that firm assets not otherwise previously encumbered should be pledged as collateral the collateral should be of at least equal value to the loan or if the collateral is insufficient all of the firms unencumbered tangible and intangible assets the legislation should require that the interest rates paid should be at least as high as those for low rated corporate bonds small business loans the bill provides 299 4 billion for small business loans ref in contrast in fiscal year 2019 the small business administration made 23 2 billion of section 7 a loans ref small business is defined as any business concern private nonprofit organization or public nonprofit organization which employs not more than 500 employees ref the loans would not to be underwritten based on creditworthiness if the business existed on march 1 2020 and had employees it is eligible ref besides any stated business purpose the loans may be used for payroll support including paid sick medical or family leave and costs related to the continuation of group health care benefits during those periods of leave employee salaries mortgage payments rent utilities and any other debt obligations that were incurred before march 1 2020 ref normal fees would be waived ref the maximum loan amount would be increased to 10 million ref the federal government will guarantee 100 percent of section 7 a loans made by financial institutions ref this is an increase from the typical guarantee percentages of 75 percent 85 percent currently ref a very large proportion of these loans will be forgiven or in other words transformed into grants section 1105 provides that businesses taking these loans shall be eligible for forgiveness of indebtedness on a covered 7 a loan in an amount equal to the cost of maintaining payroll continuity from march 1 2020 to june 30 2020 ref payroll costs would exclude wages for any employee in excess of 33 333 during the four month period and qualified sick leave wages for which a credit is allowed under section 7001 of the families first coronavirus response act ref some other limitations are imposed the forgiven loans will not be treated as income for tax purposes ref ordinarily a program anything like the program described above would constitute unwarranted government subsidy of business harming the taxpayer and impeding the ordinary functioning of the market however in the current circumstances local and state government orders have often made it unlawful for these businesses even to operate moreover the federal government is instructing although not ordering the public not to patronize these businesses the businesses must still pay their rent and mortgages and have millions of employees who rely on them for their livelihood if government continues to order them not to do business or severely restricts how they do business most will be forced to lay off or furlough workers and many of these businesses will fail because government orders driven by the desire to contain the coronavirus epidemic are the source of their financial distress some level of government support is warranted the magnitude of the support that it warranted is a function of how long government policies last making it nearly impossible for these firms to do business and the severity and duration of the epidemic ultimately this is unknown at this point labor while the families first coronavirus response act and the cares act address paid sick and family leave provisions for independent workers and those who work for companies that employ fewer than 500 employees it does nothing to protect workers of larger employers yet some of the industries that have been hardest hit by the coronavirus include very large employers in areas of travel tourism and business services by applying the same paid sick and family leave provisions to workers of large employers including quick access to refunds through employer credits policymakers could reduce or eliminate the need for separate selective bailouts to big business also provided under this act and discussed above that said the cares act also includes a number of positive reforms the major provisions include the following section 4606 allows for paid leave for rehired employees the cares act allows employers to receive paid sick leave credits for employees who were recently fired on march 1 or later but for whom they rehire and provide sick leave payments extending the availability of this credit to recently fired but rehired employees could help restore workers to their previous positions when they might otherwise have been permanently separated from their employers and potentially unemployed for a significant amount of time section 4603 adds authority to exempt small businesses from paid leave mandates to help prevent small employers from going out of business or laying off workers this provision provides added authority for the secretary of labor to use regulations to exempt some small businesses with fewer than 50 employees from being forced to provide paid leave hopefully with the added immediate availability of paid leave credits businesses will not need such exemptions section 4607 provides for advance payments for paid leave credits included in ffcra the cares act allows employers and self employed individuals to receive advance payments for their paid sick and family leave credits effectively making such paid leave dollars available potentially within weeks instead of having to wait months or a a year from now this is very helpful as many employers do not have the cash reserves to pay their employees for up to 60 days of sick and family leave and without near term access to the credits refunding their sick leave payments they would either have to lay workers off or go out of business this provision will hopefully reduce the need for heedless loans to small businesses also made available under this act and discussed above as effectively paying workers wages is superior to providing taxpayer financed loans and widespread loan forgiveness to companies tax policy there are several provisions in the cares act that are problematic section 2101 provides recovery checks through advanced tax refunds of up to 1 200 single or 2 400 married filing jointly and an additional 500 per child based on 2018 tax returns the rebate phases out starting at 75 000 single and is reduced to zero at 99 000 taxpayers must have at least 2 500 in qualifying income to qualify for a rebate millions of americans at this time are in need because of the widespread business closures however broad based relief is not a well targeted prescription for this crisis despite major dislocations most americans do not need direct government aid government supports should be targeted toward keeping people employed and supporting those who do lose their jobs due to the coronavirus crisis at the same time sending checks to americans including those who have not lost their jobs runs the risk of jeopardizing public health efforts if the intention is to encourage social distancing rather than going out into the economy to spend extra money however a number of other of tax provisions are beneficial for instance the bill includes necessary tax relief for businesses and individuals by delaying tax filing deadlines delaying estimated tax payments expanding access to business net operating losses and fixing long postponed technical fixes to the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act sections 2201 and 2202 would allow for the delay of estimated tax payments and payroll tax payments for business companies are able to delay the first two quarterly estimated tax payments of 2020 until october 15 the 6 2 percent employer payroll tax liability is delayed and required to be paid back over the following two years these delays will provide needed temporary cash to businesses as they try to stay afloat section 2101 would allow for the delay of filing deadlines for individuals the typical april 15 tax filing deadline is postponed to july 15 this will allow the irs and tax preparers to follow centers for disease control and prevention guidance for social distancing more easily and allow taxpayers to retain any money they would otherwise owe for an additional three months sections 2203 and 2204 expand access to net operating losses specifically these sections allow business tax losses from 2018 2019 and 2020 to be credited against the last five years of taxes paid for an immediate refund and temporarily removes limitations on the ability to carry losses forward businesses would also able to access larger interest deductions under section 2206 these changes would allow struggling businesses to access tax benefits immediately that they would otherwise have to wait years to recoup section 2103 provides for penalty free retirement account withdrawals this proposal would waive the 10 percent early withdrawal penalty for retirement account distributions of up to 100 000 for coronavirus related purposes this allows americans to access their own money in an emergency without facing additional penalties sections 2104 and 2105 expand the charitable giving deduction individuals are permitted a 300 above the line charitable deduction which allows all taxpayers the ability to lower their taxable income by up to 300 of their qualified donations the normal charitable deduction is available only to those taxpayers who itemize their taxes the limits for individuals and businesses on charitable giving deductions as a percent of income are temporarily lifted section 2208 expands access to expensing for retail improvements this allows businesses to fully expense qualified improvement property fixing what is known as the retail glitch this and two other technical corrections to the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act are included health policy this proposal contains provisions that would provide needed flexibility to allow doctors and patients to respond to the pandemic more effectively for example the bill would build on recent administration actions to remove barriers to the adoption of telehealth which is the practice of letting patients consult with doctors via phone or video conferencing section 4404 5 makes it easier for medicare recipients to access telehealth services section 4406 allows the secretary of health and human services to waive requirements for periodic face to face visits for certain medicare patients section 4401 allows holders of health savings accounts to spend money in these accounts on telehealth services these are prudent steps to take as telehealth offers obvious advantages especially in a pandemic that allow patients to get personal medical advice quickly without having to go to the doctor s office first this proposal does however contain several proposals that go beyond the scope of this crisis section 4123 for example provides grants to telehealth for the next five years starting in the next fiscal year congress should instead focus its efforts on near term relief that is directly tied to the current needs of the pandemic education this proposal would provide needed flexibility to public elementary and secondary schools across the country along with higher education institutions and student borrowers section 4511 of the bill includes a proposal that would grant the secretary of education the authority to grant emergency waivers from the elementary and secondary education act esea currently known as the every student succeeds act along with the higher education act hea the secretary could waive both regulatory and statutory requirements levied on states by the federal government as they pertain to testing and associated accountability measures if a state submits a waiver request if a state or school district believes the coronavirus is inhibiting its ability to comply with a particular component of the esea or the hea it could submit a request to the department of education seeking flexibility from that particular section of the law if granted a waiver from the department of education the waivers would be good for up to a year this addresses two major issues currently facing school districts whether they must continue to administer federally mandated tests and whether they can provide online learning options without contravening requirements under the individuals with disabilities education act idea with regard to federally mandated assessments the elementary and secondary education act requires every state to administer reading mathematics and science assessments annually to all students in tested grades the outcomes of which are used in state accountability plans although the u s department of education currently is providing targeted waivers to federal testing provisions under esea this proposal could allow the department to provide a blanket waiver to all states enabling them to postpone testing until this pandemic has subsided with regard to idea and students with special needs in washington state for example the superintendent of public instruction advised schools not to offer online classes unless they can ensure that lessons are provided on an equitable basis ref the department of education should further clarify a fact sheet it released in march 2020 telling districts to ensure that students with disabilities have access to the school s education program although the fact sheet states that districts have flexibility in doing so some districts and states are refusing to offer online learning options to any students out of concern that some students might not be able to access online content particularly students with special needs the senate proposal instructs the secretary to inform congress as to whether or not waivers from idea s regulations should be permitted during this time of crisis this would enable the secretary to clarify that the agency will not punish schools for delivering instructional content online even if it cannot ensure that every student will have access immediately section 4513 of the bill would suspend student loan payments for three months with secretarial discretion to extend the suspension for three additional months there would be no accrual of interest during the three month period that students are not required to make payments this is effectively enabling borrowers that are currently having trouble paying their students loans due to coronavirus induced unemployment to qualify for interest free forbearance this is smart emergency policy that avoids blanket student loan forgiveness large scale student loan forgiveness would be inappropriate and would place an additional burden on those who did not take out loans which represents the vast majority of taxpayers a better option a number of changes in the senate s cares act would improve the public health response while mitigating the economic effects directly associated with the coronavirus pandemic we have discussed these policies in detail in other papers ref however they are briefly outlined here expand rapid and targeted paid sick and family leave assistance to employers with 500 and more workers the ffcra and the cares act address paid sick and family leave provisions for independent workers and those who work for companies that employ fewer than 500 employees both fail to protect workers of larger employers yet some of the industries that have been hardest hit by the coronavirus response include very large employers in areas of travel tourism and business services by applying the same paid sick and family leave provisions to workers of large employers including quick access to refunds through employer credits policymakers could reduce or eliminate the need for separate selective bailouts to big business the credit should also be expanded to all employees of businesses required to shut down or significantly slow down operations per government orders and recommendations for any period of time it should also apply to businesses needing to reduce the number of employees who perform work or the hours of employees performing work waive required minimum distribution rules americans ages 72 and older must take a required minimum distribution each year from their retirement account a percentage which increases with age given significant declines in the stock market in recent weeks rules that require individuals to take large percentages out of their retirement accounts when they have suffered a significant loss can hurt retirees future finances we should let them ride it out if they so choose middle class savers who want to pass on their retirement benefits to their children would also benefit retirement accounts are one of the more common ways typical americans receive an inheritance when the government requires that these accounts be spent down especially in market downturns the rules actively destroy middle class wealth pre purchase expected goods and services to supply businesses with liquidity not bailouts the federal government can inject billions of dollars into the economy at this critical time by pre purchasing predictable goods and services from the private sector purchase agreements should target sectors such as travel and hospitality that are most harmed by the economic effects of the response to the epidemic the government should make these purchases competitively or based on a discount for single sourcing benefiting taxpayers with reduced future expenditures as well as participating businesses with immediate cash flow a properly designed pre purchase program would benefit everyone involved and support the economy at a critical time without being a bailout conclusion congress has taken and can still take a number of steps to mitigate the economic effects associated with the coronavirus epidemic we have outlined a number of those changes in previous papers these include expanding the ffcra tax credit to apply to businesses with more than 500 workers and to all persons who cannot reasonably telecommute in an epidemic area as well as to employees of businesses required to shut down or significantly slow down operations per government orders and recommendations it should also apply to businesses that need to reduce the number of employees who perform work or the hours of employees performing work furthermore additional flexibility should be provided for states to receive federal assistance to respond directly to the public health challenges in addition to amending the provisions included in ffcra congress could also create a program that allows the federal government to prepay anticipated future expenses for airlines hotels restaurants and other businesses directly affected by the coronavirus epidemic to help mitigate the fall in revenue that is associated with people having to change their behavior dramatically over a limited period of time finally there are several tax changes that congress should enact that would help businesses by allowing income taxes to be smoothed over the business cycle while delaying payments however the senate s cares act misses this mark by including special benefits to specific industries that will total 200 billion these special benefits should either be replaced by policies that would help all companies or should be significantly reformed so as to limit abuse lindsey burke phd is director of

bloomberg latin america s bonds are poised for a comeback in 2023 with investors planning the perfect moment to pounce on bargains before a federal reserve pivot and china s reopening send them soaring dollar denominated debt from latin american governments and companies has handed investors returns of more than 10 so far this quarter outperforming all other regions in an emerging market index that has returned 7 in that period china s move away from covid zero the potential end of the fed s interest rate hiking cycle and quieter politics could all help the region s notes shine even brighter in the new year latin america will be one of the most favored regions and as a result sovereign credits should perform quite well said graham stock a strategist at bluebay asset management in

here to listen to the latest episode of the em weekly podcast large commodity exporters such as brazil chile and peru should benefit from increased demand from china as beijing shifts away from its

european credits latin america is not a screaming buy but we do expect some modest outperformance said jared lou a portfolio manager for emerging market debt at william blair investment management in new york even if we re no longer in the commodity super cycle we are still constructive on commodity prices due to supply constraints and expectations of china reopening according to lou latin america

little risk of a default in el salvador in 2023 where nayib bukele s policies have sent the sovereign debt into a tailspin the nation s bond due in january has been edging closer to par and even in

beijing s forbidden city image by victor fraile corbis photo by victor fraile corbis via getty images corbis via getty images as readers of this column know beijing needed to inject emergency liquidity into its financial markets more than a year ago when the giant property developer evergrande first announced that it could not meet its obligations instead the authorities engaged in more than a year of delay and finger pointing now the solons in the forbidden city seem at last to have awakened to their economy s needs they have taken steps to provide that liquidity 16 measures in fact that will reliquefy real estate developers had beijing acted sooner policy would have had an easier time righting the financial ship having wasted all this time the rescue must now deal not only with the problems of developers but also with the damage done in the interim to individual wealth and confidence as well as the ill effects of china s draconian covid lockdowns as well the authorities aim with their latest measures to halt or at least slow the collapse of this critical sector of china s economy which due to past enthusiastic emphasis by beijing s central planners had grown to about 30 percent of the economy had beijing made these or similar moves back in august 2021 when evergrande first indicated that it was cash short a special flow of liquidity might well have done all that was necessary it would have allowed evergrande to complete the housing units for which it had contracted and for which it had taken buyers money it would have staved off the failures of other developers that in the past year have greatly compounded problems in the real estate sector now matters are more complex delays allowed problems to fester destroying confidence and accordingly deepening the sector s and the economy s problems data makes painfully clear the damage done to this growing and important sector during the time since beijing s initial failure to act china s national bureau of statistics reports that investment in real estate development after growing 7 3 percent in 2021 mostly earlier in the year before evergrande announced has fallen 8 8 percent so far this year sales of commercial floor space had declined 22 3 percent after growth of 7 3 percent in 2021 and revenues from the sale of commercial space has fallen 26 1 percent so far this year after growth of 11 8 percent in 2021 home prices have dropped at the fastest rate in years and residential property sales have declined for 15 straight months today s complexities lodge less with developers than with buyers real estate firms are delighted to find new resources to meet their obligations and relieve at least some of the burden of their bankruptcies but now because of past inaction the economy faces a general loss of confidence that at the very least has prompted buyers to shrink back for making a commitment to new home ownership the immediate effect emerged from the losses sustained by people on unfinished housing units in china unlike in the united states people can pre buy homes from developers like evergrande they can procure a mortgage on these pre bought but unbuilt dwellings when evergrande and after it other developers failed they also failed to finish many of these pre bought units leaving thousands of chinese with a mortgage on a property they could not occupy when it became apparent that beijing was doing nothing many of these people desperate refused to pay on their mortgages an act that carried the developers problems into banks and other lenders thousands more saw what was happening and not surprisingly decided to avoid such risks a drop in home process has reinforced the growing conviction that ownership is too risky now even though the new flow of liquidity will enable the developers to complete at least some of those unfinished units buyers once plentiful are no longer so willing china s covid problems though unrelated to the real estate mess have nonetheless compounded these problems the severe lockdowns and quarantines imposed by beijing s zero covid policies have fostered widespread concerns among chinese about future income growth either because they fear more lockdowns or because they are unsure about the economy s prospects generally even after china emerges from covid linked oppressions such anxieties have been exacerbated by the remarkable slowdown in china s growth whatever the specific cause of concerns and it is likely a combination of these they have depressed the kind of optimism that is a necessary part of anyone s decision to buy a new house some who were thinking of trading up from their existing property have rethought that decision others who have saved what could serve as a down payment have developed a greater reluctance to put those funds at risk if the additional liquidity provided by beijing s 16 measures can overcome the reluctance of homebuyers and if beijing can also temper the severity to its zero covid policies there is a chance that matters can begin to recover but for the time being these are big ifs especially because beijing waited so long to act
