new york stocks fell broadly on wall street thursday as worries about a possible recession and rising bond yields put the squeeze back on markets the s p 500 fell 2 1 percent reaching its lowest level since late 2020 the washout erased the index s gains in a big rally the day before that s when forceful moves by the bank of england to get suddenly spiking u k yields under control led to a global burst of relief among investors the dow jones industrial average fell 1 5 percent and the nasdaq composite lost 2 8 percent the russell 2000 index of smaller companies dropped 2 4 percent the major indexes are on pace for a weekly loss to wind up what has been a dismal month for wall street with one day left in september the benchmark s p 500 is down about 8 percent for the month for markets to really turn higher after u s stocks have lost more than 20 percent of their value this year analysts say investors will need to see a break from the high inflation that s swept the world that hasn t happened yet with even more data arriving thursday showing the opposite and that means the federal reserve and other central banks will likely keep pushing interest rates higher to slow their economies in hopes of pushing down inflation by doing that they re also risking recessions if they go too far the economy doesn t look to be softening if you look at employment data said brad mcmillan chief investment officer for commonwealth financial network that undercuts any investor hopes a weakening economy could convince the fed to take it easier on interest rates the selling was widespread thursday with more than 90 percent of stocks in the s p 500 finishing in the red the index fell 78 57 points to 3 640 47 the dow lost 458 13 points to close at 29 225 61 and the nasdaq slid 314 13 points to 10 737 51 the russell 2000 finished down 40 31 points at 1 674 93 stocks fell as treasury yields climbed and raised the pressure on markets the yield on the 10 year treasury rose to 3 77 percent from 3 73 percent late wednesday it had been above 3 85 percent in morning trading the yield on the two year treasury which more closely tracks expectations for fed moves rose more aggressively to 4 20 percent from 4 14 percent a stronger than expected report on the u s jobs market bolstered expectations for the fed to keep raising rates and hold them at high levels for a while potentially through 2023 fewer workers filed for unemployment benefits last week than economists expected that s good news for workers in general and an indication layoffs aren t widespread despite worries about the economy but it also keeps upward pressure on inflation which gives the fed more reason to keep rates high the central bank s benchmark overnight interest rate has already zoomed to a range of 3 percent to 3 25 percent up from basically zero as recently as march that s its highest level since 2008 and the wide expectations is for the fed to hike it by at least another full percentage point by early 2023 rate increases have a notoriously long lag time before they hit the broad economy but they re already causing big pain for the housing industry where the average rate on a 30 year fixed mortgage has more than doubled over the last 12 months to 6 70 percent higher interest rates not only invite the possibility of a recession they also push down on prices for stocks and other investments regardless of what the economy s doing investments seen as the most expensive or the riskiest tend to take the hardest hits economic reports elsewhere around the world also firmed expectations for higher rates coming in the future in germany for example a reading on inflation came in hotter than expected in the uk meanwhile prime minister liz truss defended her plan to cut taxes even though critics said it would worsen inflation the plan had sent uk bond yields spiking forcing the bank of england on wednesday to pledge to buy however many uk government bonds are needed to lower yields the bond buying announcement came just before the central bank had planned to do the opposite and sell some of the bonds it had purchased earlier to support the economy even beyond the worries about central banks and rates many other concerns continue to hang over markets a supercharged u s dollar has climbed so much so quickly against other currencies that investors worry something could break somewhere in global markets europe s already struggling economy looks to be facing more pressure from high energy prices amid accusations that someone deliberately damaged pipelines delivering gas from russia to germany and in the united states investors are concerned that one of the main levers setting stock prices may be under threat as corporate profits bend under higher interest rates a slowing economy and high inflation carmax the auto seller plunged 24 6 percent for the largest loss in the s p 500 after it reported weaker profit than expected for the three months through august it said the used auto market is tough generally as higher interest rates make getting auto loans more expensive by damian j troise stan choe and alex veiga

hurricane ian takes out fertilizer production for north america power grid down widespread supply chain damage the devastation of hurricane ian has implications far beyond florida itself one of the largest fertilizer companies in the world mosaic is located right in the devastation path of ian which lingered for over 12 hours in central florida dropping actual feet of rain in some areas causing widespread flooding and infrastructure damage that combined with the sustained hurricane force winds ripped some communities to shreds and left almost no structure standing in certain areas the mosaic company in central florida provides 50 of the granulated phosphate fertilizer used by north american farmers according to its online data sheet pdf the company also provides 12 of the global supply for granulated phosphate fertilizer this means hurricane ian just made the global fertilizer shortage far worse than what it was already even after the fertilizer shortages caused by natural gas shutdowns in europe and the recent sabotage explosion of the nord stream pipelines the upshot of all this expect even more food scarcity and price inflation in 2023 and beyond with high prices and crop scarcity to persist for many years to come we hope that mosaic which employs 3 000 full time workers and 3 000 additional contractors can get back on its feet as soon as possible and resume deliveries of phosphate fertilizer florida s power grid and cell towers remain down and many will stay down for weeks to come also today i interviewed steve of strategic response partners a private company that s hired by hospitals hotels retirement centers and hotels to help handle emergencies and disasters like hurricanes and more the website of his company is srp24 com if you want to see what they do the full interview will be posted friday late morning but he told me that many people sustained serious bodily injuries from flying shrapnel propelled by extremely high winds other people fell on slippery tile and suffered broken bones or fractures some people got injured in the evacuations and the number of dead that will ultimately be found will likely shock most people steve told me that the us coast guard is right now stockpiling body bags far beyond the numbers being shown on the news he implied that first responders are anticipating large numbers of dead from the flooding and the injuries he described proof of life teams that are searching homes retirement community buildings and other structures for evidence of whether individuals are dead or alive so that family members employers etc can be notified either way i also spoke with tina from the satellite phone store sat123 c0m a brighteon sponsor whose offices are located in sarasota florida they ve been handing out satellite phones and bivy sticks two way satellite messaging devices to first responders and law enforcement up and down florida s west coast and central counties with the power grid down and cell towers not working for a large portion of the state satellite devices are the only means of reliable comms they still have bivy sticks available for purchase by the way which allow for satellite based two way text messaging communications they have 1 000 satellite phones inbound by the end of october and are taking pre orders for those phones which will sell out immediately sat phones haven t been available all year due to the ukraine war see my recent interview with a texas border operator who uses bivy sticks to communicate with interdiction teams that are helping to halt the flow of illegal weapons drugs and human subjects across the open border the global supply chain collapse will make rebuilding extremely challenging some areas of florida look like an atomic bomb got dropped tina told me in an interview today total devastation with barely anything left standing storm surges exceeded 20 feet of height in some areas and high winds turned signage roofs and other structures into projectile missiles shrapnel that shredded everything in sight the rebuilding of florida however will be an extremely difficult endeavor given the fragile state of the supply chain for construction materials including electrical supplies plumbing parts roofing material lumber tools generators and more almost regardless of how much money is thrown at this situation the lack of availability for these supplies and the lack of labor means that florida will require not just months but years to return to pre ian status insurance companies are likely to squabble over payouts too resulting in extremely frustrating delays in reimbursement for damage causing some people to decide to move and rebuild in another state altogether the good news is that floridians are resilient determined people and they are led by an extraordinary governor desantis who is showing tremendous leadership in deploying state resources to help save lives and get people back on their feet florida isn t a blue state run by clueless democrats who have no idea how supply chains work it s a red state led by a governor who is likely going to see his own approval ratings skyrocket as he demonstrates the kind of post storm leadership that makes him look more and more presidential but it s the people of florida who really deserve the credit for being so resilient and capable even as they suffered tremendous destruction due to a disaster there s a much bigger storm coming prepare accordingly hurricane ian should be a reminder to us all that devastating events can strike at any moment with little warning and they can escalate far beyond our expectations in terms of damage disruptions and deaths while those in florida deserve our prayers and assistance the rest of us should look upon this as a reminder that the time for all of us to get prepared is now food scarcity is now a certainty for 2023 and years beyond fuel prices are on the rise and the strategic petroleum reserve is nearly drained gee thanks biden the world s fertilizer supply is on the brink of collapse and agricultural production has plummeted globally geoengineering weather weapons has unleashed droughts floods and possibly even hurricanes devastating the food supply and thrusting the western half of the united states into a severe water shortage and then someone blew up the nord stream 1 and 2 pipelines just to punish we the people a little bit more or technically the people of europe a financial storm is already under way as the ponzi stock market unravels and the fake fiat currency systems of the world teeter on the verge of collapse finally the insane deranged leaders of the illegitimate biden regime are trying to push the world into nuclear armageddon just so they don t have to go through with the mid term elections and lose control of the us house of representatives and possibly even the senate hurricane ian was devastating and yet it was only a small taste of bigger storms yet to come prepare

insurers property and casualty insurers operating in florida say they are just beginning the massive effort of assessing damage left by ian s assault through southwestern and central florida on wednesday and thursday accurate damage estimates might not be available for days after teams of adjusters fan out and assign dollar amounts to the wreckage they inspect early estimates by catastrophe risk modelers project that ian s insured losses in florida excluding claims to the national flood insurance program will be in the 30 billion to 50 billion range according to reinsurance news and an investor focused website artemis bm fitch ratings estimated insured losses between 25 billion and 40 billion meanwhile stock prices for publicly traded insurers and reinsurers exposed to losses in florida were stable on thursday suggesting the investment community believes that the cost of rebuilding what ian damaged won t break the industry insurance stocks were surprisingly calm on thursday said a post on the investor oriented website seeking alpha a morgan stanley analyst interviewed by the site said he expects losses would be manageable for larger publicly traded insurers such as progressive bekshire hathaway and fort lauderdale based universal property casualty insurance florida s office of insurance regulation will begin collecting daily claims and loss totals from all insurers beginning friday after hurricanes the office typically posts running tallies on its website state farm florida one of the state s three largest insurers received 4 300 claims by 3 30 p m thursday mostly from lee charlotte orange collier and polk counties spokeswoman heather paul said the company provides insurance for both property and vehicles about 1 800 of the claims were vehicle related paul said sixty five percent of those claims are for vehicles that are undriveable and 62 are damaged or undriveable because of flood or rising water state owned citizens property insurance corp the largest insurer in the state with more than 1 million policies estimates it will receive about 225 000 claims from policyholders spokesman michael peltier said thursday of those the company expects between 75 000 and 125 000 will be for damage below policyholders deductibles citizens expects to pay out between 1 9 billion and 3 7 billion for 100 000 to 150 000 claims with adjusted loss values that exceed policyholders deductibles if those estimates hold citizens won t need to impose surcharges on its policyholders or emergency assessments on private market policyholders to meet its claims paying obligations between reserves and reinsurance coverage citizens has 13 5 billion in claims paying ability citizens has contracted with private vendors for 1 000 vendors and has commitments from nearly 700 peltier said security first insurance is also training adjusters secured from third party vendors and plans to deploy them when search and rescue missions wind down and evacuees are allowed to return to their homes locke burt the company s chairman and ceo said thursday with its policies concentrated along the interstate 4 corridor that saw much of ian s wrath security first has so far received 1 000 claims the company which insures 169 000 homes statewide estimated on tuesday that it would get 20 000 claims and pay out 200 million to 250 million and is sticking with that estimate burt said kevin mitchell president of property and casualty insurer typtap said claims projections and financial impacts can wait considering that ian made landfall yesterday our no 1 priority is helping our policyholders who have sustained damage mitchell said by email both homeowners choice and typtap are standing by ready to help those policyholders in need

areas wednesday and continued to survey those areas thursday he said we anticipate that by the company will open a claims location in the area where policyholders can seek assistance in addition to the company s field adjusting efforts that are taking place in areas that are accessible he said burt said that security first expects to tap into the 2 billion reinsurance to assist policyholders reinsurance layer created by the state legislature in may to help smaller companies that were struggling to buy reinsurance in the private market the 2 billion supplemental reinsurance layer is backed by the state s general fund many will also likely need to seek reimbursement from the florida hurricane catastrophe fund a state owned reinsurance program with 16 1 billion in claims paying ability while the property insurance industry sees ian s damage as manageable that s because so much of ian s damage was caused by floodwaters driven by storm surge property insurance only covers water damage from hurricanes when heavy rains drive the water into a building water that enters a building from below such as a storm surge or an overflowing lake or river is only covered by flood insurance most

have flood insurance gov ron desantis said in a news conference on thursday that most insurance claims in hard hit lee county will be flood claims but only 13 of florida homeowners have flood insurance according to the insurance information institute that could leave victims in the unfortunate position of self funding their repairs as fema emergency grants would only cover a small portion

register for free to read more of the latest local news it s easy and will only take a moment liz truss and kwasi kwarteng will meet with the head of the office of budget responsibility on friday in the latest effort by the pair to reassure markets and voters that the economic turmoil of recent days is under control treasury and downing street sources hit back at suggestions it was an emergency meeting but it comes after days of chaos in the financial markets and fears of rocketing mortgage bills sparked by the chancellor s mini budget last week in a nonetheless unusual move for a prime minister ms truss will join mr kwarteng in meeting richard hughes the head of the independent spending watchdog pushed to the fore amid the political and economic fallout from friday s mini budget news of the meeting was welcomed by tory mps who expressed hope that it could mark the start of process to win back the confidence of the financial markets chair of the treasury select committee mel stride one of the growing caucus of conservatives with concerns about the government s plans urged the meeting to be a reset moment echoing earlier calls from fellow tory mps for a plan b from the government mr stride was also among those calling on mr kwarteng to bring forward his planned statement setting out how he intends to get the public finances back on track after the obr said it could produce a preliminary set of forecasts by october 7 the chancellor is currently scheduled to deliver his medium term fiscal plan explaining how he would get debt falling as a percentage of gdp alongside the updated obr forecasts on november 23 prime minister liz truss toby melville pa on bbc newsnight veteran tory mp sir geoffrey clifton brown joined those calls telling the programme that he feared further turmoil in the markets if the date of the statement is not changed it comes as a yougov poll for the times showed labour opening up a massive 33 point lead over the conservatives raising further questions about ms truss leadership only a few weeks into the job sir charles walker one tory mp commenting on the poll admitted that his party could be wiped out if an election was called tomorrow former cabinet minister julian smith also urged the government to reverse course on cut to the top rate of tax saying it must take responsibility for the reaction to friday s mini budget despite the growing unease both the prime minister and chancellor have said they are still committed to the economic plan arguing that their 45 billion package of tax cuts is the right plan for the economy and while declining to comment directly on the economic turmoil created by the mini budget ms truss told a round of bbc local radio interviews that her administration had to take urgent action to kick start the economy and protect consumers from rising energy costs during a visit to an engine plant in darlington mr kwarteng said the package he announced in the commons on friday was absolutely essential if the economy was to generate the revenues needed to fund public services pa graphics fresh details also emerged on thursday about the lack of an independent obr forecast to go along with the fiscal event last week with the obr revealing that it had prepared a draft forecast for the new chancellor on his first day in office the lack of such a forecast had been one of the issues that reportedly troubled the city after the chancellor s announcement in a letter to the scottish national party s westminster leader ian blackford and the party s shadow chancellor alison thewliss mr hughes confirmed that the body sent a draft economic and fiscal forecast to the new chancellor on september 6 his first day in office he wrote we offered at the time to update that forecast to take account of subsequent data and to reflect the economic and fiscal impact of any policies the government announced in time for it to be published alongside the fiscal event he said that the obr was not commissioned to produce an updated forecast but confirmed that it would have been in a position to do so to a standard that satisfied the legal requirements of the charter for budget responsibility mr blackford called the details contained in the letter utterly damning chancellor kwasi kwarteng arrives at darlington station owen humphreys pa the chancellor had on thursday brushed off suggestions his mini budget had been a major economic disaster while the prime minister told bbc radio leeds we had to take urgent action to get our economy growing get britain moving and also deal with inflation of course that means taking controversial and difficult decisions but i am prepared to do that the comments came after the bank launched an emergency government bond buying programme on wednesday to prevent borrowing costs from spiralling out of control and stave off a material risk to uk financial stability it bought up to 65 billion worth of government bonds known as gilts at an urgent pace after fears over the government s tax cutting plans sent the pound tumbling and sparked a sell off in the gilts market which left some uk pension funds teetering on the brink of collapse on thursday the pound regained some ground rising to above 1 1 dollars for the first time since last friday however the ftse 100 dropped around 2 to 6 864 its lowest point since march this year amid a global sell off while yields on the uk s 10 year gilts were up to 4 14 speaking in northern ireland the bank s chief economist huw pill underlined warnings that they would have to sharply raise interest rates noting that there was undoubtedly a uk specific component to recent market movements his comments contrasted with ms truss who in her interviews blamed vladimir putin s war in ukraine for pushing up global energy prices for labour shadow chancellor rachel reeves called on ms truss and mr kwarteng to reverse their kamikaze budget earlier trade unions called for a cast iron guarantee that there would be no more cuts to public spending after treasury chief secretary chris philp confirmed whitehall departments had been instructed to carry out an efficiency and prioritisation exercise in an effort to find savings speaking to broadcasters mr kwarteng said that despite the pressures on the public finances the government would maintain the state pension triple lock but refused to commit to uprating benefits in line with inflation it s premature for me to come to a decision on that but we are absolutely focused on making sure that the most vulnerable in our society are protected through what could be a challenge he said it comes amid some speculation that the government could move to the uprating of benefits by earnings instead of inflation next year in a bid to save billions of pounds ms truss can still count on some support for the measures especially among the free marketeer wing of her party writing in the telegraph lord frost dismissed those who attach importance to symbols like the value of sterling while tory mp daniel kawczynski praised the radical approach taken by the pm to stave off a recession meanwhile kemi badenoch the international trade secretary faced awkward questions during her visit to new york as she sought to promote uk businesses to us investors appearing on bloomberg tv she insisted that those she had met still had confidence in the uk now is actually the time to invest in the uk she said

cheaper than the previous one and often attracting hordes of venture funding this year alone has seen the formation of networks including sui and aptos alongside ethereum based scaling networks such as arbitrum and optimism iota which enjoys its own cult following much like other networks said shimmer s unveiling followed nearly two years of testing a product that will eventually be used to test

includes full ethereum virtual machine evm compatibility evm broadly refers to an extensive database that holds all ethereum s accounts and balances atop which developers can create services and deploy decentralized applications dapps support for a multi chain ecosystem eventually the shimmerevm will allow developers from other evm compliant networks to access the shimmer network using other

generated from users staking iota some 181 million smr were voted on by the community to the shimmer community treasury dao a community governed entity that would independently fund community projects

european union s banking watchdog said on thursday the european banking authority was asked by the bloc s executive european commission for its views on current levels of volatility and cash stumped up by energy firms in derivatives markets in case contracts turn sour and how the banking sector could help the eba view is that the prudential framework is built for normal as well as more

minor child donoghue v smith 2022 u s dist lexis 76071 this is a shareholder derivative action in which shareholders of sinclair broadcast corporation sinclair seek disgorgement of approximately 5 5 million in alleged short swing profits realized by david d smith a corporate insider officer director and beneficial owner of more than 10 of the common stock of sinclair from the acquisition and subsequent sale of shares acquired by smith from certain grats that he had established for the benefit of his children smith used his power of substitution under the grats to reacquire the sinclair shares and within six months sold the shares on the open market triggering liability under section 16 b of the securities exchange act of 1934 the exchange act section 16 b imposes strict liability on corporate insiders whose purchases and sales of securities result in short swing profits and compels statutory insiders to disgorge profits earned on any purchase or sale made within six months of each other no showing of actual misuse of inside information or unlawful intent is necessary to state a claim under the statute which is designed to prevent the unfair use of information which may have been obtained by reason of the insider s relationship to the issuer smith moves to dismiss plaintiffs claims based on two main arguments 1 under applicable regulations his acquisitions of stock from the grats were exempt from section 16 b and 2 his acquisitions of stock do not constitute purchases within the meaning of section 16 b a smith s acquisitions of stock from the grats are exempt under sec rule 16a 13 smith argues that his acquisitions of stock from the grats are exempt from section 16 b under sec rule 16a 13 which exempts in relevant part transactions that effect only a change in the form of beneficial ownership without changing a person s pecuniary interest in the subject equity securities which typically includes changes from indirect to direct ownership or vice versa the court denies smith s argument that his acquisitions of sinclair stock merely changed the form of his beneficial ownership from indirect to direct because he failed to establish that he maintained beneficial ownership after the shares were transferred to the grats smith fails to prove that he had investment control over the securities held by the trusts in order to maintain the relevant indirect pecuniary interest necessary to be considered a beneficial owner of securities held by a trust the grats explicitly give the trustees not the settlor the authority to sell or otherwise dispose of any or all property comprising the trust estate and to otherwise manage sell convey or dispose of any property freely at any time the grats further provide that the settlor can in no event serve as trustee thus it is the trustees who have investment control and not smith the court concludes that smith fails to demonstrate that the rule 16a 13 exemption applies to the transactions at issue here smith further argues that in the statements of changes in beneficial ownership of securities the forms 4 that he filed with the sec he admitted in these filings that he remained the beneficial owner of the sinclair stocks after it was contributed to the grats however the court may not rely on smith s statements in the forms 4 for their truth and can only examine the documents to determine what the documents stated not to prove the truth of their contents sec rule 16a 1 defines beneficial owner as any person who directly or indirectly has or shares a direct or indirect pecuniary interest in the equity securities pecuniary interest is defined as the opportunity directly or indirectly to profit or share in any profit derived from a transaction in the subject securities an indirect pecuniary interest includes a person s interest in securities held by a trust sec rule 16a 8 b provides that with respect to settlors if the settlor does not exercise or share investment control over the issuer s securities held by the trust the trust holdings and transactions shall be attributed to the trust instead of the settlor b smith s acquisitions of stock from the grats were not purchases under the exchange act purchases includes any contract to buy purchase or otherwise acquire securities which covers many transactions not ordinarily deemed a sale or purchase the court holds that smith s alleged exchanges of property of an equivalent value for the shares held by the trust falls within the statutory definition of purchase given that the value of the property substituted by smith matched the range of prices at which the sinclair class a common stock traded on the open market the transactions each involved an agreement to exchange property equal to the current market value of the securities for those securities the court concludes that smith s acquisitions of stock from the grats were purchases for purposes of section 16 b finally smith argues that treating an insider s re acquisition of shares from a grat is highly unlikely to serve the purpose of section 16 because the insider makes all of the investment decisions for the grat and therefore the insider enjoys no informational advantage over the grat the court is not convinced stating that there is nothing in the pleadings to support the assertion that smith made all of the investment decisions for the grats to the contrary it is the trustees who have the authority to exercise investment control over the shares and as such there is no basis to conclude that smith and the grats were equally informed parties with respect to the acquisitions on the dates alleged in the complaint and the court therefore denies smith s motion to dismiss yost v carroll dc il 130 aftr 2d 2022 5086 this case involves plaintiff mr yost s yost attempt to collect on two promissory notes the notes totaling 8 261 333 79 plus interest costs and attorneys fees that were signed by his daughter anne and her then husband the defendant mr carroll carroll which yost alleged were signed in connection with loans from yost totaling approximately 7 000 000 for the purchase of homes by the married couple no payments were made on either note and until recently none were due in june 2020 after anne and carroll began divorce proceedings yost demanded payment of over 8 000 000 from carroll on the notes which included claimed interest yost did not demand payment from his daughter though she was a co signer on the notes in carroll s affirmative defenses he argued that the large transfers of money purporting to be promissory notes were in fact gifts and that yost had orchestrated a scheme to evade the payment of gift taxes to the united states on large transfers of money to his daughter and her then husband mr carroll the amended pleading suggests that yost expressed the view that the notes were a necessary tool to enable him to make gifts that appear to be loans so that gift taxes would not have to be paid and to serve as a device to keep track of the money given to his daughters the amended pleading states that yost promised never to enforce the notes and they would be forgiven at his death in considering yost s motion to dismiss the amended pleading the court recognizes the common law defense of in pari delicto that is a plaintiff is precluded from prevailing in a suit against a defendant when they share equal or mutual fault in the very transaction at issue carroll alleged that yost expressly stated that the notes were essential to avoiding tax liability and were never intended by either party to be promissory notes at all thus by executing the notes carroll and anne became part of the alleged scheme and have implicated the doctrine of in pari delicto carroll also argued that because yost was not only an eager participant in the tax evasion scheme he devised it he should not benefit from it the central question in this case rests on whether yost made the statements and promises that are alleged in the amended pleading not on the legal accuracy of his conclusion that the notes were necessary to avoid gift taxes the court concludes that carroll s amended pleading stated a viable defense or claim and therefore denies the motion to dismiss in re marriage of rene simon cruz and rena dillon cruz cal sup ct 2022 i background h and w were married from 1992 until 2019 they have two adult children w inherited mineral rights from her mother in 2012 w s brother advised her to move the mineral rights into trusts before the possible reduction of the gift tax exemption amount on january 1 2013 first h and w created an llc called cruz mineral investments llc cmi which was community property because it was formed during marriage h and w then signed a transmutation agreement transmuting a portion of cmi from community property to each of their separate property next w deeded the mineral rights to cmi and then h and w executed a second transmutation agreement confirming that the cmi membership interests were in fact separate property h transferred a portion of his separate property cmi membership interests 39 of the interests in cmi to the 2012 rene delaware trust a trust for the benefit of w and the children w transferred a portion of her separate property cmi membership interests 39 of the interests in cmi to the 2012 rena delaware trust a trust for the sole benefit of the children in 2014 h and w engaged a second estate planning attorney to engage in additional estate tax planning at the attorney s recommendation w settled the 2014 rena delaware trust for the benefit of h and the children gifted her remaining 11 of cmi to the new trust and then the 2012 rena delaware trust sold its interests in cmi to the new trust h assigned his remaining 11 of cmi to the 2012 rene delaware trust at this point a slat for h and children owned 50 of cmi and a slat for the benefit of w and children owned the other 50 w claimed to have basically no knowledge of any of the estate planning transactions that she was involved in though she signed the documents in front of notaries and was present for all meetings and phone calls w claims that h tricked her into giving up her mineral rights ii court s analysis the first question was whether the mineral rights were part of the marital estate at the time of the trial answer no because of the transactions described above the llc interests holding the mineral rights had been transferred to irrevocable trusts and were no longer part of the marital estate the second question was whether the transmutation agreements were valid answer yes the court notes that the transmutation agreements acknowledge possible conflicts of interest and each spouse s right to independent counsel and describe the assets being transmuted with sufficient particularity finally the court asked whether h exerted undue influence on w in order to trick her into transmuting the mineral rights answer no there s a rebuttable presumption of undue influence for transactions between spouses when such undue influence is alleged the court looked first at whether w was disadvantaged by the estate planning transactions the court noted that neither h nor w was very familiar with estate planning but w was more familiar because she had acted as trustee of trusts for the benefit of her parents and herself prior to 2012 the court looked at whether w was under any sort of physical or mental disability or weakness she was not the court asked whether there was unequal bargaining power between h and w the court found that if anything it was unequal in favor of w who came from a wealthy family the court found w s testimony to be completely unreliable
in a world where uncertainty lurks around every corner neighborhood spots offer reliable comfort and peace it s something we may all take for granted from time to time still local business owners have the power to host safe healthy and welcoming spaces for their fellow community members to embrace diversity and unity some may even consider them to be heroes when we think of the typical super hero we might immediately think of iron man black widow black panther or spider man but there are many heroes inspired by these marvel characters right outside our doorsteps playing a role in our day to day lives in ways we may not even fully recognize at first highsnobiety these sort of courageous and compassionate individuals inspired us to team up with marvel and take a closer look at the shops around our city and give them a well deserved spotlight taking to the streets of nyc we embarked on a journey to uncover the city s unsung heroes where we met the individuals behind brooklyn s aunts et uncles and the lower east side s regina s grocery and the flower shop what makes the marvel brand so powerful is that it is global diverse and can be celebrated through our everyday choices in life says paul gitter svp of marvel consumer products those choices start with how a marvel fan spends time in their neighborhoods in their homes at work and with family and friends the story we re telling with highsnobiety spotlights new york city and marvel fans who like all of our heroes have come into their power they are inspired by marvel and use that passion for the brand to drive their local community s culture forward our first stop was in the little caribbean area of central brooklyn where we met nicole and michael nicholas owners of the vegan cafe aunts et uncles aunts et uncles was opened back in 2020 to bring love and connection to their local neighborhood unlike many other plant based eateries the idea of having an exclusively vegan cafe was somewhat of an afterthought to nicole and michael the duo explains we wanted to be intentional with every detail of the space after taking stock of how many personal friends family and community members we lost to cancer diabetes and high blood pressure along with what the eating options were in our community we decided to take the community on the journey with us it s a valiant effort to say the least to dedicate your pursuit to the health and consideration of others but it s these characteristics that make spaces like aunts et uncles stand apart from the rest and connect with the same higher calling that marvel heroes experience at the start of their story highsnobiety highsnobiety leaning into their sense of heroism nicole and michael note as a super fan family of marvel we don t only consume the marvel brand we exude it we are aware of the natural and supernatural powers we possess we choose to use them for the greater good as marvel promotes so for a brand of marvel s stature to align themselves with us is a key indicator we are doing the right things and also an inspiration to keep going by investing in wellbeing aunts et uncles has initiated an identity through the act of caring for others a radical stance for any modern day business the cafe was created to be an extension of our home says nicole so many good times connected through laughter and a meal that exact homey feeling of safety and familiarity perfectly embodies aunts et uncles and gives local the local community a place to gather connect and eat well nicole adds out of all of the beautiful things our customers say to us when we get the chance to meet them the one that stands out the most is this place is necessary following our morning in brooklyn we journeyed to manhattan s lower east side where we stopped at regina s grocery a sandwich shop that has been feeding its residents and visiting guests for years upon walking through its doors you can pick up on the shop s core values of family and passion almost immediately framed photos of generations of family members cover the shop s walls and the smell of fresh bread and mozzarella creates a sense of authenticity that regina s grocery has become renowned for when we asked owner roman grandinetti what he believes the shop stands for he said nostalgia family and the neighborhood not many places have the feeling of a true neighborhood spot anymore and food to me brought that feeling altogether highsnobiety highsnobiety highsnobiety after experiencing the history and love that goes into regina s grocery it may be difficult to imagine grandinetti doing anything else however the owner explains to us that his journey to creating a successful business was not always linear and can connect his story to the inevitable hardships that every hero must overcome a lot of the marvel characters carry an underdog story and i relate to that he explains starting a deli and getting into food was not the story i wrote for myself but it was one i loved i believed in it and used all of my instinct to make it into something most importantly i never gave up much like that of a true marvel character as an x men fan grandinetti relates his ability to bounce back from challenges he s faced while owning regina s to the regenerative powers of wolverine wolverine s fast physical healing powers have always been a reminder that after life gets you down you get back up and try again finding the spirit to stay dedicated in the face of confusing or difficult times is what has separated regina s grocery from hundreds of other sandwich shops around nyc throughout the years finding the correct words of wisdom grandinetti states here s some inspiration i never used a slicer a day in my life before the first day i opened the shop the hardest part of anything or business is having the courage to start so i d say find something you love and do it we capped off our day at les bar and eatery the flower shop where we were greeted by co owners dylan hales and ronnie flynn the flower shop has been a lower manhattan staple hangout spot for five years inspired by australian and english styled local pubs and watering holes the space radiates a classic 1970s americana style but of course the flower shop is so much more than its stylish aesthetic highsnobiety my interest in producing an environment that allows old and new friends to merge led me into this industry in my early 20s 16 years later i am more passionate about this ideal than ever says hales led by the drive to bring people together and celebrate one another the flower shop has proved to be a welcoming hub for all who enter when asked about the most rewarding aspect of their business flynn adds the fact that we have brought so many different people together over the years from far and wide very often strangers leave the flower shop as best friends and several have even ended up married much like the crescendo to any classic hero story the flower shop very much seems to be in its master of powers era where they experience a profound clarity after having moved through hardships in a post covid world hales explains the best way to push through any of life s difficulties is with a positive attitude even when it doesn t feel accessible he explains in the 2012 avengers movie hulk says i m always angry i don t feel that way personally but i think that statement resonates with a lot of people as it represents an internal battle to fight off negative thoughts feelings and actions in difficult moments highsnobiety highsnobiety highsnobiety when discussing the fated next steps for the flower shop we took a moment to appreciate the success of the establishment and its ability to create space for people from all sorts of backgrounds and personal experiences that is what the flower shop is all about flynn adds we want it to be everyone s clubhouse no matter your superpower as the day drew to a close in nyc there was a lingering sense

the right to privacy is enshrined in many legal traditions around the world in the united states it s protected by the fourth amendment in the european union it falls under article 8 of the european convention for human rights while definitions differ between jurisdictions most of us have a right to a reasonable expectation of privacy for our correspondence in our homes and about our persons in the 1970s businesses families and individuals started generating data like never before and the degree to which it fell under existing privacy mandates was increasingly unclear this proliferation of data was first acknowledged as a problem in the late 70s and picked up pace in the decade that followed in response the eu introduced its data protection directive in 1995 guaranteeing certain fundamental rights around the processing of personal data the crucial thing to understand in this context is that an eu directive leaves space for member states to determine how it will be incorporated into national laws it is a recommendation not a regulation that would legally require members to enforce laws from a set date from 1995 the regulation of privacy in the eu trod a well worn path starting as a directive it eventually developed into the general data protection regulation gdpr which became a lawful requirement in 2018 related biden s cryptocurrency framework is a step in the right direction gdpr became the benchmark for privacy law and influenced regulation in other jurisdictions including the united states it s a phenomenon anu bradford coined the brussels effect where eu law sets the global regulatory standard we ve seen it happen in a number of fields besides data privacy such as environmental law and online hate speech which often enter the u s via a similar mechanism the california effect whereby california sets a strict standard that is later widely adopted in the united states and now there s another industry poised to follow this well trodden path from eu directive to eu regulation to global regulatory standard the case of tornado cash which saw a protocol designed to mask financial transactions and increase privacy shut down by regulators because of its use by bad actors is an example of why regulation is so vital to decentralized finance defi infrastructure must be built along regulatory lines like data in the 1980s the proliferation of digital securities and the wider defi space is inevitable regulation will be essential to supporting innovators promoting innovation and protecting investors not to mention the widescale adoption of digital securities trading globally in the u s digital securities fall into a regulatory gray space with neither the securities and exchange commission nor the commodities future trading commission willing to put their heads above the parapet and claim responsibility for them in california the regulation of digital assets is an ongoing conversation and the senate is expected to push for an amendment to california s financial code to include digital assets the digital financial asset law if passed it would be enforceable beginning in 2025 by contrast eu regulators have been quicker to get to grips with defi the german regulator in particular the federal financial supervisory authority or bafin has gone to great lengths to encourage innovation and offers a regulatory blueprint for defi elsewhere a 2020 amendment to the german banking act put crypto assets on parity with traditional securities related biden s anemic crypto framework offered nothing new in brussels regulation is also picking up pace the eu s markets in crypto assets mica comes into force in the fourth quarter of this year and will kick off an 18 month transition period for member states meanwhile the newly published european financial stability and integration review 2022 showed a laudable understanding of the sector it advocated for a rethink of the current regulatory approach centering regulation on activity rather than an entity it s still early when it comes to defi however digital securities regulation in the eu could well follow a similar path to the one that led to gdpr brussels this year issued an opinion on activity based regulation which we ultimately might see incorporated into its markets in financial institutes directive a directive remember is a guiding recommendation for member states from there it could become regulation as part of micar with a real world example of defi regulation to lean on and decentralized finance becoming the technology layer where ultimately the entire financial market will be moving other regulators will follow indeed jurisdictions like israel have made a habit of it the question is whether the u s will be most influenced by the brussels effect or the california effect philipp pieper is the co founder of swarm a regulated defi platform in germany this article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not

at up ac za sheryl l hendriks and colleagues describe the global risks and vulnerabilities associated with health food security and nutrition september 2021 saw the united nations food systems summit unfss take place in new york it focused on the three cs that are driving disruption to food systems and threatening recent progress in mitigating hunger malnutrition and undernutrition global environmental climate change covid 19 disease and conflict summit delegates from 183 countries agreed that business as usual would not lead to the change necessary to achieve the sustainable development goals summit participants called for urgent action at scale the three cs interact on five mediators five fs upon which food systems depend the geopolitics of our global food fertilizer finance fodder and fuel systems fig 1 our global food supply system is fragile and vulnerable to the impacts of each driver or mediator however all can interact to amplify the downstream effects on people their health and diets for example decreased food availability has financial impacts and vice versa in a vicious feedback loop undernutrition affects the ability to produce food and lack of food availability can lead to conflict and vice versa while environmental climate change can cause both fig 1 the three cs and five fs of concern environmental climate change food security and nutrition environmental climate change threatens food security and nutrition1 through interconnected impacts on soil crop growth animal survival and labor productivity soil is affected by sea levels rising resulting in the loss of coastal agricultural land and saltwater ingress 2 soil volume is affected by desiccation leading to loss with tilling and strong winds while floods cause erosion 2 climate change also affects microbial populations and their enzymatic activities in soil crop growth is directly affected by environmental climate change direct impacts come from sustained changes in temperature increased crop respiration and evapotranspiration and water availability 3 agroecological conditions could change crop suitability in different regions some crops have been introduced in places unsuitable for local climates requiring substantial resources especially water for cultivation climate shifts could also affect soil microbial populations and their activities affecting human health 3 environmental climate change can affect the suitability of crops for different regions as well as crop duration the time from planting to harvest 34 affecting diets climate and environment change may alter the balance of national self sufficiency away from domestic supply possibly increasing the need to import more food and potentially creating vulnerability to food shortages direct losses in animal productivity and increased mortality of herds may occur owing to environmental climate change which would affect livelihoods especially in tropical and mediterranean regions that are expected to experience greater rises in temperature and reductions in availability of water in addition more frequent and severe mega droughts floods fires and heat waves may lead to famine with dire consequences for livelihoods and migration and the need for humanitarian food assistance 25 indirect changes owing to climate change may occur through a shift in weed flora and higher animal and plant diseases pests parasites and vectors for example locust plagues in east africa and bluetongue disease in cattle 36 climate change alters habitats and forces plants animals and humans into contact in a way that would otherwise not occur encouraging spillover events disease outbreaks may lead to greater use of antimicrobial agents and a higher incidence of antimicrobial resistance climate change also affects labor lowering productivity in raised temperatures and in extremes making it impossible to work 7 recent record heatwaves in india highlight the impact of climate change on human health extreme heat events are predicted to increase in occurrence and intensity in the coming decades 1 excessive heat and extended exposure to excessive temperatures especially in areas not accustomed to high temperatures cause excess morbidity and mortality directly from heat illness and aggravation of comorbid conditions from corollary events such as wildfires and air pollution 8 climate change directly affects health through heat stress and dehydration5 and changes in nutritional state as food availability falls it indirectly affects food systems box 1 by increasing vulnerability to diseases such as covid 19 which further impacts labor potential and thus agricultural production and poverty box 1 potential threats from extreme flooding and their impact on food systems torrential rain caused severe flooding and landslides in the south east of south africa during 11 13 april 2022 the event caused 448 deaths displaced more than 40 000 people and destroyed more than 12 000 houses numerous schools healthcare facilities and infrastructure the flooding washed away roads electricity infrastructure and water and wastewater supply lines sewerage plants were flooded what water supplies remained in service were contaminated by waste chemicals and other pollutants washed into water systems the south african national institute for communicable diseases identified five health risks arising from the flooding9 acute events such as drowning and trauma non communicable disease risks resulting from non adherence to medication regimens a lack of access to health services and disruption to medicine supply chains damage or disruption to healthcare infrastructure and systems that affect the treatment of direct health emergencies such as injury as well as other services including care for people with covid 19 mental health problems including the onset of anxiety depression and post traumatic stress disorder for people who have experienced floods increased risks of infections the floods caused disruption across the food system including damage and destruction of food manufacturing storage transportation and markets families access to clean potable water and food sources was severely affected household incomes and livelihoods were stalled restricting access to vital food and nutrition including essential school feeding programs that most children rely on daily return to text finally conflict causes and is caused by food insecurity and both can be exacerbated by climate change climate change also drives conflict by increasing competition around limited natural resources and income opportunities 10 thus it can drive population migration and displacement directly and indirectly increasing poverty and disease conflict and system connectedness food price increases make a healthy diet less affordable and can cause conflict for example in 2010 and early 2011 several disruptions led to price rises drought disrupted grain production in russia ukraine kazakhstan the us and china floods destroyed a million tonnes of grain reserves in pakistan torrential rains affected canada s wheat production and the quality of fodder in australia and northwestern europe in addition frost devastated mexican corn crops in february 2011 11 as a result prices of staples rose steeply triggering food riots worldwide and contributing to if not causing the arab spring of 2011 11 in 2021 conflict or insecurity was a primary cause of acute food insecurity in 24 countries or territories affecting around 139 million people 40 million more than in 2020 10 in 2022 the global crisis initiated by the invasion of ukraine shows the deep connectedness of global food security highlighting structural market issues and the impact of reliance on imports for staple foods fodder for livestock fertilizer and fuel increases in the price of oil and gas for domestic power or heating mean that many people lack money to buy and prepare healthy food the cost of food has also risen through impacts on fertilizer prices ammonia is made from gas fodder and manufacturing refrigeration and shipping almost one third of the globally traded cereal supply and a large proportion of traded oil seeds and fertilizer reserves are held hostage to crippled transport systems closed ports and financial markets blocked by sanctions 12 putting further pressure on food prices such impacts may synergize with those of climate change for example india affected by a record heatwave has banned wheat exports concern surrounds food production in france and china following extreme weather events the confluence of these factors demands careful reflection on the coherence and comprehensiveness of national policies related to climate change emergencies food security health nutrition and trade how covid 19 has exposed nutritional issues as a core vulnerability the covid 19 crisis is unique the pandemic added an additional shock to a world already struggling with a confluence of economic climate and conflict crises we have thus seen disruption of financial markets and global food supply chains as occurred with the global financial and food crises of 2008 and 2011 we also see perturbation of domestic food production systems as occurred with recent ebola outbreaks and major weather events such as cyclones in southern africa and droughts in eastern africa moreover the economic impacts of the covid 19 pandemic have increased the number of people struggling to feed themselves and some have had to reduce their meal sizes or to eat less often as a result the demand for food assistance and the reliance on charity and social support is growing worldwide 13 people who were malnourished whether undernourished or obese were disproportionately affected by covid 19 mortality and by post acute sequelae of covid 19 infection long covid 14 both of which may affect future food production and put strain on health systems meanwhile climate change will lead to further spillover events whereby diseases of animals cross to and spread among human hosts 1516 furthermore diversion of public expenditure into climate or health related emergencies threatens public health protection and acute health services17 and limits investment in climate mitigation environmental climate change and policy considerations to improve global food security in future efforts must be made to curb further environmental change while preparing for changes that are happening this means simultaneously reducing greenhouse gas emissions and increasing the resilience in food systems to protect food security and health 418 collaboration is needed between professionals and policy makers across agriculture climate energy health and political economy if the complexities interlinkages and trade offs in future policy choices are to be understood and solutions identified focus should lie on interactions between the three cs and five fs on policy choices trade offs outcomes and potential unintended consequences consideration of climate change is vital the supply of food fertilizer and fodder must be diversified and selected based on climate resilience and reducing the impact of production processing and transport as drivers of climate change a rapid move from fossil fuels to renewable power generation will help limit climate change and its impact on production while protecting economies from shocks in fossil fuel prices and protecting human health however care must be taken switching from crops for food to crops for biofuel may increase food prices and risk fuel price shocks especially in the event of crop failures related to climate change moreover each policy choice may change practices and patterns in animal rearing and crop production with trade offs for climate and health potentially exacerbating risks and vulnerabilities thought must be given to increasing sustainable local food production and encouraging seasonal consumption this reduces carbon emissions for transport including air miles and refrigeration food processing brings its own carbon cost but can also lower the energy requirements for storage such as refrigeration and related emissions reduction in ruminant meat production and consumption and a move to the consumption of local seasonal produce may mitigate climate change and improve health in high resource settings changes in the process of crop production can also help no till and more advanced mixed crop and crop rotation approaches can reduce soil loss while improving soil health and lowering the need for fertilizer and pesticides governments need to pay attention to ensuring the availability of food stocks to buffer changes in food availability triggered by climate conflict or pandemics after the 2007 8 food price crisis many countries in the global north and the gulf states began investing in agricultural production in the south to diversify supply and support demand across a range of crops employment and out grower contracting could benefit local household food security19 however foreign direct investment in agriculture might shore up food security in the global north while undermining national food security in the south moreover such practices risk raising hidden costs externalities in the food system increasing environmental and health risks 20 covid 19 and climate change expose deep inequalities at the individual social and national levels access to services technology and innovation related to climate or health are affected by disparities and will likely exacerbate inequality care must be taken to protect poorer nations such as those in the global south when food fertilizer and fodder supplies become disrupted in the scramble to find alternative sources of food after the february 2022 invasion of ukraine powerful nations could exploit these inequalities in the richest purchaser wins approach to global procurement and diversification of sites of food and fodder production fertilizer manufacturing and fuel sourcing in future the geopolitics of food production sourcing and supply could put more pressure on the global south potentially having a negative effect on local people s livelihoods and food security key messages global environmental climate change can lead to challenges related to health food security and nutrition environmental climate change interacts with covid 19 and conflict and drives food insecurity and malnutrition every public policy choice has opportunities threats and trade offs that can affect health food security and nutrition

reuters san francisco federal reserve bank president mary daly on thursday said she believes it will take raising interest rates to a 4 5 5 range and holding them there through the end of 2023 to get inflation under control but said she could support doing more if inflation doesn t fall as expected i m quite comfortable with policymaker projections published last week that show the majority see the fed s policy rate rising to 4 4 5 this year and 4 5 5 next year daly told reporters after an event at boise state university it s going to take restrictive policy for a duration of time to get clear and convincing evidence that inflation is getting back to 2 so from my mind that s at least through next year the fed last week delivered a third straight 75 basis point interest rate increase lifting its policy rate target range to 3 3 25 asked if global market turmoil could move her to support pausing rate hikes daly said global financial markets are just one part of the equation i m really looking at have financial conditions tightened more than the funds rate has tightened and more than they were projected to be tight because now people are realizing there s global tightening everywhere and financial markets are really responding if that s the case then you know slowing the pace of increases but still heading for the right terminal rate would be appropriate daly said but if inflation continues to print very high and we get no easing of inflation and only modest easing of labor markets then that s basically an economy that s still got a lot of momentum and inflation is still too high we re going to have to keep moving up because we are going to understand that the terminal rate isn t as close as it would be reporting by ann saphir editing by leslie adler

management statement on going concern this statement is made taking into account the global health crisis and economic fallout caused by the pandemic covid 19 there is instability in our markets and globally that could impact on group activities in ways that are currently unpredictable to account for the unpredictable conditions in forecasting future cash flows in our assessment of going concern management has made certain extraordinary assumptions specifically we have forecasted a materially negative impact on revenue for the years 2023 and 2024 forecasted expenses to remain approximately at the levels they are as on date of publication of our 2022 annual report meaning we are assuming for going concern assessment only that the group has no more flexibility to drive down expenses further assumed that the group will be able to continue to defer junior debt and to negotiate terms for repayment as liquidity becomes available assumed no development nor material construction but do assume some repurposing of existing real estate to accommodate for changes in demand forecasted no extraordinary one time events that may impact positively or negatively on the group s cash flows though such events are possible particularly given the environment assumed a stable regulatory environment in all countries with existing operations and have forecasted receiving no governmental support apart from what has already been received management has reviewed their plan with the directors and has collectively formed a judgment that the group has adequate resources to continue as a going concern for the foreseeable future which management and the directors have defined as being at least the next 12 months from the filing of this 2022 half year report in arriving at this judgment management has prepared the cash flow projections of the group directors have reviewed this information provided by management and have considered the information in relation to the financing uncertainties in the current economic climate the group s existing commitments and the financial resources available to the group specifically directors have considered i there are probably no sources of new financing available to the group ii the group has limited trading exposures to our local suppliers and retail customers iii other risks to which the group is exposed the most significant of which is considered to be regulatory risk iv sources of group income including management fees charged to and income distributed from its various operations v cash generation and debt amortization levels vi fundamental trends of the group s businesses vii ability to re amortize and unsecured lenders and vii level of interest of third parties in the acquisition of certain operating assets and status of genuine progress and probability of closing within the going concern period the directors have also considered certain critical factors that might affect continuing operations as follows special resolution on september 21 2016 the group s shareholders approved a special resolution that among other items authorized the board of directors of the corporate to sell any or all remaining assets of the corporation in such amounts and at such times as determined by the board of directors this resolution facilitates the sale of any one or any combination of assets required to support maintaining of a going concern by the group corporate expense and cash flow corporate expense has decreased materially in recent years but still must accommodate for compliance as a public company liquidity and working capital as of the date of publication of this 2022 half year report the group forecasts operating with low levels of reserves and working capital selling assets will be critical to creating a healthy level of working capital reserves for periods beyond the going concern period which ability to liquidate assets is contingent on market factors that are not within the control of the group considering the above management and directors are satisfied that the consolidated group has adequate resources to continue as a going concern for at least the 12 months following the filing date of this report for these reasons management and directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the consolidated financial statements thunderbird resorts inc consolidated statement of

register for free to read more of the latest local news it s easy and will only take a moment liz truss and kwasi kwarteng will meet with the head of the office of budget responsibility on friday in the latest effort by the pair to reassure markets and voters that the economic turmoil of recent days is under control treasury and downing street sources hit back at suggestions it was an emergency meeting but it comes after days of chaos in the financial markets and fears of rocketing mortgage bills sparked by the chancellor s mini budget last week in a nonetheless unusual move for a prime minister ms truss will join mr kwarteng in meeting richard hughes the head of the independent spending watchdog pushed to the fore amid the political and economic fallout from friday s mini budget news of the meeting was welcomed by tory mps who expressed hope that it could mark the start of process to win back the confidence of the financial markets chair of the treasury select committee mel stride one of the growing caucus of conservatives with concerns about the government s plans urged the meeting to be a reset moment echoing earlier calls from fellow tory mps for a plan b from the government mr stride was also among those calling on mr kwarteng to bring forward his planned statement setting out how he intends to get the public finances back on track after the obr said it could produce a preliminary set of forecasts by october 7 the chancellor is currently scheduled to deliver his medium term fiscal plan explaining how he would get debt falling as a percentage of gdp alongside the updated obr forecasts on november 23 prime minister liz truss toby melville pa on bbc newsnight veteran tory mp sir geoffrey clifton brown joined those calls telling the programme that he feared further turmoil in the markets if the date of the statement is not changed it comes as a yougov poll for the times showed labour opening up a massive 33 point lead over the conservatives raising further questions about ms truss leadership only a few weeks into the job sir charles walker one tory mp commenting on the poll admitted that his party could be wiped out if an election was called tomorrow former cabinet minister julian smith also urged the government to reverse course on cut to the top rate of tax saying it must take responsibility for the reaction to friday s mini budget despite the growing unease both the prime minister and chancellor have said they are still committed to the economic plan arguing that their 45 billion package of tax cuts is the right plan for the economy and while declining to comment directly on the economic turmoil created by the mini budget ms truss told a round of bbc local radio interviews that her administration had to take urgent action to kick start the economy and protect consumers from rising energy costs during a visit to an engine plant in darlington mr kwarteng said the package he announced in the commons on friday was absolutely essential if the economy was to generate the revenues needed to fund public services pa graphics fresh details also emerged on thursday about the lack of an independent obr forecast to go along with the fiscal event last week with the obr revealing that it had prepared a draft forecast for the new chancellor on his first day in office the lack of such a forecast had been one of the issues that reportedly troubled the city after the chancellor s announcement in a letter to the scottish national party s westminster leader ian blackford and the party s shadow chancellor alison thewliss mr hughes confirmed that the body sent a draft economic and fiscal forecast to the new chancellor on september 6 his first day in office he wrote we offered at the time to update that forecast to take account of subsequent data and to reflect the economic and fiscal impact of any policies the government announced in time for it to be published alongside the fiscal event he said that the obr was not commissioned to produce an updated forecast but confirmed that it would have been in a position to do so to a standard that satisfied the legal requirements of the charter for budget responsibility mr blackford called the details contained in the letter utterly damning chancellor kwasi kwarteng arrives at darlington station owen humphreys pa the chancellor had on thursday brushed off suggestions his mini budget had been a major economic disaster while the prime minister told bbc radio leeds we had to take urgent action to get our economy growing get britain moving and also deal with inflation of course that means taking controversial and difficult decisions but i am prepared to do that the comments came after the bank launched an emergency government bond buying programme on wednesday to prevent borrowing costs from spiralling out of control and stave off a material risk to uk financial stability it bought up to 65 billion worth of government bonds known as gilts at an urgent pace after fears over the government s tax cutting plans sent the pound tumbling and sparked a sell off in the gilts market which left some uk pension funds teetering on the brink of collapse on thursday the pound regained some ground rising to above 1 1 dollars for the first time since last friday however the ftse 100 dropped around 2 to 6 864 its lowest point since march this year amid a global sell off while yields on the uk s 10 year gilts were up to 4 14 speaking in northern ireland the bank s chief economist huw pill underlined warnings that they would have to sharply raise interest rates noting that there was undoubtedly a uk specific component to recent market movements his comments contrasted with ms truss who in her interviews blamed vladimir putin s war in ukraine for pushing up global energy prices for labour shadow chancellor rachel reeves called on ms truss and mr kwarteng to reverse their kamikaze budget earlier trade unions called for a cast iron guarantee that there would be no more cuts to public spending after treasury chief secretary chris philp confirmed whitehall departments had been instructed to carry out an efficiency and prioritisation exercise in an effort to find savings speaking to broadcasters mr kwarteng said that despite the pressures on the public finances the government would maintain the state pension triple lock but refused to commit to uprating benefits in line with inflation it s premature for me to come to a decision on that but we are absolutely focused on making sure that the most vulnerable in our society are protected through what could be a challenge he said it comes amid some speculation that the government could move to the uprating of benefits by earnings instead of inflation next year in a bid to save billions of pounds ms truss can still count on some support for the measures especially among the free marketeer wing of her party writing in the telegraph lord frost dismissed those who attach importance to symbols like the value of sterling while tory mp daniel kawczynski praised the radical approach taken by the pm to stave off a recession meanwhile kemi badenoch the international

stocks fell broadly as worries about a possible recession and rising bond yields put the squeeze back on markets stocks fell broadly on wall street on thursday as worries about a possible recession and rising bond yields put the squeeze back on markets the standard poor s 500 fell 2 1 reaching its lowest level since late 2020 the washout erased the index s gains in a big rally the day before that s when forceful moves by the bank of england to get suddenly surging british bond yields under control led to a global burst of relief among investors the dow jones industrial average fell 1 5 and the nasdaq composite lost 2 8 the russell 2000 index of smaller companies dropped 2 4 advertisement the major indexes are on pace for a weekly loss to wind up what has been a dismal month for wall street with one day left in september the benchmark s p 500 is down about 8 for the month for markets to really turn higher after u s stocks have lost more than 20 of their value this year analysts say investors will need to see a break from the high inflation that s swept the world that hasn t happened yet with even more data arriving thursday showing the opposite and that means the federal reserve and other central banks will probably keep pushing interest rates higher to slow their economies in hopes of pushing down inflation by doing that they re also risking recessions if they go too far the economy doesn t look to be softening if you look at employment data said brad mcmillan chief investment officer for commonwealth financial network that undercuts any investor hopes a weakening economy could convince the fed to take it easier on interest rates the selling was widespread thursday with more than 90 of stocks in the s p 500 finishing in the red the index fell 78 57 points to 3 640 47 the dow lost 458 13 points to close at 29 225 61 and the nasdaq slid 314 13 points to 10 737 51 the russell 2000 finished down 40 31 points at 1 674 93 advertisement stocks fell as treasury yields climbed and raised the pressure on markets the yield on the 10 year treasury rose to 3 77 from 3 73 late wednesday it had been above 3 85 in morning trading the yield on the two year treasury which more closely tracks expectations for fed moves rose more aggressively to 4 20 from 4 14 a stronger than expected report on the u s job market bolstered expectations for the fed to keep raising rates and hold them at high levels for a while potentially through 2023 fewer workers filed for unemployment benefits last week than economists expected that s good news for workers in general and an indication layoffs aren t widespread despite worries about the economy but it also keeps upward pressure on inflation which gives the fed more reason to keep rates high the central bank s benchmark overnight interest rate has already zoomed to a range of 3 to 3 25 up from basically zero as recently as march that s its highest level since 2008 and the wide expectation is for the fed to hike it by at least another full percentage point by early 2023 rate increases have a notoriously long lag time before they hit the broad economy but they re already causing big pain for the housing industry where the average rate on a 30 year fixed mortgage has more than doubled over the last 12 months to 6 70 advertisement higher interest rates not only invite the possibility of a recession they also push down on prices for stocks and other investments regardless of what the economy s doing investments seen as the most expensive or the riskiest tend to take the hardest hits economic reports elsewhere around the world also firmed expectations for higher rates coming in the future in germany for example a reading on inflation came in hotter than expected in britain meanwhile prime minister liz truss defended her plan to cut taxes even though critics said it would worsen inflation the plan had sent british bond yields soaring forcing the bank of england on wednesday to pledge to buy however many british government bonds are needed to lower yields the bond buying announcement came just before the central bank had planned to do the opposite and sell some of the bonds it had purchased earlier to support the economy even beyond the worries about central banks and rates many other concerns continue to hang over markets a supercharged u s dollar has climbed so much so quickly against other currencies that investors worry something could break somewhere in global markets europe s already struggling economy looks to be facing more pressure from high energy prices amid accusations that someone deliberately damaged pipelines delivering gas from russia to germany advertisement and in the u s investors are concerned that one of the main levers setting stock prices may be under threat as corporate profits bend under higher interest rates a slowing economy and high inflation carmax the auto seller plunged 24 6 for the largest loss in the s p 500 after it reported weaker profit than expected for the three months through august it said the used auto market is tough generally as higher interest rates make getting auto loans more expensive

voters who supported boris johnson at the last general election are switching allegiance to keir starmer the poll found just 37 of those who voted conservative in 2019 intend to stick with the party

disastrous for his party and that a labour landslide was now on the cards sir charles walker told channel 4 news it means if there was a general election tomorrow we would be wiped out we would cease to exist as a functioning political party he claimed that last week s budget was very poorly executed the figures looked like they had been written on the back of a fag packet and that ministers had not rolled the pitch or prepared the market for its radical proposals just days before miss truss s first conference as party leader several senior tories including former chief whip julian smith and former ministers george freeman and lord vaizey called on the prime minister to change course and abandon her plan to abolish the 45p tax and following reports last night that the mini budget could be funded by cuts to public spending not seen since the days of george osborne s austerity programme several tory backbenchers are already threatening to rebel against the prime minister s finance bill others have claimed that letters of no confidence are flying in like there s no tomorrow and suggested that miss truss will be gone by christmas with one saying i wouldn t get hung up about the 12 month rule on another whirlwind day in britain tory alarm was underlined by a shock poll giving labour a 33 point lead conservative grandee sir charles walker said the tories would cease to exist as a

treasury chief secretary chris philp sought to play down the situation telling lbc radio i don t accept the word crisis at all estate agents said house sales were collapsing as the number of mortgage deals withdrawn from the market topped 2 000 it emerged that the bank of england was warned five years ago about risky investments that almost triggered the collapse of major pension funds this week prime minister liz truss chancellor kwasi kwarteng fears among the tories that the financial fallout could hurt them at the ballot box were dramatically underlined after a yougov poll showed labour opening up a 33 point lead thought to be the biggest lead by any party in any poll since the 1990s chief secretary to the treasury chris philp prime minister liz truss chancellor of the exchequer kwasi kwarteng and minister for levelling up housing and communities simon clarke in the commons labour party leader sir keir starmer and angela rayner deputy leader of the labour party react on the final day of the labour party conference at the acc on september 28 2022 the pound rallied slightly yesterday but the ftse 100 remained below 7 000 on closing amid the financial panic uk spending watchdog insists it offered to crunch the numbers for kwareng s mini budget britain s spending watchdog has insisted that it offered to crunch the numbers for kwasi kwarteng s mini budget but was asked not to do so by the chancellor it adds further details to ongoing objections that the chancellor made his mini budget which included 45billion of tax cuts without a clear economic forecast to back it up in a letter to the scottish national party s westminster leader ian blackford and the party s shadow chancellor alison thewliss the chair of the obr confirmed that the body sent a draft economic and fiscal forecast to the new chancellor on 6 september his first day in office richard hughes wrote we offered at the time to update that forecast to take account of subsequent data and to reflect the economic and fiscal impact of any policies the government announced in time for it to be published alongside the fiscal event in the event we were not commissioned to produce an updated forecast alongside the chancellor s growth plan on 23 september although we would have been in a position to do so to a standard that satisfied the legal requirements of the charter for budget responsibility advertisement the chancellor also broke cover after days of silence yesterday appealing to jittery tory mps while on a visit to an engine plant in darlington for unity mr kwarteng told mps the government would show markets our plan is sound adding the only people who will win if we divide is the labour party but last night a series of conservative mps broke cover to demand changes to the budget including dropping the plan to scrap the 45p top tax rate former chief whip julian smith called for an immediate rethink saying the government should abandon the 45p change take responsibility for the collapse in the pound and make clear that it will do everything possible to stabilise markets and protect public services former minister george freeman called on ministers to bring forward a plan b adding this is now a serious crisis with a lot at stake ministers deny that last week s mini budget was the trigger for the market backlash against the uk saying that all countries are facing turbulence as a result of soaring energy prices caused by the war in ukraine a source pointed out that inflation in germany yesterday soared above 10 for the first time since the second world war and miss truss struck a defiant tone pushing back hard against claims that the budget and particularly the plan to axe the 45p top tax rate was unfair asked whether she was guilty of playing robin hood in reverse she told bbc radio nottingham that the best way to help working families was to boost the anaemic growth rate the pm also suggested that reversing the 45 billion package of tax cuts could trigger a recession it s not fair to have a recession she said it s not fair to have a town where you re not getting investment it s not fair if we don t get higher paying jobs because we have highest tax burden for 70 years miss truss hinted at frustration with the way her economic plan has been portrayed she said 90 per cent of the cost was accounted for by the energy price guarantee and the reversal of the rise in national insurance both of which will help millions of ordinary households the plan to freeze average energy bills will cost 10 billion a month and comes into force tomorrow but ministers fear they will get little credit for it as it was announced on the day of the queen s death the pm acknowledged the need for the government to reassure the markets that uk debt will eventually be brought under control liz truss vows to cut farmers red tape to ease cost of living crisis liz truss has pledged to slash red tape for farmers to help them deliver more affordable food for the public and ease the cost of living squeeze the prime minister who has faced calls from thousands of farmers demanding an end to mountains of regulations in the countryside yesterday reiterated her plan to solve long term supply issues and quell concerns over energy costs defending her tax cuts from accusations that they favour the most well off the former environment secretary said her upcoming economic support package would help drive down food prices miss truss told bbc radio stoke our energy package will help reduce overall inflation by up to 5 per cent and that will help reduce food prices we will also soon be announcing a package to help food producers and farmers be able to deliver more for people it will reduce the red tape for farmers make sure they re getting the government s full support so they can produce more food at affordable prices earlier this week almost 5 000 farmers including tv star jeremy clarkson urged miss truss to reduce regulation in rural areas in a letter they wrote for years the bureaucratic bulldozer has been trampling over the countryside infuriating millions of us it has cost jobs and created misery during the tory leadership campaign miss truss promised to remove onerous eu regulations and red tape advertisement she said it was important we re fiscally responsible and we bring the debt down over time the chancellor will be laying out in november how he s going to bring the debt down over time we will get borrowing back on track last night the commons treasury committee urged the chancellor to bring forward his debt management plan to next week rather than waiting until the current target date of november 23 some tory mps are warning privately that they may vote down the plan to scrap the top rate of tax following a public backlash but asked whether she would stick to her plan miss truss said this is the right plan this is about making sure people are going into the winter not worried about high fuel bills which is what we were looking at it was simply unconscionable that we could have allowed that to happen later the pm confirmed that ministers will be asked to find billions of pounds in spending cuts to help reassure financial markets that her plans are affordable mr philp is expected to write to cabinet ministers asking them to identify efficiencies miss truss said there were plenty of areas where government could become more efficient shadow chancellor rachel reeves accused the pm of making this disastrous situation even worse her failure to answer questions about what will happen with people s pensions and mortgages will leave families across the country facing huge worry she said experts said the latest opinion poll put sir keir clearly on course to be the next prime minister yougov s patrick english told the times that the realignment now under way was comparable to that which led to tony blair s landslide victory in 1997 james johnson who ran polling for former premier theresa may in downing street said there is no point pretending anything else this is terminal but some tories urged the pm to stick to her guns marco longhi the mp for north dudley who backed miss truss in the leadership campaign said i fully support and back the prime minister and her plans for growth for the country we need to be brave and carry on and do whatever we need to grow the economy another tory mp who supported miss truss in the leadership election said i m not panicking i m giving her the benefit of the doubt i think it s very early days and i think people will give her the benefit of the doubt the markets are spooked and once they calm down people might move on the optics and politics aren t great because we just handed out tens of billions to keep people warm and we want political credit for that the budget has politically backfired in the short term and clearly we re paying a massive price for it in the polls it came after the bank launched an emergency government bond buying programme on wednesday to prevent borrowing costs from spiralling out of control and stave off a material risk to uk financial stability boe swipes at liz truss top economist at bank says economic woes are home grown and not just putin s fault the country s most senior economist has said that the current economic woes facing the uk are in part home grown after the prime minister blamed them on russia huw pill the chief economist at the bank of england said there is undoubtedly a uk specific component to the recent market movements which have seen the pound collapse and the cost of government borrowing soar over the course of the past week there has been a significant repricing of financial assets he told an audience in county down northern ireland part of that repricing reflects broader global developments part of it reflects the ongoing normalisation of macroeconomic policy after the pandemic induced episode of exceptional ease it comes after liz truss on thursday seemed to blame the market sell off on vladimir putin s war in ukraine advertisement it bought up to 65 billion worth of government bonds known as gilts at an urgent pace after fears over the government s tax cutting plans sent the pound tumbling and sparked a sell off in the gilts market which left some uk pension funds teetering on the brink of collapse on thursday the pound regained some ground rising to above 1 1 dollars for the first time since last friday however the ftse 100 dropped around 2 to 6 864 its lowest point since march this year amid a global sell off while yields on the uk s 10 year gilts were up to 4 14 speaking in northern ireland the bank s chief economist huw pill underlined warnings that they would have to sharply raise interest rates noting that there was undoubtedly a uk specific component to recent market movements his comments contrasted with ms truss who in her interviews blamed vladimir putin s war in ukraine for pushing up global energy prices for labour shadow chancellor rachel reeves called on ms truss and mr kwarteng to reverse their kamikaze budget it is disgraceful that the family finances of people across the country are being put on the line simply so the government can give huge unfunded tax cuts to the richest companies and those earning hundreds of thousands of pounds a year she said this is a serious situation made in downing street and is the direct result of the conservative government s reckless actions earlier trade unions called for a cast iron guarantee that there would be no more cuts to public spending after treasury chief secretary chris philp confirmed whitehall departments had been instructed to carry out an efficiency and prioritisation exercise in an effort to find savings speaking to broadcasters mr kwarteng said that despite the pressures on the public finances the government would maintain the state pension triple lock but refused to commit to uprating benefits in line with inflation it s premature for me to come to a decision on that but we are absolutely focused on making sure that the most vulnerable in our society are protected through what could be a challenge he said asked by bbc london about why she scrapped the bankers bonus cap rather than help those on universal credit at last week s mini budget ms truss said she wouldn t apologise for wanting a successful financial services sector that attracts investment into the uk liz truss s media round key points pm insisted she had the right plan and would not shy away from controversial choices faced with questions over the fairness of what listeners called the robin hood budget the pm told bbc radio nottingham it s not fair to have a recession she insisted her plans were putting the country on a better trajectory for the long term but that conditions would not improve overnight faced criticism after appearing to suggest her government s multi billion pound plan to underwrite energy bills would cap bills at 2 500 this winter new research by the tony blair institute for global change suggested new budget will make economy just 0 4 per cent larger by 2027 than without tax cuts she also faced questions over why she had not been seen publicly since the mini budget with one caller asking where have you been advertisement earlier as she faced a grilling by local bbc radio stations ms truss had also defended her low tax economic plans after being accused of producing a reverse robin hood budget that gave to the rich at the expense of the poor appearing on eight bbc local radio stations in little more than an hour she insisted she had the right plan and would not shy away from controversial choices mr kwarteng himself also faced the media as he ruled out changes to his mini budget despite pressure for him and ms truss to alter course asked if he had a message for the financial markets as he prepared to visit a local business in darlington the chancellor said absolutely we are sticking to the growth plan and we are going to help people with energy bills that s my two top priorities quizzed by broadcasters on whether his tax cut plan had been a major economic disaster mr kwarteng added what we are focusing on is delivering the growth plan and making sure with things like our energy intervention that people people right across this country are protected without growth you are not going to get the public services we are not going to generate the income and the tax revenue to pay for public services that s why the mini budget was absolutely essential in re setting the debate around growth and focusing us on delivering much better outcomes for our people ministers are drawing up plans for billions of pounds in spending cuts to reassure panicked markets that public finances are under control new research by the tony blair institute for global change tbi and oxford economics claims the economy will only be 0 4 per cent larger by 2027 than it would have been without mr kwarteng s tax cut package the house of commons cross party treasury committee wrote to the chancellor urged him to appear before them shortly after parliament resumes sitting on 11th october senior tory mp mel stride the chair of the committee also demanded mr kwarteng bring forward a planned statement on managing government debt and a full forecast by the office for budget responsibility which are both due on 23rd november to the end of next month if not earlier the chancellor and prime minister put on a united front as they faced separately reporters after a week of turmoil in the markets affecting sterling and the mortgages and pensions of millions of britons senior tory mp mel stride the chair of the house of commons treasury committee demanded mr kwarteng bring forward a statement on managing debt and a forecast by the office for budget responsibility where have you been are you ashamed liz truss s bruising radio roadshow the pm endured a torrid round of bbc local radio interviews she faced hard questions with presenters often presenting questions and criticism from readers struggling with the cost of living crisis leeds the first question to the pm from presenter rima ahmed was where have you been she went on to say we had to take urgent action to get our economy growing get britain moving and also deal with inflation of course that means taking controversial decision but i am prepared to do that as prime minister norfolk the pm said it was really important the government took action quickly to reduce the tax burden and get the economy going she is also a norfolk mp and was asked about when king s lynn would get a new hospital by presenter chris goreham kent questions for the prime minister from bbc radio kent listeners included what on earth were you thinking how can we ever trust the conservatives with our economy again and are you ashamed of what you ve done the show s presenter anna cookson said asked if she will reverse the policies unveiled in the mini budget prime minister liz truss replied i don t accept the premise of the question lancashire the pm faced fewer questions on the economy and more on fracking which has taken place in lancashire from presenter graham liver her government has lifted the moratorium on drilling despite fears of earthquakes she said we will only press ahead with fracking in areas where there is local community support for that the uk has become dependent on global energy prices we have seen through vladimir putin s appalling war in ukraine how energy prices have shot up and russia has used the fact that it produces gas as a way of exerting pressure on other countries nottingham ms truss said it was simply not true when asked by bbc radio nottingham s sarah julian whether her mini budget was a reverse robin hood that disproportionately benefited the most wealthy asked how she was creating a fairer tax system the pm said the reality is people having lower taxes across the board everything from national insurance to corporation tax to income tax helps everybody because it helps grow the economy it s not necessarily popular to keep corporation tax low but i want to make sure we do because i want to make sure we attract investment into this country asked if there was any evidence that cutting the taxes of the most wealthy cut inequality she said there s plenty of evidence that if you have very high taxes they lead to lower economic growth tees ms truss was told about a listener diane who has had to sell her house of 25 years due to the cost of living crisis the prime minister was asked by presenter amy oakden how tax cuts for the wealthiest would help people like diane and replied well we are cutting taxes across the board because we were facing the highest tax burden on britain for 70 years and that was causing a lack of economic growth and without growth we don t get the investment we don t get the jobs we need which helps local communities right around the country we re also reversing the increase in national insurance we re also reducing the basic rate so we re reducing taxes across the board because the tax burden was too high bristol the pm was asked by james hanson i thought you believed in sound money or have you changed your mind about that like you did about brexit she replied i do believe in sound money i would point out that interest rates are going up around the world the federal reserve has raised interest rates this is a global phenomenon pressed on whether people s pensions were safe ms truss said the bank of england do that and they do a very good job of it he added it s hard to know what has fallen more since you entered downing street the value of the pound of the tory poll rating stoke the pm was asked by john acres have you taken the keys of the country and crashed the economy she replied i ve taken decisive action to deal with the very difficult situation the country and the world is facing advertisement mr stride said this was critical to help reassure markets and to help inform the bank of england on its huge decision whether to hike interest rates again at the beginning of november in a sign of the growing unease among tory mps about the financial markets reaction to mr kwarteng s mini budget former cabinet minister julian smith called on the government to take responsibility for the financial chaos he demanded the chancellor and ms truss take responsibility for the link between last friday and the impact on peoples mortgages and make clear that it will do everything possible to stabilise markets and protect public services fellow tory backbencher george freeman said the country was facing a serious crisis and called for cool heads and calm leadership he posted on twitter the economic package of borrowing tax cuts announced last week clearly can t command market or voter confidence the cabinet must meet fast to agree with pm cx a planb which can hold the mood among conservative mps will have darkened further tonight after the yougov poll found that just 37 per cent of voters who backed the tories at the 2019 general election said they were planning to stick with the party yougov said labour s 33 point lead was the highest of any recorded poll since the late 1990s their survey found a large lead for sir keir starmer 44 per cent to 15 per cent when voters were asked whether the labour leader or ms truss would make the best pm a separate survation poll published tonight found labour were 21 points ahead of the tories 49 per cent to 28 per cent which the firm said was the largest labour lead they had ever recorded a third polling firm redfield and wilton strategies also found the largest lead for labour they had ever recorded in a new poll published tonight which put sir keir s party 17 points ahead of the conservatives after almost a week of economic turmoil that followed the fiscal event the prime minister emerged from no10 to carry out a round of bbc local radio interviews but she was presented with examples of the potential hardship facing millions as she said she would not alter course from plans to massively cut taxes for the better off and increase borrowing by billions she also faced criticism after appearing to suggest her government s multi billion pound plan to underwrite energy bills would cap bills at 2 500 this winter when that figure is an average faced with questions over the fairness of what listeners called the robin hood budget the pm told bbc radio nottingham it s not fair to have a recession it s not fair to have less jobs in future because we have the highest tax burden speaking to bbc radio leeds ms truss insisted her plans were putting the country on a better trajectory for the long term but that conditions would not improve overnight we had to take urgent action to get our economy growing get britain moving and also deal with inflation she said of course that means taking controversial and difficult decisions but i m prepared to do that as prime minister she later told bbc radio norwich this is the right plan that we have set out she also faced questions over why she had not been seen publicly since the mini budget with one caller asking where have you been ms truss replied i think we have to remember what situation this country was facing we were going into the winter with people expected to face fuel bills of up to 6 000 huge rates of inflation slowing economic growth and what we ve done is we ve taken action to make sure that from this weekend people won t be paying a typical fuel bill of more than 2 500 the prime minister was lost for words at points on the round of stations from norfolk to bristol as ms truss defended government borrowing aimed at cutting taxes to promote economic growth and to provide aid with rising energy bills bbc radio stoke s presenter john acres pointed out that homeowners mortgages fees were rising by more than the amount they would save from the energy support after a silence the prime minister replied i don t think anybody is arguing that we shouldn t have acted on energy before her appearances allies insisted she has no plans to deviate from kwasi kwarteng s economic plan set out in friday s mini budget his announcement that he was scrapping the 45p top rate of income tax and cuttings other levies like corporation tax and national insurance while upping uk borrowing has sparked calls for him to quit or be replaced but ms truss is said to have ruled out axing him less than a month into his appointment or making concessions to the financial meltdown another ally told politico all of this will be fought hard by the people who benefit from the status quo but if the government was forever doing what the markets want nothing would ever change last night one of her allies treasury chief secretary chris philp suggested that november plans to unveil cuts to spending could include reneging on a promise by ex chancellor rishi sunak to increase benefits in line with inflation he denied the current economic situation amounted to a crisis labour s shadow chancellor rachel reeves accused the pm of making this disastrous situation even worse her failure to answer questions about what will happen with people s pensions and mortgages will leave families across the country facing huge worry she said former bank of england governor mark carney slammed mr kwarteng for undercutting the uk s financial institutions after the chancellor s partial budget sent the pound plummeting mr carney said the mini budget on friday came without the usual forecast attached before warning it will be the british public that pay the price it comes as a number of lenders have pulled hundreds of mortgage products over fears the bank of england boe will further raise interest rates to 6 per cent to counter the plunging sterling the institution was yesterday forced to intervene and dramatically declared it will buy long term government debt in a bid to ease the market chaos threatening to cause a financial meltdown in what mr carney said was the right move speaking on bbc radio 4 s today programme mr carney said the message of financial markets is that there s a limit to unfunded spending and unfunded tax cuts in this environment and the price of those is much higher borrowing costs for the government and mortgage holders and borrowers up and down the country mr carney who is currently the un special envoy on climate action and finance accused liz truss s government of working at crossed purposes with the country s financial institutions causing the on going turmoil by failing to produce a full costed budget shadow treasury chief secretary pat mcfadden has repeated labour s call for kwasi kwarteng to rethink his economic growth plan this was a reckless act of choice which has wreaked havoc in financial markets we had the extraordinary intervention by the bank of england to stop major pension funds going off a cliff he told bbc news it is really important now that we try to get some stability back into those markets and in the longer term restore the economic credibility of the country what is more important here the chancellor and the prime minister saving face or saving the mortgage payments of millions of people across the country this is going to have a real and damaging impact where payments could go up hundreds or thousands of pounds a year they have got to reconsider this the uk s giant welfare bill is facing a cut following a turbulent day yesterday in which the bank of england made the shock and highly unusual move to declare it would be purchasing gilts in response to the significant repricing of uk and global financial assets since kwasi kwarteng s mini budget announcement on friday it has emerged that the extraordinary intervention was triggered by fears that otherwise institutions would have been crushed within hours putting the whole system at risk meanwhile city minister andrew griffith said the package was the right plan to make our economy competitive but cabinet ministers are understood to have privately raised concerns with mr kwarteng over the package of tax cuts a member of ms truss new cabinet told the times that the government got the timing wrong by announcing the cuts and spending reforms while inflation remains so high adding that the jury is still out on whether the pm can create a strong narrative and vision to sell the measures unease is growing among the party with mps including former minister julian smith and chairman of the northern ireland select committee simon hoare both calling for changes to the economic plan but despite signs of tory nerves downing street and the treasury remain defiant saying there is no prospect of a change in approach the pound rallies by more than one percent against the dollar to 1 10 but ftse 100 drops by nearly two per cent to 6881 as uk s financial markets suffer another day of chaos the turmoil on the uk s financial markets caused by chancellor kwasi kwarteng s tax cutting mini budget continued to rage today with the pound reversing losses and climbing more than 1 following the bank of england s dramatic intervention but the ftse 100 tumbling by nearly 2 sterling crashed to a record low against the dollar of 1 0327 on monday after liz truss s government unveiled plans to cut taxes and raise borrowing with the emergency budget sparking chaos in financial markets and forcing threadneedle street to start buying bonds again the prime minister refused to back down today saying in a series of interview on bbc radio that her government s plans were the right ones for the country the pound surged from its 6am low of 1 08 to 1 10 by 5pm taking its three day rally to more than 3 though sterling is still down by more than 18 this year the euro at 5pm was 0 8850 pounds compared to 0 8941 pounds at the previous close but the ftse 100 remained below the psychologically important 7 000 mark at around 6 850 throughout the day the index at the close was down 123 80 at 6881 59 at 12pm the pound was 1 0834 dollars compared to 1 0830 dollars at the previous close after falling to 1 0763 in early morning trading today figures at 10am showed the pound at 1 0795 dollars compared to 1 0830 dollars at the previous close the ftse 100 had dropped nearly 2 before recovering to 1 17 with the index at 9 45am down 107 53 at 6897 86 by 12 45pm the ftse 100 index was down 57 55 at 6947 84 the 10 year gilt yield rose 16 bps to 4 16 on thursday after falling almost 50 bps yesterday ten year gilt yields had dropped 50 bps to 4 01 and two year yields fell a similar amount to 4 24 advertisement earlier mr griffith denied that last week s mini budget had sparked the slide in the pound and the turbulence in the uk government bond market that pushed pension funds to the brink he said what is unprecedented is the level of volatility we have seen in all developed markets the treasury has confirmed that government departments will be asked to identify billions of pounds of savings to help convince the markets that ministers are serious about keeping the uk s debts under control there was also speculation that the treasury could trim the uk s giant welfare bill to save money ministers will also fast track supply side reforms designed to cut regulation and boost growth a downing street source voiced frustration at the market reaction saying that 90 per cent of the cost of recent interventions was accounted for by the schemes to freeze energy prices for households and businesses the moves followed an unprecedented intervention by the bank of england to buy uk government debt on whatever scale is necessary to try to restore calm as market turbulence threatened the financial health of final salary pension schemes it comes as borrowers may have to prove they can afford interest rates of as much as seven per cent to secure a mortgage offer as lenders continue to pull deals from sale amid the volatile market the base rate is expected to peak at 5 5 per cent next spring causing knock on effects for potential homeowners because banks are required to test whether borrowers can afford a mortgage at a percentage point above future expectations of the rate it would mean borrowers having to prove they can afford mortgage rates of 6 5 or seven per cent repayments at seven per cent interest on a 200 000 mortgage would equate to 1 331 a month or 2 661 for 400 000 assuming a 30 year mortgage they were under huge pressure from huge moves in gilts bonds issued to finance government borrowing combined with plunging in the pound and officials believed they were witnessing a dynamic run similar to that seen when northern rock failed at the start of the credit crunch according to sky news some were said to have been urgently raising capital to cover their liabilities the bank s action is designed to add more demand for gilts and and pump up their prices which in turn brings down the interest rates the bank said in a statement this repricing has become more significant in the past day and it is particularly affecting long dated uk government debt were dysfunction in this market to continue or worsen there would be a material risk to uk financial stability this would lead to an unwarranted tightening of financing conditions and a reduction of the flow of credit to the real economy it acted on a fourth day of turmoil which has seen the pound hit record lows below 1 04 and a huge sell off in government bonds as the crisis began to spill over into the real economy the bank of england is prepared to buy up to 65bn of long term bonds between now and the middle of october but said it could increase this depending on prevailing market conditions now estate agents start calling up rich londoners saying foreign buyers are ready to swoop for bargains because of cheap pound as chains collapse and deals expire amid mortgage mayhem estate agents are calling up wealthy london homeowners alerting them of eager international buyers looking to swoop in on cheap properties after the pound slumped sterling crashed to a

federal reserve policymakers will press ahead with raising u s borrowing costs to fight the corroding effects of too high inflation taking in stride both turmoil in global financial markets and early signs their actions are weakening the job market i m quite comfortable with raising interest rates to 4 4 5 this year and 4 5 5 next year san francisco fed president mary daly told reporters after a speech at boise state university on thursday adding she expects that rates will need to stay at that level for all of 2023 those ranges encompass what the majority of daly s fellow policymakers wrote in their rate path projections published last week when the fed lifted interest rates to 3 3 25 in what is proving to be the most aggressive round of rate hikes since the 1980s the fed s steeper than expected policy tightening aimed at bringing down inflation that s running at more than triple the fed s 2 target is expected to slow economic growth and lift unemployment global stock markets have tumbled and major currencies have lost ground against the dollar loretta mester president of the cleveland fed speaking on cnbc on thursday offered an even more aggressive outlook on what is needed to tame inflation mester said she does not see a case for slowing rate hikes right now and in fact said she expects the central bank will need to go even further than it signaled last week i probably am a little bit above that median path because i see more persistence in the inflation process mester said daly addressed the turmoil in financial markets noting that markets are trying to get their footing with investors assessing a myriad of risks including market dysfunction in the u k which prompted intervention by the bank of england the war in ukraine the damaged gas pipeline in the baltic sea continued covid lockdowns in china and policy tightening by many central banks globally what i ultimately want to know is how much have financial conditions tightened what has this done to the global economy how much of a headwind will that be blowing against u s growth and then how does that factor in to where what we need to do in our policy daly said and while daly sees some signs that u s labor markets are slowing noting that firms she talks to say they are recruiting new hires with less intensity consumer spending remains robust still daly said she does not believe the fed will need to raise rates so high they will trigger a deep recession for now unemployment at 3 7 is low and the labor market is still strong she said but if households and businesses start expecting inflation to continue to get worse or if supply chains don t heal as expected and goods shortages continue to push upward on prices daly told reporters then i am prepared to do more mester said she did not see distress in u s financial markets that would alter the central bank s campaign to lower very high levels of inflation through interest rate hikes while no one knows for sure if there is a big problem lurking in the financial sector right now so far we haven t seen the kind of market dysfunction even through what s happening in the global markets right now we haven t seen that in the u s markets mester said earlier thursday st louis federal reserve president james bullard said he doesn t see u k market turmoil really impinging on the u s inflation or real growth developments tax cuts proposed by the government of new british prime minister liz truss touched off a drop in the value of the pound to an all time low of 1 0327 on monday the drop reflects widespread fears the government s plan will further stoke inflation and put britain s fiscal and monetary policy at odds with each other
