federal reserve officials are signaling that they will take an aggressive approach to fight high inflation in the coming months actions that will make borrowing sharply more expensive for consumers and businesses and heighten risks to the economy in minutes from their march policy meeting released wednesday fed officials said that half point interest rate hikes rather than traditional quarter point increases could be appropriate multiple times this year at last month s meeting many of the fed s policymakers favored a half point increase the minutes said but held off then because of the uncertainties created by russia s invasion of ukraine instead the fed raised its key short term rate by a quarter point and signaled that it planned to continue raising rates well into next year inflation rose 7 9 in february 2022 the the biggest rise in the consumer price index in 40 years the labor department reported but what exactly is inflation and what is causing it get philly local news weather forecasts sports and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc philadelphia newsletters the minutes said the fed is also moving toward rapidly shrinking its huge 9 trillion stockpile of bonds in the coming months a move that would contribute to higher borrowing costs the policymakers said they would likely cut those holdings by about 95 billion a month nearly double the pace they implemented five years ago when they last shrank their balance sheet the plan to quickly draw down their bond holdings marks the latest move by fed officials to accelerate their inflation fighting efforts prices are surging at the fastest pace in four decades and officials have expressed increasing concern about inflation the fed s plans reflect their great discomfort with the rapid pace of inflation said kathy bostjancic chief u s financial economist at oxford economics the fed is increasingly worried that consumers and businesses will start expecting price surges to persist bostjancic added a trend that can itself prolong high inflation many economists have said they worry the fed has waited too long to start raising rates and could be forced to respond so aggressively as to trigger a recession indeed economists at deutsche bank predict that the economy will tumble into a recession late next year noting that the fed finding itself now well behind the curve has given clear signals that it is shifting to a more aggressive tightening mode the stock market sold off when the minutes were released but later rebounded from its worst levels still the s p 500 index closed down nearly 1 after a sharp drop on tuesday markets now expect much steeper rate hikes this year than fed officials had signaled as recently as their meeting in mid march at that meeting the policymakers projected that their benchmark rate would remain below 2 by the end of this year and 2 8 at the end of 2023 up from its current level below 0 5 but wall street now foresees the fed s rate reaching 2 6 by year s end with further hikes next year higher fed rates will in turn heighten costs for mortgages auto loans credit cards and corporate loans in this way the fed hopes to cool economic growth and rising wages enough to tame high inflation which has caused hardships for millions of households and poses a severe political threat to president joe biden chair jerome powell opened the door two weeks ago to increasing rates by as much as a half point lael brainard a key member of the fed s board of governors and other officials have also made clear they envision such sharp increases most economists now expect the fed to raise rates by a half point at both its may and june meetings in a speech tuesday brainard underscored the fed s increasing aggressiveness by saying its bond holdings will shrink considerably more rapidly over a much shorter period than the last time it reduced its balance sheet from 2017 2019 at that time the balance sheet was about 4 5 trillion now it s twice as large federal reserve chairman jerome powell took questions from lawmakers on wednesday after the pandemic hammered the economy two years ago the fed bought trillions in treasury and mortgage bonds with the goal of lowering longer term loan rates it also cut its short term benchmark rate to near zero as a sign of how fast the fed is reversing course the last time the fed bought bonds there was a three year gap between when it stopped its purchases in 2014 and when it began reducing the balance sheet in 2017 now that shift is likely to happen in as few three months or less with the reduction in the balance sheet likely to be announced as early as may brainard s remarks caused a sharp rise in the rate on the 10 year treasury note which influences mortgage rates business loans and other borrowing costs on wednesday that rate reached 2 6 up from 2 3 a week earlier and 1 7 a month ago average mortgage rates have leapt higher reaching 4 67 last week according to mortgage buyer freddie mac the highest since 2018 shorter term bond yields have jumped more in some cases to above the 10 year yield a pattern that has often been taken as a sign of an impending recession fed officials say however that shorter term bond market trends aren t flashing the same warning signals gennadiy goldberg senior u s rates strategist at td securities said the narrow gap between longer and shorter term bond yields indicates that investors think the economy will slow enough in the next two years to force the fed to scale back its rate hikes to shrink its balance sheet the fed will let some of its bonds mature without reinvesting the proceeds what impact this might have is uncertain powell said last month that the reduction in bond holdings would be equivalent to another rate hike economists estimate that reducing the balance sheet by 1 trillion a year would be equal to anywhere from one to three additional quarter point increases in the fed s benchmark short term rate each year treasury secretary janet yellen who preceded powell as fed chair suggested at a congressional hearing wednesday that russia s invasion of ukraine would likely keep escalating inflation in the coming months the sanctions we ve placed on russia are pushing up the price of energy yellen said when energy prices are going up the price of wheat and corn that russia and ukraine produce are going up and metals that play an important industrial role are going up
the international energy agency s 31 member nations plan to release 120 million barrels from their emergency oil reserves including 60 million barrels from a previously announced drawdown from u s stockpiles it s the second coordinated release of emergency oil from the iea in just over a month as gasoline prices have soared after russia s invasion of ukraine the higher fuel costs have hurt consumers who are already dealing with high inflation around the world around half of the latest iea release will come from the united states as part of plans announced last week by president biden to release 1 million barrels per day of oil from its strategic petroleum reserve for six months or a total of up to 180 million barrels other iea members include most of europe japan and mexico among others the iea is moving ahead with a collective oil stock release of 120 million barrels including 60 million barrels contributed by the us as part of its overall draw from its strategic petroleum reserve said fatih birol iea s executive director in a tweet birol added that more details of specific contributions will be made public soon the iea announcement pushed down crude prices with brent futures the global benchmark down over 5 daniel leal afp via getty images afp via getty images international energy agency s executive director fatih birol addresses the cop26 un climate summit in glasgow on november 4 2021 world faces loss of russia oil exports the iea had announced on march 1 it would release 60 million barrels of oil including 30 million barrels from the u s that move however was seen as too small to bring down crude prices gas prices have declined though since the u s announced plans to release up to 180 million barrels from its emergency stockpiles still they continue to remain above 4 a gallon and not from a record set last month unadjusted for inflation the iea has estimatedthat russia one of the world s biggest oil exporters could face cuts of about 3 million barrels per day in its oil exports starting in april due to sanctions and also because some buyers are shunning its oil in the markets russia s oil exports totaled around 8 million barrels per day prior to the invasion what we re seeing today with russia is the potential for what could be the largest oil supply disruption ever said jim burkhard a vice president at s p global commodity insights more than halfof russian oil exports go to europe and 20 percent go to china according the the iea spencer platt getty images getty images gas prices are displayed at a gas station in brooklyn on march 8 oil markets are volatile global oil markets have been on a roller coaster since russia s invasion of ukraine in late february but analysts have warned the emergency oil releases from the u s and its partners would pose only a temporary solution given the world is still likely to experience a supply gap from russia the only true long term solution is either you increase supply or you decrease demand or more likely a combination of both said claudio galimberti senior vice president of analysis at rystad energy however oil producers are limited in how much and how quickly they can ramp up production president biden has recently been encouraging u s oil producers to drill more but it would take several months before additional oil could come to market and oil investors are hesitant to invest in further drilling after suffering big losses in previous oil busts the global oil cartel opec controls much of the world s oil supplies as its countries sit on nearly 80 of proven crude oil reserves and supply about 44 of the world s oil but last week opec which russia is a member of announced it would stick to its previous plan to increase oil production modestly or about 400 000 barrels per day that was much lower than the biden administration had hoped for biden wants to avoid a situation where gas prices become unbearably high copyright 2022 npr to see more visit
a motorist pumps gas at a valero station in encinitas california on april 5 2022 in southern california s 49th congressional district prices have soared above 6 a gallon sandy huffaker for the washington post via getty images house democrats slammed oil and gas industry executives during a hearing on wednesday accusing them of profiteering amid russia s invasion of ukraine and its impact on the global energy market the consensus among committee democrats and republicans as well as the executives who testified is that the u s needs to boost domestic production in the short term in order to provide americans relief at the pump where they fiercely disagree is on the barriers keeping that from happening advertisement rep diana degette d colo chair of the house energy and commerce oversight and investigations subcommittee displayed a chart showing that while the price of crude oil has dropped in recent weeks gasoline prices in the u s remain near historic highs why she asked if the price of gas is driven by the global market why is the price of oil coming down but the price at the pump is still at record highs something just doesn t add up she added industry executives from exxon mobil bp chevron shell usa devon energy corp and pioneer resources said the global market controls prices not individual companies but struggled to explain the widening gap advertisement changes in the price of crude oil do not always result in immediate changes at the pump said mike wirth ceo of chevron he added that it frequently takes more time for competition among retail stations to bring prices back down it is a very complex set of factors that impact the price of gasoline including supply risk across all fossil fuel products said david lawler president of bp america rep diana degette asks bp exec david lawler why gas prices so high even after crude oil prices came down here s how he responded pic twitter com aq4v7n4urh nowthis nowthisnews april 6 2022 advertisement republicans on the committee ran to the industry s defense reps morgan griffith va and cathy mcmorris rodgers wash argued that the biden administration s anti american energy agenda and war on fossil fuels are to blame for inflated prices it is impossible to generate confidence or invest in production today when future production is clearly being blocked by this administration griffith said griffith asked each of the executives if their company was taking advantage of the crisis in ukraine to keep prices artificially high in order to increase your own profits all of them said they were not we have no tolerance for price gouging wirth of chevron said in his opening remarks but as degette and other democrats on the panel pointed out and as the executives acknowledged the industry is raking in record profits the six companies present wednesday brought in a combined 75 billion in profits last year and when the federal reserve bank of dallas surveyed 139 industry executives last month the majority 59 cited investor pressure as the main reason producers have not ramped up production advertisement rep frank pallone d n j chairman of the house energy and commerce committee said the industry is ripping off the american people at a time of record profits big oil is refusing to increase production to provide the american people some much needed relief at the gas pump instead they are buying back their stock at an estimated 40 billion this year big oil is lining their pockets with one hand and taking millions in taxpayer subsidies with the other stock buybacks are when a company uses its profits to buy up its own stock often leading to a surge in the stock price pallone asked each of the executives if they would commit to reducing stock buybacks and dividends for shareholders which would enable them to increase production instead amid ongoing turmoil in the energy market none of them said they would i can t commit to a reduction in buybacks lawler said rep frankpallone asks oil company executives will you commit to doing whatever it takes including increasing production but also reducing dividends and buybacks in order to lower prices for struggling american consumers yes or no pic twitter com lgxcjvfhdb cspan cspan april 6 2022 advertisement monday s hearing and u s lawmakers push for more fossil fuel development come against the backdrop of a new united nations report that warns global carbon emissions need to peak by 2025 then go down 43 by 2030 in order to prevent catastrophic planetary warming last week biden ordered the largest ever release of oil from the nation s strategic reserves an average of 1 million barrels per day for six months to combat high prices and act as a wartime bridge until domestic production can ramp up later this year he also called on congress to pass use it or lose it legislation requiring oil and gas companies to pay fees on idle wells and unused federal leases highlighting the tightrope that democrats are walking on energy ahead of the midterms later this year when gas prices are likely to be high on voters minds pallone called on industry executives to take some action to reduce the pain at the gas pump produce more oil he said on wednesday produce more with the wells you have support huffpost our 2024 coverage needs you your loyalty means the world to us at huffpost we believe that everyone

the biden administration s decision to go for a big bang release of strategic petroleum reserves spr has successfully decreased oil prices for now the announced release of 180 million barrels will be spread over the next six months this has delivered an expected change in the brent futures curve by shifting prices down in the short term while pushing them upwards again by comparable amounts for contracts expiring later in the year a pivot around september 2022 can be expected when the spr release is likely to end rystad energy research shows this release should provide a temporary price relief at pumps as assuming normal refinery operations a decrease in prompt crude prices is usually accompanied by a decrease in product prices this comes at a time when average gasoline prices in the us are 4 2 per gallon the highest on record indeed road traffic remains heavily subdued in north america and europe because of extremely high gasoline prices and in china due to lockdowns triggered by covid 19 soon china will need to decide whether to persevere with its economically costly zero covid 19 policy in the face of rapidly increasing infections the release of 180 million barrels over 180 days will likely result in 1 million barrels per day bpd on average against a potential drop in russian crude exports of over 2 million bpd this historically large spr release is the right decision in the current crisis and consumers should feel the benefit soon but it only solves half the problem said claudio galimberti senior vice president analysis the spr was established 50 years ago with an expected life span of 25 years as such the infrastructure is dated and may be prone to faults and hiccups the release will lower the spr level significantly thus sowing the seed for a future price rally when demand for crude will increase from the need to replenish the stockpile the crude quality of the release is likely going to be split evenly between sweet and sour grades global balances over the next 12 18 months remain unchanged depending on the speed of the spr release and its duration it is expected that global s d balances will be temporarily altered assuming an average spr release of 1 million bpd for the next 180 days and keeping everything else constant including opec production and no swings in demand supply and demand balances should be less tight over the next six months in particular stock draws in the third quarter will be less pronounced and result in only a 0 3 million bpd average draw for the quarter vs the 1 3 million bpd average draw before the spr release however assuming the spr will need to be replenished over the course of the fourth quarter and most likely 2023 an increase in crude demand should be expected while the pace and duration are difficult to estimate now the rise nevertheless looks inevitable from that standpoint the big bang spr release makes very little change to the 2022 2023 global liquids balance alternative sources opec stays the course the opec group of oil producing nations said last week it would aim to raise production by 432 000 bpd in may continuing with a monthly plan agreed last year to gradually replace output cut at the start of the pandemic there have been no pledges by the uae or saudi arabia to tap into their spare capacity and fill the yawning gap between the pledges by opec and actual aggregate production which in february before the sanctions on russia stood at almost 1 million bpd at this pace and assuming a russian crude production loss of 2 million bpd going forward opec s gap between pledges and production in may could widen to 3 2 million bpd the uae and saudi arabia do not feel the need to break their alliance with russia and opec which has for the past 24 months been extremely successful at rebalancing the global market following the largest demand dislocation in living memory that was triggered by the pandemic while opec has stayed the course on volumes saudi arabia continues to take advantage of the tightening market by raising its official selling prices osps saudi aramco raised its osp across the board for may loading with barrels going to asia seeing the widest increases of up to 4 40 per barrel russian crude export flows there are robust signals that russian crude exports have been holding up so far but with unknown destinations these barrels could end up increasing floating storage levels if they don t eventually find a buyer other options include higher exports to india and above all china if these two countries decide to trade off risks of being sanctioned by the us against the benefits of russian urals steep discount the last option for russian crude exports would be crude blending in order to make its origin less clear nevertheless the eu on tuesday edged closer to banning russia s oil imports which would result in a major structural shift in crude flows from europe to asia as europe has been a major destination of russian oil

federal reserve officials are signaling that they will take an aggressive approach to fight high inflation in the coming months actions that will make borrowing sharply more expensive for consumers and businesses and heighten risks to the economy in minutes from their march policy meeting released wednesday fed officials said that half point interest rate hikes rather than traditional quarter point increases could be appropriate multiple times this year at last month s meeting many of the fed s policymakers favored a half point increase the minutes said but held off then because of the uncertainties created by russia s invasion of ukraine instead the fed raised its key short term rate by a quarter point and signaled that it planned to continue raising rates well into next year inflation rose 7 9 in february 2022 the the biggest rise in the consumer price index in 40 years the labor department reported but what exactly is inflation and what is causing it get south florida local news weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc south florida newsletters the minutes said the fed is also moving toward rapidly shrinking its huge 9 trillion stockpile of bonds in the coming months a move that would contribute to higher borrowing costs the policymakers said they would likely cut those holdings by about 95 billion a month nearly double the pace they implemented five years ago when they last shrank their balance sheet the plan to quickly draw down their bond holdings marks the latest move by fed officials to accelerate their inflation fighting efforts prices are surging at the fastest pace in four decades and officials have expressed increasing concern about inflation the fed s plans reflect their great discomfort with the rapid pace of inflation said kathy bostjancic chief u s financial economist at oxford economics the fed is increasingly worried that consumers and businesses will start expecting price surges to persist bostjancic added a trend that can itself prolong high inflation many economists have said they worry the fed has waited too long to start raising rates and could be forced to respond so aggressively as to trigger a recession indeed economists at deutsche bank predict that the economy will tumble into a recession late next year noting that the fed finding itself now well behind the curve has given clear signals that it is shifting to a more aggressive tightening mode the stock market sold off when the minutes were released but later rebounded from its worst levels still the s p 500 index closed down nearly 1 after a sharp drop on tuesday markets now expect much steeper rate hikes this year than fed officials had signaled as recently as their meeting in mid march at that meeting the policymakers projected that their benchmark rate would remain below 2 by the end of this year and 2 8 at the end of 2023 up from its current level below 0 5 but wall street now foresees the fed s rate reaching 2 6 by year s end with further hikes next year higher fed rates will in turn heighten costs for mortgages auto loans credit cards and corporate loans in this way the fed hopes to cool economic growth and rising wages enough to tame high inflation which has caused hardships for millions of households and poses a severe political threat to president joe biden chair jerome powell opened the door two weeks ago to increasing rates by as much as a half point lael brainard a key member of the fed s board of governors and other officials have also made clear they envision such sharp increases most economists now expect the fed to raise rates by a half point at both its may and june meetings in a speech tuesday brainard underscored the fed s increasing aggressiveness by saying its bond holdings will shrink considerably more rapidly over a much shorter period than the last time it reduced its balance sheet from 2017 2019 at that time the balance sheet was about 4 5 trillion now it s twice as large federal reserve chairman jerome powell took questions from lawmakers on wednesday after the pandemic hammered the economy two years ago the fed bought trillions in treasury and mortgage bonds with the goal of lowering longer term loan rates it also cut its short term benchmark rate to near zero as a sign of how fast the fed is reversing course the last time the fed bought bonds there was a three year gap between when it stopped its purchases in 2014 and when it began reducing the balance sheet in 2017 now that shift is likely to happen in as few three months or less with the reduction in the balance sheet likely to be announced as early as may brainard s remarks caused a sharp rise in the rate on the 10 year treasury note which influences mortgage rates business loans and other borrowing costs on wednesday that rate reached 2 6 up from 2 3 a week earlier and 1 7 a month ago average mortgage rates have leapt higher reaching 4 67 last week according to mortgage buyer freddie mac the highest since 2018 shorter term bond yields have jumped more in some cases to above the 10 year yield a pattern that has often been taken as a sign of an impending recession fed officials say however that shorter term bond market trends aren t flashing the same warning signals gennadiy goldberg senior u s rates strategist at td securities said the narrow gap between longer and shorter term bond yields indicates that investors think the economy will slow enough in the next two years to force the fed to scale back its rate hikes to shrink its balance sheet the fed will let some of its bonds mature without reinvesting the proceeds what impact this might have is uncertain powell said last month that the reduction in bond holdings would be equivalent to another rate hike economists estimate that reducing the balance sheet by 1 trillion a year would be equal to anywhere from one to three additional quarter point increases in the fed s benchmark short term rate each year treasury secretary janet yellen who preceded powell as fed chair suggested at a congressional hearing wednesday that russia s invasion of ukraine would likely keep escalating inflation in the coming months the sanctions we ve placed on russia are pushing up the price of energy yellen said when energy prices are going up the price of wheat and corn that russia and ukraine produce are going up and metals that play an important industrial role are going up

was a three year gap between when it stopped its purchases in 2014 and when it began reducing the balance sheet in 2017 now that shift is likely to happen in as few as three months brainard s remarks caused a sharp rise in the interest rate on the 10 year treasury note a key rate that influences mortgage rates business loans and other borrowing costs on wednesday that rate reached 2 6 up from 2 3 just a week earlier a sharp increase for that rate a month ago it was just 1 7 shorter term bond yields have jumped even higher in some cases to above the 10 year yield a pattern that has in the past been seen as a sign of an impending recession fed officials say however that shorter term bond market trends aren t flashing the same warning signals the fed will reduce its balance sheet by allowing some of its treasurys and mortgage backed securities to mature without reinvesting the proceeds which it has done for the past two years what kind of impact this will have on interest rates is highly uncertain powell said at a news conference after last month s meeting that the reduction in bond holdings would be equivalent to another rate hike economists estimate that reducing the fed s balance sheet by 1 trillion a year would be equal to anywhere from one to three additional quarter point increases in the fed s benchmark short term rate treasury secretary janet yellen who preceded powell as fed chair suggested during a congressional hearing wednesday that russia s invasion of ukraine would likely keep escalating inflation in the coming months
fed officials said that half point interest rate hikes rather than traditional quarter point increase could be appropriate multiple times this year washington federal reserve officials are signaling that they will take an aggressive approach to fighting high inflation in the coming months actions that will make borrowing sharply more expensive for consumers and businesses and heighten risks to the economy in minutes from their policy meeting three weeks ago released wednesday fed officials said that half point interest rate hikes rather than traditional quarter point increase could be appropriate multiple times this year at last month s meeting many of the fed policymakers favored a half point increase the minutes said but held off then because of the uncertainties created by russia s invasion of ukraine instead the fed raised its key short term rate by a quarter point and signaled that it planned to continue raising rates well into next year the minutes said the fed is also moving closer to rapidly shrinking its huge 9 trillion stockpile of bonds in the coming months a move that would contribute to higher borrowing costs the policymakers said they would likely cut their holdings by about 95 billion a month nearly double the pace they implemented five years ago when they last shrank their balance sheet the plan to quickly draw down their bond holdings marks the latest move by fed officials to accelerate their inflation fighting efforts prices are surging at the fastest pace in four decades and officials in recent speeches have expressed increasing concern about getting inflation under control many economists have said they worry that the fed has waited too long to start raising rates and could be forced to respond so aggressively as to trigger a recession indeed economists at deutsche bank predict that the economy will tumble into a recession late next year noting that the fed finding itself now well behind the curve has given clear signals that it is shifting to a more aggressive tightening mode the stock market sold off when the minutes were released wednesday but later recovered most of its losses still the s p 500 was down nearly 0 8 in afternoon trading after a sharp drop on tuesday financial markets now expect much steeper rate hikes this year than fed officials had signaled as recently as their meeting in mid march just three weeks ago the policymakers projected that the fed s benchmark rate would remain below 2 by the end of this year and 2 8 at the end of 2023 up from its current level below 0 5 but wall street now forecasts that the fed s rate will reach 2 6 by year s end with further rate hikes next year that would require three half point increases this year higher rates from the fed will heighten borrowing costs for mortgages auto loans credit cards and corporate loans by doing so the fed hopes to cool economic growth and rising wages enough to rein in high inflation which has caused hardships for millions of households and poses a severe political threat to president joe biden chair jerome powell opened the door two weeks ago to increasing rates by as much as a half point at upcoming meetings rather than by a traditional quarter point the fed hasn t carried out any half point rate increases since 2000 lael brainard a key member of the fed s board of governors and other officials have also made clear that they envision such sharp increases most economists now expect the fed to raise rates by a half point at both its may and june meetings in a speech tuesday brainard underscored the fed s increasing aggressiveness by saying that the central bank s bond holdings will shrink considerably more rapidly over a much shorter period than the last time the fed reduced its balance sheet from 2017 2019 at that time the balance sheet was about 4 5 trillion now it s twice as large after the pandemic hammered the economy two years ago the fed bought trillions in treasury and mortgage bonds with the goal of lowering longer term borrowing rates it also cut its short term benchmark rate to near zero as a sign of how fast the fed is reversing course the last time the fed bought bonds there

investorplace stock market news stock advice trading tips hycroft mining hymc harmony gold mining hmy kinross gold kgc b2gold btg platinum group metals plg avino silver gold mines asm nornickel nilsy source shutterstock with the fear trade surging higher these days investors will do well to consider precious metal mining firms true the underlying assets are simply commodities at the end of the day however because of their intrinsic worth and long history of representing stores of value nothing shines quite like gold during periods of turmoil but could the same cynical benefit apply to gold penny stocks let s get down to it prospective participants of gold penny stocks must gird themselves for the possibility of incredible volatility just because relevance is on tap doesn t mean that these specific ideas will jump higher at the same time being completely risk averse can be the riskiest decision of all because it denies you robust upside opportunities therefore take a measured approach congruent with your risk tolerance profile still the one factor that could really drive up gold penny stocks is the expansion of the money stock if you think about it the fundamental nature of our economy didn t change under the new normal used cars didn t become intrinsically more valuable nor did residential units what did change was the amount of money printed into existence thus causing myriad reactions since the federal reserve seems reluctant in raising benchmark interest rates too fast too soon the money stock issue might not be addressed for a while while that hurts the american people in the long run it could help lift these gold penny stocks to buy hycroft mining 2 04harmony gold mining 4 77kinross gold 5 82b2gold 4 58platinum group metals 2 06avino silver gold mines 89 centsnornickel 3 02 hycroft mining hymc source aerogondo2 shutterstock com it s in the news so we ve got to talk about it recently cineplex operator amc entertainment nyse amc made what wedbush securities analyst michael pachter decried as an idiotic and embarrassingly stupid decision the company acquired a significant amount of equity in hycroft mining nasdaq hymc according to pachter he doesn t necessarily view buying gold penny stocks as a silly move rather he means that it s inappropriate for a movie theater company to step so far out of their core business and into some completely unrelated business that will not drive any traffic to their theaters in a phone interview with the verge be that as it may hymc stock has been a clear beneficiary of the decision however you feel about it up 235 on a year to date basis it s one of the top performing gold penny stocks to buy but given the fundamental reason for pivoting to precious metals fear trade hymc is worth consideration with speculative funds harmony gold mining hmy source allstars shutterstock com although harmony gold mining nyse hmy doesn t have the notoriety of gold penny stocks like hycroft it s still a solid performer up nearly 15 ytd while it shouldn t form the bulk of the basis for your investing decision hmy appears to have formed a bullish consolidation pattern since the beginning of march this year if so the consolidation could end up to the upside given the cynically robust backdrop not surprisingly hmy began picking up serious momentum following russia s dangerous decision to invade neighboring ukraine with war at the doorsteps of western europe concerns ring sharply about geopolitical instability that s part of the reason why harmony is in the news with most of its projects located in resource rich south africa the mining firm represents an indirect hedge against further international volatility hmy isn t all technical news either in its fiscal year ended june 30 2021 harmony generated sales of 2 8 billion atop net income of 346 million in the prior year harmony suffered a net loss of 60 million kinross gold kgc source shutterstock one of the more intriguing gold penny stocks available for trading kinross gold nyse kgc managed to catch the attention of the wall street journal the reason it reported that the mining firm was nearing the sale of its arctic russian mine to fortiana holdings if approved it could represent the first sale of a western company s assets in russia since the kremlin s decision to attack ukraine on paper the decision appears to be a huge blow to kinross among gold penny stocks or just gold miners in general kinross is the only large western mining firm with a presence in russia of course russia is a massive resource hub so the impact cannot be ignored nevertheless wall street seems to approve of the divesture with kgc stock up nearly 6 over the trailing month true the sale must hurt but at the same time if you have a longer term outlook the move is both necessary and potentially lucrative basically kinross won t be exposed to russia which has proven geopolitical unpalatable thus kgc can move forward without distractions b2gold btg source shutterstock though b2gold nyseamerican btg features a speculative profile the mining firm has been on the move gaining nearly 16 ytd an international gold producer leveraging its low cost profile btg has always been attractive as a gamble on the fear trade but its exposure to relatively stable jurisdictions commands a premium under the circumstances obviously russia dominates headlines here and abroad because of the constant exposure it s tempting to view the bullish thesis of geopolitical stability as a mundane factor however as boeing nyse ba demonstrated reducing exposure to pugnacious administrations may facilitate longer term tailwinds while boeing reduced its building materials dependency on russia its rivals did not follow suit now boeing competitors find themselves behind the 8 ball similarly b2gold is well positioned in that it doesn t have to worry constantly about looking over it shoulder compared to gold penny stocks that are tied to questionable projects obviously this dynamic is no guarantee of future upside but when you re dealing with speculative trades every advantage counts platinum group metals plg source corlaffra shutterstock com an enticing idea among gold penny stocks platinum group metals nyseamerican plg operates the waterberg project an underground deposit located in south africa according to the company s website waterberg features an attractive risk profile given its shallow nature the project facilitates fully mechanised production with the potential to have amongst the lowest operating costs in the pgm sector because we re talking about gold penny stocks i must point out that geological experts estimate a significant gold reserve in the underlying project but admittedly the main focus with plg stock is platinum and palladium both metals are incredibly rare likely rarer than gold with russia dominating the latter s production therefore plg could be a geopolitically significant company coincidentally waterberg represents a joint venture between several international companies further if the firm achieves its large scale production goals platinum group metals could veritably skyrocket it s risky but it s one to watch among gold penny stocks avino silver gold mines asm source coldmoon photoproject shutterstock com long a risky name even compared to other gold penny stocks avino silver gold mines nyseamerican asm shed over 50 of its market value during the trailing five years obviously that doesn t do much for confidence however in the trailing three months asm seems to have found momentum gaining over 10 is this the narrative we can finally believe in for avino while the volatility risk for asm is no joke the underlying company has enjoyed a burst of relevance in addition to mining the namesake assets avino also features exposure to copper mining and exploration initiatives moving forward this industrial metal will likely command a premium for its myriad applications perhaps most notably copper is vital to electric vehicles with crude oil prices skyrocketing the price of gasoline many people are looking to evs as a viable cost effective alternative to personal transportation therefore you can buy asm for the fear trade and for the future of mobility nornickel nilsy source shutterstock easily the most controversial name on this list of gold penny stocks russia s nornickel otcmkts nilsy is not an investment for everybody indeed you probably need to be an agnostic speculator someone who only focuses on profit and not on esg environmental social and governance concerns i m not here to judge though i m just here to present ideas if you can divorce nornickel from the underlying politics nilsy does seem like an attractive gamble just a few days prior to the violence nilsy was trading hands in the upper 20 range suddenly right as the russian stock market went dark due in part to blistering sanctions nilsy dropped to a staggeringly low 3 well two pennies above 3 to be exact though russia partially reopened its market for trading the fate of nornickel and other high profile russian stocks remains to be seen but should you be able to acquire nilsy for single digit prices you ve got to imagine that over the long run it should rise higher on penny stocks and low volume stocks with only the rarest exceptions investorplace does not publish

fed officials said that half point interest rate hikes rather than traditional quarter point increase could be appropriate multiple times this year washington federal reserve officials are signaling that they will take an aggressive approach to fighting high inflation in the coming months actions that will make borrowing sharply more expensive for consumers and businesses and heighten risks to the economy in minutes from their policy meeting three weeks ago released wednesday fed officials said that half point interest rate hikes rather than traditional quarter point increase could be appropriate multiple times this year at last month s meeting many of the fed policymakers favored a half point increase the minutes said but held off then because of the uncertainties created by russia s invasion of ukraine instead the fed raised its key short term rate by a quarter point and signaled that it planned to continue raising rates well into next year the minutes said the fed is also moving closer to rapidly shrinking its huge 9 trillion stockpile of bonds in the coming months a move that would contribute to higher borrowing costs the policymakers said they would likely cut their holdings by about 95 billion a month nearly double the pace they implemented five years ago when they last shrank their balance sheet the plan to quickly draw down their bond holdings marks the

russia s invasion of ukraine instead the fed raised its key short term rate by a quarter point and signaled that it planned to continue raising rates well into next year the minutes said the fed is also moving closer to rapidly shrinking its huge 9 trillion stockpile of bonds in the coming months a move that would contribute to higher borrowing costs the policymakers said they would likely cut

the european union seems to be warming to the idea of direct sanctions on russia s energy industry slapping a ban on imports of coal for starters the united states is releasing 180 million barrels of crude and several iea members are releasing another 60 million barrels and saudi arabia just hiked its prices for all buyers much higher oil prices may be around the corner when a few months ago analysts were seemingly trying to out forecast each other on crude oil prices the most commonly cited bullish factors were opec s unwillingness to boost production by more than originally agreed while demand for oil continued strong now all the news appears to be on the war in ukraine and the main bullish factor for oil is the expected continued decline in russian oil exports the country is the largest exporter of crude oil and oil products and a big supplier to the european union which explains the eu s reluctance to directly target its energy industry yet pressure is growing on brussels to do just that and with coal already on the sanction list it s probably only a matter of time before oil becomes a target too when this happens brent may well top 120 and stay there in the meantime the united states has publicly stated it had banned all russian oil and fuel imports but in fact the ban is only coming into effect on april 22 and in the meantime the u s is stocking up on russian oil and products per data from the energy information administration in the week to march 25 the u s imported an average of 100 000 barrels of russian oil and fuels up from 70 000 bpd in the previous week and zero barrels daily a month earlier while all this was happening oil prices dipped after the announcement of the u s spr release with west texas intermediate even falling below 100 per barrel yet the dip was only a brief one and prices are once again above 100 as fundamentals reassert themselves after the initial market reaction to the biden administration s decision for the reserve release now prices are likely to continue climbing just like they did after the first biden spr release last year again in an attempt to put a lid on retail fuel prices at the time prices reacted with a dip immediately after the news and then rebounded as emotions gave way to facts these included the one that oil grades to be released from the reserve were not the ones refiners needed to boost their fuel production and the one that a reserve release can only provide temporary relief at the pump without actually fixing the supply problem now the release is massive in comparison to the first one it would amount to 1 million bpd over a period of six months theoretically this would cover a third of the russian oil export dip as predicted by the iea in practice traders have probably already started to worry about how the administration will replenish the spr after the release and what that would do to oil prices related does china s friendship with russia really have no limits meanwhile in europe coal prices jumped following the news of a coal import ban on russia with european commission president ursula von der leyen saying we will impose an import ban on coal from russia worth 4 billion euros 4 39 billion per year this will cut another important revenue source for russia sadly it will also raise energy costs for european further heating up the debate about who are anti russian sanctions actually hurting more russia or the eu the european union imports 45 percent of the coal it uses from russia according to european commission data that s 45 percent of coal imports it will now need to replace because cutting coal use sharply is simply not an option incidentally indonesia which is the world s largest coal exporter hiked its april delivery prices by as much as 42 percent this sounds quite similar to what saudi arabia did with its oil prices and likely means the same thing buyers have fewer options now it s a sellers market but coal prices are set to rise further because russia supplies as much as 70 percent of europe s thermal coal the sort used for power generation and heating and to make things more interesting global stocks of thermal coal are tight according to rystad energy what does this mean for oil based on what we saw with gas and coal prices in europe last year the prices of all fossil fuels are linked when one becomes prohibitively expensive demand for the others rises that s why coal prices soared last year in fact as utilities turned from gas to coal in search of a more affordable source of energy advertisement in this situation the normal rule of the cure for higher oil prices being even higher oil prices does not really apply at least not completely energy demand is hard to kill regardless of costs especially in places like the european union where people have lived in complete energy comfort and security for several generations oil prices will likely rise after the eu s ban on russian coal and if the eu decides to go further and target oil itself things could get really interesting on the price front and on the streets of european cities by irina slav for oilprice com more top reads from oilprice

that they will take an aggressive approach to fighting high inflation in the coming months actions that will make borrowing sharply more expensive for consumers and businesses and heighten risks to the economy in minutes from their policy meeting three weeks ago released wednesday fed officials said that half point interest rate hikes rather than traditional quarter point increase could be

russia s invasion of ukraine instead the fed raised its key short term rate by a quarter point and signaled that it planned to continue raising rates well into next year the minutes said the fed is

their holdings by about 95 billion a month nearly double the pace they implemented five years ago when they last shrank their balance sheet the plan to quickly draw down their bond holdings marks the latest move by fed officials to accelerate their inflation fighting efforts prices are surging at the fastest pace in four decades and officials in recent speeches have expressed increasing concern about getting inflation under control many economists have said they worry that the fed has waited too long to start raising rates and could be forced to respond so aggressively as to trigger a recession indeed economists at deutsche bank predict that the economy will tumble into a recession late next year noting that the fed finding itself now well behind the curve has given clear signals that it is shifting to a more aggressive tightening mode the stock market sold off when the minutes were released wednesday but later recovered most of its losses still the s p 500 was down nearly 0 8 in afternoon trading after a sharp drop on tuesday financial markets now expect much steeper rate hikes this year than fed officials had signaled as recently as their meeting in mid march just three weeks ago the policymakers projected that the fed s benchmark rate would remain below 2 by the end of this year and 2 8 at the end of 2023 up from its current level below 0 5 but wall street now forecasts that the fed s rate will reach 2 6 by year s end with further rate hikes next year that would require three half point increases this year higher rates from the fed will heighten borrowing costs for mortgages auto loans credit cards and corporate loans by doing so the fed hopes to cool economic growth and rising wages enough to rein in high inflation which has caused hardships for millions of households and poses a severe political threat to president joe biden chair jerome powell opened the door two weeks ago to increasing rates by as much as a half point at upcoming meetings rather than by a traditional quarter point the fed hasn t carried out any half point rate increases since 2000 lael brainard a key member of the fed s board of governors and other officials have also made clear that they envision such sharp increases most economists now expect the fed to raise rates by a half point at both its may and june meetings in a speech tuesday brainard underscored the fed s increasing aggressiveness by saying that the central bank s bond holdings will shrink considerably more rapidly over a much shorter period than the last time the fed reduced its balance sheet from 2017 2019 at that time the balance sheet was about 4 5 trillion now it s twice as large after the pandemic hammered the economy two years ago the fed bought trillions in treasury and mortgage bonds with the goal of lowering longer term borrowing rates it also cut its short term benchmark rate to near zero as a sign of how fast the fed is reversing course the last time the fed bought bonds there was a three year gap between when it stopped its purchases in 2014 and when it began reducing the balance sheet in 2017 now that shift is likely to happen in as few as three months brainard s remarks caused a sharp rise in the interest rate on the 10 year treasury note a key rate that influences mortgage rates business loans and other borrowing costs on wednesday that rate reached 2 6 up from 2 3 just a week earlier a sharp increase for that rate a month ago it was just 1 7 shorter term bond yields have jumped even higher in some cases to above the 10 year yield a pattern that has in the past been seen as a sign of an impending recession fed officials say however that shorter term bond market trends aren t flashing the same warning signals the fed will reduce its balance sheet by allowing some of its treasurys and mortgage backed securities to mature without reinvesting the proceeds which it has done for the past two years what kind of impact this will have on interest rates is highly uncertain powell said at a news conference after last month s meeting that the reduction in bond holdings would be equivalent to another rate hike economists estimate that reducing the fed s balance

the market reaction to the fed minutes was fairly muted with wall street s benchmark s p 500 index falling 1 per cent taking its decline over the past few days to 2 3 per cent the consensus of economists and analysts is that the fed minutes were largely as expected albeit with the quantitative tightening program outlined a bit bigger than some had expected but it s hard to avoid the impression the fed is working hard to make the market believe it is serious about tackling inflation huge reversal a speech a day earlier by lael brainard one of the fed s more dovish governors equated the scourge of inflation to being unemployed given how fixated the fed has been on rebuilding the labour market after the pandemic that was rightly interpreted as a decidedly hawkish turn the one two punch of brainard and the fed seems calculated to have tried to put a chill down the spine of investors advertisement the rally on equity markets in recent weeks does nothing to help the fed s cause of taking heat out of the economy and getting inflation down instead the rally means financial conditions have actually eased in recent weeks the opposite of what powell is hoping for so while many investors believe in the idea of the fed put that the fed will always protect markets from big falls it does feel like powell and his colleagues would be happy to engineer a fed call just now perhaps the spectre of quantitative tightening will help there while the initial reaction has been minor observers including credit suisse s global head of equities andrew gairthwaite to jp morgan ceo jamie dimon have previously flagged quantitative tightening as a risk the market might be underestimating the fed made all the right noises in its minutes about implementing its policy gradually but the fact is this is a huge reversal in a relatively short period of time the fed is going from buying us120 billion of bonds a month or as bank of america s michael hartnett frames it buying us800 million of assets every hour of every day since the outbreak of covid 19 to reducing its balance sheet by us95 billion a month advertisement the scale of qt is not something markets have experienced before the last time the fed started to shrink its balance sheet it did so at about half the monthly rate it has now flagged and us inflation was much lower and unemployment much higher than it is now two possible impacts of qt there are two possible impacts of qt that investors should watch the first is a tightening of financial conditions some see the qt plans as equivalent to one quarter percentage point increase deutsche bank which forecasts a 1 9 trillion balance sheet run off between now and the end of 2023 is worth four 25 basis point increases the tightening of financial conditions means lower equity prices wider credit spreads and higher interest rates says ron temple head of us equities and co head of multi asset at lazard asset management in new york long duration assets such as tech stocks should notionally be under particular pressure as shown by wednesday night s 2 2 per cent fall in the nasdaq composite index the second big implication of qt according to bank of america s hartnett is that volatility is no longer anchored advertisement the fed s extraordinarily easy monetary policy settings obviously sparked epic asset price inflation in the past decade but quantitative easing which saw the fed act as the bigger buyer in many markets also had the effect of dampening volatility across asset classes including equities as former hedge fund manager jesse felder wrote on wednesday night the suppression of volatility engineered by the fed might be about to come back to bite investors it s possible that fed policy over the past decade rather than destroying risk has only managed to shift risks into the future now that rapidly rising inflation makes the continuation of the program untenable those risks could now finally materialise in a way we haven t seen as of yet at the very least it could mean that volatility in the stock market could be elevated for the foreseeable future investors need to ask themselves with equity valuations still near record levels do the possible impacts of qt tighter conditions higher rates more volatility really feel like they are priced in as christopher alwine head of credit at vanguard fixed income group told bloomberg the history of the fed is that they tend to tighten till something breaks

the federal reserve building in washington on march 16 2022 saul loeb afp via getty images the federal reserve plans to shrink the balance sheet by 95 billion a month minutes from the march federal open market committee fomc policy meeting revealed pdf minutes released on wednesday show that committee members generally agreed on a cap of 60 billion in treasury securities and 35 billion in mortgage backed securities that would be cut from the balance sheet the central bank plans to phase this in over three months fed officials averred that trimming the balance sheet would emphasize the institution s firm stance on monetary policy noting that it would be appropriate to initiate this campaign at a future meeting possibly as early as the may meeting many participants note that they would have preferred a 50 basis point rate hike in the target range for the benchmark fed funds rate they also stated that they would like to see at least one half point increase at future meetings particularly if inflation pressures remain high or intensify others also alluded to the broad array of risks to the economic outlook including russia s invasion of ukraine surging energy costs and global tightening efforts by central banks overall the minutes spotlighted uncertainty surrounding sky high inflation and the myriad of risks associated with this current environment many participants noted that with inflation well above the committee s objective inflationary risks to the upside and the federal funds rate well below participants estimates of its longer run level they would have preferred a 50 basis point increase in the target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting the minutes stated financial markets added to their losses following the minutes with the dow jones industrial average sliding 270 points and the nasdaq composite index falling below 14 000 the treasury market was mostly in positive territory with the benchmark 10 year yield up 0 059 percent to 2 613 percent the u s dollar index dxy which gauges the greenback against a basket of currencies was up 0 1 percent at 99 57 aggressive tightening this week multiple fed officials have been suggesting more aggressive policy measures sending jitters throughout the financial markets fed governor lael brainard wrote in a speech for a minneapolis fed bank discussion that the central bank needs to engage in more aggressive and faster tightening to drive down inflation as part of these policy efforts brainard suggested a quicker reduction in the more than 9 trillion balance sheet and additional rate hikes this could indicate that the institution could move on hikes greater than 25 basis points currently inflation is much too high and is subject to upside risks the committee is prepared to take stronger action if indicators of inflation and inflation expectations indicate that such action is warranted brainard said the will continue tightening monetary policy methodically through a series of interest rate increases and by starting to reduce the balance sheet at a rapid pace as soon as our may meeting brainard added that she anticipates the balance sheet will shrink more rapidly compared to previous economic recoveries philadelphia fed bank president patrick harker revealed that he is acutely concerned about inflation running far too high harker mirrored brainard s remarks telling the delaware state chamber of commerce that he thinks a series of deliberate methodical hikes as the year continues and the data evolve the bottom line is that generous fiscal policies supply chain disruptions and accommodative monetary policy have pushed inflation far higher than i and my colleagues on the fomc are comfortable with he stated i m also worried that inflation expectations could become unmoored mary daly the president of the san francisco fed bank was blunt when she asserted that inflation is as harmful as not having a job she refrained from speculating how quickly the institution could respond to rampant price inflation daly noted that she thinks they will lead to widespread effects such as making it more challenging to finance a car or a business i understand that inflation is as harmful as not having a job that if you have a job and you can t pay your bills or i feel like i can t save for what i need to do then that s keeping you up at night she told a presentation hosted by the native american finance officers association and our goal is to make sure that people don t stay up worrying about whether their dollar today will be the same and worth a dollar tomorrow rbc wealth management is projecting 50 basis point hikes in may and june followed by a quarter point increase at each meeting in the second half of 2022 while we agree with the fomc s near term inflation outlook our forecast assumes headline and core cpi will only slow to 4 5 by the 2022 we think headline inflation will slow toward 2 next year as supply chain bottlenecks improve

the unemployment rate hitting 5 percent in 2024 we no longer see the fed achieving a soft landing instead we anticipate that a more aggressive tightening of monetary policy will push the economy into a recession bank economists wrote in the report it is now clear that price stability is likely to only be achieved through a restrictive monetary policy stance that meaningfully dents demand in a note on wednesday merk research says the odds of an economic downturn over the next 12 months is roughly 33 percent matching goldman sachs recent estimate but this does not mean a soft landing is out of reach for the federal reserve the labor market is showing no signs of slowdown so far said nick reece a portfolio manager at merk in a note the most positive development would be a bigger increase in the labor force participation rate in other words an accelerated return of the supply side would be both pro growth and disinflationary and would help the fed achieve a soft landing the latest atlanta

fed officials said that half point interest rate hikes rather than traditional quarter point increase could be appropriate multiple times this year washington federal reserve officials are signaling that they will take an aggressive approach to fighting high inflation in the coming months actions that will make borrowing sharply more expensive for consumers and businesses and heighten risks to the economy in minutes from their policy meeting three weeks ago released wednesday fed officials said that half point interest rate hikes rather than traditional quarter point increase could be appropriate multiple times this year at last month s meeting many of the fed policymakers favored a half point increase the minutes said but held off then because of the uncertainties created by russia s invasion of ukraine instead the fed raised its key short term rate by a quarter point and signaled that it planned to continue raising rates well into next year the minutes said the fed is also moving closer to rapidly shrinking its huge 9 trillion stockpile of bonds in the coming months a move that would contribute to higher borrowing costs the policymakers said they would likely cut their holdings by about 95 billion a month nearly double the pace they implemented five years ago when they last shrank their balance sheet the plan to quickly draw down their bond holdings marks the latest move by fed officials to accelerate their inflation fighting efforts prices are surging at the fastest pace in four decades and officials in recent speeches have expressed increasing concern about getting inflation under control many economists have said they worry that the fed has waited too long to start raising rates and could be forced to respond so aggressively as to trigger a recession indeed economists at deutsche bank predict that the economy will tumble into a recession late next year noting that the fed finding itself now well behind the curve has given clear signals that it is shifting to a more aggressive tightening mode the stock market sold off when the minutes were released wednesday but later recovered most of its losses still the s p 500 was down nearly 0 8 in afternoon trading after a sharp drop on tuesday financial markets now expect much steeper rate hikes this year than fed officials had signaled as recently as their meeting in mid march just three weeks ago the policymakers projected that the fed s benchmark rate would remain below 2 by the end of this year and 2 8 at the end of 2023 up from its current level below 0 5 but wall street now forecasts that the fed s rate will reach 2 6 by year s end with further rate hikes next year that would require three half point increases this year higher rates from the fed will heighten borrowing costs for mortgages auto loans credit cards and corporate loans by doing so the fed hopes to cool economic growth and rising wages enough to rein in high inflation which has caused hardships for millions of households and poses a severe political threat to president joe biden chair jerome powell opened the door two weeks ago to increasing rates by as much as a half point at upcoming meetings rather than by a traditional quarter point the fed hasn t carried out any half point rate increases since 2000 lael brainard a key member of the fed s board of governors and other officials have also made clear that they envision such sharp increases most economists now expect the fed to raise rates by a half point at both its may and june meetings in a speech tuesday brainard underscored the fed s increasing aggressiveness by saying that the central bank s bond holdings will shrink considerably more rapidly over a much shorter period than the last time the fed reduced its balance sheet from 2017 2019 at that time the balance sheet was about 4 5 trillion now it s twice as large after the pandemic hammered the economy two years ago the fed bought trillions in treasury and mortgage bonds with the goal of lowering longer term borrowing rates it also cut its short term benchmark rate to near zero as a sign of how fast the fed is reversing course the last time the fed bought bonds there was a three year gap between when it stopped its purchases in 2014 and when it began reducing the balance sheet in 2017 now that shift is likely to happen in as few as three months brainard s remarks caused a sharp rise in the interest rate on the 10 year treasury note a key rate that influences mortgage rates business loans and other borrowing costs on wednesday that rate reached 2 6 up from 2 3 just a week earlier a sharp increase for that rate a month ago it was just 1 7 shorter term bond yields have jumped even higher in some cases to above the 10 year yield a pattern that has in the past been seen as a sign of an impending recession fed officials say however that shorter term bond market trends aren t flashing the same warning signals the fed will reduce its balance sheet by allowing some of its treasurys and mortgage backed securities to mature without reinvesting the proceeds which it has done for the past two years what kind of impact this will have on interest rates is highly uncertain powell said at a news conference after last month s meeting that the reduction in bond holdings would be equivalent to another rate hike economists estimate that reducing the fed s balance sheet by 1 trillion a year would be equal to anywhere from one to three additional quarter point increases in the fed s benchmark short term rate treasury secretary janet yellen who preceded powell as

editors note this column is part of the vox debate on the economic consequences of war the sudden russian invasion of ukraine generated an upward shift in various risks around the globe ranging from rising food prices and their impact on poverty and inequalities artuc et al 2022 to permanent adjustments in global supply chains korn and stemmler 2022 it turns out that many financial variables also reacted sharply soon after the beginning of the war monitoring changes in financial stress provides valuable information on the contribution of the financial sector to current economic risks in this respect adrian et al 2019 have proposed a quarterly growth at risk gar approach enabling the assessment of macroeconomic risks based on financial conditions indexes recently we put forward in a paper an extended version of the quarterly gar by accounting for the high frequency nature of financial conditions indicators ferrara et al 2022 specifically we use bayesian mixed data sampling midas quantile regressions to exploit the information content of a financial stress index leading to real time high frequency gar measures for the euro area this high frequency approach allows us to rapidly quantify macro risks related to the war in ukraine financial stress in the euro area the financial stress indicator that we consider is the composite indicator of systemic stress ciss developed by the ecb holló et al 2012 the main methodological innovation of the ciss is the application of basic portfolio theory to the aggregation of five market specific sub indexes the foreign exchange market the equity market the money market the bond market and the financial intermediaries the aggregation takes into account time varying cross correlations between the five sub indexes as a result the ciss puts relatively more weight on situations in which stress prevails in several market segments at the same time thus it captures the idea that financial stress is more systemic and thus more dangerous for the economy as a whole if financial instability spreads more widely across the whole financial system the daily evolution of the euro area ciss until 28 march 2022 is presented in figure 1 we observed a sharp increase in the euro area index just after the russian invasion of ukraine on 24 february in mid march 2022 the index reached a value close to 0 45 before receding slightly in the following days however the value of financial stress stays below that observed at the beginning of the covid 19 crisis in 2020 and in any case far from that observed during the global crisis or the euro area sovereign debt crisis luckily the ecb recently put forward a new ciss measure for the us allowing us to compare both economies on a similar basis it is striking to see in figure 1 that the us does not seem to have been strongly affected by financial stress at least so far figure 1 composite indicator of systemic stress for the euro area and the us note ciss for the euro area changing composition and ciss data for the us are provided by the european central bank daily data until 28 march 2022 macroeconomic risks in the euro area based on this ciss we recently proposed a new econometric approach to assess on a high frequency basis a gar measure for the current euro area quarterly gdp growth ferrara et al 2022 the idea of our approach is to extend the gar originally put forward by adrian et al 2019 by taking advantage of the high frequency nature of financial conditions indexes to this end we developed a bayesian mixed frequency quantile regression model in order to gauge risks to gdp growth for the current quarter stemming from daily financial conditions results are presented in the form of a conditional distribution for current gdp growth nowcasting from which conditional quantiles can be derived interestingly this exercise can be carried out on a daily basis that is each time we get an update of the ciss providing us with high frequency monitoring of macro risks results from an updated version of our model are given in figure 2 we observe that within a few days the probability density function of conditional euro area gdp growth for 2022q1 clearly shifted to the left the value estimated on 28 march shows a thicker left tail highlighting an increase in downward macro risks in the wake of the start of the war in ukraine as regards the value of the gar at 10 which can be considered as the 10 quantile of this estimated conditional distribution it went from 0 02 on 01 february to 0 90 on 28 march figure 2 probability density functions of conditional euro area gdp growth in 2022q1 note authors computation based on ferrara mogliani sahuc 2022 macroeconomic risks in the us based on the new us ciss measure we also estimated a similar bayesian mixed frequency model for the us economy the probability density functions of conditional us gdp growth for 2022q1 estimated at various dates are presented in figure 3 the shift to the left between 01 february and 28 march is less marked than for the euro area the gar 10 goes from 0 30 on 1 february to 0 03 on 28 march so overall the gar 10 lost only about 0 30 percentate points in the us compared to 0 90 percentate points in the euro area this result suggests that macro risks in the euro area are three times higher compared to those in the us mainly due to higher exposure to russia

article 3 months old international apr 07 2022 the impact of the russian invasion and western sanctions in response is creating a fresh geopolitical segregation with potentially far reaching consequences by danielle ecuyer the 1989 fall of the berlin wall was one of the most seminal moments in history how many of us of a certain age up until that point had feasted on a diet of cold war john le carre fiction such as tinker tailor soldier spy one step away from the reality of real fear generated post wwii from the us soviet cold war we could all breathe again as the anxiety of nuclear warfare faded into annals of history the prospect of open markets and tourism behind the once iron curtain was now possible and globalisation thrived when i worked at baring securities emerging markets specialists in the 1990 s amidst the 300 person trading room floor in london there was a team dedicated to the bric countries of brazil russia india and china these were the growth emerging markets that bankers index providers and global fund managers sought to profit from the possible wealth generation of opening economies and financial markets when the facts change i change my mind what do you do sir john maynard keynes once upon a time declared a new axis of autocracy february 24 2022 the world changed again point out a battery of experts including jonathan pain macro economic commentator and author of the pain report at the march 2022 australian investors association national conference pain outlined his view of a new axis of autocracy that would shape and define decades to come the russian invasion of ukraine is a new geo political reality with far reaching consequences for the world australia and financial markets pain declared some experts have noted the profundity of this event as a shifting of the global and economic tectonic plates simon hunt strategic services describes ukraine as the battleground for how the future of the world will evolve to appreciate the magnitude of the event one need look no further than the global reaction to russia s invasion as the starting point as to how the battle lines are being drawn a first with impact let s start with the united states america in collaboration with the european union and the uk sanctioned not only some of russia s banks through the swift payments system but also the country s central bank with the very real threat of nuclear retaliation if the us or nato entered the war the us instead turned to its financial might rather than military force to strangle the russian economy and the country s ability to trade make no mistake about the enormity of this decision to weaponise the us dollar with one decision the united states rendered 60 of russia s central bank reserves or us 600bn as redundant this meant russia lost the ability to use part of their reserves instrumental to a fully functioning economic financial system in the same way as if our own cash in our bank accounts was frozen the sanctions from the western allies were not unexpected bloomberg reports russia had been de dollarising their reserves for the last five years selling us treasuries as much as us 175bn according to jonathan pain and buying gold instead what was a surprise was the all out sanctioning of the russian central bank thereby creating a precedent for other autocratic nations to take note of unintended consequences every nation state opposed to the western rule of law will now have to consider where they invest and how they hold their reserves here we have a major geopolitical problem that served up a financial response we could argue the rights or wrongs about the western allied response but one takeaway from this action that is without debate is the unintended consequences of escalating an emerging trend that had already been in chain that trend is the gradual but steady building of a euro asian alliance of autocratic states that share the same world view and challenge the western liberal democratic order as described by jonathan pain the two main protagonists are russia and china who have been steadily putting in place the building blocks to diversify away from the hegemony of the us dollar and its financial control on their economies trading and financial systems organisations such as the shanghai cooperative organisation sco founded in 2002 and the eurasian economic union eaeu 2015 are developing a new stage of monetary financial and economic cooperation between the eaeu and the prc global transformation challenges and solutions highlights simon hunt the eurasian group currency is evolving and although the members to date are small the scope to develop an alternative currency which could embrace more commodity trading nations is now on the table this has many experts querying whether we are witnessing the decay of us dollar hegemony the nations to date include china kazakhstan russia tajikistan uzbekistan and kyrgyzstan other countries such as brazil india as well as african and middle east states with an antithetical us stance may well be keen to be part of the evolving alternative currency regime us dollar losing its mojo the decline of us dollar hegemony won t be inevitable says simon hunt goldman sachs concurs with the view that the change in fx markets and the dominance of the us dollar will not change overnight but the tightening of geopolitical financial sanctions may act to accelerate the probability of official de dollarisation efforts which in turn may affect the valuation of the us dollar over time the work of economist barry eichengreen and imf economists published in a report the stealth erosion of dollar dominance noted that a decline in us dollar foreign exchange reserves saw a 25 move into the yuan and the remaining 75 into australian and canadian dollars and the korean won the imf has calculated that the percentage share of us dollar global reserves has declined from 70 in 1998 to 60 at the end of 2021 the euro remains the second largest currency reserve alternatives have increased from 2 to 7 and although china s renminbi has grown from 1 in 2016 the percentage of total reserves remains low at 3 martin wolf at the financial times observed in his piece a new world of currency disorder looms there are several reasons why the us dollar reserve currency status will not be challenged immediately but a paper delivered by the hoover institute as cited by mr wolf highlights that china s development of an alternative payment system to swift and the digital yuan e cny opens up the ability for countries to trade with china outside of the western payment systems and currencies our world is changing on balance the war in ukraine is a conflict that will potentially re shape the future of not only geopolitics but our financial and economic systems whether the audacity of the us and western allies to sanction a central bank will accelerate and further erode the power of the united states and the dominance of the us dollar and globalisation in general remains to be seen however as investors we should all accept our world changed for better or worse on february 24 2022 as martin wolf wrote post the invasion the west must reinforce its defences on all fronts military energy cyber and economic wolf is not alone in his views jonathan pain and simon hunt echo the chorus that the ukraine invasion is much much more than just boots and tanks on the ground the world is now locked in an ideological battleground of what has existed for the last fifty years and how the autocrats in today s world are ready to take back what they felt had been lost the ukraine chapter is not finished but china will be closely watching as the reunification of taiwan remains firmly in xi jinping s

the u s senate approved the sunshine protection act in march 2022 with the goal of making daylight saving time permanent starting in november 2023 if that happens the u s will never again spring forward or fall back following the senate s vote and a recent hearing in the house subcommittee on consumer protection and commerce at which i testified the subcommittee is now considering the issue the full house of representatives will need to vote in support of permanent dst before the bill goes to president biden s desk for his signature in my research on dst i have found that americans don t like congress messing with their clocks however the move to dst year round makes a lot of sense in an effort to avoid the biannual time change in spring and fall some dst critics have suggested that returning to permanent standard time would benefit society but research shows that dst saves lives and prevents crime nearly 20 states have passed bills to make dst permanent and the senate unanimously passed the sunshine protection act to allow those laws to take effect since any one state can t move to dst unilaterally on dates different from the rest of the country if congress ultimately passes the measure to turn all clocks forward permanently i see five ways that americans lives will improve 1 lives would be saved simply put darkness kills and darkness in the evening is far deadlier than darkness in the morning the evening rush hour is twice as fatal as the morning for various reasons far more people are on the road more alcohol is in drivers bloodstreams people are hurrying to get home and more children are enjoying outdoor unsupervised play fatal vehicle on pedestrian crashes increase threefold when the sun goes down dst brings an extra hour of sunlight into the evening to mitigate those risks standard time has the opposite impact by moving sunlight to the morning a metastudy reviewing all of the available research on the topic demonstrated that 343 lives per year could be saved by moving to year round dst primarily in reduced vehicle on pedestrian accidents mornings would be riskier but afternoons evenings would be far more safe 2 crime would decrease darkness is also a friend of crime moving sunlight into the evening has a far greater impact on crime prevention than it does in the morning this is especially true for crimes by juveniles which peak in the after school and early evening hours criminals prefer to do their work in the darkness of evening and night crime rates are 30 lower in the morning hours even when those morning hours occur before sunrise when it s still dark a 2013 british study found that improved lighting in the evening hours could reduce the crime rate by up to 20 3 energy would be saved many people don t know that the original justification for the creation of dst was to save energy initially during world war i and ii to prioritize energy for u s troops and then later during the 1973 opec oil crisis when the sun is out later in the evening peak energy loads are reduced having more sun in the evening requires not just less electricity to provide lighting but reduces the amount of oil and gas required to heat homes and businesses though it could increase cooling costs in the summer dst resulted in 150 000 barrels of oil saved by the u s in 1973 which helped combat the effect of opec s oil embargo most people in our society are awake and using energy in the early evening when the sun sets but a considerable portion of the population is still asleep at sunrise resulting in significantly less demand for energy then this rationale motivated some in california to recommend permanent dst in the early 2000s when the state experienced recurrent electricity shortages and rolling brownouts the american council for an energy efficient economy estimated that the u s would have seen an energy savings of more than us 4 billion and a decrease of carbon emissions by 10 8 million metric tons if we had enacted permanent dst more than a decade ago 4 avoiding clock switches improves sleep critics of dst are correct about one thing the biannual clock switch is bad for health and welfare it wreaks havoc with people s sleep cycles heart attacks increase 24 in the week after the u s springs forward in march there s even an uptick during the week when clocks fall back if that s not bad enough a study from 2000 shows that major financial market indexes nyse amex and nasdaq average negative returns on the monday following both clock switches presumably because of disrupted sleep cycles critics of biannual clock switching sometimes use these points to argue in favor of permanent standard time however the same sleep benefits are available under year round dst too plus standard time doesn t offer the energy saving lifesaving or crime prevention effects of dst 5 recreation and commerce flourish in the sun recreation and commerce flourish in daylight and are hampered by evening darkness americans are less willing to go out to shop in the dark and it s not very easy to catch a baseball in darkness either these activities are far more prevalent in the early evening than they are in the early morning hours so sunlight is not nearly so helpful then not surprisingly the u s chamber of commerce and organizations devoted to outdoor recreation favor extended dst brick and mortar stores especially family owned businesses suffered during the pandemic having more daylight to shop helps to reverse the trend a note about the downsides of dst it is important to note that some research highlights the downsides of dst the first concern is that dst creates sleep disruptions but most circadian rhythm dysfunction is created by the biannual clock shift itself either permanent standard time or permanent dst solves that problem standard time may be better for circadian rhythms overall because the sun sets and rises earlier however people s evening activities and routines are unlikely to change in response earlier sunsets won t force people to go to bed earlier as might have been the case 150 years ago before electricity prime time is 8 to 11 p m not 5 to 6 a m for a reason other research has associated living in western portions of time zones which have longer evening sun with an increased cancer risk compared with those living in eastern portions the increased cancer risk may be partially explained by lifestyle choices like diet and exercise in different parts of time zones further americans make decisions all the time that we know have health risks like eating red meat instead of broccoli and drinking alcohol or soda instead of water we do this because we enjoy the benefits of those products despite their risks this is similar to sun exposure and later bedtimes we enjoy and benefit from them even though we know they carry risks to address another downside early morning winter darkness any switch to permanent dst could be coupled with efforts to move school start times later as long advocated by the american academy of pediatrics this would be a good idea for kids circadian rhythms and mental health regardless of dst or standard time stepped up child safety measures for darker mornings such as crosswalk lighting and more crossing guards would also help time will tell whether the u s adopts permanent dst but either way we should consider all of its benefits versus all of the costs this is an updated version of a story that was originally published on march 4 2019 and updated on march 3 2020 steve calandrillo does not work for consult own shares

leaders next they discuss potential changes to daylight saving time and why this issue is so important to so many people and in the third segment they look at why some sports fans don t actually seem to like their favorite teams 15 reasons we should get rid of daylight saving time intro 1 a guy invented it to look for bugs 2 people always get the name wrong 3 not helpful for farmers 4 doesn t really save energy 5 easy to live without it 6 doesn t benefit moderate locations 7 throws off your sleep 8 increase in accidents 9 focus up 10 cyberloafing 11 bad for your health 12 time zone headaches 13 bad for some businesses 14 dst is basically standard time 15 keep it simple stupid

innovationrx is your weekly digest of healthcare news to get it in your inbox subscribe here d igital health venture funding hit 6 billion across 183 deals in the first quarter of 2022 with an average deal size of 32 8 million according to the latest report from rock health this is lower than the 6 7 billion recorded in the first quarter of last year and a significant step down from the 7 3 billion in venture funding in the fourth quarter of 2021 the report notes that there could be something seasonal at play in past years the first quarter tends to be a low if not the lowest funding quarter but the bigger picture question is whether this is an early indication of a digital health venture funding correction and whether we have seen the end of sky high valuations that seem absurdly far removed from revenue and customer numbers and when it comes to the public markets the spac boom of 2021 seems to be going bust in 2022 as digital health companies that went public via blank check companies

breitbart news senior contributor and government accountability institute gai president peter schweizer said during a republican study committee rsc meeting that there is a slam dunk case to indict hunter biden on charges of tax evasion breitbart news has learned exclusively schweizer the author of red handed how american elites get rich helping china win spoke to the rsc members about his book which focuses on how american elites and lawmakers became rich to america s detriment the red handed author said during the meeting that although the book documents many elites that sell out to china it principally focuses on president joe biden and his family rsc chairman jim banks r in said that he thought after reading clinton cash the untold story of how and why foreign governments and businesses helped make bill and hillary rich the clintons were the most corrupt family in politics and then he learned about the biden family schweizer said the hunter biden laptop stories made it easier to answer three basic fundamental questions about the relationship between china hunter biden and joe biden the biden family received roughly 31 million in business deals with the chinese hunter biden had significant business dealings with high ranking chinese government officials schweizer said that the hunter biden emails revealed that the biden family s money is fungible schweizer said hunter and joe biden had joint accounts and that hunter biden was paying for joe biden s monthly bills it also indicates that joe biden was a direct beneficiary of the money that was being transferred from asia schweizer said schweizer said that there was a grand jury established in 2018 to look at hunter biden s business deals in china which is focusing on potential tax evasion money laundering political corruption and failure to register as a foreign agent under the foreign agents registration act fara schweizer said that there remains a good chance that hunter biden will go to jail for one of these charges likely tax evasion however he caveated that hunter biden will likely take the fall to protect his father schweizer explained what seems to be fairly clear at this point you can notice this with a flurry of news reporting that is occurring that i would say that the odds are fairly good hunter biden is going to be indicted on which of those charges i don t know i think tax evasion is a slam dunk but here s the real challenge for the people in this room and for the american people what is probably going to happen is there s going to be a deal cut hunter biden is going to cop to some of the charges he may spend some time in jail but he s going to do that to protect his father the american people will have no accounting they will have no accounting of what the financial relationships were and how it influenced u s policy schweizer said the gai president offered two recommendations to prevent more foreign influence increased congressional oversight and ethics reforms he explained congressional oversight is a legitimate and important function here the department of justice is not going to do it and what i would suggest is congressional committees when the anticipation is you will take the majority in november use the subpoena power of the oversight committees to investigate this have hunter biden and these other individuals testify under oath subpoena financial records the joint accounts etc he added if you look at the situation right now as it relates to the biden family joe biden is required to disclose if he has 1 000 in ge stock he s required to disclose all of his campaign contributors of 200 or more but his son does multimillion dollar deals with chinese state owned entities where he s performing no legitimate business purpose there s no disclosure requirement so why not simply require the executive branch and legislative branch members to answer a simple question is anybody in your immediate family meaning adult children spouse engaged in commercial activities with foreign governments or foreign state owned enterprises if you check yes at least require members to disclose it schweizer emphasized that foreign entities now do deals with family members to offshore the individual that they are trying to corrupt and protect them from these kinds of disclosure and ethics reforms house judiciary committee ranking member jim jordan r oh has launched a new investigation into facebook and twitter s impression of the hunter biden laptop story if house republicans were to retake the house majority jordan would likely become the judiciary chairman and have the power to investigate the biden family banks said that jordan would lead the judiciary committee and do the right thing regarding investigations into the biden family i would say personally i have a lot of faith in jim jordan schweizer said
