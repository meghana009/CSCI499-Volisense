i ve been a resident in the village of housatonic for almost 3 years and if i can describe the situation regarding the water that comes out of our taps in one word disgusting with a capital d it seems like this problem has been rampant for years prior to my arrival and nothing is being done to address this matter even though there have been numerous meetings regarding this topic on hand no significant action has been taken to remedy the problem as brown and roily h 2 o has found a so called permanent home in pipes across the vicinity great barrington town manager mark pruhenski has been instrumental in having a say in this matter as he is valiantly trying to acquire housatonic water works which will focus exclusively on serving 1 400 users with decent water coming out of their faucets but all things considered to paraphrase brook benton s classic hit single it s just a matter of time the acquisition will combine forces to work with the town s fire department as they will keep an eye on making the system workable once again as residents continue to express their disdain over this never ending matter board chairman steven bannon also put his twoc cents on the question in hand we know the state says the water is safe to drink but we understand that the residents are concerned about the appearance of the water we think water should be safe to drink and esthetically pleasing it should also not ruin residents clothing or stain their bathtubs so my question is when do we stop buying bottled water and resume using the tap to fulfill this basic necessity plus the residue in our bathrooms and sinks proves to be a total eyesore to me and other fellow residents as much needed improvements need to be addressed not down the road but now if that is the case then a massive reduction or credit should be mandated in monthly water bills this topic has been addressed to the bay state s attorney general maura healey as there are talks out east in boston in trying to install private wells or modify the village s filtration system let s see if this actually comes to fruition stand by we ll keep you posted looking ahead to the future a meeting will take place on november 1st as the community will have another opportunity to voice their opinions on this sensitive matter kudos to jim mercer who has informed us every step of the way as to when construction takes place to significantly make things more tolerable despite the inconvenience of water taps shutting down for a few hours but it is one step towards some room for improvement until we can find a quick fix for this problem i have one suggestion stock up on the bottled water and pack some patience because there is a light at the end of the tunnel i certainly hope so some background information on this article was obtained by wsbs courtesy of the berkshire edge for on line usage

greetings wonketteers i m hooper your bartender i ve covered a lot of classic cocktails in recent months this time i m going out on a limb and giving you a drink entirely of my own creation very much in the style of modern craft cocktails i call it the sinister force here s the recipe sinister force 2 oz old forester 86 proof 1 oz carpano sweet vermouth ½ oz 360 double chocolate vodka ¼ oz campari 2 shakes chocolate bitters 1 shake creole bitters add all ingredients to mixing tumbler and stir over ice until chilled strain into a chilled martini glass garnish with a luxardo cherry the sinister force was inspired by another great cocktail the left hand that drink was authored by sam ross he s a modern legend in craft cocktails one of the first bartenders to look back at the classics bring them out into the light and make them better the left hand is itself a twist on the boulevardier a bourbon negroni that dates back to harry s bar in the 1920s the same place we got the sidecar last week i like sam s cocktail but i wanted to add more cocoa notes and rebalance the drink i also thought i d play around with the name a bit for halloween alexander haig said that a sinister force was responsible for erasing 18 minutes from nixon s tapes drink enough of these and i m sure the sinister force will erase 18 minutes from your memory too on to the ingredients the sinister force disappeared in a sinister fashion shortly after this photo was taken matthew hooper old forester 86 proof theold forester sales rep was a guest at the us bartenders guild meeting last week he raved enough about this bourbon to make me try it the base line bourbon is light sweet and mild a little thin but we ve got enough things going on in this cocktail to make up for it budget permitting i d upgrade to old forester 1910 according to the rep old forester s bottling plant went up in flames that year and the distiller had to put the bourbon back in the barrels the 1910 we taste today is double oaked to commemorate the date some extra vanilla and tannin in this cocktail would be fantastic carpano sweet vermouth do not put your vermouth in the liquor cabinet so many home bartenders and lousy bars make this mistake and it drives me crazy vermouth is wine wine with herbs and extra liquor but wine leave it out at room temperature and it ll taste as nasty as that three week old bottle of red wine that s lingered on your kitchen counter put it in the fridge and it ll keep for months i m using carpano here but there are a ton of tasty vermouths worth exploring 360 double chocolate vodka i know you can get this just about anywhere it s cheap and has a ton of chocolate flavor it s a far better choice than crème de cacao which is basically chocolate syrup but i d rather recommend an amazing bottle made right in here my neighborhood west branch malts in brunswick ohio has been distilling its malted barley into whiskey and vodka their base vodka still has a strong pleasant malt note their chocolate vodka has a clean chocolate and malt flavor that s rather like alcoholic ovaltine it s amazing but west branch doesn t have nationwide distribution so unless you re my neighbor you re probably out of luck on the other hand it s very likely that there s a microdistillery near you that s worth checking out some of my favorite gins come from columbus ohio pilar rum out of florida is a fantastic sipping rum state liquor laws make it hard for these companies to gain traction nationwide but there are little gems hiding in every state worth finding just about every microdistiller makes a vodka it s easy to make and flavored vodka like a chocolate vodka is the next logical step look around find what s out there and give your neighbors some time and money campari campari is a bitter italian apertif very very bitter i should like campari as a professional bartender but it s not easy to like i ve used a tiny amount here to overwrite a weird chocolate finish from the vodka aperol is a less chalky alternative with orange notes that would work as well bitters i m using two different bitters here to get spice and chocolate notes into the glass the most common brand of creole bitters ispeychaud several brands including scrappy s supply chocolate bitters amazon is my go to source for both i was stumped for a non alcoholic cocktail this week fortunately my wife keeps a stock of middle eastern ingredients for times like this pomegranate molasses definitely qualifies as a secret ingredient it s thick very tart and just barely sweet try it in this recipe for some super pucker power pomegranate molasses beer 1 oz pomegranate molasses ½ oz fresh lime juice ½ oz enriched simple syrup add all ingredients to a tumbler with 2 3 oz soda water stir to dilute and combine top with ice and additional seltzer in summary and conclusion drink well drink often and tip your bartender donate to wonkette at the link below i m currently behind the stick at tiki underground come by and say hello and if you d like to buy some ingredients or bar gear from amazon please click on the links above or this one open thread want to just donate once
one year after maine launched its legal adult use cannabis market industry members say they re encouraged by the market s rapid growth but they also shared worries about the possibility of market saturation an influx of out of state corporate interests and continued issues with high prices in just under a year maine s recreational cannabis industry has brought in nearly 60 million according to data released by the maine office of marijuana policy while that figure can t match the 250 million in 2020 sales generated by maine s more mature medical cannabis market monthly sales in the adult use market have grown rapidly since its launch on oct 9 2020 edging downward just a bit in september to 9 7 million as summer tourism waned industry participants are excited by the seemingly exponential growth in the long awaited recreational program s inaugural year but some worry that at some point with more stores being added all the time the market will become saturated or continued high prices will make it harder to compete against larger corporate sellers with deeper pockets september s sales dip from the industry s august peak of just over 10 2 million marked the first time the numbers have trended downward erik gundersen director of the maine office of marijuana policy said he is encouraged by the industry s growth over the past year since the launch of maine s adult use cannabis industry our licensees have proven to be both innovative and resilient gunderson said in a statement we maintain the highest standards for public health in our adult use program and on the anniversary of this industry s launch are encouraged to see that more and more consumers are choosing the tested tracked and well regulated market over the illicit market advertisement more stores more sales in just under a year the state s 58 licensed adult use retailers reported 788 551 sales transactions totaling over 58 5 million earning the state roughly 5 8 million in sales tax revenue according to the department s adult use data dashboard monthly sales have come a long way from roughly 1 3 million in the industry s first full month of operation setting a new record each month thereafter until september at the start the industry struggled with limited supply and high costs but with 58 stores five opened in september 26 manufacturing facilities 50 cultivation sites and three testing labs buyers are continuing to see more variety and lower prices the average price of smokable marijuana flower has fallen from 16 68 per gram at market launch to 12 46 per gram as of september smokable cannabis continues to account for the majority of sales capturing about 58 percent of the revenue in september however that share is down from 76 percent when the market opened and 63 percent in january likely the result of a product menu that continues to expand and diversify advertisement cannabis concentrates and infused products such as edibles and beverages have both seen their share of the market increase capturing 22 percent and 19 percent respectively compared with 14 percent and 10 percent in october 2020 the average transaction has remained at around 75 since the beginning the industry s growth trajectory is not likely to change anytime soon the state has 171 stores 77 manufacturing facilities 159 cultivation sites and two additional labs in various stages of the approval process like any other business maine s rollout of legalized adult use cannabis was the slowest in u s history it took almost four years after voters approved legalization in 2016 with movement slowed by legislative rewrites gubernatorial vetoes a change in gubernatorial leadership and the coronavirus pandemic only six stores were licensed to open on the first day coastal cannabis was one of those early licensees but things got off to a rocky start the small shop should have been one of the first to open its doors on oct 9 but there was just one problem it didn t have any product to sell advertisement it took an additional month for coastal cannabis to stock its shelves enough to officially open co owner david page said since then it s been full steam ahead we re just now starting to feel a little bit of a summer slowdown he said it s not what it was this summer but neither is any business in maine page said he has been somewhat surprised by the makeup of his customer base he didn t expect to see so many older people or women coming into the store i didn t realize there were so many female potheads page said it s been amazing page said he doesn t know what to expect for his shop in the future some of that market newness has started to wear off he said it s going to turn into any other business in the world he said but so far it appears that there s room for everybody advertisement green cures in auburn was the first shop to officially make a legal recreational marijuana sale in maine but owner tanya rollins hasn t been too enchanted with the realities of the legal market it s had its goods and its bads but it would have been better if i stayed medical rollins said the income that i m seeing is not the same as the numbers that are being reported larger companies with out of state investors and deep pockets to fall back on have made it increasingly difficult for independent shop owners to survive she said rollins said the proliferation of such competitors plays a major role in her dissatisfaction with the market and will be the downfall of any small mom and pop marijuana store as written the law would have required every officer director and manager of an adult use cannabis business and its majority owners to have lived and filed taxes in maine for at least four years the mandate would have lapsed in june 2021 but would have given locals a leg up at the outset of the new market but wellness connection of maine the state s largest cannabis company sued regulators arguing that the requirement violated its constitutional right to interstate commerce by favoring mainers advertisement a federal judge agreed and in may 2020 the state and wellness connection reached a legal agreement stipulating that the office of marijuana policy would no longer enforce the residency requirement essentially inviting out of state investors into the market saturation a big concern a relative newcomer to the adult use cannabis industry john kreis opened his shop portland greenhouse on sept 17 kreis was nervous about market saturation within the city when portland first proposed its rules which restricted the market to 20 retail licenses he worried 20 stores would be too many in such a small city but then voters passed a referendum that eliminated the cap as well as a required buffer zone between competitors now kreis is preparing to share a wall with another adult use store stage cannabis which is expected to open later this month kreis said he is trying to make the best of it portland has 14 adult use shops now but the potential for more is unlimited advertisement kreis is hoping the two shops paired together will give the location added visibility he said he plans to get along with his next door competitor and will give his own store a unique identity to make it stand out anyone who s going to see his store is going to have to see my store kreis said still it s not easy to get the word out to a wider audience he said and maine has tight restrictions on how cannabis can be marketed i m scared to death to do anything to market the store for fear of being noncompliant kreis said i m trying to do the right thing and follow the rules everyone is but there are so many rules an evolving market mohammed ibrahem owner of bangor s firestorm cultivation another of the first round of licensees is more optimistic about the industry s continued growth advertisement things are going really great he said we ve seen the industry rise from nothing to something significant prices are high ibrahem said but maine has done a good job of bringing them down as much as possible now that supply is starting to catch up with demand like other shop owners he has seen a bit of a dip in visitors as fall goes on but ibrahem said that s just like any other business in maine he s not worried about the market becoming overly saturated in fact at the outset he was more concerned about how few licensees were permitted in the first round but that problem has largely resolved itself the pace of sales and the expansion of licenses being issued is right around where i thought it would be ibrahem said sweet dirt which opened its waterville location in december and its portland store in march continues to grow advertisement ceo jim henry said the company which also boasts a large greenhouse and a medical store in eliot employed about 30 people a year ago now it has between 115 and 125 employees rather than a decline in business henry said he s noticing different buying patterns with stronger business on weekends and a softening during the week henry said he believes business will remain steady year round with people coming for leaf peeping in the fall and ski season in the winter there are still challenges of course whether from the pandemic the labor shortage supply chain problems or a combination of factors he said certainly everything seems a little harder than you d expect henry said but despite all that he said maine s adult use program has become more successful than he had envisioned and he hopes it stays that way a rising tide will lift all boats henry said send questions

site plans for the proximity port city daily courtesy ghk cape fear development carolina beach the proximity stepped closer to full approval this week the proposed development in carolina beach would turn one of the final large swaths of empty land in the beach s center business region into a mixed use complex with more than 250 units the carolina beach planning and zoning commission unanimously vouched for the project at its thursday meeting leaving the developers with one last hurdle to clear before securing approval from the town a hearing before town council backed by ghk cape fear development the firm behind the adjacent publix site and autumn hall in wilmington the proximity is planned for a group of parcels off lake park boulevard that are being acquired by the group that includes the land owned by harris teeter which the grocer staked out years ago as the spot for a future store overgrown grass and a faded coming soon sign eventually became the battleground for a lawsuit fought over the grocer s attempts to prevent the development of the next door publix elsewhere on the tract there used to be a putt putt golf course and amusement park rides that had been relocated from the boardwalk through combining the cluster of parcels the development team has amassed a 12 acre tract the proposal involves seven buildings that would contain a total 261 apartment units and other amenities a restaurant a fitness club nearly 19 000 square feet of rentable retail space and the existing jersey mike s the project would have at least 44 000 square feet of total heated commercial space according to the application packet the planning commission hearing thursday followed a months long effort from the development team to set the stage for this project s application town code previously prohibited development of this sort in the highway business district in cases of mixed use development it was required that ground floors be reserved for only commercial space brian eckel is the co founder of ghk s sister company cape fear commercial in wilmington he has been the frontman for the project in public hearings over the summer along with attorney sam franck of ward and smith in august the group first worked to edit the town code through a text amendment their proposal asked for the right to build mixed use projects that could include freestanding residential buildings instead of having to stock all ground floors with commercial tenants previously developers release more information on 12 acre carolina beach project the market would not support a full on commercial complex at the site eckel said at past public meetings while the frontage on lake park boulevard would be suitable for attracting commercial customers eckel said commercial tenants would struggle on the property s backside along st joseph street where there s less traffic the text amendment was crafted to be isolated to this specific site one limitation of the rule change puts a 10 acre minimum on the lots that can take advantage of the new provision in want of more specifics the planning commission initially voted down the text amendment application unanimously town council later approved it 4 1 with jodan garza dissenting the planning commission s vote acts as a recommendation to council with the text amendment secured and the design concept now allowed the developers turned to the project itself and the need to achieve a conditional rezoning request eckel said there have been over 20 meetings with locals to discuss the project including walking tours drop ins at majik beanz espresso and onsite visits ghk set up a website about the project after plans were first revealed it s a super tight knit community and the stakeholders of carolina beach that are coming are literally coming with good ideas and trying to make the plan better which is exactly what we hope for eckel said in a phone interview friday we re glad that our education on what we re trying to do is working first and foremost the conceptual design includes sizable green space and promises to preserve lots of heritage oaks on site some over 90 years old eckel said the town has no tree retention regulations there will be a multi use path through the property an extension of the island greenway system collaboration with local mural artists and an in house service that offers uber like ride ordering but with golf carts one week after town council approved the text amendment eckel emailed town manager bruce oakley to ask if planning director jeremy hardison would be allowed to join the developers for a quick trip down to florida in order to scope out some developments that could offer inspiration for the design of the proximity we think it could be good for all of us to go down as we start to drill down on the plan and discuss architectural inspiration eckel wrote oakley responded that the offer was appreciated however after discussing with legal counsel we feel it s probably not appropriate for him to join you guys at the meeting thursday members of the planning commission said they were pleased with the presentation praising the development team for responding to community feedback and making plans clear two locals who spoke emphasized the need for this development to be integrated in a way that offers actual maneuverability in and out via foot and bike and doesn t make traffic unsafe there was lots of talk about the conditions the commission would recommend compelling the developers to abide by the conditions at this time include vows to minimize light pollution and to prohibit any sort of rental of less than 90 days town leaders would like a traffic signal at the corner of winner avenue and lake park boulevard around the site s southwest corner eckel said the development team will invest up to 300 000 to improve that intersection which will involve approaching the n c department of transportation alongside the town there was also a desire from some commissioners to use a sliver of town owned property on winner avenue south of the property for a walking connection into the proximity after much back and forth involving franck the attorney that idea was transcribed vaguely so that it would not be a requirement but it is currently being evaluated eckel said town council will consider the conditional rezoning application for the proximity on nov 9 the planning commission is an advisory board and council makes the final call on approving land use requests send tips comments and criticisms to

i ve been a resident in the village of housatonic for almost 3 years and if i can describe the situation regarding the water that comes out of our taps in one word disgusting with a capital d it seems like this problem has been rampant for years prior to my arrival and nothing is being done to address this matter even though there have been numerous meetings regarding this topic on hand no significant action has been taken to remedy the problem as brown and roily h 2 o has found a so called permanent home in pipes across the vicinity great barrington town manager mark pruhenski has been instrumental in having a say in this matter as he is valiantly trying to acquire housatonic water works which will focus exclusively on serving 1 400 users with decent water coming out of their faucets but all things considered to paraphrase brook benton s classic hit single it s just a matter of time the acquisition will combine forces to work with the town s fire department as they will keep an eye on making the system workable once again as residents continue to express their disdain over this never ending matter board chairman steven bannon also put his twoc cents on the question in hand we know the state says the water is safe to drink but we understand that the residents are concerned about the appearance of the water we think water should be safe to drink and esthetically pleasing it should also not ruin residents clothing or stain their bathtubs so my question is when do we stop buying bottled water and resume using the tap to fulfill this basic necessity plus the residue in our bathrooms and sinks proves to be a total eyesore to me and other fellow residents as much needed improvements need to be addressed not down the road but now if that is the case then a massive reduction or credit should be mandated in monthly water bills this topic has been addressed to the bay state s attorney general maura healey as there are talks out east in boston in trying to install private wells or modify the village s filtration system let s see if this actually comes to fruition stand by we ll keep you posted looking ahead to the future a meeting will take place on november 1st as the community will have another opportunity to voice their opinions on this sensitive matter kudos to jim mercer who has informed us every step of the way as to when construction takes place to significantly make things more tolerable despite the inconvenience of water taps shutting down for a few hours but it is one step towards some room for improvement until we can find a quick fix for this problem i have one suggestion stock up on the bottled water and pack some patience because there is a light at the end of the tunnel i certainly hope so some background information on this article was obtained by wsbs courtesy of the berkshire edge for on line usage

the obama administration s pivot to asia seemed to be present in president joe biden s justification of the u s withdrawal from afghanistan the world is changing biden said in an aug 31 speech citing serious competition with china among other threats that superseded the superpower s post 9 11 mideast focus a pivot suggests turning away from something but like his recent presidential predecessors biden may find it geopolitically necessary to pivot back i understand why priorities in foreign policy national security should be geared more toward asia and the indo pacific to be specific said former ambassador dennis ross but if you want to be able to pursue those policies without distraction and diversion then you need to invest enough so the middle east doesn t intrude on it ross who served multiple administrations as a top envoy to the mideast is now a distinguished fellow at the washington institute for near east policy in an interview while he was in minnesota last week he analyzed the diplomatic dynamics of the region and how they relate to u s foreign policy even a management strategy for the middle east requires enough investment and involvement that it leaves you in a position where you can pursue your other priorities and areas you consider more important ross said if you don t then it will intrude on you like it or not probably not for the biden administration especially regarding iran the subject of this month s global minnesota great decisions dialogue since president donald trump jettisoned the jcpoa the joint comprehensive plan of action or iran deal the theocrats in tehran have increased its stock of enriched uranium and decreased the access of u n inspectors intended to verify the multinational deal biden pledged to rejoin the jcpoa if iran came back into compliance but talks are balky going through european russian and chinese intermediaries instead of direct bilateral negotiations and iran s new hard line leader president ebrahim raisi has made an accord even more difficult the president s special envoy for iran robert malley speaking wednesday in a webinar held by the carnegie endowment for international peace acknowledged the difficulties of trump s abrogation of the treaty and iran s recalcitrance on re establishing the pact i ll let historians debate what could have been but what is clear and what s been clear since april is that u s and the biden administration put on the table ideas which meant if iran had negotiated and reached this understanding all of the sanctions that were inconsistent with the jcpoa with the nuclear deal would have been lifted and lifted very quickly addressing the indirect intermediated talks malley said it s not particularly constructive and that it lends itself to misunderstanding expressing hope the iranians would directly negotiate malley said that s not a concession to the united states it s a favor to diplomacy diplomacy has actually improved between regional behemoths iran and saudi arabia despite their defining mutual animosity and overall regional engagement is a big change since the iran deal was struck the united arab emirates and all of the countries of the gulf cooperation council are engaging with tehran malley said and there s the trump era abraham accords between four mideast nations and israel but elsewhere iranian involvement in lebanon iraq yemen and syria has brought only strife iran s main exports are rockets militias and failed states quipped ross internally repression is rising with tehran unjustly jailing citizens and foreigners including four americans separate and apart from the talks on the nuclear deal we ve been engaged again indirectly from day one on the talks about securing the release of the four americans who have been unjustly cruelly and outrageously detained as pawns by the iranian government malley said this thuggish tactic isn t expected to ease under raisi and it s unclear if the nuclear negotiations will restart either we will be prepared to adjust to a different reality in which we have to deal with all options to address iran s nuclear program if it s not prepared to come back into the constraints of 2016 malley said the special envoy did not detail what all options means neither did america s top diplomat secretary of state antony blinken when he spoke after a trilateral meeting with israeli and united arab emirates foreign ministers on wednesday we ve made it abundantly clear over the last nine months that we are prepared to return to full compliance with the jcpoa if iran does the same blinken told reporters what we are seeing or more accurately not seeing from tehran now suggests that they re not and time is running short because as we ve also had an opportunity to discuss together we are getting close to a point at which returning to compliance with the jcpoa will not in and of itself capture the benefits of the jcpoa and that s because iran has been using this time to advance its nuclear program in a variety of ways including enriching uranium to 20 and even 60 using more advanced centrifuges acquiring more knowledge and so blinken added that runway is getting shorter israeli foreign minister yair lapid agreed iran he said is becoming a nuclear threshold country lapid noting that both he and blinken are the sons of holocaust survivors added that we know there are moments when nations must use force to protect the world from evil if a terror regime is going to acquire a nuclear weapon we must act we must make clear that the civilized world won t allow it if the iranians don t believe the world is serious about stopping them they ll race to the bomb iran likely doesn t doubt the seriousness of biden s bid to re enter the jcpoa and tehran is certainly sure about israel s willingness or as lapid labeled it right to act at any given moment in any way which he deemed not only our right it is also our responsibility but the seriousness of the u s potentially entering yet another major mideast war is far less certain especially after the kabul debacle obviously there are doubts about credibility they predated afghanistan afghanistan fed them said ross and yet he added there s still a reality that when push comes to shove there s nobody else in the region they really feel they could depend on as biden considers the consequences of failed negotiations his words on withdrawing from afghanistan take on new resonance there s nothing low grade or low risk or low cost about any war biden said adding as we close 20 years of war and strife and pain and sacrifice it s time to look to the future not the past but the past can be prologue especially in the mideast where the u s seems to keep returning or pivoting back to john rash is a star

activists in calexico say the city isn t doing enough for the community amid the extreme heat of the summers california usa it s three o clock on august 4th and the temperature is creeping towards 119 degrees fahrenheit in downtown calexico maribel padilla the co founder of the brown bag coalition is driving a van around the city to hand out water cold towels and snacks to people who are unsheltered on the street she makes water deliveries anytime the temperature goes over 114 degrees padilla is concerned about one man pedro sanchez known as peter who she hasn t seen in a couple of days i worry that if he lays down where there used to be shade and time goes on and then the sun hits them and they don t wake up that s how they end up dying from the heat so anytime i don t see him for a couple of days i start getting antsy in imperial county 22 heat related deaths have been confirmed so far this year through oct 2 according to the county health department s survey of local hospitals it s only the second time in at least 15 years with available data that heat related deaths have surpassed 10 in a year the other time was in 2018 when 25 deaths were linked to extreme heat in the county this year heat may be credited with taking even more lives three unhoused men who were living in downtown calexico died this summer according to stories in the calexico chronicle although the imperial county coroner s office says the causes of death are still under review their bodies were found within less than a half mile of each other between early july and early august during excessive heat warnings according to the articles in which first responders said heat played a role extreme heat is part of life in imperial county but as the climate changes the county is predicted to see more frequent and extreme days of heat in the future the county hit its record daily maximum temperature in june 2017 at 122 degrees nine of the ten hottest three day periods recorded in the county since 1962 have occurred since 2016 environmental justice advocate luis olmedo views the effects of climate change as a local public health emergency throughout this covid crisis in the summers we have a public health emergency here people are dying out here as a result of the extreme weather conditions the executive director of the nonprofit environmental justice organization comite civico del valle olmedo was speaking at a media event for the pioneers memorial healthcare district donation of bottled water to the brown bag coalition larry lewis the pioneers district s chief executive officer agreed that summer heat creates a public health crisis every year donating water that can be given to those who need it he says is one way to alleviate the crisis if we don t take care of people away from the hospital they will end up there lewis said the healthcare district includes one of the county s two hospitals pioneers memorial hospital which is located in brawley how do we keep people healthier and keep them out of the expensive and the crowded places and take care of them where they re at instead of waiting for them to get into a crisis situation in calexico advocates say that the city is not prepared to protect vulnerable residents in extreme heat they say specific actions the city has taken in 2021 have neglected the needs of unhoused people they say the continued closure of public bathrooms in the downtown area as well as the limited accessibility of the city s one cooling center made the heat more dangerous for those experiencing homelessness calexico city councilmember raul ureña a frequent critic of fellow city leaders and an advocate for more services for those experiencing homelessness says the city s response this summer was inadequate and shameful he admits that in part because of a budget crisis that has lasted more than a decade the city has relied on community organizations and nonprofits to assist vulnerable communities in extreme heat we ve been leaving it up to the nonprofits almost completely he said people have died as a direct result of that it could happen to me padilla s efforts to fill gaps in services for those experiencing homelessness started six years ago after spearheading the opening of an emergency shelter during a winter freeze she met sanchez the first night the shelter opened when the shelter closed she and co founder norma aguilar distributed leftover food to people in brown bags community donations have continued to come in ever since and the brown bag coalition now distributes dinners on a nightly basis at calexico s border friendship park on the afternoon of aug 4 padilla s first stop is to people living in a small camp of shelters off of cesar chavez boulevard just down the street from the u s mexico border crossing although only several blocks away in distance the camp is separated from the rest of downtown by train tracks and south bound traffic to the border once the border line backs up later in the afternoon padilla avoids driving over to that part of the city because of the traffic the encampment sits on a dusty lot and is surrounded by mounds of recycled scrap material on the other side of a chain linked fence sit dozens of transport trucks and an auto body shop francisco pancho ramirez is one of the people who comes out from the shade of a shelter to take the water padilla offers ramirez grew up in mexicali and worked for decades as a farmworker throughout the state of california he still has family that lives in a home in mexicali but he says they re now estranged he s been staying at the cesar chavez camp for the past year or two previously he slept on the streets downtown and would spend many hours looking for shade to stay cool in during the day the shelter he s built out of scrap wood and metal provides a dependable shadow from the sun on hot days across a vacant lot from the camp there s a small shopping center where he and others go to buy water ice and food he uses a wrench to open the nearby fire hydrant when he needs to bathe or cool off in the water now 55 ramirez no longer works in the fields during the heat of the summer he recalls a hot day when he was younger and was taken to the hospital after experiencing symptoms of a heart attack while he was working i wouldn t eat and i would work in the field i was carrying a box and suddenly felt a pain in my calves and a sensation in my hands and in my face too he says in spanish i was working sweating a lot and on drugs i thought i was going to die he stayed at the hospital for 24 hours and the doctor who treated him told him to stay out of the sun and avoid working in the heat ramirez has also been diagnosed with high blood pressure which he knows puts him at greater risk in the heat ramirez was friends with a man known as cuba one of two men who according to a news report died in downtown calexico on july 9 with signs of heat exhaustion the two would often recycle cans and bottles together and cuba s death surprised ramirez he guesses that what happened to cuba was similar to what he himself experienced that day in the field and what he could experience again i know that what happened to cuba could happen to me where do these people go advocates say the city could make simple changes to save the lives of people like cuba padilla brings water directly to ramirez and others at the cesar chavez camp with the belief that in order for resources to be effective they need to be available in the locations that people are staying the city of calexico did operate one cooling center this summer but it was located at the calexico community center in a residential area about a mile from the downtown area where many people experiencing homelessness stay according to a flyer on the door of the cooling center it was open monday through wednesday from 1 5 p m thursdays from 1 4 p m and every other friday from 1 5 p m it was not open on the weekends or for extended hours on days of excessive heat ismael arvizu of the community organization calexico needs change agrees with padilla that the cooling center should be located in a building downtown the fact that they made it in the community center which is like blocks away from where people really need it shows to everyone how much they don t care arvizu said his organization has been working to form a coalition with other leaders downtown that can provide resources such as a cooling center closer to the people who need them calexico needs change stocks a community refrigerator at the calexico wellness thrift store on 2nd street with donated water and food padilla also keeps bottled water at the store that people can come in and ask for however calexico mayor javier moreno says it s up to those who need it to take advantage of the resource having a cool center for them the whole 10 12 hours that it s hot it takes a lot of resources for that moreno said even if we did they re not willing to walk all the way over there for whatever reason padilla says the city could also alleviate some of the challenges for those who are homeless by reopening the public bathrooms downtown there s no water fountains they closed down all the bathrooms so where do these people go she said in march of 2020 calexico closed public bathrooms and water fountains as part of a sweeping public health mandate at the beginning of the covid 19 pandemic some public bathrooms and water fountains in the city were reopened in may of 2021 but the bathrooms downtown remain closed there are no water fountains in the downtown area before the covid 19 pandemic the city operated two public bathrooms downtown one set is in calexico s border friendship park and the other is next to an orthopedic clinic on the east end of 1st street one of the men who died on july 9 was found at the latter location councilmember ureña says that while the bathrooms were initially closed over concerns from covid 19 the city is allowed to open them back up the city is operating like a 7 eleven that once it cut costs that keeps the restrooms closed when under the public health mandate or the local public health authority we re able to open them up but we keep them closed to save a couple cents on the dollar according to public works manager lilliana falomir reopening the downtown bathrooms would cost between 80 000 and 90 000 because of needed plumbing fixes and other improvements moreno said that though the closures initially came along as a pandemic protocol they ve remained close because of concerns for safety rather than opening the current bathrooms moreno said the city is depending on a california state farmworker assistance bill says would help develop a farmworker service center downtown that will house public restrooms that can be monitored the center would be located across the street from the currently closed bathrooms the bill was signed into law sept 22 councilmember ureña says he wants the city to be more proactive in curbing heat related deaths and illnesses by making resources directly available to those who are vulnerable what do we do as decision makers to address and facilitate the solving of the issue at the core which is getting someone that hydration before we have to call an ambulance the city expects to receive 9 5 million from the american rescue plan which ureña would like to see spent in part on providing direct services to people who are unhoused as well as to farmworkers he d like to see the bathrooms downtown reopened and for buildings to be used for transitional and affordable housing the city has received half the money and a portion of the funds have already been allocated to the fire and police departments searching for shade it s late august and fernando toledo is one of several men lying in the shade at calexico s border friendship park where the brown bag coalition is serving one of its nightly dinners it s located next to the border fence at the southwest corner of downtown across from the port of entry and is where many people who are unhoused seek refuge from the heat the park houses one set of the closed bathrooms when the bathrooms were open many used the sinks as a source of water for the first few months of 2021 toledo stayed at an encampment started by calexico needs change on the east side of downtown it was set up as a place for farmworkers to stay before and after work and was cleared out by calexico police in early april on the night of aug 26 he says he s been feeling sick with a headache and stomach pain after working in the fields earlier in the week toledo sleeps on a small bench in the park that night and moves to a place on the grass in the shade of a nearby building as soon as the sun hits him in the morning he says he s feeling better that day but still doesn t feel well enough to work outside in the heat he spends the day moving between patches of shade in the park to sleep under one of the few times toledo leaves the shade is to refill a cup of ice he walks a block to the nearby 7 eleven and fills a plastic cup up at the vending machine when he reaches the front of the line with a handful of change the cashier waves him through with a smile back in the park toledo has a few bottles of water from the brown bag coalition to last him through the day he ll get more at their dinner at the park that night the cooling center is closed that day but when asked if he s ever gone he says he s never heard of it pedro sanchez friend of padilla and

this july indonesia s former fisheries minister edhy prabowo was sentenced to five years in prison after a court found him guilty of accepting bribes to lift a ban on the export of lobster larvae the decision by the corruption eradication commission kpk was widely praised by environmentalists and fisheries organisations but the case remains a sign that indonesia has fallen away from its position as an exemplar of sustainable oceans policy edhy s sentencing came a little more than two years after president joko jokowi widodo unexpectedly appointed him instead of sticking with incumbent fisheries minister susi pudjiastuti susi had become popular in indonesia thanks to her hard line on illegal fishing which included blowing up culpable vessels entering at the beginning of jokowi s second term edhy undid several of susi s policies as the president pushed for a greater focus on gdp growth over long term sustainable practices it s the same president but a different direction said arifsyah nasution oceans campaigner at greenpeace indonesia on the changes since jokowi s 2019 re election we ve had several major setbacks and still we don t have any progressive direction from the current government edhy was replaced by sakti wahyu trenggono in december 2020 shortly after the kpk announced its case against him the new fisheries minister has made some positive moves but it remains to be seen if he ll return to the more dramatic effective and popular policies of susi from sustainable management to prioritizing the economy indonesia has more than 17 500 islands and the ocean makes up more than three quarters of its territory the fisheries sector is central to the economy providing 27 billion in gross domestic product supporting seven million jobs and supplying more than half of the country s animal based protein intake despite being the world s largest archipelago nation indonesia had played a relatively small role in global fisheries and ocean policymaking that changed when jokowi picked susi to be his first fisheries minister in 2014 relatively unknown but with extensive experience of fisheries she soon made waves globally with her decisive action on behalf of indonesian fishers during her five years at the head of the ministry susi took a hard handed approach most visibly through her policy of seizing and sinking foreign vessels fishing illegally in indonesian waters she also made public the country s boat tracking data and pushed to reduce environmentally dangerous fishing practices by small scale fishers she was willing to take on the power elite when it came to the large scale commercial fishing industry that was detrimental to both the fishing communities and fisheries resources said sally yozell director of the environmental security programme at the stimson center in washington dc susi proposed the lobster larvae export ban in 2016 lobster aquaculture in countries like vietnam and china depends on imports of larvae and juveniles they are first caught in indonesian waters before being transported and grown in submerged cages abroad and then sold as adults often at a large profit indonesia is one of a few countries able to export large numbers of lobster larvae and their stocks had been depleted by exploitation prior to the ban it was also hoped that limiting exports would encourage lobster farming domestically providing income for coastal communities along with her boat scuttling policies she introduced policies to stem the use of environmentally harmful fishing methods such as bottom trawl nets which scrape the ocean floor and damage coral reef ecosystems and bottom dwelling species the health of fisheries duly improved with studies showing an increase in biomass in indonesian waters and a reduction in illegal unreported and unregulated fishing under edhy the boat destruction stopped bottom trawl nets returned and data sharing with the non profit global fishing watch gfw ended since the departure of susi in 2019 there have been several leadership and staff changes in the fisheries ministry said ko jung lo gfw s regional manager for asia the renewal of our agreement with the ministry was delayed because of these changes and as a result indonesia suspended its vessel monitoring system data feed to our map uncertain future not everyone was happy about susi s policies she had opponents in the capital jakarta and among business interests this along with a shift towards more economy minded decision making is believed to have led to her replacement globally almost everyone was disappointed to see someone who was working to manage the fisheries sustainably in a country that is the world s second largest producer of seafood be replaced said yozell she was really trying to balance sustainably managing fisheries with the economic needs of the fishing industry since taking over the current fisheries minister sakti wahyu trenggono has shown more willingness to engage with civil society and has been in contact with susi according to arifsyah in june he brought back the ban on exporting lobster larvae and the following month he reimposed bans on destructive purse seine and bottom trawl fishing there are concerns though about the ministry potentially giving licences to foreign fishing boats to operate in indonesia bustar maitar ceo of indonesian ngo econusa said that reducing the number of permits given to foreign fishing boats will surely provide larger space to small fishers he added the indonesian native fishers therefore could catch fish in indonesian waters also of concern is indonesia s omnibus law on job creation a 1 028 page bill that became law late last year the broadest amending of indonesia s legal code in decades it modified or annulled 79 different laws that govern land use environmental impacts infrastructure and much more it has the potential to speed up the implementation of environmentally harmful development projects such as ports coal plants and land reclamation without proper local consultation or environmental impact analysis we re concerned that the omnibus law will result in more conflicts on the ground because the environment and coastal communities will be deprioritised said arifsyah despite the uncertainty at the fisheries ministry gfw is focusing on working with local governments and organisations especially on a challenge that susi wasn t able to address during her first term managing small scale vessels small scale fisheries are a vital source of nutrition and income for many communities in indonesia yet nearly all small scale fishing which makes up almost 90 percent of indonesia s fishing sector is unmonitored and unreported said lo with more affordable tracking technology and better monitoring data we would like to support indonesia s small scale fisheries sector efforts to promote legal reported and regulated fishing activity arifsyah hopes that sakti and president jokowi turn back to the model implemented under susi which also means playing an active role in global conferences and negotiations let s bring back indonesia s leadership in the international forum said arifsyah share the challenges and be proactive in commitments around saving the ocean and ending human trafficking that is something that we hope the current minister takes forward nithin coca is a southeast asia based

washington oct 15 reuters the white house on friday will lift covid 19 travel restrictions for fully vaccinated international visitors starting nov 8 ending historic restrictions that had barred much of the world from entering the united states for as long as 21 months the unprecedented travel restrictions kept millions of visitors out of the united states from china canada mexico india brazil much of europe and elsewhere shrunk u s tourism and hurt border community economies they prevented many loved ones and foreign workers from reuniting with families oh how i ve missed christmas in ny alexandros koronakis an executive with at t inc in brussels wrote on twitter u s allies had heavily lobbied the biden administration to lift the rules many praised friday s announcement including sweden s ambassador to the united states karin olofsdotter who called it very welcoming news white house spokesman kevin munoz confirmed the nov 8 date on twitter adding the policy is guided by public health stringent and consistent advertisement restrictions on non u s citizens were first imposed on air travelers from china in january 2020 by then president donald trump and then extended to dozens of other countries without any clear metrics for how and when to lift them curbs on non essential travelers at land borders with mexico and canada have been in place since march 2020 to address the covid 19 pandemic reuters first reported friday s announcement of the nov 8 starting date earlier in the day u s airline hotel and cruise industry stocks rose on the news including american airlines up 2 8 marriott international inc up 3 7 and carnival corp up 0 9 u s international air passenger traffic was down 43 in august and overall passenger air traffic was down 21 over pre pandemic levels the u s transportation department said friday airlines have seen an increase in international ticket sales in recent weeks after the white house announced plans to lift the restrictions nick calio chief executive of the airlines for america industry trade group said in a statement calio said the full reopening of international travel is also critical to reviving economies around the globe reinvigorating communities and supporting millions of jobs in the u s and abroad the united states had lagged many other countries in lifting such restrictions advertisement in january trump issued an order to lift travel restrictions on people in europe and brazil but the order was reversed by president joe biden before it took effect the biden administration which repeatedly has said it does endorse so called vaccine passports grappled for months over whether to mandate vaccinations as a condition of lifting country specific restrictions officials told reuters on tuesday the white house announced it would lift restrictions at its land borders and ferry crossings with canada and mexico for fully vaccinated foreign nationals in early november they are similar but not identical to requirements announced last month for international air travelers unvaccinated visitors will still be barred from entering the united states from canada or mexico at land borders canada on aug 9 began allowing fully vaccinated u s visitors for non essential travel the centers for disease control and prevention cdc told reuters last week the united states will accept the use by international visitors of covid 19 vaccines authorized by u s regulators or the world health organization the white house which held a meeting late thursday to finalize the nov 8 date faces some remaining questions including how and what exemptions the biden administration will grant to the vaccine requirements children under 18 for example are largely expected to be exempt from the requirements an official said u s travel association chief executive roger dow said declines in international visits since the pandemic started resulted in more than 250 billion in lost income advertisement dow said in a statement that the nov 8 date is critically important for planning for airlines for travel supported businesses and for millions of travelers worldwide who will now advance plans to visit the united states once again the white house announced on sept 20 that the united states would lift restrictions on air travelers from 33 countries in early november it did not specify the date at the time starting nov 8 the united states will admit fully vaccinated foreign air travelers from the 26 so called schengen countries in europe including france germany italy spain switzerland and greece as well as britain ireland china india south africa iran and brazil the unprecedented u s restrictions have barred non u s citizens who were in those countries within the past 14 days the united states has allowed foreign air travelers from more than 150 countries throughout the pandemic a policy that critics said made little sense because some countries with high infection rates were not on the restricted list while some on the list had the pandemic more under control the white house said last month it would apply vaccine requirements to foreign nationals traveling from all other countries non u s air travelers will need to show proof of vaccination before boarding a flight and will need to show proof of a recent negative covid 19 test foreign visitors crossing a land border will not need to show proof of a recent negative test the new rules do not require foreign visitors or americans entering the country to go into quarantine americans traveling overseas must still show proof of a recent negative covid 19 test and unvaccinated americans will face stricter testing requirements they will also be subject to restrictions in countries they plan to visit which may include quarantines

mashudu netsianda senior reporter when the cow birthed its first calf he sold it together with the offspring and started a dog breeding business which subsequently catapulted him to a thriving brahman breeding project in 2018 brahman was the first cattle breed to develop in the united states out of crossbreeding between local european breeds and bos indicus breeds such as the guzerat the nelore and gyr which were imported from india mexico and brazil between 1854 and 1926 to introduce hardier cattle for states such as louisiana texas and california starting off with just four brahmans comprising three cows and a bull today mr dlamini manages a herd of 66 brahmans at his plot in nyamandlovu with focus now shifting from livestock rearing for personal consumption to cattle productivity that contributes to the country economic growth in line with vision 2030 and the national development strategy 1 nds1 mr dlamini s promising story is just one of many expected to have a significant impact mr dlamini represents a new crop of smallholder cattle farmers who are taking up livestock breeding seriously and helping the country s beef industry to slowly get back to its feet through his enterprise mr dlamini has joined other farmers in the country who have taken a bold step towards addressing poor breeding feeding and health management strategies that had affected cattle production for years notwithstanding the numerous challenges that still bedevil beef cattle production smallholder farmers are slowly bouncing back and actively contributing towards rebuilding the industry largely affected by illegal sanctions imposed on the country by western countries i dropped out of school in 1999 when i was doing form three following my stepfather s death he was the sole breadwinner and that really affected me emotionally and to make matters worse my mother was not working he said mr dlamini said he started moulding bricks and selling them to locals and it was through that business that he managed to raise money and bought a cow which he later sold and ventured into dog breeding in 2016 he said in 2018 he decided to diversify and went into brahman breeding i started with four beasts which cost me us 7 000 and today i have 66 brahman breeding stock which i bought from a prominent cattle breeder in esigodini he said mr dlamini sells his quality breeds mostly to farmers in neighbouring tsholotsho who are keen on improving the quality of their herds the price of his cattle range between r35 000 and r60 000 depending on the size and weight although mr dlamini is still breeding dogs his major focus is now on his brahman breeding business naturally i love breeding animals and that is why i am still keeping dogs the advantage of breeding brahmans is that they fetch a good price and have fast growth rate unlike indigenous breeds he said mr dlamini is an active member of the brahman breeders society of zimbabwe bbsz with a membership of 70 commercial cattle breeders his cattle are registered in the bbsz database i am always busy because i have to keep updating my livestock records in our society database i also do a lot of research so that i acquaint myself with the ever changing regulations including information on the estimated breeding value for my animals he said due to his passion for livestock breeding mr dlamini enrolled for a short course on animal genetics at a farm in banket i am in the process of looking for a bigger space i did an artificial insemination course and i am in the process of acquiring the equipment which comprises a flask where nitrogen and semen are kept and guns to inseminate the purpose of artificial insemination is to introduce a new genetic in the herd he said innovative breeding technologies like artificial insemination have been embraced and are bringing in a new breed of cattle artificial insemination increases fertility in cattle through use of scientifically proven technology the

suggested that inflation remains a problem as the voices calling for federal reserve action increase former treasury secretary lawrence summers said he was alarmed by the spread of inflation to more goods and said on bloomberg tv friday the fed should taper faster than they re talking about a day earlier morgan stanley ceo james gorman told bloomberg not all inflation will prove to be transitory and the fed will need to be more aggressive to stop it other major financial firm ceos have also gone on record about inflation lingering at least into next year or longer inflation is running very hot at a 30 year high and the transitory the fed s word not ours nature of recent price increases don t seem so transitory said robert ostrowski chief investment officer of the global fixed income group at federated hermes the fed hasn t said when inflation would stop being transitory if it continues he noted the reality is the fed can keep moving the goal posts meaning if you re in the non transitory camp you may never win the how long discussion the bond market ostrowski asserted isn t priced for inflation of 2 25 to 2 5 through next year inflation and bonds don t typically go together the fed could start tapering next month the minutes from its latest meeting suggests and with negative real yields almost across the curve it s hard not to worry that flows at some point could turn negative he said it is possible the economy stumbles causing a sell off in the risk markets that gives bonds a boost but that is not federated hermes base case inflation made a read of the september retail sales report difficult a better than expected september retail sales report says as much about the higher prices that come with supply shortages as it does about the resilience of consumer spending said wells fargo securities senior economist tim quinlan and economist shannon seery retail sales rose 0 7 in september after a 0 9 increase a month earlier while excluding autos sales gained

grocery stores and at restaurants did too said grant thornton economist yelena maleyev while the impact of the delta induced lull in the third quarter is waning she said the economy is facing much higher inflation and goods shortages which will constrain spending for the fourth quarter supply issues will continue into the holiday shopping season leaving the fed no choice but to taper its purchases of treasuries and mortgage backed securities starting in november but morgan stanley researchers said consumers have been resilient despite supply shortages the increase in food services throughout the delta wave suggests households are better equipped to manage around covid flare ups also released friday the university of michigan consumer sentiment index fell to 71 4 in the

be 73 8 current conditions at 82 0 and expectations at 70 3 contrasting retail sales with consumer sentiment quinlan and seery said the broad based strength is a reminder that gloomy sentiment measures are often at odds with actual spending patterns it s possible retailers will see a banner year of holiday sales they said if stores can keep merchandise in stock though that is a big if this

washington oct 15 reuters the white house on friday will lift covid 19 travel restrictions for fully vaccinated international visitors starting nov 8 ending historic restrictions that had barred much of the world from entering the united states for as long as 21 months the unprecedented travel restrictions kept millions of visitors out of the united states from china canada mexico india brazil much of europe and elsewhere shrunk u s tourism and hurt border community economies they prevented many loved ones and foreign workers from reuniting with families oh how i ve missed christmas in ny alexandros koronakis an executive with at t inc in brussels wrote on twitter u s allies had heavily lobbied the biden administration to lift the rules many praised friday s announcement including sweden s ambassador to the united states karin olofsdotter who called it very welcoming news white house spokesman kevin munoz confirmed the nov 8 date on twitter adding the policy is guided by public health stringent and consistent advertisement restrictions on non u s citizens were first imposed on air travelers from china in january 2020 by then president donald trump and then extended to dozens of other countries without any clear metrics for how and when to lift them curbs on non essential travelers at land borders with mexico and canada have been in place since march 2020 to address the covid 19 pandemic reuters first reported friday s announcement of the nov 8 starting date earlier in the day u s airline hotel and cruise industry stocks rose on the news including american airlines up 2 8 marriott international inc up 3 7 and carnival corp up 0 9 u s international air passenger traffic was down 43 in august and overall passenger air traffic was down 21 over pre pandemic levels the u s transportation department said friday airlines have seen an increase in international ticket sales in recent weeks after the white house announced plans to lift the restrictions nick calio chief executive of the airlines for america industry trade group said in a statement calio said the full reopening of international travel is also critical to reviving economies around the globe reinvigorating communities and supporting millions of jobs in the u s and abroad the united states had lagged many other countries in lifting such restrictions advertisement in january trump issued an order to lift travel restrictions on people in europe and brazil but the order was reversed by president joe biden before it took effect the biden administration which repeatedly has said it does endorse so called vaccine passports grappled for months over whether to mandate vaccinations as a condition of lifting country specific restrictions officials told reuters on tuesday the white house announced it would lift restrictions at its land borders and ferry crossings with canada and mexico for fully vaccinated foreign nationals in early november they are similar but not identical to requirements announced last month for international air travelers unvaccinated visitors will still be barred from entering the united states from canada or mexico at land borders canada on aug 9 began allowing fully vaccinated u s visitors for non essential travel the centers for disease control and prevention cdc told reuters last week the united states will accept the use by international visitors of covid 19 vaccines authorized by u s regulators or the world health organization the white house which held a meeting late thursday to finalize the nov 8 date faces some remaining questions including how and what exemptions the biden administration will grant to the vaccine requirements children under 18 for example are largely expected to be exempt from the requirements an official said u s travel association chief executive roger dow said declines in international visits since the pandemic started resulted in more than 250 billion in lost income advertisement dow said in a statement that the nov 8 date is critically important for planning for airlines for travel supported businesses and for millions of travelers worldwide who will now advance plans to visit the united states once again the white house announced on sept 20 that the united states would lift restrictions on air travelers from 33 countries in early november it did not specify the date at the time starting nov 8 the united states will admit fully vaccinated foreign air travelers from the 26 so called schengen countries in europe including france germany italy spain switzerland and greece as well as britain ireland china india south africa iran and brazil the unprecedented u s restrictions have barred non u s citizens who were in those countries within the past 14 days the united states has allowed foreign air travelers from more than 150 countries throughout the pandemic a policy that critics said made little sense because some countries with high infection rates were not on the restricted list while some on the list had the pandemic more under control the white house said last month it would apply vaccine requirements to foreign nationals traveling from all other countries non u s air travelers will need to show proof of vaccination before boarding a flight and will need to show proof of a recent negative covid 19 test foreign visitors crossing a land border will not need to show proof of a recent negative test the new rules do not require foreign visitors or americans entering the country to go into quarantine americans traveling overseas must still show proof of a recent

kissel amanda mandy schmitt mahoney and williams apn has previously published bakhtiari s responses apn has also previously published mahoney s responses apn also published bacote s responses apn reported that bacote has ethics issues and that he has stood in the way of the city of atlanta s public policy initiatives around affordable housing kissel has not responded williams s responses are as follows policy 1 homelessness criminal justice reform currently the city of atlanta code of ordinances criminalizes homelessness in various ways one of these ways is the prohibition on monetary solicitation panhandling in large geographic areas called restricted monetary solicitation zones rmsz s code part ii ch 106 85 11 would you support again repealing rmsz s given that aggressive panhandling would still be banned and panhandling within ten feet of atm s egresses etc would still be banned yes policy 2 homelessness criminal justice reform currently the city of atlanta code of ordinances criminalizes homelessness in various ways one of these ways is through curfew laws making it a crime to be outside while under the age of eighteen during the hours of 11 p m and 6 a m curfew laws currently exempt children or teens who are working going to or from school running an errand for a parent etc there currently are no exemptions for homeless or emancipated minors putting them at risk for being arrested merely for being homeless or emancipated would you support amending code part ii ch 106 227 to add exemptions from the curfew law for homeless minors and emancipated minors yes policy 3 affordable housing currently the city of atlanta has an ordinance on the books requiring a housing inventory so that policymakers and the public will have good data regarding the city s housing stock and the affordability of each housing unit code part ii ch 54 6 however like many city policies it is not being enforced one obstacle to enforcement is lack of data would you support updating the city s business license requirements contained in code part ii chapter 30 to require that any residential lessors required to have a business license to provide annual data on the prices of their rental units within the city of atlanta as part of their annual renewal paperwork yes policy 4 democracy currently the city of atlanta charter sec 2 501 and code of ordinances part ii 2 40 provide for voter initiated referenda whereby a voter could come up with a policy and submit it to the municipal clerk and if enough voters sign a petition the policy will go on the ballot for citywide consideration however upon belief and knowledge this process has never been used due to the high signature burden and other obstacles would you support reducing the petition requirement from fifteen percent of registered voters to fifteen percent of actual voters or potentially even lower yes policy 5 democracy currently the city of atlanta charter sec 2 501 and code of ordinances part ii sec 2 40 provide for voter initiated referenda whereby a voter could come up with a policy and submit it to the municipal clerk and if enough voters sign a petition the policy will go on the ballot for citywide consideration however upon belief and knowledge this process has never been used due to the high signature burden and other obstacles would you support eliminating the requirement contained in sec 2 40 that the municipal clerk check that voters are up to date in paying their property taxes in order to sign a petition a requirement which amounts to a quasi poll tax yes policy 6 environment currently there are seven council committees but none prioritize environmental stewardship would you support amending the code of ordinances part ii ch 2 131 and 2 135 to create a new standing committee on the environment whose task will be to consider the environment first on all policy matters and advance environmental policy yes policy 7 democracy public comment currently the code of ordinances allows committee chairs to restrict public comments to only items on the committee agenda do you support amending code of ordinances part ii ch 2 136 to allow public comment on any matter within the subject matter purview of the committee whether or not the specific matter is not on the agenda of the committee i e a policy that the committee is not currently considering but ought to consider yes policy 8 economy currently the city of atlanta relies primarily on expensive bond financing and other borrowing to fund capital intensive initiatives cities and states around the country are exploring the possibility of launching public banks that would be used to fund things like affordable housing small businesses and solar panel installations with low interest loans would you support a study committee to launch a public bank in atlanta yes policy 9 affordable housing currently the city has three inclusionary zoning zones the beltline overlay westside overlay and westside park overlay code part iii part 16 ch 36a sec 16 36a 004 ch 37 sec 16 37a 004 ch 41 sec 16 41a 004 the beltline and westside overlays currently require developers to set aside either a fifteen percent of units as affordable at 80 percent of the area median income ami or below or b ten percent at 60 percent of ami however the westside park overlay added a new compliance option c where developers can set aside five percent of units at 30 percent of ami or below would you support amending the beltline and westside overlays to add this third option to serve low income families in atlanta yes policy 10 environment the city of atlanta has yet to declare a climate crisis do you support passing a resolution declaring a climate crisis yes policy 11 democracy transparency currently council committees are struggling to meet the requirements of the georgia open meetings act o c g a 50 14 1 et seq especially when committee chairs call votes so quickly as to prevent the recording of vote details do you support amending code part ii sec 2 133 to require committee chairs to call all votes in a manner that permits the committee analyst to record the mover seconder yeas nays abstentions and absences for each vote yes policy 12 democracy currently members of the public have only two minutes to speak per person in full council meetings however seniors are often observed struggling to make their comments within the allotted time research shows that cognitive processing time declines at age 67 a half standard deviation from the mean and a full standard deviation at 79 murman 2015 ebaid et al 2017 emory university 2019 would you support amending code part ii secs 2 104 to provide additional public comment speaking time for seniors and for persons with disabilities requiring reasonable accommodation specifically an additional minute for those seniors 67 and above an additional two minutes for those above 79 and an appropriate case by case accommodation for persons with cognitive or speaking related disabilities yes policy 13 criminal justice reform currently the city of atlanta has higher penalties for drug crimes occurring within drug free commercial zones the council recently rejected adopting a new drug free commercial zone in district 4 west end because the zones tend to be in high minority areas and because they send the wrong signal to police regarding proportionality of enforcement however the council has not repealed the city s existing drug free commercial zones do you support repealing the existing zones contained in code part ii ch 106 403 such that drug crimes will still be illegal in the city of atlanta but there will not be heightened enforcement or penalties in certain areas yes policy 14 affordable housing currently the city has three inclusionary zoning zones the beltline overlay westside overlay and westside park overlay code part iii part 16 ch 36a sec 16 36a 004 ch 37 sec 16 37a 004 ch 41 sec 16 41a 004 the beltline and westside overlays currently require developers to set aside a fifteen percent of units as affordable at 80 percent of the area median income ami or below or b ten percent at 60 percent of ami or below the westside park overlay added a new compliance option c where developers can set aside five percent of units at 30 percent of ami or below however under this framework a developer would choose only one price point for compliance with the affordability requirement instead of providing a mix of incomes to promote mixed income communities would you support for large projects of fifty units or more amending all three iz areas to require a 3 3 3 plan at least three percent of units affordable at 80 percent ami at least three percent at 60 percent ami and at least three percent at 30 percent ami yes i think the 3 3 3 initiative is a good start but likely insufficient to meet the needs for affordable housing policy 15 affordable housing currently the city of atlanta has no consistent citywide policy around using zoning and land use incentives to negotiate voluntary commitments to affordable housing i e a voluntary inclusionary zoning policy the code has a few zones with density bonuses that are under utilized because height would be a better incentive do you support amending code part iii part 16 ch 28 adopting a citywide inclusionary zoning policy to empower neighborhoods to self designate as height bonus areas whereby development projects would be eligible for additional height by providing affordable housing units yes policy 16 democracy npu s currently npu s are empowered to make recommendations regarding any matter of public policy to the city of atlanta per code part iii part 6 sec 6 3013 c however the department of planning only routinely communicates recommendations regarding only certain zoning matters and other specific categories of policy matters to the city council and the mayor this means it is up to each npu to communicate their recommendations to the atlanta city council and mayor do you support amending the code to require the department of planning to provide a monthly report to the atlanta city council of all npu votes on matters not otherwise included on the full council meeting agenda and that this monthly report shall be included in any full council meeting agendas as an attachment for any meetings that fall within that month yes policy 17 democracy npu s npu s make recommendations regarding policy to the city council but npu s do not and legally cannot have veto power over city council decisions with which they do not agree however npu s often wonder whether council members are listening to them especially when council members go against the wishes of one or more npu s would you support the creation of a responsive statement to neighborhoods whereby one or more councilmembers may provide an optional statement called a responsive statement to neighborhoods by which they explain how they considered the input of one or more npu s with respect to one or more legislative items and all responsive statements to neighborhoods shall be attached to the appropriate meeting agendas yes policy 18 democracy npu s currently the code allows npus to utilize representative voting whereby individual residents and businesses lose their individual voting rights to vote on matters at npu meetings and whereby in certain npu s only neighborhood association delegates and business community delegates vote on what recommendations to make to the city council code part iii part 6 sec

this post is also available in portuguese taken together with a sharp increase in union strikes the mass resignations of individuals indicate a deep worker dissatisfaction across the nation by sonali kolhatkar on september 14 a young woman in louisiana named beth mcgrath posted a selfie facebook video of herself working at walmart her body language shows a nervous energy as she works up the courage to speak on the intercom and announces her resignation to shoppers everyone here is overworked and underpaid she begins before going on to call out specific managers for inappropriate and abusive behavior i hope you don t speak to your families the way you speak to us she said before ending with f k this job perhaps mcgrath was inspired by shana ragland in lubbock texas who nearly a year ago carried out a similarly public resignation in a tiktok video that she posted from the walmart store where she worked ragland s complaints were similar to mcgrath s as she accused managers of constantly disparaging workers i hope you don t talk to your daughters the way you talk to me she said over the store intercom before signing off with f k the managers f k this company the viral resignations of these two young women are bookending a year of volatility in the american workforce that economists have branded the great resignation women in particular are seen as leading the trend the seriousness of the situation was confirmed by the latest bureau of labor statistics report showing that a record 2 9 percent of the workforce quit their jobs in august which is equivalent to 4 3 million resignations if such a high rate of resignations were occurring at a time when jobs were plentiful it might be seen as a sign of a booming economy where workers have their pick of offers but the same labor report showed that job openings have also declined suggesting that something else is going on a new harris poll of people with employment found that more than half of workers want to leave their jobs many cite uncaring employers and a lack of scheduling flexibility as reasons for wanting to quit in other words millions of american workers have simply had enough so serious is the labor market upheaval that jack kelly senior contributor to forbes com a pro corporate news outlet has defined the trend as a sort of workers revolution and uprising against bad bosses and tone deaf companies that refuse to pay well and take advantage of their staff in what might be a reference to viral videos like those of mcgrath ragland and the growing trend of quitmyjob posts kelly goes on to say the quitters are making a powerful positive and self affirming statement saying that they won t take the abusive behavior any longer still some advisers suggest countering the worker rage with bonding exercises such as gratitude sharing and games others suggest increasing trust between workers and bosses or exercis empathetic curiosity with employees but such superficial approaches entirely miss the point the resignations ought to be viewed hand in hand with another powerful current that many economists are ignoring a growing willingness by unionized workers to go on strike film crews may soon halt work as 60 000 members of the international alliance of theatrical stage employees iatse announced an upcoming national strike about 10 000 employees of john deere who are represented by the united auto workers are also preparing to strike after rejecting a new contract kaiser permanente is facing a potential strikefrom 24 000 of its nurses and other health care workers in western states over poor pay and labor conditions and about 1 400 kellogg workers in nebraska michigan pennsylvania and tennessee are already strikingover poor pay and benefits the announced strikes are coming so thick and fast that former u s labor secretary robert reich has dubbed the situation an unofficial general strike yet union representation remains extremely low across the united states the result of decades of concerted corporate led efforts to undermine the bargaining power of workers today only about 12 percent of workers are in a union the number of strikes and of striking workers might be far higher if more workers were unionized non union workers like mcgrath and ragland hired by historically anti union companies like walmart might have been able to organize their fellow workers instead of resorting to individual resignations while viral social media posts of quitting are impactful in driving the conversation around worker dissatisfaction they have little direct bearing on the lives of the workers and the colleagues they leave behind one example of how union organizing made a concrete difference to working conditions is a new contract that 7 000 drug store workers at rite aid and cvs stores in los angeles just ratified the united food and commercial workers local 770 negotiated a nearly 10 percent pay raise for workers as well as improved benefits and safety standards and when companies don t comply workers have more leverage when acting as a collective bargaining unit than as individuals take nabisco workers who went on strike in five states this summer mondelez international nabisco s parent company saw record profits during the pandemic with surging sales of its snack foods so flush was the company with cash that it compensated its ceo with a whopping 16 8 million annual pay and spent 1 5 billion on stock buybacks earlier this year meanwhile the average worker salary was an appallingly low 31 000 a year many nabisco jobs were sent across the border to mexico where the company was able to further drive down labor costs after weeks on the picket line striking nabisco workers represented by the bakery confectionery tobacco workers and grain millers international union returned to work having won modest retroactive raises of 2 25 percent 5 000 bonuses and increased employer contributions to their retirement plans the company which reported a 12 percent increase in revenue earlier this year can well afford this and more taken together with mass resignations such worker strikes reveal a deep dissatisfaction with the nature of american work that has been decades in the making corporate america has enjoyed a stranglehold over policy spending its profits on lobbying the government to ensure even greater profits at the expense of workers rights at the same time the power of unions has fallen a trend directly linked to increased economic inequality but now as workers are flexing their power corporate america is worried in the wake of these strikes and resignations lawmakers are actively trying to strengthen existing federal labor laws business groups are lobbying democrats to weaken pro labor measures included in the build back better act that is being debated in congress currently corporate employers can violate labor laws with little consequence as the national labor relations board nlrb lacks the authority to fine offenders but democrats want to give the nlrb the authority to impose fines of 50 000 to 100 000 against companies who violate federal labor laws also included in the build back better act is an increase in fines against employers that violate occupational safety and health administration osha standards the coalition for a democratic workplace which is a business lobby group that wants anything but democracy in the workplace is deeply concerned about these proposed changes and sent a letter to lawmakers to that effect it remains to be seen if corporate lobbyists will succeed this time around at keeping labor laws toothless but as workers continue to quit their jobs and as strikes among unionized workers grow employers ignore the warning signs of rage and frustration at their

health stringent and consistent advertisement restrictions on non u s citizens were first imposed on air travelers from china in january 2020 by then president donald trump and then extended to dozens of other countries without any clear metrics for how and when to lift them curbs on non essential travelers at land borders with mexico and canada have been in place since march 2020 to address the covid 19 pandemic reuters first reported friday s announcement of the nov 8 starting date earlier in the day u s airline hotel and cruise industry stocks rose on the news including american airlines up 2 8 marriott international inc up 3 7 and carnival corp up 0 9 u s international air passenger traffic was down 43 in august and overall passenger air traffic was down 21 over pre pandemic levels the u s transportation department said friday airlines have seen an increase in international ticket sales in recent weeks after the white house announced plans to lift the restrictions nick calio chief executive of the airlines for america industry trade group said in a statement calio said the full reopening of international travel is also critical to reviving economies around the globe reinvigorating communities and supporting millions of jobs in the u s and abroad the united states had lagged many other countries in lifting such restrictions advertisement in january trump issued an order to lift travel restrictions on people in europe and brazil but the order was reversed by president joe biden before it took effect the biden administration which repeatedly has said it does endorse so called vaccine passports grappled for months over whether to mandate vaccinations as a condition of lifting country specific restrictions officials told reuters on tuesday the white house announced it would lift restrictions at its land borders and ferry crossings with canada and mexico for fully vaccinated foreign nationals in early november they are similar but not identical to requirements announced last month for international air travelers unvaccinated visitors will still be barred from entering the united states from canada or mexico at land borders canada on aug 9 began allowing fully vaccinated u s visitors for non essential travel the centers for disease control and prevention cdc told reuters last week the united states will accept the use by international visitors of covid 19 vaccines authorized by u s regulators or the world health organization the white house which held a meeting late thursday to finalize the nov 8 date faces some remaining questions including how and what exemptions the biden administration will grant to the vaccine requirements children under 18 for example are largely expected to be exempt from the requirements an official said u s travel association chief executive roger dow said declines in international visits since the pandemic started resulted in more than 250 billion in lost income advertisement dow said in a statement that the nov 8 date is critically important for planning for airlines for travel supported businesses and for millions of travelers worldwide who will now advance plans to visit the united states once again the white house announced on sept 20 that the united states would lift restrictions on air travelers from 33 countries in early november it did not specify the date at the time starting nov 8 the united states will admit fully vaccinated foreign air travelers from the 26 so called schengen countries in europe including france germany italy spain switzerland and greece as well as britain ireland china india south africa iran and brazil the unprecedented u s restrictions have barred non u s citizens who were in those countries within the past 14 days the united states has allowed foreign air travelers from more than 150 countries throughout the pandemic a policy that critics said made little sense because some countries with high infection rates were not on the restricted list while some on the list had the pandemic more under control the white house said last month it would apply vaccine requirements to foreign nationals traveling from all other countries non u s air travelers will need to show proof of vaccination before boarding a flight and will need to show proof of a recent negative covid 19 test foreign visitors crossing a land border will not need to show proof of a recent negative test the new rules do not require foreign visitors or americans entering the country to go into quarantine americans traveling overseas must still show proof of a recent negative covid 19 test and unvaccinated americans will face stricter testing requirements they will also be subject to restrictions in countries they plan to visit which may include quarantines

1 800 proves to be a tough resistance to crack for gold us treasury bond yields continue to drive xau usd s action chinese growth data and markit manufacturing pmis stand out in next week s calendar gold started the week in a calm fashion and spent the first two trading days fluctuating in a tight range above 1 750 with the us treasury bond yields falling sharply however xau usd gathered bullish momentum and gained nearly 2 on wednesday before extending its rally to a fresh monthly high above 1 800 on thursday ahead of the weekend gold reversed its direction once again on rising us t bond yields and erased the majority of its weekly gains to settle around 1 770 what happened last week the market action was subdued on monday as the us bond markets were closed due to the columbus day holiday when american investors returned on tuesday the benchmark 10 year us t bond yield lost more than 3 and helped gold inch higher on the other hand the poor performance of us stocks allowed the greenback to outperform its rivals and limited xau usd s upside on wednesday us t bond yields continued to push lower and the dollar came under heavy bearish pressure during the american trading hours the data published by the us bureau of labor statistics revealed that the core consumer price index cpi stayed unchanged on a yearly basis at 4 in september and this reading provided a boost to risk sentiment additionally upbeat third quarter earnings from big us financial institutions made it difficult for the safe haven greenback to find demand moreover gold attracted additional technical buyers after piercing through the upper limit of its near term trading channel at 1 770 the data from the us showed on thursday that the annual producer price index ppi rose to 8 6 in september from 8 3 in august furthermore the us department of labor announced that there were 293 000 initial claims for unemployment benefits in the us during the week ending october 9 reflecting the risk positive

reaction from market participants next week third quarter gross domestic product gdp data from china will be looked upon for fresh impetus at the beginning of the week investors expect the chinese economy to grow by 5 2 on a yearly basis after expanding by 7 9 in the second quarter september retail sales and industrial production data will be featured in the chinese economic docket as well in case these prints point to a considerable slowdown in the world s second biggest economy safe haven flows could dominate the markets and help the dollar keep a firm footing and vice versa on wednesday consumer price index cpi data from the uk and the euro area will highlight the economic calendar nevertheless these figures are unlikely to have a direct impact on xau usd federal reserve bank of philadelphia s october manufacturing survey and the weekly initial jobless claims data from the us will be watched closely before the ihs markit published the flash manufacturing and services pmi reports for the uk germany the euro area and the us in the meantime investors will pay attention to the us treasury bond yields the benchmark 10 year us t bond yield has managed to hold above the key 1 5 level despite the weekly decline and gold could come under bearish pressure in case the greenback capitalizes on rising yields gold technical outlook the relative strength index rsi indicator on the daily chart returned to the 50 area on friday suggesting that buyers are struggling to remain in control of gold s action the initial support is located at 1 770 former resistance fibonacci 61 8 retracement of the april june uptrend a daily close below that level could open the door for additional losses toward the 20 day sma at 1 760 and 1 750 lower limit of the previous trading channel on the upside the 50 day sma seems to have formed dynamic resistance at 1 780 before 1 800 fibonacci 50 retracement 100 day sma 200 day sma in case buyers manage to lift the price above the latter the recovery could extend toward 1 825 fibonacci 38 2 retracement however sellers are likely to defend this resistance unless gold is fueled by a fundamental driver gold sentiment poll the fxstreet

of drugs for neurodegenerative diseases its lead therapeutic product candidate is called simufilam formerly pti 125 developed as a treatment for alzheimer s disease ad and its lead investigational diagnostic product candidate was savadx a blood based biomarker diagnostic to detect ad simufilam purportedly targets an altered form of a protein called filamin a flna in the alzheimer s brain and reverts it to its native healthy conformation thereby countering the downstream toxic effects of altered flna the company s financial viability is largely dependent upon the clinical success of simufilam as the company currently has no sources of revenues on february 2 2021 cassava announced results from its interim analysis of an open label study of simufilam which purportedly demonstrated that patients cognition and behavior scores both improved following six months of simufilam treatment with no safety issues according to the company n a clinical study funded by the national institutes of health and conducted by cassava sciences six months of simufilam treatment improved cognition scores by 1 6 points on adas cog11 a 10 mean improvement from baseline to month 6 and n

materially false and or misleading statements as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the company s business operations and prospects specifically defendants failed to disclose to investors that 1 the quality and integrity of the scientific data supporting cassava s claims for simufilam s efficacy had been overstated 2 data underlying the foundational research for cassava s product candidates had been manipulated 3 experiments using post mortem human brain tissue frozen for nearly 10 years was contrary to a basic understanding of neurobiology 4 biomarker analysis for patients treated with simufilam had been manipulated to conclude that simufilam was effective 5 quanterix corp quanterix an independent company had not interpreted the test results or prepared the data charts for the biomarker analysis for patients treated with simufilam 6 as a result of the foregoing there was a reasonable likelihood that cassava would face regulatory scrutiny in connection with the development of simufilam and 7 as a result of all the foregoing defendants positive statements during the class period about the company s business metrics and financial prospects and the likelihood of u s food and drug administration fda approval were false and misleading and or lacked a reasonable basis on july 29 2021 cassava issued a press release entitled cassava sciences

simufilam the petition requested that the fda halt cassava s clinical trials pending a thorough audit of the publications and data relied upon by the company among other things the petition stated that the etailed analysis of the western blots shows a series of anomalies that are suggestive of systematic data manipulation and misrepresentation it also stated that the methodology for studies about simufilam s effects in experiments conducted on postmortem human brain tissue defies logic and the data presented again have hallmarks of manipulation the petition further stated that after initial analyses of phase 2b trials found that simufilam was ineffective in improving the primary biomarkers endpoint cassava had these samples analyzed again and this time reported that simufilam rapidly and robustly improved a wide array of biomarkers and the reanalysis shows signs of data anomalies or manipulation on august 25 2021 before the market opened cassava issued a response to the petition claiming that the allegations regarding scientific integrity are false and misleading among other things the company claimed that the clinical data which the citizen petition stated had been

mike richard special for the gardner news how many times have you heard it someone finds themselves inundated by unexpected bills or unusually heavy debt and they mutter if this keeps up i ll wind up in the poorhouse what you may not have realized is that not only did gardner once have a poorhouse of its very own but there was also a sad case of an entire family within the confines of the town sold off as paupers back in 1849 a farm and some 233 acres of land owned by abram stone which was located in north gardner near the winchendon line was purchased by the town for the purpose of creating a pauper farm a new barn was built at a cost of 3 000 while an additional 1 000 was authorized for the purchase of stock and furnishings for the farm mr stone became the first overseer at what was then called the gardner work house governed by the overseers of the poor according to esther gilman moore s history of gardner massachusetts 1785 1967 the upton family however in the years preceding the purchase and use of a poor farm in gardner a rather sad and unfortunate chapter in gardner s history centered around the family of oliver upton when the town of gardner was incorporated in 1785 upton was one of the 61 original settlers to sign the petition for township very little is known about upton except for the fact that he married susannah styles of fitchburg and died in 1821 this mansion is big old and beautiful and it s also said to be very haunted for some unknown reason a short time after the incorporation of the town of gardner the upton family apparently fell upon hard times to the point where they were considered paupers since the town did not have the means to care for the poor and indigent the manner by which they were annually disposed of was through what was called a vendue otherwise known as a public auction this was not the equivalent to the practice of the southern slave dealer but rather a method of public charity that was demanded as a necessity of the times according to the town warrant for jan 5 1789 individuals within the town were being charged to take care and provide for upton and his family by vendue to the lowest bidders a committee was selected to draw up the condition of sale the warrant later pointed out that the lowest bidder would have upton and his family until the march meeting with their household stuff and to provide victuals and drink convenient for them and to take care of them ebenezer eaton of south gardner who was chosen as vendue master in gardner in 1782 oversaw the conditions of sale the big chair this gardner icon is one for the record books oliver upton and his wife susannah were bid off by simon gates at 10 shillings per week while their oldest child was also bid off by gates at 1 shilling per week john heywood bid off the second child at 10 pence per week while a third child was bid off by andrew beard at 1 shilling 2 pence per week their fourth child was bid off by ebenezer bolton at 1 shilling 9 pence per week this method of disposing of the poor continued in gardner until 1849 when the town farm was purchased for use as a poorhouse while there were likely other examples of this in gardner s past the sad case of the upton family was the most widely known the area is now rich in protected forest land in march of 1969 the area off green street near the winchendon line was dedicated as a conservation area today a sign on the property boundary proclaims it the stewardship forest according to the city s website there are nearly 1 800 acres in the area of north gardner that are part of the forest stewardship plan the cowee pond reservoir located in the northern corner of gardner along the winchendon and ashburnham town lines has more than 760 acres nearby is the 774 acre perley brook reservoir forest which is located in the northern corner of gardner along the winchendon town line that forest is located on the north and south sides of route 140 finally there is the crystal lake reservoir forest more than 260 acres located in the urban section of gardner along the northern city limits elsewhere in the city are the snake pond forest stewardship in a southwest section of gardner along the templeton town line on the south side of route 2 and the wildwood cemetery forest on the west side of gardner on the south side of route 68 near otter river and the templeton town line so while portions of north gardner were once home to a poor farm today the area is rich in protected forest land comments and suggestions for then and now can be sent to mike richard at mikerichard0725 gmail com or in writing to mike richard 92 boardley road sandwich ma 02563

published in partnership with the usc price center for social innovation in support of the neighborhood data for social change platform ndsc the platform is a free publicly available online data resource that provides reliable aggregated data at the city neighborhood and census tract level the mission of the usc price center for social innovation is to develop ideas and illuminate strategies to improve the quality of life for people in low income urban communities home affordability in the usc area in 2006 when usc began planning its new mixed use village development the unidad coalition a group of community based organizations in south central arose to ensure that it contained concrete benefits for the long term residents in the surrounding community with their organizing unidad negotiated a community benefits agreement that included a 20 million investment from usc towards an affordable housing development fund of which usc has currently contributed 10 million to as a fulfillment of part of the community benefits agreement neighborhood data for social change has created the usc area housing dashboard to track the demographic residential stability and built environment relevant data surrounding the community this data story takes a deeper dive into some of the trends shown on the dashboard by examining single family mortgage applications in the usc area in the last decade following the great recession the racial wealth gap gentrification over the last century in america widespread homeownership has been a key component of the narrative about an american dream and of a society with opportunities for social mobility despite its many financial benefits all americans have not had equal access to homeownership america is a nation marked by racial injustice and inequality and this inequality is deeply implicated within and cannot be separated from housing in 2016 the federal reserve noted that the average white family has eight times the wealth of the average black family and then five times the wealth of the average latina o family a separate analysis found that rates of homeownership in the black community today in the second decade of the 21st century are as low as they were in the 1960s racist housing policies like redlining enacted by the federal housing authority during the 20th century and predatory lending practices against black and latina o households by large financial institutions in the years leading up to the great recession have led to this systemic wealth gap along racial and ethnic lines in recent years many historically black and latina o neighborhoods in cities across the u s have experienced large increases in property values due to an influx of wealthy and oftentimes white residents a phenomenon known as gentrification a recent study found that between 2000 and 2013 over 110 000 black residents and nearly 25 000 latino a residents were displaced from u s metro areas due to gentrification given all of these compounding and systemic barriers that exist for people of color to build wealth and thrive in their own communities new economics for women is an organization that seeks to create economic mobility for communities of color through wealth creation housing education entrepreneurship and civic engagement this data story examines homebuying trends over the last decade in the historically black and latina o community surrounding the university of southern california usc and how new economics for women is promoting wealth building and homeownership for longtime residents new economics for women clients outside a home new economics for women housing justice in the usc area in this story the usc area refers to exposition park and historic south central the neighborhoods surrounding usc on its west and east sides respectively this usc area is home to a predominantly latina o and black community in 2019 61 of residents identified as latina o 13 identified as black 11 as asian and 11 as white the area has experienced systemic oppression and a lack of investment over multiple decades but it is also home to community based organizations and movements advocating for progressive policy changes in the city of los angeles like many other historically black neighborhoods in los angeles and other metro areas the black population in the usc area has been displaced over the last several decades as shown in the visualization below in 1990 the neighborhood was home to over 20 200 black residents 24 of the population by 2019 there were just under 11 500 black residents in the area making up 13 of the population american community survey u s decennial census over that time period the physical characteristics of the neighborhood also changed as usc expanded its campus and built new developments such as the galen center and the gateway towers like many other gentrifying metropolitan areas across the u s the usc area has experienced a substantial increase in home property values over the last decade according to analysis conducted using zillow home value index data the typical home value in the two zip codes making up the usc area more than doubled from just under 284 000 in 2010 to over 656 000 by 2020 as shown in the figure below the larger city and county of los angeles have also experienced large increases in typical home value however the usc area differs in important ways from the larger city and county that make the exponential growth in home values difficult to navigate for longtime residents of the neighborhood for example the share of residents who are homeowners in the usc area has consistently hovered around 15 over the last decade less than half of the city of los angeles average american community survey this means that a small share of neighborhood residents would have been generating wealth from the large increases in neighborhood home values additionally in 2019 72 of usc area residents over the age of 25 were making under 60 000 in income meaning that buying a home at the quickly rising prices is likely financially unfeasible for the vast majority of neighborhood residents american community survey the area around usc has experienced systemic oppression and a lack of investment over multiple decades resulting in housing injustice furthermore as shown in the chart below the share of usc area residents making under 30 000 fell by 10 points over the last decade while the share of residents making over 100 000 has doubled suggesting that residents with low incomes have been displaced by wealthier residents american community survey the changing demographics of homebuyers a stock photo of a mortgage application form with a red denied stamp just as there have been significant changes in the home values and incomes of usc area residents there have also been substantial changes in the demographics of people who are applying to purchase single family homes in the neighborhood in 2010 people who identify as latino a made up 62 of the neighborhood s population and 60 of the neighborhood s mortgage applicants a decade later latino as still make up roughly 60 of the resident population but they account for just 37 of mortgage applicants people who identify as white or asian have made up an increasingly large share of mortgage applicants since 2010 in 2019 they made up 22 of the neighborhood s residents and 58 of mortgage applicants home mortgage disclosure act american community survey in addition to the fact that black and latina os are making up a smaller share of mortgage applicants in the usc area when such households have applied for mortgages they have gotten denied by financial institutions at higher rates than white and asian households across both the city and the usc area black and latina o households have experienced higher rates of mortgage application denials than other racial ethnic groups since 2010 furthermore applications from black households were denied at much higher rates in the usc area than the citywide average home mortgage disclosure act while racial discrimination from financial institutions is very likely a factor in the discrepancy in denial rates read more about racial discrimination in small business lending in this october 2020 data story there are likely other institutional barriers at play financial literacy affordability barriers new economics for women clients courtesy of new economics for women as shown in the chart below households in the middle income range of mortgage applicants those with incomes between 69 000 and 128 000 were denied at significantly higher rates in the usc area compared to the city average home mortgage disclosure act according to new economics who works with first time homebuyers to navigate the mortgage application process households in these middle income ranges simply would not be able to afford the skyrocketing home prices in the usc neighborhood over the last year new economics worked with clients with incomes ranging between 62 000 and 80 000 falling into the lowest two income groups on the chart above across the city of los angeles new s clients are on average already in a significant amount of debt due to student loans and the use of credit cards to supplement income for basic needs in order to afford a home in the usc area at current prices new s clients would be paying between 62 79 of their monthly incomes towards a mortgage and debt payments according to new financial institutions typically allow a debt to income ratio between 43 50 which may explain in part why applicants in these middle income categories have been denied at higher rates in neighborhoods like the usc area that are becoming increasingly unaffordable in addition to affordability issues however new notes there are also systemic knowledge gaps for middle and lower income first time homebuyers often such borrowers contact a real estate agent or loan officer to seek financing before they properly understand their financial profile in a financial industry that has been historically predatory against lower income households and people of color such households are left at best with a mortgage denial or at worst a financially unsustainable amount of debt looking forward a new economics for women client signs a document courtesy of new economics for women new s homebuyer education program has been providing homeownership education and guidance for nearly 20 years in that time the program has evolved with the ever changing real estate market to keep participants competitive and well prepared to step into homeownership households who participate in new s homebuyer education program before meeting with an agent or loan officer are 95 less likely to get denied for a mortgage loan in order to reduce denial rates loan and real estate professionals should encourage first time homeowners to go through a homebuyer education program prior to seeking financing for a home however financial literacy is a small piece of the complex housing affordability crisis in neighborhoods like the area surrounding usc homebuyer education programs alone can t stop the widespread displacement of black and latino a residents who have called south central home for decades our team at new must be very honest sometimes painfully honest with our participants says rosie papazian new s program manager the sad truth is that many of them will not be able to afford it here but if the goal is to build wealth let s see where you can make it happen and build from there for

excavations at an ice age hunter gatherer camp in utah s great salt lake desert have revealed the oldest known evidence of tobacco use found so far the discovery took place at the wishbone site and was hidden only a few centimeters below the surface during their excavations researchers discovered a campground used by the prehistoric hunter gatherers 12 300 years ago the oldest evidence of tobacco use in north america the site contains several points of interest including the charred remains of an ancient hearth a finely crafted spear point and a collection of tobacco seeds archaeologist daron duke of far western anthropological research group in henderson nev and colleagues were especially intrigued by the four charred seeds which they discovered came from wild tobacco plants according to science news three of the seeds were radiocarbon dated to approximately 12 300 years old this makes their discovery the oldest known evidence of tobacco use in north america the scientists write in their article in nature human behavior that the plants were gathered on foothills or mountains located 13 kilometers or more from the wishbone area burned tobacco seeds found at an archaeological site in utah including this seed shown here from multiple angles date to more than 12 000 years ago d duke et al nature human behavior 2021 exploring the wishbone site when the site was occupied it would have been part of a marshland and some of the other finds in and around the fireplace are bones of waterfowl such as ducks a long intact stone point another stone point which is broken in two seeds of various wetland plants and a bone implement the first exploration of the wishbone site took place in 2015 and in the early stages the team was focused on thousands of acres of a range that had never been explored before when archaeologists returned in 2016 they focused on an area where they found a collection of over 60 items many of the artifacts have provided insight into what hunter gatherers ate in the ice age in 2015 duke also reported a staggering array of more than 1 000 large stone points found at the site the area contained traces of mammoth residue providing the first evidence of mammoth hunting in the great basin the tools discovered in the area were also dated back to the ice age when the temperature was around 10 15 degrees cooler on average than now however the most important part of the discovery is the evidence of tobacco use at such an early period in history tobacco seeds parinya adobe stock how did the hunter gatherers use the tobacco duke says that the researchers are uncertain how exactly the ancient north american hunter gatherers used the tobacco it s possible that tobacco was smoked at the wishbone site and that people may have twisted tobacco leaves stems and other plant fibers into balls and chewed or sucked them before spitting out or discarding the seeds other studies have shown that the ancestors of the pueblo people were chewing wild tobacco between around 1 000 and 2 000 years ago in what s now arizona the earliest evidence researchers have for the use of domesticated tobacco comes from south america but it only dates to 8000 years ago but that doesn t rule out an earlier domestication date in north america duke says that certain groups wound up domesticating particular species typically alongside food crops ancient pipe study reveals what native americans were smoking a 2020 study revealed that native americans also smoked plants other than tobacco in their pipes a multidisciplinary team from washington university made the discovery while studying a 1430 year old pipe that was once used by people who inhabited what is now washington state they used a new technology known as metabolomics based analysis which can provide more data than the traditional biomarker method and potentially detect thousands of plant residues what they found was evidence for the smoking of smooth sumac rhus glabra mixed in with the tobacco one of the lead researchers dr korey brownstein said we think the rhus glabra may have been mixed with tobacco for its medicinal qualities and to improve the flavor of smoke smooth sumac homer edward price cc by 2 0 top image the storyteller by martin pate courtesy southeast archeological center national park service updated on october 15 2021
