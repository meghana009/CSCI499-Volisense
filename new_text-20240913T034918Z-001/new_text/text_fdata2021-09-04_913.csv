good evening i m karen kaplan and it s friday sept 3 here s the latest on what s happening with the coronavirus in california and beyond as we head into labor day weekend we bring you the tale of two tireless entrepreneurs with a bona fide pandemic hit on their hands but since the coronavirus has a way of flipping everything on its head theirs isn t entirely a success story the pair in question are melinda hwang and ed fu the west l a couple behind happy masks their 24 face coverings are all the rage especially among parents whose kids are old enough to be going back to school but are too young to get vaccinated indeed masks sized for children account for about 80 of the company s runaway sales hwang is a graduate of mit s sloan school of management and the former marketing director of capital group an investment management firm fu has a degree from harvard business school and served as chief marketing officer of ziprecruiter a hiring website despite their credentials they didn t set out to create a mask business the masks were developed in taiwan by a scientist who collaborated with hwang s father on a new type of filter for wastewater treatment the 2003 sars outbreak prompted the scientist to adapt the filter for use in masks and when covid 19 burst onto the scene in 2020 he shared some with friends and family advertisement hwang fu and their three young children wore the masks around their neighborhood wearers find that the masks with a design reminiscent of a parrot s beak make it easier to speak and breathe without fogging up one s glasses sewn inside is a nano fiber membrane filter capable of blocking particles as small as 3 micrometers a micrometer is 10 000 times smaller than a centimeter for the record an earlier version of this newsletter said a micrometer was only 100 times smaller than a centimeter the masks attracted attention and soon hwang was asking her parents if she could get extras for friends neighbors and other acquaintances as requests poured in she realized she had the makings of a business happy masks founders melinda hwang and husband ed fu have seen their company s face coverings become a back to school sensation gary coronado los angeles times the masks were in demand from the start hwang s first callout to parents in a facebook group for one of her daughter s classes generated orders for more than 1 000 masks after receiving a glowing online review that said happy masks filtered small particles better than many other masks customers bought up the entire inventory the harder the masks were to find the more popular they became when a new allotment of masks went on sale aug 9 about 16 000 would be customers swarmed the site and 90 of them left empty handed the same thing happened three days later advertisement nikki hart a mother of two in culver city put three masks in her cart within seconds of the aug 9 sale getting underway but by the time she hit the purchase button her selections were out of stock it felt like i was trying to get tickets to the rolling stones hart said you might think this was a good problem for a new company to have but you d feel differently if you were fielding hundreds of emails from an angry and frustrated public some disgruntled parents posted complaints on instagram one critic called happy masks a marketing scam some of the most anguish inducing messages came from the parents of immunocompromised children she said hwang said the situation left her feeling like she d let everyone down at one point she said the stress caused her to burst into tears she and fu have experimented with different ways of allocating masks among customers with some success but there will be kinks to work out until they can ramp up their production without sacrificing quality plenty of customers are willing to wait they want to experience the joy of laura gaskill a mother of two in naperville ill who has purchased 25 happy masks there is no higher praise than your 6 year old wearing a mask all day and forgetting he has it on gaskill said we ve been so grateful to have a little bit of control over something as completely chaotic as covid by the numbers

louisiana this week the pandemic just makes everything even harder hospitals that could have been focused on treating storm victims were already brimming with covid 19 patients once the storm hit the best equipped medical centers struggled to keep ventilators and other essential machinery functioning on backup generators other hospitals had to evacuate their fragile patients three dozen shelters around the state took in nearly 2 000 people displaced by the storm they struggled to take pandemic precautions like encouraging masking and social distancing at one shelter in laplace near new orleans only one of the two sheriff s deputies sitting behind a counter wore a face covering behavior like that made dontrell riley nervous she opted to take her four children out to the sidewalk rather than wait inside i just hope we stay safe and don t catch covid riley said nudging a blue surgical mask to cover her nose i seen a lot of people here and i know it s dangerous demetrice joseph left waits with her family at a makeshift dropoff center in laplace la after a boat rescued them from their flooded home jennie jarvie los angeles times demetrice joseph also felt safer outside especially since she wasn t able to grab a mask when she left her waterlogged home nor did she see any masks at the shelter when she lined up to check in we don t want to catch it she said as she and several relatives kept their distance from a growing crowd of evacuees most not wearing masks joseph was particularly concerned about her mother who has asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary

100 of our cases are attributable to this delta variant he said everything we re doing needs to be done with covid in mind so it s important we mask and wash hands and do all of these things to the maximum extent possible that message apparently didn t impress cain dufrene the chief of operations for st john the baptist parish fire services i ll be honest with you we really didn t take too many covid protocols he said after pulling a 30 hour shift we re going to save the life rather than trying to worry too much about the covid stuff like many of the local officials and emergency workers

the best stocks are the underappreciated ones like alimentation couche tard tsx atd a tsx atd b the best stocks are the ones that are underestimated sometimes investors need to dig in a little deeper to recognize an opportunity others may have missed one such source of hidden value is the payout ratio the amount of money a company pays out in dividends compared to how much it can actually afford to pay stocks with low payout ratios are in my view hidden gems these companies can sustain their dividends during downturns they can also raise their dividends easily every year if economic conditions are favourable it s a win win with that in mind here are the best stocks that are secretly dividend stars best stock for retail investors alimentation couche tard tsx atd a tsx atd b is my top pick for a hidden dividend star the stock offers a paltry 0 7 dividend yield that s probably why no one considers it a viable income stock however couche tard can afford to pay 10 times more its payout ratio is just 9 9 right now why so low the management team has been keeping cash on hand for a mega deal over the past year it tried to acquire a major convenience store chain in australia and a grocery brand in france both deals fell apart the management team believes it can eventually put this cash to use however if they don t secure an attractive deal there s a chance the team could hand this cash back to shareholders in other words the dividend could surge significantly higher at the moment couche tard stock trades at a price to earnings ratio of 16 4 this is one of the best stocks to buy for long term portfolios best stock for value investors cogeco tsx cgo is rarely mentioned on this site or by most investors that could be a potential sign that it s an overlooked investment opportunity the montreal based company is a media giant with impressive growth and earnings revenue and free cash flow have jumped 3 7 and 14 6 respectively in its most recent quarter the stock meanwhile is up 14 year to date however it still trades at just 10 6 times earnings cogeco also offers a 2 4 dividend yield that s deceptively low the company s payout ratio is just over 30 which means it can triple the dividend with cash to spare this hidden dividend star should be on your list of best stocks to buy in 2021 best stock for financial investors manulife tsx mfc nyse mfc is the final pick on this list just like cogeco the company s payout ratio is roughly 30 that gives it plenty of room to expand shareholder rewards manulife s diverse portfolio of financial services and exposure to asian economies is particularly attractive the stock is less exposed to financial turmoil in north america which is excellent for canadian investors trying to diversify their portfolios the stock trades at an unbelievable 6 7 times earnings and offers a huge 4 6 dividend yield it s probably one of the best stocks to buy if you re seeking a bargain

in the past several years cam technology has evolved to enable extremely productive new milling strategies perhaps chief among them is high efficiency machining which can reduce roughing cycle times by as much as 80 in some cases rather than traditional hogging with this process you use a solid endmill with a much greater depth of cut small stepovers and a high constant feed rate the limitation however is that this strategy can only be used in certain circumstances within a given part program with the bulk of the total cycle time often still devoted to more traditional cutting techniques learn how sandvik coromant mebane has decreased cycle times and increased savings using vericut force cgtech has an answer for this with its post program optimization software that enhances the entire part program including cam optimized tool paths called vericut force the software works on the principle of maintaining a constant chip thickness and cutter load throughout each tool path and modulating the feed rate accordingly in most circumstances this means feeding faster than originally programmed most of the time and occasionally feeding slower in moments of high cutter engagement the result is often an overall cycle time reduction of 25 or more with substantially longer tool life and better surface finish as well here s how it works optimizing chip thickness and cutter force when cutting at a constant feed rate programmers have little choice but to be conservative in the rates they choose because they have to anticipate and be sure cutting tools survive the worst cutting case conditions for example you can be cutting the wall of a pocket at a very high rate but when the tool gets to a corner the cutter engagement can spike dramatically causing shock and vibration perhaps even breaking a tool the corner is an obvious case but there are often many other cutter engagement spikes in a typical part program such as when the tool enters the material and other more subtle circumstances cam systems typically cannot anticipate these moments of varying cutter load so an overly conservative feed rate is selected to survive the predictable hostile cutting conditions but also results in inefficient cutting in other areas that could and should have been machined with faster cutting speeds force software works by analyzing chip thickness and cutter load and then adjusts feed rate to maintain optimal yet safe cutting conditions for each cut in each operation the key to force is that it can determine chip thickness and cutter load under any cutting condition and most any material this enables the software to dynamically compensate for cutter load variability by adjusting the feed rate up where you can machine faster and down in the moments where cutter load exceeds the desired level the image above illustrates how it works on a typical part program as you are viewing a simulation of a cutting routine you can see where the tool path is exceeding the maximum chip thickness shown in red in the top graph and placing excessive force on the cutter middle graph those moments of course need to be corrected with a slower feed rate but all the green areas in between are opportunities to machine significantly faster as shown in the bottom graph with this methodology force can further optimize existing cam so called optimized tool paths because most cam systems can t calculate a constant chip thickness based on cutter engagement in the stock workpiece and cutting forces or dynamically modulate feed rate based on these critical variables force thus can further reduce existing hem cutting times by as much as 20 but the bigger payoff may well be that force optimizes all cutting strategies based on chip thickness and cutter load so it is applicable across virtually an entire part program and can be used on roughing semi finishing and finishing cuts it even works in turning applications this video shows a variety of examples of how effective force is at reducing cutting times with different tools and materials how much time does force really save that depends on the machinability of the material and the complexity of the part and usually the more difficult the material and part the higher the return to help quantify improvements in more difficult materials an injection mold maker and force user imflux inc hamilton ohio did some controlled texts they found on a 420 stainless steel workpiece heat treated to 48 rc force reduced cycle time from 7 51 to 4 55 a 37 improvement several parts with relatively simple toolpaths or large numbers of drill holes generated savings between 9 7 and 19 9 when hard milling complex surfaces in 52 rc stavax a type of mold steel force cut cycle times by 51 machining of a p20 test piece produced a 30 reduction force was also applied to a previously optimized program it cut an hour off a six hour cycle time and caught and removed a tool loading spike that would almost certainly have broken the cutter in general force saved at least 17 on basic part geometries and 45 on complex geometries and improved tool life significantly with little to no chipping or edge wear read more about force at imflux inc how to generate the perfect chip this all begs the question of how does force know what an optimal chip thickness should be for a given tool and material it can do this in two ways cutting tool manufacturer data cutting tool manufacturers provide start data for their cutting tools which can be downloaded from the cloud with the tool geometry data via applications such as machining cloud coro plus tdm and others by using the vericut tool import function cutting tools are imported with machining intelligence such as realistic cutting ranges for the type of material being machined and reasonable starting values for optimization learned from nc program vericut includes machine learning functionality where the ideal chip thickness can be determined automatically by processing the nc program and vericut analyzing the cuts performed by each tool or after using the learning function the value can be adjusted by reviewing the chip thickness and cutter force graphs tool by tool and vericut analyzing the cuts performed by each tool vericut force optimization software can be used on turning processes as well cutting tool savings this optimization process can have a dramatic impact on cutting tool related costs in several ways and typically increases tool life by 100 or more keeping a constant load on the cutter substantially reduces tool deflection and vibration that can quickly degrade solid or indexable tools through chipping or excessive edge wear it s also much easier on the machine spindle broken tools can virtually be eliminated and the associated machine downtime they cause longer lasting tools mean fewer tool changes overall by constantly cutting within the tool manufactures recommended parameters overall performance is enhanced because it enables the most efficient use of the tool this combination of faster and safer cutting increases the useful life of your tools substantially reducing tool costs and the costs associated with machine downtime

while the new constitutional carry law in texas has received a lot of attention from the national media this week almost all of it negative of course another piece of legislation signed by gov greg abbott has quietly taken effect and its implementation could have a big impact on the bottom line of some of the largest financial institutions in the country advertisement for several years now we ve seen big banks impose restrictions on their relationships with companies in the firearms industry refusing to do business with firms that manufacture modern sporting rifles or large capacity magazines for instance well now these same banks are getting a taste of their own medicine because unless they end their corporate gun control policies they won t be allowed to underwrite municipal or state bonds some of the country s largest banks including bank of america citibank and jpmorgan chase underwrite municipal and state debt in texas but also have tailored restrictions that appear to bar financing to certain parts of the gun industry such as companies that make or sell bump stocks or sell to customers under 21 republican attorney general ken paxton s office isn t having it leslie brock the state s assistant attorney general and chief of the public finance division notified bond underwriters that compliance with the new texas law isn t open to qualifications according to an aug 23 letter obtained by bloomberg law the new law signed by republican gov greg abbott in june requires banks and other businesses seeking municipal or state contracts worth 100 000 or more to certify that they don t exclude firearm or ammunition industries and retailers companies that do business with the state including bond underwriters face a sept 1 deadline to certify compliance with the law banks that reject clients based on the types of weapons sold or customers served wouldn t be in compliance according to brock s letter such restrictions amount to a refusal to do business against an entire class of firearm entities she wrote advertisement texas is the second largest bond market in the country behind california so this isn t a minor measure that banks can simply shrug off in fact there are signs that some of these institutions may be trying to get around the new law without actually changing their practices while we believe our business practices should permit us to certify we continue to assess our next steps as we try to understand how texas will interpret the law jpmorgan spokesperson patricia wexler told bloomberg law aug 24 jpmorgan chase ceo jamie dimon told the house financial services committee may 27 that the bank doesn t serve manufacturers of assault style weapons for civilian use but does serve manufacturers for military and law enforcement bank of america declined to comment however the bank previously said in 2018 it would stop making loans to companies making military style rifles for civilian use after more than 150 employees were affected by mass shootings in the preceding years citibank also declined to comment but referred bloomberg law to a june 23 blog post that said the bank will keep doing business in texas citibank said the law doesn t conflict with a policy adopted in 2018 requiring retail firearms industry clients to use best practices like requiring background checks prohibiting sales to people under 21 and barring sales of bump stocks or high capacity magazines ultimately it s not up to citibank to determine whether or not it s in compliance with the new law that will be up to texas ag ken paxton and my guess is that if citibank is refusing to do business with companies that abide by all federal state and local laws but don t comply with the bank s supposed best practices paxton s office will have something to say about it advertisement will the new law lead to an actual reversal of the banks anti gun policies maybe though i wouldn t be surprised if paxton s office has to take a hard line before any corporation like citibank or jp morgan chase changes their stance if other population rich red states like florida and ohio were to follow texas lead however that would certainly increase the odds of these anti gun financial institutions scrapping their gun control mandates in favor of a politically neutral policy if gun owners really want to bring these banks to heel they should be encouraging their own state legislators to follow texas lead here

by matthew poterba cfa senior analyst highlights latin america remains our favorite emerging market region sharply accelerating profits supportive leading indicators and bargain valuations make brazil and latin america overall seem very attractive at the other extreme chinese equities our favorite from 2019 to early 2021 appear very unattractive because of peaking profits growth expensive valuations and a weak liquidity backdrop brazil s profits growth is now faster than china s corporate profits growth in brazil recently surged past that in we expect growth to peak for both countries in the second half of the year but strong leading indicators suggest more resilient growth in brazil than in china government policies in china might also hamper future profits growth corporate profits growth in brazil recently surged past that in we expect growth to peak for both countries in the second half of the year but strong leading indicators suggest more resilient growth in brazil than in china government policies in china might also hamper future profits growth brazil stocks remain a significant contrarian play brazil stocks trade cheap to history whereas china stocks are we suspect brazil stocks will reprice higher as investors gain confidence in the recovery brazil stocks trade cheap to history whereas china stocks are we suspect brazil stocks will reprice higher as investors gain confidence in the recovery liquidity turning uncertain liquidity within brazil and china could be changing and needs close china s credit impulse growth turned negative this spring but recent policy looks more neutral brazil however began to incrementally tighten policy this year content continues below advertisement as the global economy reopens and as growth matures investors find themselves looking outside developed economies for opportunities one of the challenges however is that although there have been periods of synchronized growth across many emerging market countries em consists of 27 different countries each with its own economy set of risks and market exposures as part of a global equity allocation differentiating between emerging market countries is increasingly important when fundamentals diverge currently we see opportunities within latin america especially brazil as tailwinds for growth remain supportive and equities still appear cheap china on the other hand is increasingly facing headwinds from slowing liquidity and drivers of growth profits growth looks poised to diverge in 2h21 brazilian versus chinese profits growth is just one of several areas that highlight all emerging market countries are not created equal for example brazilian trailing four quarter profits have grown 94 year on year and have been accelerating at among the fastest rates globally while those for chinese companies still increasing 9 in q2 have slowed relative to the rest of the world although it would be easy to dismiss the brazilian growth dynamic as driven by 2020 base effects we have found that markets consistently focus on the change in earnings growth better or worse and less on whether that growth is driven by easy comparisons so even though chinese profits are growing and we expect their growth rate to peak next quarter in the mid 20 s the steep declines in 2020 earnings of brazilian companies have supercharged 2021 growth rates which we expect to further accelerate and remain well above 100 through year end further in 1q22 by which time the easy comparisons from 2020 earnings will have rolled out analysts expect relatively stronger profits growth of brazilian companies 43 year on year as compared to chinese companies 17 year on year looking to the future leading indicators of profits appear resilient in brazil but weakening in china most recently 6 of the 8 indicators or 75 in our brazil profits cycle model were positive whereas 7 of the 11 or 64 in our china profits cycle model were positive as an example our work shows that purchasing manager indices pmis of manufacturing firms have historically provided insight into the direction of future profits growth chart 1 note inflections in china s manufacturing pmi have historically led to inflections in its profits cycle recently manufacturing pmis for china have clearly peaked while those for brazil have recently reaccelerated chart 2 suggesting profits growth for chinese companies will be moderate while brazilian companies may see strong growth continue brazil stocks remain out of favor in addition to identifying profit outlooks our research has shown that sentiment can be a key driver of equity returns as well with brazilian stocks lagging the returns of global equities over the last fifteen months investors still appear skeptical of brazil s covid recovery as shown in chart 3 this pessimistic outlook may explain why brazilian stocks continue to trade at depressed forward price to earnings multiples relative to broader emerging markets and especially china chart 4 chinese stocks conversely are still rich relative to their historical average even despite the recent sell off in chinese markets we suspect this is partly due to investors extrapolating china s recovery and their markets behaving as a safe haven during the onset of covid 19 looking at investor sentiment from another angle we note that bofa research s monthly fund managers survey shows investors have largely been less optimistic on brazilian stocks since the onset of the pandemic the july survey noted that investors have become incrementally more constructive on brazilian stocks but even with that improvement sentiment is still only just at average levels chart 5 we anticipate that as brazilian companies deliver on strong earnings growth investors will become increasingly constructive on their equity prospects china s rebound on the other hand appears largely priced in and any earnings disappointment may cause investors to reprice those stocks changing currents in liquidity over the last 18 months brazil met the pandemic head on with sizeable fiscal stimulus and a dramatic easing of its policy rate the selic as shown in chart 6 these policy moves helped stabilize and more recently have provided a tailwind to growth china on the other hand enacted fewer pro growth policies during 2020 and 2021 in part because their domestic economy was damaged less by the pandemic history suggests that policy tends to work with long lags and as such we expect brazil s easing a year ago to continue to positively reverberate throughout the country particularly in contrast to china more recently the pace of brazil s easing has slowed with the banco central do brasil bcb beginning to raise the selic in march to combat sharply accelerating inflation and following through with three subsequent rate hikes when the bcb adjusts the selic rate up or down it is effectively changing the cost of credit although the bcb has been raising rates the current selic level remains quite accommodative relative to history however the bcb s shift from easing in 2020 to tightening in 2021 may pose a headwind to growth toward year end and next year turning now to china the most recent policy move has been one of slight easing rather than tightening until recently the pboc had left the required reserve ratio rrr unchanged but on july 9th it reduced the rate by 50 basis points for all banks chart 7 1 although this change should increase the quantity of credit available history would suggest reducing the rrr by this magnitude is unlikely to have a substantial impact on credit availability and lending this policy move also comes on the heels of several quarters of slowing credit growth as evident from china s slowing and negative 12m change in its credit impulse which peaked in october 2020 chart 8 2 we see the rrr reduction as a sign that tighter credit over the last few quarters may have stymied the growth outlook more than desired we do not expect sustained easing by the pboc in the immediate future as they remain focused on de risking the financial sector and therefore tight credit likely remains a headwind to accelerating growth in the coming quarters of course we would be remiss if we did not also mention the recent market volatility and policy news out of china within the last month several companies in china s property market are increasingly showing signs of stress government reforms were announced on companies in china s tutoring sector and chinese regulators took action against several high profile companies the direction of china s policy is an important determinant of the outlook for its market especially to the extent it positively or negatively impacts the profits liquidity or sentiment backdrop fundamentals driving performance the brighter outlook for corporate profits growth cheaper valuations and a more constructive credit backdrop in brazil over china highlight that it may be advantageous to be tactical within emerging market equities especially now and during last year as we stated previously not all emerging market countries are created equal indeed in 2021 thus far there has been over a twelve percentage point spread in the performance of brazil 3 12 and china 9 58 equities 3 this is all that more important in times of diverging country fundamentals don t

things just continue to get crazier and crazier in all of the years that i have been writing about the economy i have never seen anything like this the latest employment report that was released on friday is being described as a huge disappointment because the number of americans that were hired last month was way way below expectations employment only rose by 235 000 but economists were expecting a number about triple that size normally when this sort of thing happens it is because of a lack of available jobs but that is definitely not the case right now there are literally millions upon millions of jobs that are open but for a variety of reasons people simply don t want them a lot of experts are blaming covid for the worker shortage and without a doubt fear of covid is causing some potential workers to stay home in other cases mask mandates and vaccine mandates are causing people to reject open jobs that they would otherwise accept but i don t think that those are the biggest reasons for the worker shortage the types of jobs where we are seeing the most severe shortages of workers are jobs that require long hours and hard physical work these days there are millions upon millions of americans that just don t want to drive trucks load trains stock shelves or work at our ports unfortunately the machinery of our economy comes grinding to a halt without such workers and we are seeing that right now these days millions of americans would rather stay home and collect government benefits rather than work a difficult low paying job in fact the numbers clearly show that unemployed workers are going back to work much faster in states where enhanced unemployment benefits have been cut off that is an easy problem for our politicians to fix but we are facing another growing trend that won t be so easy to rectify our young people are increasingly gravitating to the internet economy they are figuring out that it doesn t make much sense to put in endless hours at an entry level job when so many others are making big bucks as social media influencers instead during this pandemic the white house has invited quite a few top social media influencers to the white house but i don t think that they have invited a single truck driver of course there are others that have made millions upon millions of dollars buying and selling cryptocurrencies nobody is ever going to become a millionaire unloading container ships but tons of people have become millionaires by trading cryptos or by becoming social media celebrities so why should our young people choose to do the low paying work that nobody else wants to do when the internet offers so many other promising opportunities i believe that this is the biggest reason why the number of americans that are employed is still more than 5 million less than it was just prior to the start of the pandemic nearly a year and a half into the recovery the us economy remains 5 3 million jobs short of where it was in february 2020 before covid 19 threw a wrench into the gears it has been reported that there are currently 9 8 million job openings in the united states if you want a job you can go out and find one but the vast majority of the jobs that are available are low paying jobs that are not particularly pleasant and the rampant inflation that we are now experiencing is rapidly causing those jobs to lose the limited appeal that they once had in a desperate attempt to keep their low paid workforce officials at walmart just announced that they will be raising wages for hundreds of thousands of workers walmart is raising the pay for more than 565 000 store employees the world s largest retailer announced thursday that u s store workers in its frontend food and consumable and general merchandise workgroups will receive at least a 1 an hour raise elsewhere a mcdonald s in oregon has now decided to hire kids as young as 14 after raising wages to 15 dollars an hour did not work businesses across the country are turning to teens as young as 14 to cope with a dire labor shortage with one mcdonald s in oregon drawing attention with a huge banner touting the new policy the mcdonald s franchise in medford hung the banner after finding that raising the minimum wage to 15 didn t bring in many new applications but opening the door to younger applicants did operator heather coleman told business insider and earlier today i was stunned to learn that amazon has decided to start recruiting pot smokers to drive their delivery vehicles but it s not just amazon s in house workforce that needs expanding bloomberg reported wednesday that amazon has found a solution for the contract delivery drivers it uses to deliver packages from its fulfillment centers to customers doorsteps recruit pot smokers that s right despite the fact that driving while high on any substance is illegal the company is advising its delivery partners to prominently advertise that they don t screen applicants for marijuana use according to emails between amazon and contractors reviewed by bloomberg but no matter what these companies do it is just going to be really tough to recruit low paid workers in this environment because our leaders have flooded the system with so much cash young people will continue to gravitate toward opportunities on the internet that they think will make them rich but meanwhile the machinery of our economy will continue to break down the widespread shortages that we have been witnessing just continue to get worse and earlier today the wall street journal ran a big story about the nightmare that the u s auto industry is currently facing the u s auto industry is heading into one of its biggest selling weekends of the year with dealership lots stripped bare of inventory and some buyers having to drive great distances to secure a new ride for a second year in a row car shoppers are facing bleak prospects in trying to buy a car this labor day weekend the period has historically been a time of blowout deals and big sales events for car companies and dealerships trying to clear out old vehicle stock to make way for the new model year on a very basic level we need workers that will build stuff move stuff and sell stuff unfortunately those jobs just aren t very appealing today but if you think that you may want a job at some point in the foreseeable future i would encourage you to grab one while you still can because this current state of affairs will certainly not last indefinitely and it won t be too long before we see some pretty dramatic shifts in the employment marketplace it is finally here michael s new book entitled 7 year apocalypse is now available in paperback and for the kindle on amazon about the author my name is michael snyder and my

with major general chris donahue the commanding general of the 82nd airborne division having boarded the c 17 aircraft the two decade old american military mission in afghanistan came to an end the sight of the american planes flying out of kabul with the remainder of the service members aboard was broadcast live around the world generating millions of comments across the traditional and social media platforms the completion of the withdrawal of the us forces in line with the schedule announced by us president joe biden on april 16 earlier this year was followed by celebratory aerial firing by the victorious taliban as their personnel took control of kabul airport the ignominious pullout by the world s greatest military power led the taliban spokesperson to tweet that afghanistan was a free and sovereign country for a ragtag militia that was literally bombed out of power in 2001 faced political wilderness for a long time and confronted the fiercest us led nato military onslaught it is no less than a miracle to fight its way back into power however the takeover of afghanistan is but a part of more formidable challenges facing the taliban they may have shown resoluteness and singularity of purpose in holding their ground against the us and its allies over the last two decades however the burden of governing a war wracked and deeply divisive country will surely test them in fundamental ways the most immediate challenge facing the taliban leadership is to put in place an inclusive government one whose composition reflects the political ethnic and linguistic realities of the country such a political arrangement if it is consensually arrived at will not only bring much needed goodwill to the taliban but also send a message of inclusivity harmony and peace to the afghans forming an inclusive government is the first major step more important is the autonomy power and freedom given to this government to draw up a national agenda coalition governments are a tricky business even in the established democracies how such a government consisting of old rivals and battlefield adversaries fares will constitute a real challenge it will also be crucial to see what conflict resolution arrangement is provided for in the system to iron out the differences that are sure to emerge second despite the taliban s assurances and general amnesty a large number of afghans particularly those living in the urban areas remain deeply worried about their future under the islamic emirate this includes women minorities and ethnic communities the searing memories of the treatment the taliban meted out to the people during their previous rule have not faded it is this distrust of the new rulers that explains the chaos and mayhem witnessed at kabul airport as people scrambled to fly out of the country at any cost the falling of a 15 year old teen footballer to death from the wings of a flying aircraft represents the tragedy of today s afghanistan as it faces an uncertain future allied to the environment of fear and anxiety is the massive brain drain underway in the wake of the taliban takeover no country can function without its skilled human resource doctors engineers scientists lawyers civil servants media persons and teachers are the backbone of any society their presence is vital to running a government and shaping the future of a country hundreds of afghan nationals got the opportunities to be educated at western universities during the past two decades and acquired valuable experience of working in global settings they are a great asset and their professional expertise and skills are vital to the process of rebuilding the country it is therefore of utmost importance that the taliban led government takes conscious steps to build a relationship of trust with these afghans by addressing their fears and apprehensions no matter what ethnicity race and political background they may belong to their inclusion into the mainstream will serve afghanistan in good stead it is indeed heartening that the taliban have asked all the university teachers and staff to report back from august 31 a welcome gesture in its own right yet another key challenge facing the new rulers is to make sure that afghanistan does not suffer from a humanitarian crisis there are worrisome reports of food and medical stocks dwindling and the long harsh winter stares in the face the long queues of the people in front of banks present a painful sight the unhcr has warned of an impending humanitarian crisis if the global community does not act fast to help the afghans it is in this context that prime minister imran khan has urged the world community to stay engaged with afghanistan to avert a human tragedy pakistan is the first country to deliver medical supplies of the world health organization through a pia cargo flight after the events of august 15 islamabad has assured the world community to establish a humanitarian air bridge for the relief activities to take place the world needs to heed pakistan s advice of not leaving the afghan people at this most critical juncture otherwise the consequences of such negligence will be horrible the world must act wisely considering the past mistakes of the 1990s when the collapse of the ussr led to the complete abandonment of afghanistan afghanistan needs the world so it can sustain itself economically foreign aid formed about 40 percent of its gdp during the ghani administration following the taliban s takeover the united states has suspended afghanistan s foreign reserves to the tune of over 9 billion what the world and the us must know is that this money belongs to the afghan people without which they will literally face starvation and be deprived of essential services such as power water and fuel supplies etc they need empathetic treatment it is here that the taliban are doubly obligated to work with the international community to find a diplomatic resolution to the conflict instead of imposing a regressive governing order they must find ways to allay the apprehensions of the world they should know that it will be well nigh impossible for afghanistan to survive without the support and assistance of the international community hence the middle ground and moderate approach in the statecraft consistent with the globally cherished values offers the way forward taliban leaders have said the right things so far and their initial actions have been conciliatory towards their opponents however what the world remains wary of is their abiding commitment to regressive ideology and stereotyped notions in order to govern effectively and earn global legitimacy they need to transition from a militia mindset into a reformative party whose broad outlook is pluralistic and informed by an understanding of the contemporary problems and the imperatives of running modern day nation states this will require a paradigm shift in their ideological orientation without which such a transformation cannot take place last but not least is the challenge of wrangling and competition from terror outfits such as isis k as the recent terrorist incidents including the deadly attack on kabul airport made it absolutely clear afghanistan under the taliban will be a site of renewed terror activity this problem from isis k type organizations is two fold on the one hand they will violently oppose the taliban s shift to normalcy advertising the change in its policy as a sell out of jihad with a clear motive to attract new recruits to their more puritanical cause on the other hand they will try to form alliances with other terrorist organizations such as the ttp and use ungoverned spaces as a launching pad for terrorism against the neighbouring countries to keep the region in perpetual turmoil and disrupt any bonhomie between the taliban and the world from developing the taliban face a mammoth test one they have never faced before the last time they ruled afghanistan was two decades ago new realities have cropped up since then the world is anxiously watching them and has stakes in the direction they take down the road they will realise that power imposes a restraining burden and demand sagacity and prudence more than anything else the writer a chevening scholar studied international journalism at the

socialism doc the big scary s word an overly simplistic primer the flawed film is unlikely to sway opinions the word socialism has long been a convenient bogeyman for politicians on the right i ve always loved the irony of republicans who appeal to their older voters by vowing to fight socialism while simultaneously promising they ll protect medicare and social security benefits tell me you don t understand socialism without telling me you don t understand socialism conversely young people in the united states have increasingly favorable views of socialism the documentary the big scary s word will probably not do much to close this generational gap it serves as an often overly simplistic primer on socialist movements in the u s a bit of socialism 101 that seems too geared toward preaching to the choir the movie s title comes from an interview with lee carter a then member of the virginia house of delegates who was elected as a self proclaimed democratic socialist he shares a campaign flyer from his opponent that shows carter s face next to karl marx vladimir lenin joseph stalin and other famous socialists and communists it s from another era entirely carter says i was born in 87 i don t remember the berlin wall falling so the red scare anybody who uses the big scary s word is automatically stalin it just doesn t work anymore in the world of this documentary this is true director yael bridge incorporates interviews some original some stock with some big names in the modern movement bernie sanders alexandria ocasio cortez cornel west and naomi klein among others more compelling are the interviews with everyday people as well as the case the film builds that we as a society need to seriously consider new perspectives on growing issues of economic inequality s word is meant to be a primer that destigmatizes socialist ideas and it s effective in that regard it also runs a brisk 82 minutes and features some compelling visualizations for a low budget doc with kickstarter support but the film runs the risk of oversimplifying solutions by showing small scale examples of socialist principles at work not to mention the challenges of real life after all there are real dangers to embracing a magic wand approach that pretends replacing flawed systems is easy work that can be done overnight not mentioned in the documentary but worth noting lee carter ran a long shot campaign in the virginia gubernatorial primary he got 3 percent of the vote and also lost his primary to hold his seat in the house of delegates his resulting twitter tantrum is a great example of what not to do when you re trying to build coalitions for change the audience for this documentary will find it affirms their beliefs the question is how many minds will it actually change the big scary s word now playing at the gateway film center and on demand 2 stars out of 5

by paul r la monica cnn business the august jobs report was a massive disappointment with corporate america hiring far fewer people than expected but investors largely shrugged off the weaker jobs gains stocks were mostly unchanged friday and remained near all time highs the s p 500 was flat while the nasdaq rose slightly both held onto gains for the week the dow fell nearly 75 points or 0 2 and was down modestly over the past five days the us stock market will be closed monday for labor day investors may have taken heart that the unemployment rate fell to 5 2 despite the slowdown in new jobs that s a sign that the labor market recovery is still on track following the covid fueled shutdown of the economy and brief recession last year the job market is continuing to recover and heal said ashok bhatia deputy chief investment officer for fixed income at neuberger berman but bhatia said the recent jobs softness particularly for sectors like retailers and restaurants that have been hurt by delta variant concerns could lead the federal reserve to move even more slowly on plans for removing some of the extraordinary stimulus it put in place last spring fed chair jerome powell has suggested recently that the central bank will be cautious and will not move too aggressively to cut back on or taper its bond purchase program that has helped keep long term interest rates low we still expect tapering not to begin until 2022 and that there will be no rate hikes until 2023 or potentially even later bhatia said other experts were quick to note that one weak report is not a trend especially since it was data for august a month that is notoriously noisy because people take late summer vacations the government actually reported zero jobs were added or lost in august 2011 for example that figure was later revised august is often a wacky month for jobs and this is a crazier time than normal said chadd garcia vice president and portfolio manager with ave maria funds garcia thinks that much of the jobs weakness in consumer oriented industries could be temporary retail and other leisure workers may be more inclined to return to work as expanded unemployment benefits fade and kids go back to school wage growth was much stronger than expected in august companies like walmart and cvs have recently announced hourly pay increases for employees as well but there are many most notably the fed s powell who maintain that higher wages won t cause a major and permanent surge in inflation that would lead the fed to put the brakes on the recovery ed keon chief investment strategist at qma agrees he added that investors also need to remember that covid 19 has also led to supply disruptions that are also distorting the labor market consumer prices and the broader economy this is obviously delta related keon said there is a lot of frustration about supply chains and finding labor the big jump in wages last month may simply be due to the lack of growth in lower paying services jobs in other words the friday jobs numbers may be yet another sign that powell and others who believe inflation is transitory are right that s probably reassuring investors as well the cnn wire 2021 cable news network inc a warnermedia company all rights reserved

commentary chinese leader xi jinping looks increasingly like the anti deng xiaoping xi would no doubt object to such a characterization he has after all lionized deng any number of times as the author of china s economic miracle but whatever xi says his actions would take china in a very different direction from deng s economic policies xi is in fact undoing much of what sparked china s growth in the first place unless beijing changes course and returns to the economic practices that promoted growth all the fear the west presently feels about chinese economic dominance will be moot the middle kingdom s economy will slow and likely stall deng whatever other undesirable policies he implemented presided over china s economic rise a little over 40 years ago at what was officially called the third plenary session of the 11th central committee of the chinese communist party there he authorized a clean break with the centralized and belligerent approach of mao zedong he had visited the west and saw the ongoing economic growth and levels of wealth he was especially impressed with singapore s use of trade to rise from poverty to riches he wanted something similar for china then as now economists policymakers and historians hotly debate the causes of economic growth and development deng settled on the areas where these disputants tended to agree under the rubric reform and opening deng ended the near isolation practiced under mao and set out to encourage trade between china and the rest of the world he invited foreign investment into china to promote both trade and investment he stopped pursuing longstanding maritime disputes between china and other asian nations his reforms moved the country s economic management away from the rigid centralized planning practiced under mao allowing for more entrepreneurial activity and market direction of economic effort with western help the changes created rapid development and growth a record that needs no review here those gains have put xi in a position of power and prestige that no modern chinese leader has enjoyed but in recent years and especially recent months xi seems determined to undermine the economic structures on which his power today rests he had already exacerbated the maritime disputes that deng quieted in this more recent time xi contrary to the reform and opening policies has begun to close china to western investment he has also used the government s huge regulatory power to discourage activities that though they promise huge market gains are nonetheless contrary to the chinese communist party s centralized plan the starkest evidence of xi s change shows in beijing s recent harassment of chinese technology companies particularly those serving chinese consumers last october jack ma founder of alibaba and its affiliate ant financial called attention to the situation complaining publicly about the difficulty of raising capital from state run chinese banks when in early november he turned for needed financing to an initial public offering ipo on the shanghai exchange beijing had the exchange cancel the deal more recently beijing used its regulatory power to fine the food delivery company meituan simply for being too big the ride hailing company didi after a wildly successful ipo in the united states found itself forbidden by beijing to seek new subscribers a didi autonomous taxi is performing a pilot test drive on the streets in shanghai on july 22 2020 hector retamal afp via getty images after a different and also successful ipo in the united states by a growing chinese tutoring company beijing forbade it to teach subjects taught in china s state run schools in other words its most popular products research by goldman sachs has discovered that in just the months since ma complained beijing has taken at least 50 such actions from a purely economic standpoint it s hard to justify this behavior it thwarts growth by cutting the flow of financial capital to some of the fastest growing and most innovative parts of china s economy if such actions bewilder anyone who values wealth creation it s apparent that xi and his government drawing on their communist roots value control and secrecy more accordingly they have directed state run banks to favor activities that fit in the central plan and ignore any other borrowing needs however much market directions favor them part of that controlling impulse also punishes any firm that would seek to end run the control exercised by the banks by say issuing stock on either the shanghai or u s exchanges from this perspective listing on the american exchanges must look especially dangerous since that act imparts some control to u s shareholders as well as american regulatory authorities as both demand certain disclosures from the chinese companies trading on u s exchanges also telling is beijing s recent decision to emphasize manufacturing while china had grown for years on manufacturing for export as the economy became more developed and wealthier beijing at least until recently had determined that the economy needed to broaden its economic base reduce its relative dependence on exports and emphasize growth in consumer products as well as services market forces were naturally bringing about this shift in emphasis but now xi wants to block this change and emphasize manufacturing again beijing has made clear this shift in emphasis in its made in china 2025 plan it explicitly aims to make the world dependent on china for crucial manufactured goods among them artificial intelligence ai electric vehicles biometric devices and aerospace this insistence on government directed as opposed to market directed actions may work for china over the next few years even though it flies in the face of the successful economic reforms of the past but ultimately the dominance of central direction will fail china by thwarting active areas of the economy as xi and his plans have china will deny itself sources of innovation that all modern economies need in order to advance no doubt china s leadership rejects the notion that consumer oriented firms can offer useful innovations but as any economic history will make clear innovation often comes from unlikely quarters the best approach is to have as many sectors of the economy as possible seeking to innovate central direction also narrows the economy s focus making the entire economic effort less likely to capture new directions the made in china 2025 plan may focus on today s hot topics but there s no telling whether these products will really capture the future and to the extent that they don t the plan will create huge amounts of waste that no economy even china s can afford of course market directed economies also generate a lot of failed effort but because they never concentrate as thoroughly as centrally directed efforts their losses tend to be smaller while at the same time their diversity of effort is more likely to capture aspects of the future unseen in the present as indicated xi might luck out with his made in china 2025 effort some part of it might capture the future and give china an economic leg up on its western competition but since coming years much less decades seldom behave as plans anticipate the future will increasingly deviate from the way china s central planners expect the longer xi s policies last the further he will have taken china from the advantages that deng brought it the more damage his policies will do and the less imposing china s economy will become views expressed in

last year as the stock market rebounded out of the coronavirus crash that saw the s p asx 200 index drop around 35 and we were forced into a national lockdown there was a virtual outcry that millennials were investing like mad men and women of course no one said it but the implication was that this new breed of investors were nothing more than speculators who d get their comeuppance when the market went down another leg down at the time switzer daily wrote a piece headlined are millennials ruining the stock market we found the following that fund managers are blaming millennial madness for the volatility in the stock market at the moment a 2019 millennials and investing study by calastone found just 10 of australian millennials invest in funds but 76 plan to invest in the future as of may 2020 us based investing app robinhood has added 3 million funded accounts so far this year the rise of robinhood investors is a concern for fund managers as the app allows easy and cost effective investing in stocks and cryptocurrency and is predominantly used by millennials seasoned professional investors were looking at the escalation of covid 19 infections worldwide but the us stock market and ours kept going higher this chart shows it very clearly s p asx 200 that market rebound with very little volatility as the world was being shutdown to beat a virus out of control perplexed many fund managers and older investors professional fund managers saw it as the silly behaviour of millennials as they got too engrossed in the stock market however i always saw it as a rational response for anyone be they young or older who wanted to build wealth at the time i wrote term deposits are hopeless people can t buy homes so they re looking to the stock market as an alternative to build wealth on an episode of switzertv investing at the time pengana s rhett kessler and montgomery investment s roger montgomery featured as guests for a bulls vs bears segment rhett kessler pengana took the role of the bear stating before it was the belgian dentists then it was the new york taxi driver that you got your stock tips from now it s the millennials rhett grew concerned that everybody is having a punt and made a point that this isn t a time for embracing risk despite being the bull roger montgomery agreed rhett gave you a demographic that s pretty responsible for it and i d say that s pretty accurate roger used the example of hertz who declared chapter 11 bankruptcy in may of 2020 and then their share price went up fivefold people were punting on the equity not realising that the equity and the capital structure is the last to be repaid said montgomery the speculation in the stock after they announced chapter 11 bankruptcy just shows you how uninformed traders are at the moment and while that particular trading action underlined that some silly share plays were being reported history has shown that most of the new participants into the stock market since the bottom of the february march crash of 2020 have wisely got it right many younger investors went long tech stocks i recently looked at these groups of tech stocks called waaax and zeet stocks since may 29 the former group are up 62 on average while the zeet group are up 18 so combined that would be a 40 gain which isn t a bad pay off for any newcomer to the world of stocks waaax stands for wisetech up 137 appen down 66 altium down 13 7 afterpay up 174 and xero up 77 8 zeet which i christened saw z1p up 80 elmo software down 22 eml up 15 and tyro payments down 1 5 that wasn t bad given tyro copped a discredited report from a us hedge fund that had shorted the stock after the report was countered the share price rebounded but this company has been hurt by the lockdowns that stop people going to pubs and cafes where tyro machines are used for credit card payments meanwhile eml has had a battle with the irish central bank that surprised the market but this seems to be less of a headwind on the share price what the experience with these tech stocks has taught all investors is that if you want to play a theme it s wiser to play it diversified sure if the millennial investor went for afterpay they ve killed them but if they went for appen they ve been killed share price wise the chart above shows our market is about 5 higher from where the s p 500 index was before the crash that s not excessive given record low interest rates and huge government spending this point is proven even more when you look at the stock market rebound for the s p 500 index in the us s p 500 see how much the us market has rebounded from its high level before the crash that was 3380 it s now 4536 which is a 34 rise if you take out the down and up of the crash and rebound of 2020 that compares to only 5 for our market that not only tells me the young excessively confident investors of 2020 totally got it right believing that the stock market was going up i only hope their stock picking was on the money the internet and the generations it has helped raise have created a more savvy group of stock market investors sure they will make mistakes but what stock market investor doesn t i m heartened that my switzer investing tv show on mondays and thursdays now has nearly 20 000 subscribers these people show up hungry to learn and invest the irony of this virus and the low interest rate environment it has entrenched has forced wealth builders to look at one of the best albeit one of the riskiest ways to get rich i hope these newcomers learn the value of being diversified invest in quality companies for the long term and as warren buffet advised be fearful when others are greedy and be greedy when others are fearful it seems a lot of young investors got the second part of his advice right after march 2020 i hope on my tv show that i and my fellow experts can pick the time to be fearful when others are greedy they do look greedy in the us right now but they ve done a lot better on vaccinations and avoided a lot of lockdowns

columnists jerry apps for many years on the home farm a windmill pumped water for our small herd of dairy cattle for the horses hogs chickens and for the family it was an all metal aermotor windmill some earlier windmills were of wooden construction in 1883 laverne noyes a chicago manufacturer hired a mechanical engineer by the name of thomas o perry who was a mechanical and civil engineer perry experimented with 61 different experimental wind wheels before he settled on what became the aermotor windmill the aermotor windmill was introduced in 1888 and only 45 were sold that first year in 1892 the company sold 20 000 windmills soon the aermotor company became a dominant supplier of windmills in the world at one time the company s manufacturing operations covered nine acres on the southwest side of chicago in 1915 the aermotor company introduced an auto oiled windmill with an enclosed gearcase all the moving parts were bathed in oil and had to be serviced but once a year the aermotor windmill had one serious problem however when the wind didn t blow there was no water i remember one time in the late 1930s when central wisconsin was suffering from a serve drought as long as our livestock had water and some feed we could get by but then one day the wind quit blowing and the windmill quit turning soon the stock tank for the livestock was empty as was the water pail in the kitchen that provided water for the family we heard the cattle bellowing for water not a pleasant sound all day and all night they bellowed as we waited for the wind to blow a neighbor who powered his water pump with a gasoline engine came to the rescue we hauled water from his farm and not long after dad bought a gasoline engine for our water pump the old timer says wind power is wonderful as long as the wind blows jerry apps born and raised on a wisconsin farm is professor emeritus at the university of wisconsin madison and the author of more than 35 books many of them on rural history and country life for further information about jerry s writing and tv work go to www jerryapps com
let s drink to the hard working people let s think of the lowly of birth spare a thought for the rag taggy people let s drink to the salt of the earth salt of the earth the rolling stones youghal ireland yes today we say an ave maria for the salt of the earth the poor folks are going to get whacked by whom jagger and richards of the rolling stones had that figured out too spare a thought for the stay at home voter his empty eyes gaze at strange beauty shows and a parade of the gray suited grafters a choice of cancer or polio yes the masses need leading but they get gamblers jokers and gray suited grafters instead the deathly cancer of trump or the crippling polio of biden take your pick and this just in breitbart on the war on terror brown university s costs of war project reveals the cost since september 11 2001 exceeds 8 trillion and that wars have directly killed an estimated 897 000 to 929 000 people one of the questions surrounding america s appalling retreat from afghanistan is seeing how easily the taliban took over the country last month why didn t they do it sooner that question was answered by matthew hoh former u s marine corps captain the u s was spending millions of dollars every day on the war in afghanistan much of it was going to well the taliban we re talking about a fountain of money that the taliban were happy to take whether they took it directly or it was the taliban commander s cousin that was the contractor it doesn t matter the absurdity of all this and everyone knew it was going on no ticker tape parade our diary is longer than usual today we re trying to understand more clearly how america s hard working people get ripped off every society has its elite the common people depend on it after all who has time to understand how a nuclear reactor really works but we still live with atomic power and who knows which of the afghan tribes are friends and which are enemies we have experts to keep them straight right and which king of queens or family guy really understands what the federal reserve is up to we expect those with phds in finance and economics to make sure it is doing the right thing but did the common foot soldier gain anything from the elite s 27 trillion forever wars do you remember the ticker tape parade when our troops marched through the center of manhattan celebrating their victory in the wars against poverty and drugs how about the war against covid 19 elites versus the common man a hunter gatherer tribe might not need an elite everybody knows approximately the same thing but the more advanced a society becomes the more it depends on the few people who know how things work its politics as well as its nuclear submarines then as an empire ages and expands the elite becomes further and further removed from the people it is meant to serve the rich and powerful live in special zip codes especially those around the capital beltway they shop at saks not dollar stores they drink pinot grigio not old milwaukee and they insist on remaking the whole world in their own grotesque image worse they cheat the common man in order to take more money for themselves they stab him in the back with their wall street bailouts three so far this century and they despise him for his beliefs and his naivete didn t he invade the capitol to hijack our democracy doesn t he refuse to believe the science doesn t he drive a carbon spewing pickup but now it is getting late in the cycle the elite has become incompetent and degenerate it loses its wars its investments all go bad and it s desperate to keep its privileges who pays but who will pay for its mistakes its lies and its larcenies hey all this money printing fed chief jay powell might admit it was just to enrich wall street washington and the elite but now we re getting rising inflation so we re going to have to stop honesty would be easy but expensive the elite would have to give back much of its ill gotten gains stocks would crash government spending would be slashed the goofy boondoggles along with the contracts and jobs that go with them would have to end so would the preposterous wars that benefit only the insiders forget the 1 2 trillion infrastructure bill forget the 3 5 trillion human infrastructure budget forget the pivot to asia it would be time to mind our own business in other words the costs would fall primarily on those who deserved to pay the elite social insecurity but they are the deciders and they will never decide to do that truth will have to wait while the costs of three decades worth of foolish investments get passed on to can you guess the rich have their portfolios the professors have their tenure the politicians and bureaucrats have their fat pensions what does the common man have social security he trusts the elite to make sure it is solvent so he will get what is coming to him but the committee for a responsible federal budget reports the social security and medicare trustees released their annual reports on the long term financial state of those programs the medicare trustees report shows that the part a hospital insurance trust fund will be insolvent in just five years the trust fund faces a shortfall of 0 77 to 1 61 percent of payroll and medicare spending will grow significantly over the next few decades along with the two social security trust funds and the highway trust fund all four major trust funds are headed for insolvency in the next 13 years of course even those gloomy projections are based on a remarkable premise that nothing goes wrong how it goes wrong but something will go wrong and the results will be worse than expected the feds will continue printing money and inflation will run riot through the economy social security payments are pegged to inflation but only as the feds compute it inevitably the adjustments will lag already the official u s inflation rate is 5 4 but as we saw yesterday housing is going up at an 18 annual rate used auto prices have gone up by more than 40 the last year and global producer prices for food according to the imf are rising at a 25 rate there is no way the 28 trillion in national debt not to mention the other 57 trillion in corporate household and other debt will ever be repaid not in honest money bad solution the only solution is inflation the elite must print more money to keep the jig going social security payments will be reduced by inflation medicare support will be another victim prices for housing transportation food and just about everything else will keep going up and standards of living for most people the uncounted masses the wavering millions the faceless crowd will go down trusting soul so this labor day weekend say a prayer for the laboring masses the salt of the earth the common man is a trusting soul long suffering and loyal most of the time the chain around his neck rests lightly no matter how he is mistreated he still licks his master s hand his sons and daughters still answer the call and put on uniforms ready to attack whatever poor helpless third world nation the elite targets and he goes to the voting stations in the belief that his ballot will change things even when he is kicked he still wags his tail but watch out kicked too many times he may show his teeth regards bill

it s a hot night in boston hotter still in the narrow space of studio soto where barefoot models weave trance like through the melting crowd exhibiting the kind of creative flair she s known for ballina born designer and hat maker marie galvin had forsaken the predictable run down the catwalk during boston spring fashion weekend in favor of an art gallery show that united fashion and art with a dollop of humor but even the heat and the antics of a nude performance artist couldn t upstage galvin s remarkable hats vivid feather creations and delicate constructions of netting that defy the effects of gravity she s unique mark ellis on the board of boston fashion week said mopping his perspiring brow if she has a fault and it s not really a fault he emphasized it s that she s too modest one of the most innovative designers around enthused new yorker jay calderin who originated the idea for boston s annual spring and fall fashion weeks and was among the judges last year who voted galvin most innovative designer one of a clutch of awards the designer has recently collected still the first time galvin and i met she sighed i wish i d had better direction earlier in my life and knew this was what i should be doing sitting in her boston studio cum apartment an aladdin s cave of cunning hats and colorful leftovers it was hard to feel too much sympathy for the ambitious 30 something designer who s only been in the business a few years bello 2001 ready to wear collection capello rosa 2001 ready to wear collection her hats romantic plumed concoctions came first a hat is an instant facelift for a woman or a man she says then in response to her clients demands she began making clothes to go with her hats interpreting figure flattering designs in unique tactile fabrics i wanted to be an actress believe it or not she laughs you can believe it with her long red tresses and impeccable bone structure she s the sort of woman who could put a paper bag on her head and still look good in combination with a strong streak of individuality it s clear galvin was destined to make her mark somewhere i was a real tomboy when i was young but i still liked cool stuff galvin says traces of her mayo accent growing more pronounced with the memory as a young teenager she was already designing her own clothes which her grandmother a designer and dressmaker in her hometown of ballina county mayo made up for her i d go gran i want this outfit will you have it ready for me for tomorrow then there was the clothes store she haunted its upstairs packed with men s suits dating from the forties and fifties the surprised sales staff glad to get rid of stock no one else wanted would let her buy the suits at the original prices at home galvin would cut off the sleeves or make some other adjustment to suit her current whim destiny was shaping up though she laments the lack of career guidance common in irish schools at the time i remember i did an iq test they said i was mechanically minded should i be a mechanic an engineer nobody could tell me galvin talks fondly of her days in st mary s convent ballina the school itself was very inspirational i used to love to go into the church even though i was no more religious than the next person and watch the nuns in their long dresses and the way their veils would move it was intriguing too to see such dedication at 18 when galvin announced her intention to emigrate to australia her dad nixed the idea allowing instead the daft young one as he called her to go to boston where she had an aunt at the time i wanted to get as far away from ireland as i could but now look at everything i do it s got an irish dimension arriving in boston in the mid 80s with plans to study acting galvin met up with a group of like minded immigrants devoting themselves to the more serious task of enjoying life to support herself she took au pair and waitressing jobs it wasn t until she met the man she married five years ago that she became serious about her career he believed in me she says of bill gillis her engineer husband bathing beauties 2001 couture collection daktari 2001 ready to wear collection i could see marie had talent and that she just needed somebody to encourage her gillis told me a graduate of mit with a successful career as a computer engineer he knows something about the power of encouragement i used to race motorcycles professionally and there was a point in my life when people thought i was wasting my time but i did have a few friends who supported me so i knew the position marie was in she just needed somebody to encourage her while gillis was attending mit galvin began taking night classes at the school of fashion design in boston and quickly realized that she was on the right track there she learned the basics of dressmaking while she taught herself the art of millinery from old books some she found in ireland obsessing over the intricacies all of one summer until she got them right the death of her much loved granny galvin four years ago was another catalyst in determining galvin s future her description of what happened after her grandmother s death can only be described as extraordinary i felt something had happened an overpowering sense of creativity came over me suddenly it was oh god look at what i just made and it started getting exciting it was like i was blind but woke up one morning and found i could see though galvin has spent almost half her life in boston her connection to home is still strong it s where she gets much of her inspiration for her work there s nothing like being on the beach on a cold winter s day or taking a walk in belleek woods beside the river with the houses on the other side and smoke coming out of them i come back from ireland and i have a million ideas at the same time as galvin was showing her hats in a boston art gallery a major exhibition of hat forms by fellow west of irelander and the most famous hatter of them all philip treacy opened in dublin s irish museum of modern art in the old days people wore a hat to conform but now it s almost an act of rebellion treacy observed when he came over from london for the opening le jardin secret 2001 couture collection queen of hearts 2001 couture collection the two events combined might suggest that hats have become such rarefied objects nowadays that they belong in art museums but galvin told me two stories indicating that a hat that rises above the purely pragmatic may be rare but definitely not irrelevant at this year s kentucky derby while tv stars like loni anderson and courtney cox showed up in conventional brimmed hats it was a complete unknown wearing a ravishing black and white galvin design who attracted the attention of every tv camera in sight and had all the anchors asking who she was i m not anybody she admitted happily soaking up her 15 minutes of fame courtesy of a galvin hat hat starved women also displayed their enthusiasm recently when galvin was invited to show her hats at a featured event during cincinnati s prestigious annual flower show hosted by irishwoman mary margaret rochford head of the cincinnati horticultural society it was like a church bazaar galvin says remembering the aftermath of the sedate tea party hats were flying all over the place all the women wanted to buy two or three realistically though fashion begins in new york and galvin knows it it s all about new york when vogue or w magazine shows a hat it s always by a new york based hat designer because it s so much easier for them to access something right there in their own backyard having said that galvin revealed that vogue had recently borrowed some of her hats for a fall winter spread an indication that new york s fashion vortex has registered galvin s presence which nicely fits with her future plans meanwhile her website www mariegalvin com allows her to do business with anyone anywhere it s been a hectic year so far for galvin the cincinnati show the kentucky derby orders boston fashion week but the hard work has brought her closer to refining her goal i finally figured out what direction i need to go in i want to concentrate on hats they re my strong point

listen to this article listen to this article restaurateurs looking around new orleans for a niche they might fill profitably would do well to consider the old style country catfish house the concept is simple but much misunderstood all you have to do is latch down a source of wild caught catfish and i know that at least one major seafood wholesaler is looking for customers coat it with seasoned cornmeal and corn flour then fry the catfish to order no batching in fresh hot oil while paying close attention the all time greats of the catfish cookery in new orleans never did much more than that unfortunately two of the three longtime best catfish joints were lost in the years after hurricane katrina barrow s shady inn was killed by the flood the owners attempted to return but it didn t work out bozo s was tripped up by a generational change then sold to the mr ed s restaurant confederacy which under a new name has continued the bozo s tradition of excellent catfish only middendorf s continues a long term specialty in catfish and it s way out of town fortunately good catfish cooks are still out there by the dozen as we will presently demonstrate but there s plenty of room for more and it s at least as promising a source of enjoyment as the current hamburger mania is also encouraging is the recent expansion in the availability of wild caught des allemands catfish it always was better than the farm raised variety i have been saying for a long time that no cooking method for catfish beats the cornmeal coated frying mentioned above but there is one interesting alternative many of the vietnamese restaurants braise catfish in fish stock with peppers and lemongrass and the like in a clay pot this is very good and calls for its inclusion in this list not worthy are the

catfish before i order it and i recommend that strategy to you too 1 middendorf s river parishes exit 15 off i 55 manchac 985 386 6666 middendorf s so dominates local thinking about catfish that folks who are in principle opposed to any institution widely recognized as number one often complain loudly about it i have no idea why the catfish is fried to order hot and golden out of the fryer the thin cut fish has rebounded from the years when it was too thin but i still like the thick fish better they like small fillets here and so do i 2 hoa hong 9 nine roses gretna 1100 stephens 504 366 7665 the

five days after hurricane ida lashed the southeast and with more than 800 000 homes and businesses still without power the hunt for life s essentials groceries cleaning supplies and fuel is fueling dread of the challenges still ahead lines stretched for blocks friday at gas stations in louisiana some supermarkets have begun rationing water ice bread milk and other staples while one pharmacy chain has deployed mobile units to devastated communities aid workers have been filing into darkened neighborhoods at night to serve food by the taillights of their trucks residents with generator power or a place to stay outside the hardest hit regions have peppered social media with offers of help for shut in neighbors one louisianian even ran groceries and ice from a supermarket in lafayette to an elderly catholic nun in new orleans some 2½ hours away in ideal conditions the fuel shortages have made other essential resources more scarce as families stock up to avoid making multiple shopping trips and wasting critical supplies the result residents and aid workers say is a growing sense of anguish as louisianans confront the storm s sprawling aftereffects i m passionate about making sure people know about how impactful the storm really was even though you don t see video of the french quarter being destroyed said blair broussard who left her home in new orleans s uptown neighborhood to be with her mother in lafayette and later delivered groceries to the nun it s life altering folks can t get the things they need they can t talk to their doctors kids won t be going to school next week the southeast s supply chains have largely withstood the worst of the category 4 storm that made landfall sunday with 150 mph winds and blanketed the region in darkness grocery chain officials say they are receiving shipments and replenishing shelves and oil pipelines that rerouted fuel in preparation of ida restarted operations soon after it passed advertisement waffle house considered by emergency management officials to be the gold standard of disaster preparedness reopened all but 10 of the 90 restaurants it closed as the hurricane struck a spokeswoman told the washington post but the prolonged power outages ida wreaked unprecedented havoc on louisiana s electric grid in the hot and muggy summer quickly became ida s most worrisome fallout residents and aid workers in the gulf coast say an estimated 825 000 electric meters remained offline as of friday including 700 000 from entergy louisiana s largest utility the company said it would be another five days before its grid is fully restored down from earlier estimates of up to three weeks tracking service gasbuddy reported more than 7 in 10 fuel stations in baton rouge did not have gasoline friday morning nor did 66 of stations in new orleans half of locations in lafayette which was largely unaffected by the storm also were out of fuel residents of harder hit areas have been driving there to fill up their tanks shoppers have packed rouses markets the region s largest grocery chain to stock up for the coming days they ve been snapping up water ice deli meats bread milk diapers and cleaning supplies said tim acosta the company s marketing director on high demand items some locations are limiting purchases to two per family all 66 stores in the region are open powered by gargantuan generators installed years ago to avoid outages after hurricanes acosta said advertisement this is not our first storm he said but many rouses are operating on reduced hours from 7 a m to 5 p m instead of 10 p m because of limited worker availability many of its associates sustained damage to their homes or need to spend time caring for family he said for the rest of the company s employees it s all hands on deck acosta was unloading bags of ice from a refrigerated truck at a store in thibodaux during a phone interview with the washington post on a subsequent call he was directing delivery trucks entering the store s parking lot we have product coming into our stores we re finding ways to make it happen he told a reporter over here he shouted a moment later to a truck driver the sound of the vehicle s engine audible over the phone in the background all but one winn dixie location the region s other major grocery chain was open friday according to company s website though some also had reduced hours by saturday the company said those stores will reopen at normal times a representative did not respond to a request for comment advertisement cvs pharmacy spokeswoman amy thibault said in an email that 50 of its 134 locations in louisiana and mississippi were closed because of power loss or physical damage she said the company was rerouting phone systems from closed pharmacies to nearby open locations walgreens deployed three mobile pharmacies between houma and larose two communities south of new orleans that sustained major damage spokeswoman erin loverher said while some bank branches in new orleans are closed because of the power outages some atms are still in service liberty bank which serves several states including louisiana and alabama said in an alert on its webpage that two atms are in service in the city while all its new orleans branches remain closed through its critical needs assistance program fema is providing one time payments up to 500 for residents of parishes that were included in the federal disaster declaration while fema is helping coordinate efforts to deliver fuel and restore power to areas disrupted by the storm the agency is not playing a direct role in getting residents cash according to acting press secretary caitlin justesen even with stores open residents are still often unable to access some of those basic supplies especially in outlying communities with public transportation largely shuttered around new orleans the scarcity of gasoline presents a difficult choice aid workers say risk using precious fuel to drive unpredictable streets to grocery stores or sit in gas lines or wait at home for food distribution that may not arrive we ve got folks who can t come pick up food from us anymore because they don t have gas in their car said nate mook chief executive of relief agency world central kitchen all of these things combine the lack of fuel the lack of power and electricity it s a challenge and it s adding up advertisement world central kitchen set up its own fuel depot mook said with gasoline brought in from out of state to fill up its vehicles the city government s vehicle fleet does not have enough gasoline so relief agencies have largely taken up the responsibility of making deliveries to neighborhoods still shut in by closed roads or downed power lines after distributing dinner in parts of new orleans aid workers venture out in suvs into isolated communities without power to hand deliver meals and other essentials aid workers are strategizing he said on what kinds of food to distribute in addition to hot meals and sandwiches raw meat can be given out only sparingly neighborhood barbecues have become a popular way of feeding a whole block of non shelf stable protein while helping cooks avoid preparing meals in already hot kitchens fresh fruit world central kitchen founder and celebrity chef josé andrés purchased nearly half a million bananas oranges and grapefruits from local farmers and suppliers is nutrient dense and does not have to be refrigerated it also makes for a good breakfast in place of cereal and milk or eggs even if grocery stores open that s not helpful if you don t have power and you can t put things in your refrigerator he said a box of groceries is not going to be helpful when they can t keep anything cold or they can t cook anything send

sign up for myft daily digest and become the first person to learn about us economic news a sort of a sharp slowdown economists said that us job growth ruled out the possibility that the federal reserve announced this month that it plans to start scaling back its pandemic stimulus program as the spread of the delta coronavirus mutation has disrupted the economic outlook following the very strong non farm payroll reports in june and july the u s central bank ready this year the 120 billion monthly asset purchase plan has been cut and the plan said it will continue until substantial progress is achieved in achieving the maximum employment and an average inflation target of 2 these gains coupled with soaring consumer prices in the united states push up inflation the rise to the highest level in 13 years has prompted several regional fed presidents to call for more direct adjustments to be announced as early as the september policy meeting but the shockingly weak employment report in august showed that only 235 000 jobs were created last month while 1 1 million post in july the timetable was overturned and supported the fed to be more cautious when planning to exit the financial market there is a feeling that we are heading in the right direction in terms of the labor market lydia boussour senior us economist at the oxford economics institute said the slowdown in job creation and the delta variable remain a key downside risk which may help to wait patiently this excludes the possibility of an announcement in september that it will begin to reduce asset purchases added joseph song senior u s economist at bank of america the key question going forward is whether this is a one off print or whether we will continue to see a slowdown although the unemployment rate did fall from 5 4 last month to 5 2 in august the delta variable dealt a huge blow to some important sectors which eventually began to recover with the national vaccination campaign according to the us bureau of labor statistics there was no job growth in the leisure and hospitality industries that month considering the average monthly increase of 350 000 jobs in the past six months this number has dropped suddenly respected retailers and restaurants have also been forced to lay off workers with a total of approximately 70 000 layoffs more americans reported last month that they were unable to work because their employers closed or lost businesses due to the pandemic this indicator rose from 5 2 million in july to 5 6 million in august prior to friday s report the economic pressure caused by the delta variant was not yet obvious federal reserve chairman jay powell suggest at the end of july the current wave may have a milder impact on the economy but the extent of the labor market frustration last month makes this view doubtful so far we have seen central banks generally pay attention to the delta variant ellen gaske chief economist at pgim fixed income said that this did not derail them from the policy path but slower data starts to emerge and the fed may become more cautious and pause although the possibility of action in september is slim most economists and investors still expect the central bank to announce its intention to reduce its support sometime this year at the jackson hole seminar last month powell stated that the inflation threshold for the central bank to slow down bond purchases has been reached and that the labor market has also made significant progress he is also optimistic that many of the factors that prevent workers from filling a record number of job vacancies including lack of childcare services and increased unemployment benefits are probably fading august employment data provides new evidence that labor shortages are still severely hindering recruitment and employers have to raise wages to attract new employees simone mocuta senior economist at state street global investment consulting said that average hourly wages increased by 0 6 from july and 4 3 year on year which highlights the impact of supply constraints on employment growth coronavirus business update how does the coronavirus affect the market business and our daily lives and workplaces keep up to date with our coronavirus newsletter register here she said when the number of employed people in an economy is reduced by more than 5 million compared to covid before there will be huge conflicts and contradictions but there will be record vacancies clearly there is friction and no one knows about it how long will it last peter williams of evercore isi warned that the dramatic increase in wages and the prospect of pushing up headline inflation may also provide material for officials who are concerned about rising price pressures and advocate reductions in currency support he now expects greater disagreement within the fed on the economic outlook the current debate is centered on whether the fed is confident enough in the recovery of the labor market to announce the scale reduction at its november meeting at which time it will only analyze one more employment report constance hunter chief economist at kpmg said that in such an extremely uncertain period it is more likely to issue a december notice we are not sure if this number is the beginning of a new trend or a short lived one added paul ashworth chief u s economist at capital macros all you can do is wait
by michael snyder things just continue to get crazier and crazier in all of the years that i have been writing about the economy i have never seen anything like this the latest employment report that was released on friday is being described as a huge disappointment because the number of americans that were hired last month was way way below expectations employment only rose by 235 000 but economists were expecting a number about triple that size normally when this sort of thing happens it is because of a lack of available jobs but that is definitely not the case right now there are literally millions upon millions of jobs that are open but for a variety of reasons people simply don t want them a lot of experts are blaming covid for the worker shortage and without a doubt fear of covid is causing some potential workers to stay home in other cases mask mandates and vaccine mandates are causing people to reject open jobs that they would otherwise accept but i don t think that those are the biggest reasons for the worker shortage the types of jobs where we are seeing the most severe shortages of workers are jobs that require long hours and hard physical work these days there are millions upon millions of americans that just don t want to drive trucks load trains stock shelves or work at our ports unfortunately the machinery of our economy comes grinding to a halt without such workers and we are seeing that right now these days millions of americans would rather stay home and collect government benefits rather than work a difficult low paying job in fact the numbers clearly show that unemployed workers are going back to work much faster in states where enhanced unemployment benefits have been cut off that is an easy problem for our politicians to fix but we are facing another growing trend that won t be so easy to rectify our young people are increasingly gravitating to the internet economy they are figuring out that it doesn t make much sense to put in endless hours at an entry level job when so many others are making big bucks as social media influencers instead during this pandemic the white house has invited quite a few top social media influencers to the white house but i don t think that they have invited a single truck driver of course there are others that have made millions upon millions of dollars buying and selling cryptocurrencies nobody is ever going to become a millionaire unloading container ships but tons of people have become millionaires by trading cryptos or by becoming social media celebrities so why should our young people choose to do the low paying work that nobody else wants to do when the internet offers so many other promising opportunities i believe that this is the biggest reason why the number of americans that are employed is still more than 5 million less than it was just prior to the start of the pandemic we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us nearly a year and a half into the recovery the us economy remains 5 3 million jobs short of where it was in february 2020 before covid 19 threw a wrench into the gears it has been reported that there are currently 9 8 million job openings in the united states if you want a job you can go out and find one but the vast majority of the jobs that are available are low paying jobs that are not particularly pleasant and the rampant inflation that we are now experiencing is rapidly causing those jobs to lose the limited appeal that they once had in a desperate attempt to keep their low paid workforce officials at walmart just announced that they will be raising wages for hundreds of thousands of workers walmart is raising the pay for more than 565 000 store employees the world s largest retailer announced thursday that u s store workers in its frontend food and consumable and general merchandise workgroups will receive at least a 1 an hour raise elsewhere a mcdonald s in oregon has now decided to hire kids as young as 14 after raising wages to 15 dollars an hour did not work businesses across the country are turning to teens as young as 14 to cope with a dire labor shortage with one mcdonald s in oregon drawing attention with a huge banner touting the new policy the mcdonald s franchise in medford hung the banner after finding that raising the minimum wage to 15 didn t bring in many new applications but opening the door to younger applicants did operator heather coleman told business insider and earlier today i was stunned to learn that amazon has decided to start recruiting pot smokers to drive their delivery vehicles but it s not just amazon s in house workforce that needs expanding bloomberg reported wednesday that amazon has found a solution for the contract delivery drivers it uses to deliver packages from its fulfillment centers to customers doorsteps recruit pot smokers that s right despite the fact that driving while high on any substance is illegal the company is advising its delivery partners to prominently advertise that they don t screen applicants for marijuana use according to emails between amazon and contractors reviewed by bloomberg but no matter what these companies do it is just going to be really tough to recruit low paid workers in this environment because our leaders have flooded the system with so much cash young people will continue to gravitate toward opportunities on the internet that they think will make them rich but meanwhile the machinery of our economy will continue to break down the widespread shortages that we have been witnessing just continue to get worse and earlier today the wall street journal ran a big story about the nightmare that the u s auto industry is currently facing the u s auto industry is heading into one of its biggest selling weekends of the year with dealership lots stripped bare of inventory and some buyers having to drive great distances to secure a new ride for a second year in a row car shoppers are facing bleak prospects in trying to buy a car this labor day weekend the period has historically been a time of blowout deals and big sales events for car companies and dealerships trying to clear out old vehicle stock to make way for the new model year on a very basic level we need workers that will build stuff move stuff and sell stuff unfortunately those jobs just aren t very appealing today but if you think that you may want a job at some point in the foreseeable future i would encourage you to grab one while you still can because this current state of affairs will certainly not last indefinitely and it won t be too long before we see some pretty dramatic shifts in the employment marketplace

as the socialist equality party candidate for california governor i demand the immediate implementation of the most far reaching measures to suppress the devastating fires that have engulfed the state there must be a massive redistribution of wealth from the state s ruling oligarchy to rebuild and modernize power infrastructure to protect current and future generations from the ravages of human induced global warming the ongoing fires in california have burned through more than 1 650 000 acres of land and wildfires nationally have now consumed more than 5 020 000 acres more than half the total is still on fire and only one of the 85 active large fires has been contained a firefighter lights a backfire to stop the caldor fire from spreading near south lake tahoe calif wednesday sept 1 2021 tens of thousands of people have been evacuated over 1 000 homes have been destroyed with thousands facing the trauma of losing everything some are reliving the nightmare from the 2018 camp fire that destroyed the town of paradise killing 86 people air quality continues to range from unhealthy to hazardous for large parts of northern california and oregon smoke from the fires has traveled as far south as louisiana to the south and newfoundland canada to the north health officials warn that extended exposure to high levels of smoke can cause asthma or other long term health problems as well as make those impacted more vulnerable to covid 19 that such massive catastrophes continue to occur every year is a staggering indictment of capitalism and its media and ruling elite every year increasingly massive wildfires erupt across california and large portions of the american west as has been predicted by climate scientists for years yet the resources necessary to both fight and prevent these fires across and the state and country have remained essentially static over the past decade and when more personnel have been directed toward firefighting they are often drawn from the state s prison population each year an estimated 3 000 inmates are worked in 24 hour shifts for as little as 2 90 to fight fires through policies defended by vice president kamala harris when she was california attorney general and carried out under a series of state administrations both republican and democratic the systematic defunding of infrastructure and public safety is the other side of the vast transfer of wealth from public coffers to the state s wealthiest individuals and corporations according to data from forbes 160 billionaires reside in california and are collectively worth more than 984 billion much of which was gained during the pandemic as a result of government bailouts through the cares act and similar legislation just one percent of this wealth is more than triple california s fire budget and would provide for a vast and necessary expansion of the state s firefighting and fire prevention efforts among the companies directly responsible for the fires none stands ahead of pacific gas electric pg e which has prioritized ensuring billions in stock dividends are paid to investors by divesting any efforts to maintain and modernize the power grid the utility giant has also been found criminally liable for specific fires including the catastrophic camp fire in 2018 which their antiquated equipment sparked to evade compensating the victims of the camp fire and wildfires started by the company pg e declared bankruptcy at the same time california governor gavin newsom moved to bail the company out indirectly through utility rate hikes and directly with public funds there is widespread anger at both pg e and newsom for their actions anger which was tapped into to spur the recall campaign itself newsom s ruling class opponents in the recall election are however just as beholden to capitalism as he republican kevin faulconer is seeking to militarize firefighting having called for a war footing to fight the blazes republican john cox has similarly called for an air armada to fight fires the dangers of wildfires are also exacerbated by the accelerating coronavirus pandemic hospitals across the state are filling up with cases as schools open amid an explosion of the delta variant nationally and internationally not only do the fires and resultant smoke make cases of covid 19 worse full hospitals mean there is less space for any injuries caused by the wildfires and the tens of thousands fleeing the flames are forced to temporarily reside in close proximity with hundreds of others further spreading the deadly disease like the coronavirus pandemic a fight against the wildfires is not just a question for california workers the fires reflect the broader changes of earth s climate as a result of global warming and are now causally linked to increased global temperatures as a result of capitalist industrial and agricultural activity it is thus scientifically necessary that a concerted systematic and international response be mounted to combat climate change on a global scale lest the fire seasons of the past several years become normal with even more extreme infernos to come climate change is also behind the increasing incidents of extreme weather events such as hurricane ida which devastated new orleans and led to the massive flooding catastrophe in new york city and the surrounding region more than 60 people have been killed in eight states the fires sweeping across the mediterranean and the floods in western germany are part of the same deadly process any effort to address climate change is blocked by two factors first the subordination of earth s resources to private profit which drives the overuse of fossil fuels and other activities for the enrichment of corporate executives and wall street bankers second the necessary globally coordinated response to climate change is blocked by the division of the world into competing nation states all fighting for the interests of their own financial elite the only genuine solution is for the working class to fight for its own independent class interests climate change and the coronavirus pandemic will never be resolved without an international strategy that places social need over private profit the fortunes of the ruling elite in california and around the globe must be expropriated and that wealth used to fight wildfires and the underlying problem of climate change i urge all those who agree with this perspective to contact my campaign and take up the fight for socialism among the working class in california the united states and around the world support the campaign of david moore for governor
