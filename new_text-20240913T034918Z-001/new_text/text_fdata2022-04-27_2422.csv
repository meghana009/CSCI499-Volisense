compared to 7 7 million for the quarter ended december 31 2021 and increased 1 1 million or 16 6 from 6 5 million for the quarter ended march 31 2021 the decrease from the prior quarter was primarily the result of lower interest income earned on loans partially offset by higher interest income from investments and cash and cash equivalents and lower interest expense paid on deposits the increase from the same quarter last year was primarily the result of lower interest expense paid on deposits and higher interest income earned on loans investments and interest bearing cash interest income decreased 146 thousand or 1 7 to 8 2 million for the quarter ended march 31 2022 compared to 8 4 million for the quarter ended december 31 2021 and increased 214 thousand or 2 7 from 8 0 million for the quarter ended march 31 2021 the decrease from the prior quarter was primarily due to a two basis point decrease in average loan yields the increase in interest income from the same quarter last year was due primarily to higher average loan balances partially offset by a 38 basis point decline in the average loan yield interest income on loans decreased 163 thousand or 2 0 to 8 1 million for the quarter ended march 31 2022 compared to 8 2 million for the quarter ended december 31 2021 and increased 189 thousand or 2 4 from 7 9 million for the quarter ended march 31 2021 the average balance of total loans was 694 9 million for the quarter ended march 31 2022 compared to 690 7 million for the quarter ended december 31 2021 and 628 4 million for the quarter ended march 31 2021 the average yield on total loans was 4 71 for the quarter ended march 31 2022 compared to 4 73 for the quarter ended december 31 2021 and 5 09 for the quarter ended march 31 2021 the decline in the average yield on loans during the current quarter compared to the prior quarter primarily was due to lower recognition of net deferred fees due to a reduced volume of ppp loan repayments from u s small business administration s sba loan forgiveness and new loan originations at lower rates primarily related to fixed rate mortgage loans the decrease in the average yield on loans during the current quarter compared to the same quarter in 2021 was primarily due to the decrease in the recognition of net deferred fees due to loan repayments from sba loan forgiveness lower rates on new originations and adjustable rate loans resetting to lower current market rates the bank recognized 84 thousand 192 thousand and 768 thousand in deferred fees and interest income related to ppp loan forgiveness repayments during the three months ended march 31 2022 december 31 2021 and march 31 2021 respectively refer to the discussion below for the impact of ppp on our net interest margin as of march 31 2022 total unrecognized fees on ppp loans were 60 thousand interest income on investments and interest bearing cash increased 17 thousand to 138 thousand for the quarter ended march 31 2022 compared to 121 thousand for the quarter ended december 31 2021 and increased 25 thousand from 113 thousand for the quarter ended march 31 2021 this increase compared to the same quarter one year ago was due to both a higher average balance and average yield for investments and interest bearing cash interest expense decreased 48 thousand or 7 5 to 595 thousand for the quarter ended march 31 2022 compared to 643 thousand for the quarter ended december 31 2021 and decreased 868 thousand or 59 3 from 1 5 million for the quarter ended march 31 2021 the decrease from the prior quarter was primarily due to both a lower average rate and average balance of certificate accounts the average rate paid on certificate accounts declined three basis points to 1 09 while the average balance declined 8 7 million or 7 8 to 102 3 million during the current quarter compared to the quarter ended december 31 2021 the decrease in interest expense during the current quarter from the comparable period a year ago was primarily the result of a 46 basis point decline in the average cost of deposits reflecting reduced rates paid on all deposits and a 112 2 million or 52 3 decline in the average balance of certificate accounts partially offset by a 106 6 million or 26 3 increase in the average balance of interest bearing deposits other than certificate accounts in addition total deposit costs were favorably impacted by the 4 0 million increase in the average balance of noninterest bearing deposits to 194 6 million for the three months ended march 31 2022 compared to 190 6 million for the three months ended december 31 2021 and the 33 4 million increase in average balance from the same period last year the increase in the average balance of noninterest bearing deposits contributed to the three basis point decrease in the average cost of total deposits to 0 21 for the quarter ended march 31 2022 from 0 24 for the quarter ended december 31 2021 and the decline of 46 basis points from 0 67 for the quarter ended march 31 2021 the average cost of subordinated notes increased to 5 85 for the quarter ended march 31 2022 from 5 73 for the quarter ended december 31 2021 and decreased from 5 88 for the quarter ended march 31 2021 net interest margin annualized was 3 49 for the quarter ended march 31 2022 compared to 3 53 for the quarter ended december 31 2021 and 3 09 for the quarter ended march 31 2021 the decrease in net interest margin from the prior quarter was due primarily to the lower average yield earned on loans partially offset by a two basis point decline in the cost of total interest bearing liabilities the increase from the comparable period in 2021 was primarily due to the decline in rates paid on interest bearing liabilities exceeding the decline in yields earned on interest earning assets during the first quarter of 2022 the average yield earned on ppp loans including the recognition of the net deferred fees for ppp loans repaid and forgiven by the sba resulted in a positive impact to the net interest margin of three basis points compared to a positive impact of five basis points during the quarter ended december 31 2021 and a positive impact of 18 basis points during the quarter ended march 31 2021 the company recorded a provision for loan losses of 125 thousand for the quarter ended march 31 2022 as compared to no provision for loan losses for the quarters ended december 31 2021 and march 31 2021 the increase in the provision for loan losses for the quarter ended march 31 2022 compared to the quarter ended december 31 2021 resulted primarily from the increase in our loan portfolio partially offset by a shift in the loan portfolio composition to loan types requiring a lower general loan allowance the provision for loan losses in the first quarter of 2022 also reflects the inherent uncertainty related to the economic environment as a result of local national and global events noninterest income increased 40 thousand or 2 7 to 1 5 million for the quarter ended march 31 2022 compared to 1 5 million for the quarter ended december 31 2021 and decreased 1 2 million or 43 7 from 2 7 million for the quarter ended march 31 2021 the increase in noninterest income for the three months ended march 31 2022 as compared to the three months ended december 31 2021 primarily resulted from a positive 382 thousand change to our fair value adjustment on mortgage servicing rights as rising interest rates slowed prepayment speeds partially offset by a 83 thousand decrease in service fees and income resulting primarily from lower loan fees and foreign atm fees a 114 thousand decrease in market value related to our deferred compensation and a 142 thousand decrease in the net gain on sale of loans as a result of decreased refinance activity over the past quarter the decrease in noninterest income from the comparable period in 2021 was primarily due to a 1 7 million decrease in net gain on sale of loans due to a decline in both the amount of loans originated for sale and gross margins for loans sold loans sold during the quarter ended march 31 2022 totaled 12 2 million compared to 19 1 million and 68 1 million during the quarters ended december 31 2021 and march 31 2021 respectively noninterest expense decreased 93 thousand or 1 3 to 6 8 million for the quarter ended march 31 2022 compared to 6 9 million for the quarter ended december 31 2021 and increased 673 thousand or 10 9 from 6 2 million for the quarter ended march 31 2021 the decrease from the quarter ended december 31 2021 was a result of a decrease in operations expense of 418 thousand primarily due to decreases in various expenses including marketing expenses reserves for unfunded loan commitments and professional fees partially offset by an increase in salaries and benefits expense of 381 thousand primarily due to higher stock compensation expense and the impact of annual wage increases during the quarter the increase in noninterest expense compared to the quarter ended march 31 2021 was primarily due to an increase in salaries and benefits of 523 thousand primarily due to higher wages and incentive compensation higher medical expenses and lower deferred compensation partially offset by a decrease in commission expense related to a decline in mortgage originations in the first quarter of 2022 as compared to the same period in 2021 operations expense also increased 108 thousand due to increases in various accounts including marketing expenses office related expenses and professional fees the efficiency ratio for the quarter ended march 31 2022 was 74 77 compared to 75 31 for the quarter ended december 31 2021 and 66 69 for the quarter ended march 31 2021 the improvement in the efficiency ratio for the current quarter compared to the prior quarter is primarily due to lower noninterest expense and lower net interest income partially offset by slightly higher noninterest income the weakening in the efficiency ratio for the current quarter compared to the same period in the prior year is primarily due to higher noninterest expense and lower revenues balance sheet review capital management and credit quality assets at march 31 2022 totaled 958 9 million compared to 919 7 million at december 31 2021 and 936 7 million at march 31 2021 the increase in assets from the sequential quarter was primarily due to increases in cash and cash equivalents investment securities and loans held for portfolio the increase from one year ago was primarily a result of increases in loans held for portfolio investment securities and bank owned life insurance boli partially offset by lower balances in cash and cash equivalents and decreases in loans held for sale cash and cash equivalents increased 13 5 million or 7 4 to 197 1 million at march 31 2022 compared to 183 6 million at december 31 2021 and decreased 72 5 million or 26 9 from 269 6 million at march 31 2021 the increase from the prior quarter end was primarily due to increases in noninterest bearing and interest bearing deposits partially related to temporary increases in lawyer trust accounts these increases were partially offset by the redeployment of excess liquidity into higher earning loans and investments the decrease from one year ago was due to deploying cash earning a nominal yield into higher earning loans and investments investment securities increased 4 0 million or 47 8 to 12 4 million at march 31 2022 compared to 8 4 million at december 31 2021 and increased 3 4 million or 37 1 from 9 1 million at march 31 2021 held to maturity securities totaled 2 2 million at march 31 2022 compared to none at december 31 2021 and march 31 2021 the increase was due to the purchase of 2 2 million in municipal bonds and agency mortgage backed securities classified as held to maturity securities during the first quarter of 2022 available for sale securities totaled 10 2 million at march 31 2022 compared to 8 4 million at december 31 2021 and 9 1 million at march 31 2021 the increase in available for sale securities from the prior quarter was primarily due the purchase of 2 8 million in municipal bonds and agency mortgage backed securities partially offset by regularly scheduled payments and maturities the increase from the same period one year ago was primarily due to investment purchases throughout the previous year partially offset by calls of securities and regularly scheduled payments and maturities loans held for sale totaled 1 3 million at march 31 2022 compared to 3 1 million at december 31 2021 and 10 7 million at march 31 2021 the decreases were primarily due to a decline in mortgage originations reflecting reduced refinance activity loans held for portfolio increased to 709 5 million at march 31 2022 compared to 686 4 million at december 31 2021 and increased from 614 4 million at march 31 2021 the increase in loans held for portfolio at march 31 2022 compared to the prior quarter and one year ago primarily resulted from increases across all loan classes excluding commercial business loans the increases primarily resulted from focused marketing campaigns increased utilization of digital marketing tools and the addition of experienced lending staff during 2021 as well as strategic loan purchases these increases were partially offset by the decrease in commercial business

state officials on tuesday morning said they were close to a deal for a new budget both legislative leaders and gov ned lamont s administration have offered compromises sources said to settle their largest outstanding issue bolstering an early child care and development industry both now and over the long haul the administration has agreed to expand its funding proposals in this area for the fiscal year that begins july 1 though not to the level sought by the legislature s appropriations committee and majority democrats in the house and senate have offered another way to increase investments in infant and toddler development over the long term without tampering with the savings programs that have allowed the state to amass more than 7 billion in reserves and projected surpluses in four years we re in great shape house speaker matt ritter d hartford said tuesday adding that efforts to resolve differences in spending are 99 of the way there ritter also said house democrats expect to have a budget deal ready wednesday to discuss in a closed door caucus and that could lead to a house debate and vote on the plan on saturday the administration and legislative leaders have been sparring in recent days over how to better fund child care early childhood intervention programs and other efforts to help an industry that was hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic lamont s objections to legislative proposals largely have centered not on how the money would be used half to provide a new income tax cut for families with children half to invest in early childhood development particularly in urban centers but rather with from where the funding would come i just want to make sure we don t get tempted to go back to the old days where we got in trouble lamont cautioned two weeks ago shortly after the finance committee had recommended dedicating more than 300 million annually starting in 2024 to help families with children the finance committee specifically had proposed repurposing a savings program that s become known as the revenue cap designed to stop legislators from creating budgets with no room for error this cap was created in 2017 and says appropriations cannot exceed 99 of projected revenues this fiscal year that s a built in cushion of 275 million by 2024 the revenue cap would reach 98 5 and would create a cushion of 321 million sources said legislators have offered to drop this proposal if lamont would use another source of funds to ramp up spending on early childhood development for several years to come connecticut has used surpluses over the past two years to pay down almost 1 7 billion in pension debt in addition to the billions spent annually on regular pension contributions and the state is expected to make another huge supplemental debt payment at the end of this summer legislators and administration officials have said this should reduce annually required pension payments by 200 million to 300 million per year by 2024 or 2025 sources said lawmakers suggested that some of those funds could be used to expand spending on child care and infant and toddler development the governor also tried to reach middle ground sources said by offering to expand funding for the child care industry next fiscal year which legislators have said wasn t sufficient to address critical problems lamont s proposal doesn t include the 72 million the appropriations committee sought to boost wages for that struggling industry but sources said it does include funding to stabilize child care businesses beyond the roughly 25 million lamont proposed in his own budget last february lawmakers and the governor also agreed to use federal pandemic relief funds provided through the american rescue plan act to help child care providers legislators have said connecticut can easily afford to do more to help child care and still maintain fiscal stability the state has 3 1 billion in its rainy day fund the maximum allowed by law and the current budget is on pace to close a staggering 4 billion in the black equal to one fifth of the entire general fund in addition to the revenue cap the state also has a second even larger savings program still in place the volatility adjustment also created in 2017 forces legislators to save a portion of state income tax receipts tied to capital gains and other investment earnings revenues that historically have fluctuated greatly from year to year and since the stock market generally has been robust since 2017 the volatility adjustment never has failed to save less than 500 million per year since its creation it s not the state s coffers that are in most dire need right now says sen john fonfara d hartford rather its connecticut s children particularly in poor cities where the achievement gap is great too many children are denied those opportunities that most of connecticut enjoy great opportunities he said earlier this month when the finance committee recommended repurposing the revenue cap legislators and lamont appeared last week to reach middle ground on the revenue side of the new budget with several tax cuts likely in the offing i think this year you ll see the most significant tax cuts this state has seen in many a year the governor told morning radio talk show host brian shactman during an appearance on wtic 1080 am among the tax cuts expected to be approved are an expansion of the property tax credit within the state income tax from 200 to 300 the credit also would be made available again for the first time since 2017 to families without children or seniors a reduction in the cap on municipal property taxes on non commercial vehicles from 45 to 29 mills an expansion of the state s income tax credit for working poor families from 30 of the federal earned income tax credit to 41 5 this would provide roughly an extra 300 annually to more than 185 000 households a new 300 per child tax credit within the state income tax for low and middle income families
auditing is at best a cumbersome and time consuming engagement whether it s an audit of internal controls or one to produce audited financial statements there s always a fairly complex and time and labor intensive effort required tools to assist in this task have been available for years and as technology improves so do the tools progress in this area has been particularly fruitful in recent years going deeply into workflow analysis data mining and machine learning and artificial intelligence to get a better idea of where the tools have improved and what new capabilities they offer we asked a virtual panel of vendors of audit oriented software to bring us up to speed put away the old spreadsheet for many years the go to tool when performing an audit was the venerable spreadsheet there are still a huge number of practices where the spreadsheet is the primary tool for tracking projects defining workflows and recording results and they are still being used by some to perform statistical analysis and produce sampling lists that s pretty sad when you think about it as spreadsheets were initially introduced in the early 1980s spreadsheets have evolved since then and excel and similar spreadsheets do have enormous and impressive capabilities but they weren t developed to specifically address the process of auditing the fact that practices are still using them for this purpose can largely be attributed to inertia and familiarity with the software fortunately software vendors largely see a sea change in the works with more and more accountants seeing the large benefits in productivity and accuracy that the ongoing evolution of auditing tools provide these tools encompass advanced capabilities in areas including data mining analysis and reporting robin grosset chief technology officer at mindbridge said i see a lot of positive movement in recent years in the accounting and auditing profession to acquire the skills and technology to go deeper into analyzing and understanding financial data there s been a steady uptick in accountants and auditors upskilling to take advantage of available tools globally universities are adding in new tools including coding as part of their accounting programs and firms are rolling out digital universities to jumpstart their existing auditors on this journey especially as the cpa exam in the u s is being updated to include more data analytics skills it appears the tide has turned and we are seeing rapid uptake of advanced analytics in both training and tooling grosset continued it s not about weaning accountants and auditors off spreadsheets but about using the right tool on the right data to get the best analysis spreadsheets are a great tool for small data sets since it provides an easy way to transform and manipulate data for large complex data sets managed by data professionals more sophisticated tools should be used to transform and manipulate data but transforming and manipulating data is only part of the auditing process uncovering anomalies whether accidental or deliberate requires recognition and analysis capabilities that spreadsheets just may not be able to provide and there seems to be a general consensus that the accounting profession is waking up to the fact that there are better ways to handle the large data sets and workflows inherent in the audit process but progress is not always smooth according to colleen knuff vice president of audit product management at wolters kluwer tax and accounting north america even when these tools are available i believe that accountants and auditors for the most part are adopting tools that make their jobs easier and more efficient however they may not always be taking advantage of the full capabilities of those tools most people forget 75 of what they learn within a week of training so it s no surprise that without a continuous improvement process firms do not get the efficiency gains they hoped or planned to achieve from new tools she said with a plethora of choices in tools to perform a wide variety of tasks and workflows accountants auditors may also not yet be able to fully automate streamline or integrate their new tools due to time money or resource constraints this may create a sense of frustration that leads to a regression in tool usage where spreadsheets feel like the safe place to go back to work evan deford a cpa and global director of expert services at inflo agreed that inertia is a problem in firms embracing new technologies and new tools the global pandemic was a huge catalyst for driving accountants and auditors to seek to leverage new or additional tools and technologies unfortunately we are seeing there is still a broad range to the breadth and depth of the adoption of tools and technologies for the profession many firms have had an awakening to what tools are available in the market but now are either in a state of paralysis by analysis hold off deploying technology at scale due to and therefore are just dabbling in the space so it is great that firms and individuals are aware that there are so many solutions available to them but the struggle now is breaking the inertia from traditional practices still there is great pressure in the profession toward change and adoption of enhanced technologies and tools jeff gramlich managing director of accounting at validis said i think we all agree that are not taking full advantage of the tools but there has certainly been a noticeable shift over the last few years accounting firms frequently struggle with change management and often wrestle with the operational undertaking of implementing new tools versus a saly approach when the firm experiences new pressures in addition to those presented by clients such as the great resignation or ramping up for the regular busy season lean and game ready this drives the appetite to change firms are now regularly asking themselves how they can improve how they can adapt and how they can adopt new tools to facilitate this change for the better across the audit process there is a collective desire of the industry to drive towards improved audit quality and offering even greater services and insights to their clients this will be the single biggest driver of progress for firms along their digital transformation journey they will not want to be left behind or be seen to be relying on outdated technologies and processes duncan andison duncan andison stock adobe com but as amy pawlicki vice president of assurance and advisory innovation at the association of international certified professional accountants pointed out sometimes it s not the tools that are the problem nor is it getting accountants to use them accountants and auditors have access to many tools to help with automation and workflow efficiency and they absolutely are taking advantage of them she said as far as spreadsheets are concerned they can be a perfectly effective tool depending on the situation in more complex situations where there is a lot of information to be analyzed you likely need a more sophisticated tool where there is room for improvement i believe is better access to client data that s in consistent reusable digital formats this is particularly important as more tools make use of machine learning with better more consistent access to data we ll get better results with the new and innovative tools that firms are already using auditing from afar the process of auditing has changed greatly as a result of the pandemic it s not especially common anymore for large teams of auditors to arrive on site for the duration of audits somewhat fortuitously there was already a move in the way practices have adapted to performing audits remotely fueled to a large extent by financial operations moving to the cloud or being stored in remotely accessible databases this has resulted in a paradigm shift in the way auditing services are being conducted and delivered and that means a major change is required by the firms we asked our panel how they deal with this mass transition and evolution of the audit function and the software used in performing the audit functions and pretty much every one of them emphatically stated that having the financial data in the cloud was essential both for the process of remote auditing as well as obtaining optimum audit efficiency and accuracy along with this all of the vendors we questioned have recognized the problems inherent in auditing and collaborating remotely wolters kluwers knuff said many firms have either adopted our cloud based solutions or moved their on premise solutions to a hosted environment allowing their staff to work anywhere anytime they have adopted collaboration tools like microsoft teams or zoom to conduct meetings perform walk throughs and generally work in team settings virtually many firms have increased their use and reliance on data analytics tools and started performing 100 population tests where sampling may not be the best approach in a fully remote audit also pointing out the importance of collaboration and communication was kalil merhib vice president of growth and professional services at cpa com remote audit was occurring prior to the pandemic however it accelerated over the last few years and suffice it to say remote auditing is here to stay he said the biggest challenges around adoption center around firm and client communication and auditor collaboration cloud technologies support improved processes for both of these activities for example solutions such as onpoint collaborate provide firms and their clients a seamless communication platform for exchange of documents that flow directly into the engagement management tool solutions such as onpoint pcr and onpoint ebp have this functionality built directly into the application with our cloud based onpoint applications engagement team members can collaborate with one another directly within a chat let the software do it one area where audit tools have tremendously evolved is ai and machine learning these technologies allow audit software to do a more thorough and effective deep dive into data than was ever possible when the audit process was mostly human based in some cases statistical sampling of large data sets has been replaced with 100 examination of each data point something that just wasn t possible in the past ai and machine learning have been approached in different ways by different vendors we see ai used extensively in audit planning risk assessment and journal entry testing explained mindbridge s grosset the initial use case for us has been journal entry testing but once all the data has been loaded for that purpose there are a myriad of additional valuable uses of the data one of our most popular reports is our completeness report that validates that the gl is complete and can be relied upon that means auditors can then use our tool to pull requests instead of having to go making additional requests of a controller we also have firms using our interim module to do planning analytics understanding the entity and substantive sampling we also have a module that aggregates up the risk scores of all the transactions to give a user a numeric risk score by account and by assertion this will be an ever more popular feature as auditors move to the spectrum of inherent risk requirements in sas 145 and cpa com s merhib said auditors are already using tools that leverage artificial intelligence to audit client data longer term there is potential to further leverage ai to support more advanced analytics across broader data sets our dynamic audit solution solution created in partnership with the aicpa and caseware international is being built with a view to support the ability to apply ai and machine learning to the analysis of client data as well as aggregated anonymized data covering peer data for benchmarking and relevant external data das also takes this a step further by leveraging auditor knowledge and engagement data using data analysis and eventually machine learning to drive suggestions related to risk identification and response not everyone we spoke to was fully vested in ai and machine learning s role in audit yet though all are trying to take advantage of the newest technologies we have not yet seen ai and machine learning fully implemented in the audit process but we believe this is the way of the future said melissa yard senior product manager for audit and accounting development at thomson reuters in 2021 we added a tool to our cloud audit suite that uses artificial intelligence to identify areas of risk that are common to the audit here data is aggregated and anonymized then ai provides insight into areas where auditors commonly identify risk and at what percentage when performing the same type of audit looking toward tomorrow as to where audit tools are headed over the next several years data and analysis was a common theme in the answers we received according to validis gramlich we see more need for additional data to help with the audit some structured some unstructured and this is a big part of our focus we see the need for more frequent access to the data but more for analysis predictive insight and helping firms become more proactive and integrated across business lines and advising their clients versus strictly interim audit work cpa com s merhib said we expect to see increased use of machine learning and ai to analyze full data sets many of the modern capabilities are available to auditors but live in disparate systems by bringing these capabilities together in a single platform such as das as well as having advanced capabilities such as audit data analytics embedded directly in the audit workflow and procedures we ll continue to elevate the effectiveness and efficiency of the audit process the experts we spoke to pointed out some of the areas where evolving tools can improve audit productivity accuracy and improved confidence in the outcome but the benefits come with a price a tool has limited benefit if the person or practice wielding it doesn t know what the tool can do or have the training to know how to use that tool most effectively and along with the availability of the software there s also going to be an increasing need for auditors to upgrade their knowledge and skill sets this might be one of the most intimidating barriers to taking advantage of the ever increasing and evolving auditing toolset

more than half of americans tested had antibodies from a previous infection but things looked different for older age groups washington three out of every four u s children have been infected with the coronavirus and more than half of all americans had signs of previous infections centers for disease control and prevention researchers estimated in a report tuesday the researchers examined blood samples from more than 200 000 americans and looked for virus fighting antibodies made from infections not vaccines they found that signs of past infection rose dramatically between december and february when the more contagious omicron variant surged through the u s the most striking increase was in children the percentage of those 17 and under with antibodies rose from about 45 in december to about 75 in february for americans of all ages about 34 had signs of prior infection in december just two months later 58 did i did expect it to increase i did not expect it to increase quite this much said dr kristie clarke co leader of a cdc team that tracks the extent of coronavirus infections the older people were the less likely they had evidence of past infections the study found for those 65 and older 19 had signs of prior infection in december and 33 did in february that may be because older adults have higher vaccination rates and they may be more likely to take other covid 19 precautions such as wearing masks and avoiding crowds clarke said clarke said the tests can detect antibodies for one to two years after infection and possibly longer what does this mean for immunity studies have shown previous infection can protect some people against severe disease and hospitalization but cdc officials stressed that the previously infected should still get covid 19 vaccines the study looked for any detectable level of antibodies it did not distinguish how many people had antibody levels that might be protective scientists are still trying to understand what role these kinds of antibodies play in protection from future virus exposures

police investigate the site of a fatal shooting in pittsburgh pennsylvania on april 17 authorities said as many as 90 bullets were fired xinhua for most americans april 16 was just another saturday however within less than 24 hours from the day s early morning hours multiple gunshot incidents occurred across the country a shopping mall shooting in columbia south carolina injured 12 people an armed assault in pittsburgh pennsylvania saw 90 shots fired at a crowd of some 200 partygoers killing two minors and wounding at least nine the previous weekend proved even worse with iowa illinois indiana georgia tennessee and texas each reporting a shooting incident that killed at least three victims according to data released by american website gun violence archives as of early morning april 17 12 502 had been killed and a further 10 024 injured in gun related violence nationwide this year additionally 138 cases of mass shootingâ in which four or more victims are murdered with firearmsâ occurred over the same period the explosion in gun violence has long been a stain on american society as well as a clichã d topic of heated debate in recent years as the public security situation continues to deteriorate buying guns for self defense seems to have become a much needed move for americans in some states the authorities even encourage the possession of multiple weapons colorado congresswoman lauren boebert said in january 2021 i will carry my firearm in d c and congress because d c is one of the top 10 most dangerous cities in our country a washington post report in 2018 carried the headline there are more guns than people in the united states it read in 2017 that americans made up 4 percent of the world s population but owned about 46 percent of the entire global stock of 857 million civilian firearms several u s administrations have sought tighter gun control measures recently on april 11 president joe biden announced new steps aimed at regulating so called ghost guns as in the use of untraceable homemade weapons these efforts however do not target the essence of the american gun problemâ and in reality prove almost futile the call of governmental duty is often limited to managing the purchase and possession of firearms applying an overall ban has never been part of the mainstream voice gun control groups do exist but perhaps the apparent hesitation to put a complete halt to gun sales is more a matter of popular belief or of the longstanding u s tradition of civilian firearms ownership the second amendment to the u s constitution passed in 1791 considers freedom to bear arms like freedom of religion or speech a basic right civilian guns have undeniably played a significant role throughout american history the original minutemen militiamen ready to serve in combat at a minute s warning who achieved outstanding military successes during the revolutionary war 1775 83 to this day are heroes in the eyes of many but this is 2022 almost 250 years have passed since said revolution fundamental changes have occurred in both the global climate and the art of war a gun is no longer the american patron saint it has become the king of terror against the current social backdrop of increasingly polarized american politics and intensified racial conflict gun ownership has done far more harm than good the gun issue may very well be an issue with the american mindset it s not just about the worship of firearms it s about some of the most outdated u s ideology that has manifested in a variety of ways e g an unwavering belief in the thucydides trap of rising power established power conflict the borderline fanatical cold war mentality and a prejudice against all social systems that don t align with western democracy the world is changing the u s certainly has a proud legacy but an indulgence in past glories and applying a 200 year old mentality to deal with current issues will obviously miss the mark copyedited by elsbeth van paridon

helping you live richer reviewed by experts trusted by millions of readers whether it be in cryptocurrency the stock market or in a retirement plan investing is talked about constantly the problem is most people don t have a great grasp on what exactly investing is according to a recent gobankingrates survey of 1 000 americans 44 of people have avoided investing because they don t understand it however not investing can cost you though investments do have their risks even investing a small amount leaves you in a better place not investing at all here s what you lose when you don t start investing your quality of life in retirement suffers pension plans are less and less common as an employee benefit and social security usually isn t enough money to sustain life in retirement investing can be started really easily and it ensures you ll have money to live off when you retire take advantage of 401 k plans at your job especially if your company offers to match any amount of your contributions if your job doesn t offer a 401 k plan as a benefit think about opening a traditional or roth ira account and contribute to it regularly if your modified adjusted gross income magi in 2022 is under 144 000 as a single filer or 214 000 as a married couple filing jointly you are eligible to contribute to both types of ira accounts but if you earn above those numbers you can only open a traditional ira the main difference between a traditional ira and a roth ira is when you pay taxes with a traditional ira you pay taxes later and with a roth ira you pay taxes now if you think you ll be earning a lower income than you do now when you retire then a traditional ira is the way to go if you think you ll be earning more in retirement than you do now opt for a roth ira by not investing in any sort of retirement account you can lose out on hundreds of thousands the suggested investment into these accounts is 4 of your income so that ultimately you ve saved 70 80 of your pre retirement income say you make 60 000 a year now and want to retire in 40 years according to the inflation calculator 60 000 would be the equivalent of 288 061 in 40 years by not investing you re missing out on at least 200 000 you could have saved in your retirement accounts even a small investment can go a long way outside of retirement accounts you might think investing is just for the wealthy that is not the case say you save 10 a month and put it in a savings account that would be 120 at the end of the year and 600 after five years it s not bad but if you invest that in the stock market you could earn an extra 10 on top of your savings over time that really adds up at the end of 25 years just saving 10 a month can turn into an extra 3 300 in your pocket it can be even more if your investments do exceptionally well pick an app to get started there are plenty of resources that are specifically made to help new investors break in investment apps are referred to as robo advisors and can choose investments for you automatically based on your goals and risk tolerance betterment is a popular app that does this betterment even has the ability to make a socially conscious portfolio that directs your funds to causes that you re passionate about the fee for betterment is 0 25 of whatever you invest which is a bargain when compared with paying a financial advisor acorns is another investment app that focuses on saving for retirement the app chooses your portfolio based on when you want to retire the app will make sure your investments become more conservative the closer you get to retirement the app starts at just 3 a month always remember to only invest money you have and don t feel pressured to invest a lot to make a lot of money or chase the trends of what stocks are hot right now remember a small amount is better than nothing and if you re not comfortable with taking big risks in the market you don t have to more from gobankingrates methodology

kupicoo istock com commitment to our readers gobankingrates editorial team is committed to bringing you unbiased reviews and information we use data driven methodologies to evaluate financial products and services our reviews and ratings are not influenced by advertisers you can read more about our editorial guidelines and our products and services review methodology 20 years helping you live richer reviewed by experts trusted by millions of readers most americans don t really want to work after retirement after all isn t the point of retirement to leave your work life behind but the truth is that if you re trying to live on social security you re not likely to get very far in america like many of the americans who come up a bit short when it comes to the size of their retirement nest egg for some taking on outside work in retirement is not a luxury but rather a necessity but the double edged sword of social security is that if you earn too much outside income your benefits may become taxable if you think you might need to work after you start drawing social security benefits here is what you ll need to know about how and when those benefits become taxable when is social security nontaxable for many americans social security benefits aren t actually taxable currently if your combined income is less than 25 000 as a single filer or less than 32 000 for joint filers benefits are nontaxable the social security administration defines combined income as your adjusted gross income plus nontaxable interest plus one half of your social security benefit since the average social security retirement benefit as of january 2022 is 1 657 or 19 884 per year this means that if you live off your social security check alone your benefits won t be taxable however a significant rise in your outside earnings could trigger taxes when is social security 50 taxable single filers earning between 25 000 and 34 000 face a 50 tax on their social security benefits for joint filers the range is from 32 000 to 44 000 in combined income as defined above when is social security 85 taxable once you cross 34 000 in combined income as a single filer you ll owe taxes on 85 of your social security benefits the same is true for joint filers with combined income exceeding 44 000 is spousal income included for purposes of calculating the taxability of social security benefits spousal income is indeed included if you are a joint filer in other words even if you are fully retired and don t work at all you ll have to add your spouse s income into the combined income calculation this only makes sense because as a joint filer your adjusted gross income which is part of the combined income calculation includes your spouse s income ways to avoid social security taxation while still earning money trying to avoid taxation on social security benefits while still earning enough to live on can be a delicate balancing act on the one hand it makes sense to keep your combined income down so that you don t have to pay tax on your benefits on the other hand the average social security benefit of 1 657 per month won t go very far in most american cities one strategy is to take on small side gigs that keep you under the threshold of taxability imagine for example that you are a single filer and you earn 20 000 per year in social security benefits under ssa rules you can earn up to 25 000 per year in combined income before you face taxation since combined income only takes into account one half of your social security benefits this means you can safely earn 14 999 per year in outside income and still avoid taxes on your benefits this would bring your total income for the year up to 34 999 and you still wouldn t have to pay taxes on your social security what types of side gigs could you work being retired gives you the freedom to work flexible side gigs that you can fit into your schedule in many cases you can work a side gig that you actually enjoy and pick up a few bucks without affecting the taxability of your social security benefits common retirement age side gigs include the following craft or tradesperson reseller virtual assistant ride share driver online tutor community college lecturer bookkeeper consultant house or pet sitter if you can find a side gig that is more like a hobby to you than a job it can help contribute to a successful and enjoyable retirement not just financially but also emotionally more from gobankingrates

excluded from the calculation of finding and development costs fd a costs have been presented because acquisitions and dispositions can have a significant impact on the company s ongoing reserve replacement costs and excluding these amounts could result in an inaccurate portrayal of the company s cost structure finding and development costs both including and excluding acquisitions and

number is calculated by dividing the identified capital expenditures by the applicable reserves additions after changes in fdc costs 24 the aggregate of the exploration and development costs incurred in the most recent financial year and the change during that year in estimated future development costs generally will not reflect total finding and development costs related to reserves additions for

should not be used for purposes other than for which it is disclosed herein changes in forecast commodity prices differences in the timing of capital expenditures and variances in average production estimates can have a significant impact on the key performance measures included in tamarack s guidance the company s actual results may differ materially from these estimates specified financial measures this press release includes various specified financial measures including non ifrs financial measures non ifrs financial ratios and capital management measures as further described herein these measures do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by international financial reporting standards ifrs and therefore may not be comparable with the calculation of similar measures by other companies adjusted funds flow capital management measure is calculated by taking cash flow from operating activities on a periodic basis deducting current income taxes and adding back changes in non cash working capital expenditures on decommissioning obligations and transaction costs since tamarack believes the timing of collection payment or incurrence of these items is variable while current income taxes will not be paid until q1 23 management believes adjusting for estimated current income taxes in the period incurred is a better indication of the adjusted funds generated by the company expenditures on decommissioning obligations may vary from period to period depending on capital programs and the maturity of the company s operating areas expenditures on decommissioning obligations are managed through the capital budgeting process which considers available adjusted funds flow tamarack uses adjusted funds flow as a key measure to demonstrate the company s ability to generate funds to repay debt and fund future capital investment adjusted funds flow per share is calculated using the same weighted average basic and diluted shares that are used in calculating income per share adjusted funds flow can also be calculated on a per boe basis which results in the measure being considered a non ifrs financial ratio free funds flow previously referred to as free adjusted funds flow and capital expenditures capital management measure fee funds flow is calculated by taking adjusted funds flow and subtracting capital expenditures excluding acquisitions and dispositions capital expenditure is calculated as property plant and equipment additions net of government assistance plus exploration and evaluation additions management believes that free funds flow provides a useful measure to determine tamarack s ability to improve returns and to manage the long term value of the business net production expenses revenue net of blending expense operating netback and operating field netback non ifrs financial measures and non ifrs financial ratios if calculated on a per boe basis management uses certain industry benchmarks such as net production expenses revenue net of blending expense operating netback and operating field netback to analyze financial and operating performance net production expenses are determined by deducting processing income primarily generated by processing third party volumes at processing facilities where the company has an ownership interest under ifrs this source of funds is required to be reported as revenue blending expense includes the cost of blending diluent to reduce the viscosity of our heavy oil transported through pipelines to meet pipeline specifications and is shown as a reduction to heavy oil revenues rather than an expense as in the financial statements under ifrs operating netback equals total petroleum and natural gas sales net of blending including realized gains and losses on commodity and foreign exchange derivative contracts less royalties net production expenses and transportation expense operating field netback equals total petroleum and natural gas sales less royalties net production expenses and transportation expense these metrics can also be calculated on a per boe basis which results in them being considered a non ifrs financial ratio management considers operating netback and operating field netback important measures to evaluate tamarack s operational performance as it demonstrates field level profitability relative to current commodity prices see the md a for a detailed calculation and reconciliation of tamarack s netbacks per boe to the most directly comparable measure presented in accordance with ifrs net debt capital management measure is calculated as credit facilities plus senior unsecured notes plus deferred acquisition payment notes plus working capital surplus or deficiency plus other liability including the fair value of cross currency swaps plus government loans plus facilities acquisition payments less notes receivable and excluding the current portion of fair value of financial instruments decommissioning obligations lease liabilities and the cash award incentive plan liability net debt to quarterly annualized adjusted funds flow capital management measure is calculated as estimated period end net debt divided by the annualized adjusted funds flow for the preceding quarter multiplied by 4 for annualization source tamarack valley energy ltd

more than half of americans tested had antibodies from a previous infection but things looked different for older age groups washington three out of every four u s children have been infected with the coronavirus and more than half of all americans had signs of previous infections centers for disease control and prevention researchers estimated in a report tuesday the researchers examined blood samples from more than 200 000 americans and looked for virus fighting antibodies made from infections not vaccines they found that signs of past infection rose dramatically between december and february when the more contagious omicron variant surged through the u s the most striking increase was in children the percentage of those 17 and under with antibodies rose from about 45 in december to about 75 in february for americans of all ages about 34 had signs of prior infection in december just two months later 58 did i did expect it to increase i did not expect it to increase quite this much said dr kristie clarke co leader of a cdc team that tracks the extent of coronavirus infections the older people were the less likely they had evidence of past infections the study found for those 65 and older 19 had signs of prior infection in december and 33 did in february that may be because older adults have higher vaccination rates and they may be more likely to take other covid 19 precautions such as wearing masks and avoiding crowds clarke said clarke said the tests can detect antibodies for one to two years after infection and possibly longer what does this mean for immunity studies have shown previous infection can protect some people against severe disease and hospitalization but cdc officials stressed that the previously infected should still get covid 19 vaccines the study looked for any detectable level of antibodies it did not distinguish how many people had antibody levels that might be protective scientists are still trying to understand what role these kinds of antibodies play in protection from future virus exposures

the balfour beatty communities military housing company told congress on tuesday that most residents are happy with its units and that it has no systemic failures despite new testimony from residents who said unsafe conditions made them sick and a senate investigation that found mold asbestos and other problems the company which manages more than 43 000 military homes in 26 states was the subject of a newly released eight month investigation by a senate homeland security and government affairs panel it found the poor living conditions have continued even after balfour beatty was caught up in a nationwide scandal over squalid family housing in 2019 and it pleaded guilty last year to falsifying maintenance records our performance metrics indicate the overwhelming majority of our residents are happy with their home and the service we provide richard taylor the dallas based company s president of facility operations testified to the senate panel on tuesday read next air force general convicted in historic court martial avoids jail time but he rejected allegations of substandard conditions throughout the company s network of housing units which serves 150 000 military personnel and family members things go wrong we don t always get it right the first time we re not perfect we ve never testified that we are a perfect organization he testified military tenants were also called to testify at the senate hearing and painted a different picture of the housing army capt samuel choe said his daughter has suffered skin problems as the result of living in balfour beatty housing at fort gordon georgia my daughter s skin once youthful and supple is now reptilian in nature to where there are numerous times she will wake up in the middle of the night hands covered in blood from scratching choe told lawmakers she was a very vibrant social young lady and now she has withdrawn subcommittee chairman sen jon ossoff d georgia released results tuesday of the investigation into balfour beatty that coincided with the company s negotiations with the justice department on a plea deal for falsifying work orders and manipulating data in an effort to cover up complaints of maintenance issues and hazardous living conditions according to ossoff the investigation showed that the company did not prioritize the health and safety concerns of its residents or take steps to fix the problems more troubling he said the subcommittee found that balfour appeared to continue to engage in such misconduct while it was under investigation by the justice department and even after it pleaded guilty and was fined more than 65 4 million ossoff described the investigation as alarming and disturbing revealing injustice imposed on servicemembers and their families and grave risks to the health and safety of servicemembers and their families reveal neglect by balfour beatty which is responsible for housing tens of thousands of military families and reveal not just neglect but misconduct and abuse that persisted even after balfour beatty pled guilty to a scheme to defraud the united states between 2013 and 2019 ossoff said at the start of the hearing the investigation found that families at fort gordon and sheppard air force base texas moved into balfour homes that hadn t been cleaned between tenants and contained mold filth pet hair and trash and were exposed to mold and asbestos from crumbling ceilings broken floor tiles and previous water damage the families also reported a lack of concern and in some cases retaliation from housing offices when they requested repairs and maintenance according to the report choe a prior enlisted soldier who said he lived in military housing as a child when it was run by the military services said balfour looked at the home and insisted that there was no mold present he said he repeatedly reached out to balfour supervisors to make repairs and remediate mold in the home but was ignored i asked if we would be given the opportunity to relocate at least at the very minimum be provided another home to reside in while they could at least mitigate the conditions of the current home that we were at we were categorically denied both of those choices choe said air force tech sgt jack fe torres who lives in a balfour beatty home at sheppard air force base said mold began growing in his home when a water heater broke flooding portions of the house after a family member s asthma flared they asked about mold remediation which was approved on a limited basis by an industrial hygienist who never visited the house the family moved out of the house while it was repaired only to return a month later to mold in the house in all of the work orders for torres s house there is no mention of mold the investigation noted we found many issues unrepaired there was even visible mold underneath the can opener in the kitchen work was completed with band aid fixes or ignored altogether we immediately reported the remaining issues via the residential portal and the work orders were marked wet enter torres testified referring to the presence of moisture or water damage in the home was later changed to the category carpentry the department of defense entered into agreements with private companies to build and manage installation housing largely to get out of the leasing business and to improve the services housing stock much of which had been allowed to languish without significant repairs or renovations the idea was to build new homes and neighborhoods that would attract and retain service members and their families balfour beatty officials said the company has high satisfaction rates with tenants but taylor testified that more than a third of the houses it manages are older homes built by the u s military and have long standing maintenance issues taylor said balfour beatty like other construction and repair businesses has had supply chain challenges home access issues and staff shortages as a result of the pandemic he also questioned whether there was a direct link between the living conditions in the choe family home and the daughter s skin condition to my knowledge we ve never seen any photographic evidence of mold in the home taylor testified to my knowledge the medical doctor s letter that suggested the home might be the cause of the skin conditions or her school to my knowledge that doctor never visited the home personally the hearing is the latest chapter in a scandal that erupted in 2019 over the poor condition of privatized military housing the issues came to light in a series of reports by reuters on the presence of mold lead based paint and other dangerous living conditions in base housing managed by private companies military families have filed lawsuits and testified before congress on their poor housing conditions noting that the companies often ignored maintenance requests or took shortcuts in repairing their homes following a series of congressional hearings military leadership pledged to improve its oversight of these companies which hold 50 year contracts the defense department developed and rolled out an expanded tenant bill of rights last august that gave residents more leverage with their landlords and to negotiate disputes still advocates on tuesday testified that more oversight is needed and service members must be educated on how to challenge housing companies and resolve issues rachel christian founder of armed forces housing advocates called for harsh penalties for balfour beatty which she said has exploited service members in the name of profit how many more cases of negligence fraud and civil rights violations must be presented in this building before balfour beatty is banned from receiving further government contracts as well as removed from their current partnership with the department of defense christian asked the private companies that manage military housing hold contracts of up to 50 years many of which were signed in the late 1990s at the end of the hearing ossoff pledged additional oversight to provide safe housing for military personnel and said the company would be held accountable sen ron johnson of wisconsin the subcommittee s ranking republican agreed these men and women should expect to live in conditions that will not damage the health and safety of themselves or their families johnson said the question that kept going through my mind throughout the investigation is the statement fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me you had a settlement and two years later it seems like it

homeowners economists and even prime minister scott morrison face an excruciating six day wait to see whether the strongest inflation print since the introduction of the gst will be enough to trigger an rba interest rate hike consumer prices surged by 2 1 per cent during the march quarter with the annual rise now at a more than 20 year peak of 5 1 per cent easily outstripping what the market expected on wednesday treasurer josh frydenberg said the figure was a reminder that australians lived in a complex and volatile economic environment and he pointed to the war in ukraine as a key reason that fuel prices for example have leapt 11 per cent however the immediate question for borrowers and analysts is undoubtedly whether prices are hot enough for rba governor philip lowe and his board to announce a controversial pre election interest rate hike on tuesday may 3 treasurer josh frydenberg said the figure was a reminder that australians lived in a complex and volatile economic environment picture nca newswire luis enrique ascui many believe the case for an immediate rate rise from the record low level of 0 1 per cent is rock solid regardless of the timing of the may 21 federal election or how strong upcoming wage growth data is according to markets there is a near 90 per cent chance rates will be hiked to 0 25 per cent next week this is expected to be the start of a sharp hiking cycle over the coming months as the central bank continues to wind back the monetary conditions that helped the country through the pandemic rates were last raised in 2010 and the previous election campaign hike came in 2007 something that was seen as a definitive moment in the defeat of prime minister john howard the central bank is often said to have an unwritten rule that prevents them from making rate decisions during an election campaign others say hiking rates on tuesday will be a true test of its independence regardless the strength of price increases means the situation may now be out of its hands there ll be talk about the rba waiting for wage growth next month but that s not its mandate markets analyst kyle rodda said it s job is to manage inflation and support full employment everything is in place now for rate hikes next week whatever happens in wpi imf chief economist alex joiner went one further stating that anyone who sought to politicise a rate hike should be condemned these data make it abundantly clear that the rba should raise interest rates at its may meeting joiner said on twitter economists from all quarters should condemn anyone who seeks to politicise such a move should it not happen they should condemn the rba for doing same market consensus is for an annual inflation figure at 4 6 per cent which could prove a headache for people with home loans and a prime minister campaigning strongly on cost of living pressures frydenberg said people should know better than to ask the treasurer to speculate about what the rba may or may not decide it s an independent board frydenberg said what i do know is the cash rate at 10 basis points is at a historically low level today and i have said before interest rates will normalise over time we are seeing that in other parts of the country but i m not going to speculate on what the reserve bank may or may not do at the next meeting the meeting after or the meeting after that the treasurer did acknowledge the march quarter price surge but said the data showed why it was important to vote the coalition back in he predictably pointed to the government s so called jobs drive and broader economic record on the economy as the reason why only they could see the nation through the storm of uncertainty this is not a time to roll the dice on fake independents a weak labor leader and the chaos of a hung parliament frydenberg said as to be expected opposition treasury spokesman jim chalmers lashed the government this is his triple whammy of skyrocketing costs of living rising interest rates and falling real wages and that is what the number was all about today chalmers said this inflation number should be a wake up call for a government is out of touch out of plans and out of time in this country under scott morrison everything is going up except people s payee and they are about to be hit with rising interest rates on top of that highest print since the gst the rba has held interest rate at an emergency setting since november 2020 to help keep borrowing costs low and cushion the economy through covid lockdowns but an unexpectedly strong increase in consumer prices stoked by conflict in ukraine and ongoing supply chains bottlenecks has seemingly prompted the central bank to come around to a view held by analysts and financial markets rates will need to rise sooner than expected lest prices get out of control core inflation increased to 3 5 per cent over the three months to march a figure that hasn t been seen since december 2009 while an underlying figure of 3 7 per cent is well above the rba s target band of 2 per cent to 3 per cent the morrison government has been campaigning hard on cost of living measures and will no doubt be keen for the rba to keep its weapons holstered next week during a live press conference on tuesday morning morrison was asked how his government s one off cost of living payments will help insulate people from higher prices in the long term you know how we ve been able to manage money and ensure that wherever possible we ve been able to put downward pressure on those rising costs of living he said market consensus for wednesday morning s australian bureau of statistics data was for an annual cpi figure of 4 6 per cent but strong price increase for building materials new houses petrol and tertiary education helped blow this figure out of the water continued shortages of building supplies and labour heightened freight costs and ongoing strong demand contributed to price rises for newly built dwellings head of prices statistics at the abs michelle marquardt said fewer grant payments made this quarter from the federal government s homebuilder program and similar state based housing construction programs also contributed to the rise the cpi s automotive fuel series reached a record level for the third consecutive quarter with fuel price rises seen across all three months of the march quarter philip lowe governor of the reserve bank of australia picture brent lewin bloomberg via getty images for annual inflation to meet the budget forecast of 4 25 per cent in june prices would need to experience an unexpected fall notable prices rises were recorded across the food group in march quarter up 2 8 per cent reflecting high transport fertiliser packaging and ingredient costs as well as covid related disruptions and herd restocking due to favourable weather main contributors to the rise in food prices included vegetables up 6 6 per cent waters soft drinks and juices up 5 6 per cent fruit up 4 9 per cent and beef up 7 6 per cent the rise for the food group was softened by voucher programs in sydney and melbourne which reduced out of pocket costs for meals out and takeaway foods marquardt said the grocery component of the group which excludes meals out and takeaway foods rose 4 0 per cent in the march quarter prices for other grocery items such as non durable household products up 6 7 per cent which includes products such as toilet paper and paper towels also rose in the march quarter the local sharemarket sharply extended losses from 0 7 per cent to 1 1 per cent immediately after tuesday s data as nervy investors continue divide their attention between inflationary fears and policy settings that could stifle company earnings and economic growth the index soon bounced back but remained 0 7 per cent lower just before noon the aussie dollar briefly spiked to 71 71 us cents on the surging data before falling back to 71 50 us cents strong price increases for building materials new houses petrol and tertiary education helped blow march quarter inflation figures out of the water analysts had been torn on whether the timing federal election would mean the rba would hold fire on may 3 with the bank previously having signalled there was ample room for patience and that there would likely be no need to shift rates higher until 2024 some such as westpac economist bill evans expected the rba to lift the rate by an unusually large 40 basis points to 0 5 per cent on tuesday betashares etfs senior economist david bassanese previously thought the rba would hold off until june but the prices pressures that have been roiling financial markets changed his mind given heightened global supply chain bottleneck problems and more aggressive rate hikes expected in the united states bassanese now thinks the rba should and likely will raise interest rates next week by 15bps the case to hike is so obvious it need not feel bound by next month s wage report he said indeed while inflation pressures are building in australia they remain less acute than in the united states accordingly we don t need to risk jarring economic sentiment with a shock and awe 40 bps move next month consumer prices are tipped to have risen to a more than decade high during the march quarter an unexpectedly strong increase in consumer prices stoked by conflict in ukraine and ongoing supply chains bottlenecks has prompted the central bank concede rates will need to rise sooner than expected originally published as pre election rate rise a

more than half of americans tested had antibodies from a previous infection but things looked different for older age groups washington three out of every four u s children have been infected with the coronavirus and more than half of all americans had signs of previous infections centers for disease control and prevention researchers estimated in a report tuesday the researchers examined blood samples from more than 200 000 americans and looked for virus fighting antibodies made from infections not vaccines they found that signs of past infection rose dramatically between december and february when the more contagious omicron variant surged through the u s the most striking increase was in children the percentage of those 17 and under with antibodies rose from about 45 in december to about 75 in february for americans of all ages about 34 had signs of prior infection in december just two months later 58 did i did expect it to increase i did not expect it to increase quite this much said dr kristie clarke co leader of a cdc team that tracks the extent of coronavirus infections the older people were the less likely they had evidence of past infections the study found for those 65 and older 19 had signs of prior infection in december and 33 did in february that may be because older adults have higher vaccination rates and they may be more likely to take other covid 19 precautions such as wearing masks and avoiding crowds clarke said clarke said the tests can detect antibodies for one to two years after infection and possibly longer what does this mean for immunity studies have shown previous infection can protect some people against severe disease and hospitalization but cdc officials stressed that the previously infected should still get covid 19 vaccines the study looked for any detectable level of antibodies it did not distinguish how many people had antibody levels that might be protective scientists are still trying to understand what role these kinds of antibodies play in protection from future virus exposures

germany said tuesday it would send anti aircraft tanks to ukraine in a clear switch in berlin s cautious policy on military backing for kyiv that was welcomed by the united states the government has agreed to sign off the delivery of used gepard anti aircraft tanks defence minister christine lambrecht told an international meeting of defence ministers at the us ramstein airbase the move comes after heavy criticism of chancellor olaf scholz for refusing to directly send heavy weapons to ukraine despite announcing a turning point in german defence policy in response to russia s invasion us defense secretary lloyd austin said the pledge to send some 50 cheetah anti aircraft systems the english name for the weapons was especially welcome austin was speaking at the end of a meeting of 40 countries at the airbase in southwestern germany aimed at bolstering the defence capabilities of ukraine other european countries delivering heavy weapons to ukraine include france which is providing caesar cannons with a range of 40 kilometres 25 miles and britain which is sending starstreak anti air missiles and tanks the gepard tanks will not come from the german army but from stocks held by the krauss maffei wegmann kmw arms group government sources told afp they were taken out of service 10 years ago and need to be technically upgraded the sources said lambrecht admitted that the bundeswehr s weapons stocks are limited but said it will turn to the inventory of germany s armaments manufacturers to help ukraine ukraine orders and germany pays she said scholz in february announced an overhaul of germany s typically timid defence policy in response to russia s invasion of ukraine but critics say the chancellor has since failed to take enough concrete action they accuse scholz of weak leadership and say his social democrats spd are too reluctant to break from their historic policy of detente towards moscow scholz has even faced criticism from within his own coalition government a partnership between the spd the greens and the liberal fdp the chancellor has justified his cautious approach by saying he wishes to avoid a direct confrontation between nato and russia a nuclear power but according to a draft document seen by afp on tuesday the three coalition parties now plan to present a joint proposal in parliament calling for the delivery of heavy weapons to ukraine the document calls on the government to continue and where possible accelerate the delivery of necessary equipment to ukraine including extending the delivery of heavy weapons and complex systems it also suggests that ukrainian soldiers should be trained in germany and other nato countries to operate the weaponry

via birch gold group this week your news to know rounds up the latest top stories involving gold and the overall economy stories include not all so called alternative assets are equal gold holds ground amid market trembles and the customer base for gold bullion just keeps expanding why gold is more than just a well performing alternative asset what is the purpose of investing in alternative assets surely different investors have different reasons but diversification is most commonly cited and we shouldn t neglect to mention returns ask why any investor does anything and to make money is always going to be somewhere on the list we all know that any chase for returns brings with it equal risks both diversification and returns are considered factors in upside or potential growth likewise hedging or protecting your investments is primarily about ensuring that your savings survive market crashes and economic crises generally we think of hedges as a sort of portfolio insurance the hedging asset isn t expected to perform like risky return oriented investments rather hedging guards against downside or potential loss so what if there was an investment that offered the benefits of diversification return on investment and hedging an investment that could help capitalize on both upside growth opportunities while also protecting against downside risks of loss we turn to the experts at wealth management magazine who assessed the performance of the seven top performing alternative assets their methodology was simple take a classic 60 40 stock bond portfolio and replace 10 of the stock share with one alternative asset they then analyzed the five year results gold was among the top five performing alternatives which included commodities options funds real estate and energy mlps gold had a 51 51 5 year cumulative return compared to an average of 65 gold s return on investment lagged just behind real estate and options remember though high returns aren t why most people buy gold the other metrics are what we should focus on gold had the lowest volatility the highest diversification ratio and the highest sharpe ratio gold s benefits in a portfolio stand out even more when we only penalize an asset s downside volatility as a wealth management report notes referring to the first quarter gold for much of the period was the yin to the stock market s yang producing that most sought after of portfolio prizes a smooth ride among the five top performing alternative assets gold had the second best return an average of 7 69 per year after cautioning us that there s no guarantee that diversification through alternative investments will provide investors with a smooth ride going forward the article ends with a compelling message holding gold in your portfolio over the past five years might not have made you the richest of alt savvy investors but you probably would have slept better when the equity market nosedived at the onset of the covid 19 pandemic based on wealth management magazine s research it seems that gold is the alternative asset that doesn t just diversify doesn t just hedge and reduce volatility but also boosts returns but also helps savvy investors sleep better at night we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us that s pretty incredible risks abound and they re all likely to drive gold s price higher portfolio managers at vaneck associates explained why march was a good month for gold looking forward they discussed how the federal reserve s hiking cycle might end up boosting prices the first part is straightforward march brought us geopolitical risks economic risks and a generally queasy uncertainty have coalesced into a toxic blend of negative sentiments and gold thrives on fear for example russia s attack on ukraine sent gold to 2 070 on march 8 just short of the previous all time high of 2 075 yet this move in gold price was only possible due to the existing economic uncertainty inflation was hitting multi decade highs before the attack and not just in the u s the invasion has only intensified existing problems consider a russian embargo of european energy sales would plunge the eurozone into a recession for the history books and they probably wouldn t suffer alone then there is the russian monetization of gold vaneck s analysts point out that global central banks noticed that russia s 2 300 ton gold pile about 140 billion gave the sanctioned country plenty of safety that s why we call gold a safe haven after all for individuals and central banks alike the following observation is incredibly interesting according to bgm group gold represents less than 1 of global financial assets and a relatively small percentage of the total reserves of several large economies including china 3 3 japan 3 5 switzerland 5 4 and india 6 9 a relatively small increase in the percentage of global financial assets allocated to gold from say just under 1 to 2 could see demand double and with it the price of gold we ve seen both large and small economies display an interest in boosting their gold reserves over the past few years for the same reasons as russia though with less urgency but the consequences of weaponizing the dollar by freezing russia s global u s dollar denominated accounts are still playing out should global financial reserves increase gold holdings by just 1 demand would send prices skyrocketing a month after the much anticipated first fed hike gold has broken out and hit 1 975 as last week closed we know that gold appreciated in every rate hiking cycle dating back 50 years this time the fed s moves are likely to plunge the u s economy into a recession that would likely fuel gold s price surge even higher demand surging gold prices lead to the tiniest gold bars ever india s cultural enthusiasm for gold investing is well known india is regularly the world s 1 gold buying nation sometimes sliding into second place behind china recently economic downturn and soaring gold prices have made gold unattainable for many citizens of the world s largest democracy retailers have responded to meet that demand and a coalition of jewelers and gold dealers have released a new product 0 5 gram gold bars granted that isn t very much gold you d need to stack 62 to equal a single 1 oz american gold eagle however the price makes owning physical gold achievable for a truly vast number of buyers investing in physical gold is all too often considered the domain of hedge fund billionaires that s certainly not the case in india a survey by the india gold policy centre showed that 89 of gold investors come from middle income households the bulk of india s gold investors aren t necessarily those with a large and diverse investment portfolio but rather the average citizen with some money to spare these 0 5 gram gold bars have taken off among the younger generation even the college student demographic have become frequent buyers each of these tiny bars contains about 30 worth of gold by weight they re similar in price to a one ounce silver coin their introduction and rise in popularity tells us a few interesting things the first being that indian shoppers buy silver it s gold or nothing the diversity among india s gold investors tells us the nation has a cultural memory of severe economic crises droughts and famine and other natural disasters wars with neighbors pakistan and china civil strife and self inflicted economic disruption scar the nation s history these events left scars on the memories of the everyday indian citizen as a nation these people even college students struggling to feed themselves know they must be prepared for economic catastrophe that s why they insist on gold even in near trivial amounts on a global scale it s extremely unlikely that the 0 5 gram bar will become popular except among collectors for gold buyers here in the u s the 1 10 oz american gold eagle is an affordable first time purchase in the physical gold market nonetheless the newly minted bars are a showcase of gold s ubiquitous popularity immense utility and demand at all times

more than half of americans tested had antibodies from a previous infection but things looked different for older age groups washington three out of every four u s children have been infected with the coronavirus and more than half of all americans had signs of previous infections centers for disease control and prevention researchers estimated in a report tuesday the researchers examined blood samples from more than 200 000 americans and looked for virus fighting antibodies made from infections not vaccines they found that signs of past infection rose dramatically between december and february when the more contagious omicron variant surged through the u s the most striking increase was in children the percentage of those 17 and under with antibodies rose from about 45 in december to about 75 in february for americans of all ages about 34 had signs of prior infection in december just two months later 58 did i did expect it to increase i did not expect it to increase quite this much said dr kristie clarke co leader of a cdc team that tracks the extent of coronavirus infections the older people were the less likely they had evidence of past infections the study found for those 65 and older 19 had signs of prior infection in december and 33 did in february that may be because older adults have higher vaccination rates and they may be more likely to take other covid 19 precautions such as wearing masks and avoiding crowds clarke said clarke said the tests can detect antibodies for one to two years after infection and possibly longer what does this mean for immunity studies have shown previous infection can protect some people against severe disease and hospitalization but cdc officials stressed that the previously infected should still get covid 19 vaccines the study looked for any detectable level of antibodies it did not distinguish how many people had antibody levels that might be protective scientists are still trying to understand what role these kinds of antibodies play in protection from future virus exposures

have shown encouraging preliminary clinical results that demonstrate substantial improvement on a clinically significant endpoint over available medicines the fda granted the btd based on data from the pivotal destiny breast04 phase 3 trial where enhertu demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in both progression free survival pfs and overall survival os in patients with her2 low unresectable and or metastatic breast cancer with hr positive or hr negative disease versus physician s choice of chemotherapy which is the current standard of care the positive topline results of destiny breast04 were recently announced and these data will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting the safety profile of enhertu was consistent with previous clinical trials with no new safety concerns identified overall interstitial lung disease ild rates were consistent with that observed in late line her2 positive breast cancer trials of enhertu with a lower rate of grade 5 ild observed as determined by an independent adjudication committee historically only patients with her2 positive metastatic breast cancer were shown to benefit from her2 directed therapy destiny breast04 in which enhertu showed a clinically meaningful survival benefit in patients with her2 low metastatic breast cancer is the first trial to demonstrate that selecting patients for treatment based on low expression of her2 has the potential to change the diagnostic and treatment paradigms for these patients said ken takeshita md global head r d daiichi sankyo this breakthrough therapy designation acknowledges the potential of enhertu to fulfill an unmet medical need and we look forward to working closely with the fda to bring the first her2 directed therapy to patients with metastatic breast cancer whose tumors have lower levels of her2 expression today s news is a significant validation of the potential we see for the historic destiny breast04 trial to enable a paradigm shift in how breast cancer is classified by targeting the full spectrum of her2 expression said susan galbraith mbbchir phd executive vice president oncology r d astrazeneca enhertu continues to show

april 25 twice in the last week the biden administration promised to deliver 800 million in heavy and technologically advanced weapons to ukraine for a total of 1 6 billion added to nearly 3 billion earlier the u s has coordinated deliveries from canada britain and other nato powers these deliveries are just a beginning according to the u s government the weapons involved include heavy artillery drones that can fly themselves into targets and explode anti tank and anti aircraft weapons and tanks and more ammunition of all sorts the push now is to get countries with soviet era tanks artillery and perhaps even fighter planes to provide them to ukraine with the promise that the united states will replenish them with more modern western made arms in return new york times april 20 it is nearly impossible except for military commanders to learn what the actual military situation is in ukraine as in all wars no one tells the truth publicly about their casualties and how precarious their forces are u s corporate news reports about the results of battles have been skewed to exaggerate setbacks for the russian army and glorify resistance from kiev s army corporate news on the war in the u s and western europe have amounted to an avalanche of uncontested anti russian propaganda with the goal of demonizing russia and its leaders as in bucha a town near kiev temporarily occupied by the russian army the imperialist media collaborated with the ukraine regime to invent massacres or blow them out of proportion workers org 2022 04 63341 despite the lack of accurate information some obvious conclusions can be made about the consequence of these weapons deliveries and the goal of the u s nato forces washington aims to prolong war the first conclusion is that the weapons deliveries show that washington aims to prolong the war against russia and will continue to use the ukrainian population as cannon fodder in that war long before washington orchestrated the 2014 coup in kiev that brought an anti russia regime to power its strategists had as a goal weakening russia and changing the government there prolonging the war will kill or wound large numbers of ukrainians and russians the second conclusion is that the biden administration is risking this step even though it can lead to a direct confrontation between u s nato forces and russia the current proxy war can escalate to a war between major world military powers armed with thousands of nuclear weapons it can lead to world war iii a windfall for the merchants of death a third conclusion is that the arms deliveries provide a windfall of profits for the military industrial complex first and foremost for u s arms manufacturers and their investors last week reported the april 20 ny times the pentagon met with leaders of eight large military contractors like raytheon company and lockheed martin corporation to discuss how to overcome any supply problems both to replenish american weapons stocks that have been drawn down to help ukraine and to keep kyiv in the fight the two companies together make the javelin and raytheon makes the stinger the pentagon has urged manufacturers to ramp up production note that billions have been allocated without reluctance by the same administration and congress has so far refused to forgive student debt finance housing for the houseless guarantee extended unemployment insurance or pay for all necessary medical care the biden administration seconded by the republican leadership which is equally responsible for the u s drive to war pushes this dangerous policy of arming the kiev regime while disguising its role of using and manipulating the ukrainian people against russia biden claims the u s will avoid direct involvement in the war yet each step prolonging the war creates forces from the arms manufacturers to the most belligerent anti russian elements in eastern europe to ukrainians who feel betrayed by the manipulators in the west to u s generals who think the goal should be victory for ukraine that will push toward escalating the war and at some point the russian government may take countermeasures the russian government recently sent a formal warning to the united states saying that western deliveries of the most sensitive weapons systems to ukraine could bring unpredictable consequences ny times april 20 a movement has already begun in europe to protest the arms deliveries and the escalation of the war antiwar forces in the u s should continue to mobilize with the demands no arms to ukraine u s out of europe disband nato photo credit kke

for one former fidelity executive bitcoin in workplace retirement plans evokes a very non digital analogy birth control start with the real life context a fomo fueled frenzy over the 21st century s biggest investing trend in which scores of people feverishly trade volatile cryptocurrencies on platforms like coinbase laura varas a former fidelity vice president sees that growing activity as reckless behavior that goes against the principles of prudent investing like teenagers having unprotected sex so when fidelity investments said tuesday that it would let investors hold bitcoin in their 401 k s varas the founder of hearts wallets a market research and benchmarking firm said she thought of condoms consumers are trading crypto now in a risky way that we re concerned about she said fidelity is enabling consumers to do something that they re already doing and in a more responsible way it s far from clear that financial advisors and regulators crypto s biggest skeptics will agree fidelity the nation s largest provider of workplace retirement plans will let the roughly 23 700 companies for which it administers plans choose to offer bitcoin as an option for investors starting later this year retirement savers can put as much as 20 of their savings into bitcoin though individual plans can set a lower maximum almost no 401 k s currently offer a digital investment option that makes fidelity which oversees 401 k s holding more than 2 7 trillion in retirement assets for more than 20 million people the first big retirement plan provider to open up bitcoin to the ranks of salaried employees the boston based financial giant will give investors indirect ownership of bitcoin the best known digital currency through a digital assets account that uses its institutional trading and custody platform currently most investors who buy or sell cryptocurrencies have to set up a digital wallet on a cryptocurrency exchange investment strategies financial advisors overwhelmingly want crypto but they want it as a spot etf while many see a spot etf as a way to solve problems such as contango and higher fees there is skepticism that the sec will approve one anytime soon april 14 douglas boneparth a crypto enthusiast and the president of bona fide wealth a fee only advisory firm in new york called fidelity s move a very bullish thing for bitcoin the digital currency now at around 38 000 is down more than 40 since peaking last november at nearly 69 000 at the same time boneparth said it s unclear how fidelity will handle internally the bitcoin it holds for investors is it like a mutual fund he asked a futures exchange traded fund we don t know how that s going to work in its announcement fidelity said that a digital assets account in a 401 k would hold bitcoin and short term money market investments to provide the liquidity needed for the account to facilitate daily transactions on behalf of the investor investors will pay management fees ranging from 0 75 to 0 90 of the value of bitcoin they hold fidelity spokesman mike shamrell said fidelity will also levy a not yet disclosed trading fee labor unrest fidelity s big move comes just one month after the labor department which regulates company retirement plans issued a stark warning about cryptocurrencies in 401 k s cautioning companies to exercise extreme care when deciding whether to include them on plan menus one issue the agency said in its march warning was that plan sponsors are required by law to act as fiduciaries for plan participants and refrain from offering imprudent investment options calling digital money a speculative and volatile investment it said that retirement plans that move to offer digital currencies should expect to be questioned about how they can square their actions with their duties of prudence and loyalty in light of the risks described above u s 401 k plans hold nearly 7 3 trillion according to the investment company institute fidelity thus controls 37 of that market but its bitcoin move may presage a fight with the labor department sometimes being large means you can almost define what s standard practice said jesse st cyr an employee benefits lawyer at poyner spruill in raleigh north carolina while someone with the resources of fidelity can fight an audit he said a lot of other plan sponsors and service providers would not be willing to do so still cautious not all big retirement plan providers intend at least now to copy fidelity s move vanguard has no plans to offer a cryptocurrency option within 401 k plans spokeswoman carolyn wegemann said a t rowe price spokesman cited the high level of speculation and lack of regulatory clarity in this space adding that the mandates we manage for clients today are not well suited for investing directly in digital assets still the spokesman added given the size of digital asset markets their impact on capital markets cannot be ignored our research will continue practice and client management crypto certificates and advisor skepticism with ric edelman ric edelman continues his crypto crusade with a new book and a warning for advisors unwilling to learn about the asset class april 20 after the labor department warning more than 57 of retirement plan sponsors said they would never consider cryptocurrency as a viable investment option according to a poll by the plan sponsor council of america last month only 1 6 said they would continue pondering the merits of crypto in the wake of the agency s caution matt peterson the executive director of the national association of government defined contribution administrators a trade group for retirement plans for public sector employees said that while some members were interested in offering crypto investments it is still new territory and we encourage extreme caution for anyone deciding to invest their retirement dollars in a bitcoin fund a spokesperson for schwab said that while no companies using schwab s 401 k platform offer crypto investments on their menus around 60 of schwab retirement plan services clients offer a brokerage window in 401 k plans through which investors can put money into cryptocurrency products fidelity estimates that around 80 million u s individual investors currently own or have invested in digital currencies varas who is also a former vice president at citigroup s consumer bank for latin america said that crypto use tripled last year data from hearts wallets shows that nearly one in four u s households or 22 are now using crypto either for payments trading or both up from 8 in 2020 nearly four in 10 gen z ers and millennials own crypto for gen x the rate is 27 and for boomers only 6 trading is driving the nearly three fold increase a march 24 report by the firm said as crypto users cite fear of missing out fomo is no way to invest said varas who led product management and development for fidelity s equity mutual funds in the early 2000s she opted to leave after becoming pregnant with her third child fidelity s move is not about empowering people to take undue risks with their 401 k s she said the workplace is an excellent way to engage younger consumers in responsible investing financial advisors particularly independent ones who have a fiduciary duty to put a customer s interests first and avoid conflicts of interest have been relatively slow to embrace cryptocurrencies for clients only 14 of advisors recommend digital money according to cerulli associates but eight in 10 are getting questions from clients nearly one in two advisors or 45 said they expected to direct clients to crypto investments at some point still only 31 of advisors said they anticipated actually recommending cryptocurrency as an investment in the future varas argued that in a world of online brokerages like robinhood and investors trading meme stocks like baseball cards fidelity could bring seriousness to bitcoin this is much more about establishing a platform for investing than about letting people gamble with their 401 k

shocks to the system there is something about being detached from reality that makes it hard to go about your everyday business in the quaint asylums of yore it was understood that a few shocks to the system could bring lunatics out of a fugue state of derangement â a cold water plungeâ an insulin hot shot to induce convulsionsâ some electrodes placed artfully on select regions of the brainâ it looks like america is about to be treated to some shocks will they break the mass formation psychosis that styles itself unironically as â progressive politics â article by james howard kunstler republished from kunstler com the first shock will be the painful recognition that ukraine is not prevailing against russiaâ s operation z despite the combined efforts of the us news media and the intel community to put over thatâ narrative true it took russia more than a few days to overcome ukraineâ s nato fortified defenses but now most of that has been neutralized and weâ re into the final weeks heading towards resolution â which will be a ukraine that is unable to make any more trouble in that corner of the world thatâ s right hard as it is to accept operation z came down on ukraine because it misbehaved badly egged on by delusional war gamers in washington who could only pretend to support ukraine once the real action started no amount of chantingâ putin putin putinâ availed to stop the grinding russian advance stateâ s antony blinken and dodâ s general austin were in kiev over the weekend on a face saving mission my guess they tried to persuade mr zelenskyy to throw in the towel he may be too desperate and crazy to listen but itâ s truly game over the russians will treat him with kid gloves perhaps give him leave to settle in miami and enjoy the american dream with the fortune he has squirreled away there will be changes in the map ukraine will sink back into peaceful obscurity while the us and europe have to struggle with the impoverishing blowback from wrecking the global trade settlement system the next shock will be the utterly predictable crash of global financial markets which started last friday and is looking to gain momentum this week watch it shove ukraine clean off the media landing pages and the cable news chyrons the hang seng and shanghai exchanges closed today down respectively 3 7 and 5 1 percent pretty awesome china unravels with its massive lockdowns factory shutdowns and shipping breakdowns all because of more covid really i doubt it europeâ s markets are red all over this morning surely fretting over the suicide pact with america to go â greenâ by energy starvation the dirty secret is that nobody will be going â greenâ the way fantasists propose rather weâ ll be going medieval you can see our nauseating freefall in real time a friend set forth to shop for a car last week her current ride is eight years old and has 110 k on the odo at two dealerships there was no inventory of new cars on the lots the low mileage used cars were actually priced higher than the new ones which were not there and all prices are generally higher than a sinking middle class can possibly afford delivery of a new car could not be promised before september at the earliest the sales rep said i will tell you what this means it means that the car industryâ s business model is broken similarly a conversation i had saturday with the farm and garden store owner in town supplies of everything are off wholesale cost of everything is out of sight he usually has a hundred chain saws in stock this time of year this april heâ s only got ten anything electrical â no replacement parts theyâ re short on fertilizer and vegetable seeds meanwhile food processing plants all around the country are mysteriously blowing up and burning down no supper for you america next shock to the system remember covid 19 do you have any idea how much homicidal fraud was committed in its name by the pharmaceutical industry and the public health agencies of the us government â follow edward dowdâ s gettr feedâ to get a general idea the former black rock investment manager has been collecting the actuarial tables from the life insurance industry from country to country we are seeing a 40 percent increase in all causes mortality for people in the prime of life wall street has noticed mr dowd says the key to the issue is that fraud obviates the liability shield conferred on pfizer moderna et al by the governmentâ s emergency use authorization eua awaiting in parallel to all that is the criminal culpability of many hundreds perhaps thousands of government officials hospital executives and doctors who killed their patients while in thrall to the cdc dr naomi wolf has engaged over two thousand researchers and hundreds of lawyers in gathering the hard evidence of these frauds all of this will eventually flip the covidian catatonics out of their trances and their stupid masks sometime in may hillary clinton attorney michael sussmann will be the second russiagater to go on trial following fbi lawyer kevin clinesmith last year it looks like special counsel john durham does not need to make a plea deal with mr sussmann durhamâ s office already has enough evidence to move up the feeding chain to the bigger fish many still doubt that he will actually try i do not indictments of rogue bureaucrats and political celebrities will conclude the seditious mindfuck that sent the country reeling into mass formation none of these shocks can be postponed anymore the leftâ s war on americaâ s psyche is over america is

credit facilities was approximately 400 million see the reconciliation of non gaap items in the attached financial schedules i am very pleased that we were able to deliver strong double digit consolidated revenue and adjusted ebitda growth rates for the third consecutive quarter stated michael j brown euronet s chairman and ceo our eft transactions continue to rebound nicely with recovery of travel as more covid restrictions are lifted we also realized continued growth in epay and money transfer from our leading physical and digital distribution networks in addition our sales pipeline for our leading edge ren technology platform remains robust which we expect to contribute to our earnings results in the coming quarters the quarter wasn t without challenges as we commenced the quarter under the presence of the covid omicron variant only then to see the onset of the russian invasion of ukraine we have undertaken many measures to support our 26 ukrainian employees and we have shut down all business dealings in russia and certain other countries continued mr brown additionally we have begun to see inflation creep into discussions across our business while none of these items had a significant impact on our financial results we d be remiss not to acknowledge uncertainty caused by these events we are pleased that the diversity of our products and markets enable our core businesses to remain strong and we continue to have an optimistic outlook for the full year results these first quarter results include the adoption of asc 2020 06 accounting for convertible instruments and contracts in an entity s own equity under this asu certain debt instruments with embedded conversion features will be accounted for as a single liability measured net of debt issuance costs further this asu eliminates the treasury stock method to calculate the diluted earnings per share for convertible instruments as a result of the adoption of this standard the company recorded a 99 7 million decrease to additional paid in capital a 56 8 million decrease in debt discounts and a 42 9 million increase in retained earnings non cash accretion expense for the convertible notes was reduced to 0 from 3 9 million for the three months ended march 31 2021 additionally the elimination of the treasury stock method resulted in an increase of 2 8 million dilutive shares used in the diluted earnings per share calculation for the three months ending march 31 2022 the company has elected to continue to exclude these shares from the adjusted eps calculation taking into consideration current trends in the business the latest global covid 19 landscape and historical seasonal patterns the company anticipates that its second quarter 2022 adjusted ebitda will be in the range of approximately 150 million to 160 million this outlook does not include any change in foreign exchange rates changes in covid 19 containment changes in travel patterns stemming from the war in ukraine or other unusual factors that may develop throughout the quarter segment and other results the eft processing segment reports the following results for the first quarter 2022 compared with the same period or date in 2021 revenues of 145 6 million a 67 increase from 87 1 million 77 increase on a constant currency basis operating loss of 6 3 million an 84 improvement from 40 1 million 82 improvement on a constant currency basis adjusted ebitda of 16 0 million a 188 improvement from 18 1 million 191 improvement on a constant currency basis transactions of 1 328 million a 44 increase from 925 million total of 49 521 installed atms as of march 31 2022 a 9 increase from 45 497 operated 44 353 active atms as of march 31 2022 a 21 increase from 36 777 as of march 31 2021 improvements in revenue operating loss and adjusted ebitda in the first quarter 2022 were driven by increased domestic and international withdrawal transactions resulting from the continued lifting of covid 19 related travel restrictions across europe together with a strong recovery of travel as well as a continued benefit from a significant volume increase in low value point of sale transactions in europe and low value payment processing transactions from the asia pacific market the eft segment s total installed atms grew 9 largely from the addition of nearly 3 400 euronet owned atms 150 new outsourcing atms and the addition of approximately 500 low margin atms in india the difference between installed and active atms is from atms deactivated due to seasonal closures or covid 19 related travel restrictions at the end of the first quarter of 2022 approximately 5 150 atms remained closed due to seasonal locations or continued covid 19 travel restrictions approximately 40 less than the 8 720 that were closed at the end of the first quarter 2021 the epay segment reports the following results for the first quarter 2022 compared with the same period or date in 2021 revenues of 235 8 million a 3 decrease from 242 3 million 3 increase on a constant currency basis operating income of 26 2 million a 10 decrease from 29 2 million 3 decrease on a constant currency basis adjusted ebitda of 27 9 million an 11 decrease from 31 3 million 4 decrease on a constant currency basis transactions of 864 million a 30 increase from 667 million point of sale pos terminals of approximately 760 000 as of march 31 2022 a 3 increase from approximately 736 000 retailer locations of approximately 335 000 as of march 31 2022 a 3 decrease from approximately 345 000 constant currency revenue and transaction growth was driven by continued expansion of digital branded payments and mobile growth together with the continued expansion of the digital distribution channel offsetting constant currency revenue growth was the impact of a government ban on a group of apps in india due to data privacy concerns one of which was the top grossing gaming app in the country together with the previously disclosed loss of a key customer in europe and certain promotional activity in the first quarter 2021 that did not repeat in this quarter the money transfer segment reports the following results for the first quarter 2022 compared with the same period or date in 2021 revenues of 339 0 million a 4 increase from 324 9 million 8 increase on a constant currency basis operating income of 33 3 million a 6 decrease from 35 3 million 2 increase on a constant currency basis adjusted ebitda of 42 2 million a 5 decrease from 44 4 million 2 increase on a constant currency basis total transactions of 33 5 million a 7 increase from 31 2 million network locations of approximately 495 000 as of march 31 2022 a 4 increase from approximately 475 000 first quarter revenue growth was the result of 10 growth in u s outbound transactions 38 growth in direct to consumer digital transactions and 11 growth in international originated money transfers which was a combination of 15 growth in europe outbound transactions partially offset by a decline of 9 in transactions originated in asia pacific and the middle east where covid 19 lockdowns weighed significantly on transactions during the period moreover revenue growth was partially offset by declines in the u s domestic business operating income and adjusted ebitda were lower from continued investments in physical and digital network expansion higher costs to support technology and certain new product development and advertising costs in the current period while the money transfer segment continued to grow network locations year over year by 4 the segment suspended its service to russia belarus and tajikistan which resulted in a decline from the december 31 2021 count by more than 20 000 locations the closure of these locations had nominal impact on our revenue and operating profits corporate and other reports 16 5 million of expense for the first quarter 2022 compared with 14 0 million for the first quarter 2021 the increase in corporate expense for the first quarter is largely due to higher short and long term compensation expense balance sheet and financial positionunrestricted cash and cash equivalents on hand was 986 5 million as of march 31 2022 compared to 1 260 5 million as of december 31 2021 the decrease in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents is largely from cash placed into the atms in response to increased travel demands the acquisition of piraeus merchant services share repurchases of 70 million and working capital changes partially offset by cash generated from operations of approximately 20 million in the first quarter of 2022 as well as borrowings on the revolver which is also reflected in the increase in debt total indebtedness was 1 77 billion as of march 31 2022 compared to 1 43 billion as of december 31 2021 as of march 31 2022 availability under the company s revolving credit facilities was approximately 400 million non gaap measuresin addition to the

economic activity trackers our australian economic activity tracker fell slightly over the last week but remains strong suggesting the economy is continuing to grow at a solid pace our european and us trackers also fell slightly with that for europe remaining surprisingly strong based on weekly data for eg job ads restaurant bookings confidence mobility credit debit card transactions retail foot traffic hotel bookings source amp major global economic events and implications us data was dominated by housing related releases in the past week and they were mixed while housing starts and permits surprisingly rose the nahb s home builder conditions index and existing home sales fell with mortgage rates rising above their last high in 2018 not helping that said the weakness in home sales may largely reflect a lack of stock on the market and the homeowner vacancy rate is at a record low suggesting that home building will likely remain relatively strong meanwhile manufacturing conditions remained strong in april with a fall in the philadelphia region to a still strong level and a sharp rise in the new york region jobless claims fell with continuing claims at their lowest since 1970 fortunately both the philadelphia and new york surveys reported some improvement in supplier delivery times so far 18 of us s p 500 companies have reported december quarter earnings with 80 beating expectations compared to a norm of 76 consensus earnings expectations for the quarter have moved up from 4 3 yoy a week ago to now 5 5 yoy but with the average beat running at about 8 it s likely to end up at about 12 yoy this is well down from the growth pace seen in the previous four quarters but they were pushed up by the initial recovery from the pandemic energy materials and industrials are seeing the strongest earnings growth the continuing strength in earnings is proving to be an ongoing source of support for the us share market key to watch going forward will be the impact of rising costs source bloomberg amp canadian cpi inflation rose more than expected to 6 7 yoy in march with underlying inflation rising to 3 8 yoy keeping the bank of canada on track for further rate hikes similarly in new zealand inflation rose to 6 9 with further rises in underlying inflation while fractionally less than expected it will also keep the rbnz on track for further rate hikes japanese business conditions pmi s rose in april but only to a relatively soft reading of 50 9 inflation rose to 1 2 yoy in march on the back of higher energy prices but core inflation only rose to 0 7 yoy source bloomberg amp chinese economic activity data slowed in march by less than expected but further weakness is likely march quarter gdp growth came in slightly stronger than expected at 4 8 yoy and industrial production and investment slowed in march but by less than expected however march retail sales contracted by 3 5 yoy and unemployment rose with covid lockdowns expanding and continuing into this quarter and high frequency weekly data running well below year ago levels a further sharp slowing in growth is likely more policy support is likely but the pboc with just a 0 25 cut to bank required reserves last week and no cut to interest rates appears reluctant to be too aggressive so much of the focus will likely be on credit easing and fiscal stimulus australian economic events and implications australian business conditions pmis remained strong in april actually rising slightly suggesting that economic growth remains solid despite omicron s continuing disruptions to the workforce and supply constraints see chart above price pressures remain high though outlook for investment markets shares are likely to see continued volatility as the ukraine crisis continues to unfold and inflation monetary tightening the us mid term elections and geopolitical tensions with china and maybe iran impact however we see shares providing upper single digit returns on a 12 month horizon as global recovery continues profit growth slows but remains solid and interest rates rise but not to onerous levels at least for the next year still low yields and a capital loss from a further rise in yields are likely to result in negative returns from bonds unlisted commercial property may see some weakness in retail and office returns as online retail activity remains well above pre covid levels and office occupancy remains well below pre covid levels but industrial property is likely to be strong unlisted infrastructure is expected to see solid returns australian home price gains are likely to slow further with average prices falling from mid year as poor affordability rising mortgage rates reduced home buyer incentives and rising listings impact expect a 10 to 15 top to bottom fall in prices from mid year year into 2024 but with large variation between regions sydney and melbourne prices may have already peaked a rising trend in the aud is likely over the next 12 months helped by strong commodity prices probably taking it to about us0 80

from 36 777 as of march 31 2021 improvements in revenue operating loss and adjusted ebitda in the first quarter 2022 were driven by increased domestic and international withdrawal transactions resulting from the continued lifting of covid 19 related travel restrictions across europe together with a strong recovery of travel as well as a continued benefit from a significant volume increase in low value point of sale transactions in europe and low value payment processing transactions from the asia pacific market the eft segment s total installed atms grew 9 largely from the addition of nearly 3 400 euronet owned atms 150 new outsourcing atms and the addition of approximately 500 low margin atms in india the difference between installed and active atms is from atms deactivated due to seasonal closures or covid 19 related travel restrictions at the end of the first quarter of 2022 approximately 5 150 atms remained closed due to seasonal locations or continued covid 19 travel restrictions approximately 40 less than the 8 720 that were closed at the end of the first quarter 2021 the epay segment reports the following results for the first quarter 2022 compared with the same

345 000 constant currency revenue and transaction growth was driven by continued expansion of digital branded payments and mobile growth together with the continued expansion of the digital distribution channel offsetting constant currency revenue growth was the impact of a government ban on a group of apps in india due to data privacy concerns one of which was the top grossing gaming app in the country together with the previously disclosed loss of a key customer in europe and certain promotional activity in the first quarter 2021 that did not repeat in this quarter the money

475 000 first quarter revenue growth was the result of 10 growth in u s outbound transactions 38 growth in direct to consumer digital transactions and 11 growth in international originated money transfers which was a combination of 15 growth in europe outbound transactions partially offset by a decline of 9 in transactions originated in asia pacific and the middle east where covid 19 lockdowns weighed significantly on transactions during the period moreover revenue growth was partially offset by declines in the u s domestic business operating income and adjusted ebitda were lower from continued investments in physical and digital network expansion higher costs to support technology and certain new product development and advertising costs in the current period while the money transfer segment continued to grow network locations year over year by 4 the segment suspended its service to russia belarus and tajikistan which resulted in a decline from the december 31 2021 count by more than 20 000 locations the closure of these locations had nominal impact on our revenue and operating profits corporate and other reports 16 5 million of expense for the first quarter 2022 compared with 14 0 million for the first quarter 2021 the increase in corporate expense for the first quarter is largely due to higher short and long term compensation expense balance sheet and financial position unrestricted cash and cash equivalents on hand was 986 5 million as of march 31 2022 compared to 1 260 5 million as of december 31 2021 the decrease in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents is largely from cash placed into the atms in response to increased travel demands the acquisition of piraeus merchant services share repurchases of 70 million and working capital changes partially offset by cash generated from operations of approximately 20 million in the first quarter of 2022 as well as borrowings on the revolver which is also reflected in the increase in debt total indebtedness was 1 77 billion as of march 31 2022 compared to 1 43 billion as of december 31 2021 as of march 31 2022 availability under the company s revolving credit facilities was approximately 400

transaction growth was driven by continued expansion of digital branded payments and mobile growth together with the continued expansion of the digital distribution channel offsetting constant currency revenue growth was the impact of a government ban on a group of apps in india due to data privacy concerns one of which was the top grossing gaming app in the country together with the

expansion higher costs to support technology and certain new product development and advertising costs in the current period while the money transfer segment continued to grow network locations year over year by 4 the segment suspended its service to russia belarus and tajikistan which resulted in a decline from the december 31 2021 count by more than 20 000 locations the closure of these locations had nominal impact on our revenue and operating profits corporate and other reports 16 5 million of expense for the first quarter 2022 compared with 14 0 million for the first quarter 2021

homeowners economists and even prime minister scott morrison are on tenterhooks as to whether the strongest inflation print since the introduction of the gst will trigger an rba interest rate hike next week consumer prices rose by 2 1 per cent to a more than decade high during the march quarter and were 5 1 per cent higher through the year easily outstripping the market s expectations ahead of wednesday morning s drop from the australian bureau of statistics the key question for borrowers and analysts now is whether this is hot enough for governor philip lowe and his board to announce a controversial pre election interest rate hike on tuesday market consensus was for an annual cpi figure of 4 6 per cent but strong price increases for building materials new houses petrol and tertiary education helped blow this figure out of the water continued shortages of building supplies and labour heightened freight costs and ongoing strong demand contributed to price rises for newly built dwellings head of prices statistics at the abs michelle marquardt said fewer grant payments made this quarter from the federal government s homebuilder program and similar state based housing construction programs also contributed to the rise the cpi s automotive fuel series reached a record level for the third consecutive quarter with fuel price rises seen across all three months of the march quarter the local sharemarket sharply extended losses from 0 7 per cent to 1 1 per cent immediately after tuesday s data as nervy investors continue to divide their attention between inflationary fears and policy settings that could stifle company earnings and economic growth wednesday s data will also fray the nerves for people with home loans as well as a prime minister campaigning strongly on cost of living pressures the rba has held the interest rate at an emergency setting of 0 1 per cent since november 2020 to help keep borrowing costs low and cushion the economy through the coronavirus pandemic the interest rate has not been increased since 2010 and was last hiked during an election campaign in 2007 something that was seen as a definitive moment in the defeat of prime minister john howard analysts had been torn on whether the timing federal election would mean the rba would keep its weapon in the holster but an unexpectedly strong increase in consumer prices stoked by conflict in ukraine and ongoing supply chains bottlenecks has prompted the central bank to come around to a view held by analysts and financial markets rates will need to rise sooner than expected lest prices get out of control some such as westpac economist bill evans expect the rba to lift the rate by an unusually large 40 basis points to 0 5 per cent on tuesday betashares etfs senior economist david bassanese previously excepted the rba to hold off until june but the price pressures roiling financial markets have changed his mind given heightened global supply chain bottleneck problems and more aggressive rate hikes expected in the united states bassanese now thinks the rba should and likely will raise interest rates next week by 15bps the case to hike is so obvious it need not feel bound by next month s wage report he said indeed while inflation pressures are building in australia they remain less acute than in the united states accordingly we don t need to risk jarring economic sentiment with a shock and awe 40 bps move next month morrison will no doubt be hoping the rba holds fire during a live press conference on tuesday morning morrison was asked how his government s one off cost of living payments will help insulate people from higher prices in the long term you know how we ve been able to manage money and ensure that wherever possible we ve been able to put downward pressure on those rising costs of living he said by alex druce news com au
