here s a trio of names that have what it takes to make investors happy for years to come if you invest in a company you are buying it for the long term believing that management can steer it to success over years and even decades that s different from speculators looking to take advantage of short term price moves which could be driven by little more than investor sentiment here are three stocks that do things in unique ways that should set them apart from their peers for a very long time to come and that could be very rewarding for you and your portfolio 1 going where the value lies as far as real estate investment trusts reits go w p carey s wpc 0 14 core net lease business model is pretty common like many of its peers it owns single tenant properties where its lessees pay most of the assets costs it s a popular reit model because it s generally pretty low risk however w p carey takes this approach and does something more with it for example the reit is highly opportunistic looking to put money to work when and where it makes the most sense for investors many of its peers are laser focused on just one or two property types which limits their flexibility w p carey on the other hand spreads its portfolio across the industrial 25 of rents warehouse 24 office 21 retail 17 and self storage sectors 5 as well as its other category to round things out and it generates 37 of its rents from outside the united states mostly from europe 25 of rents while most of its peers focus only on domestic properties in other words this incredibly diversified reit can literally go just about anywhere at any time and that gives it a sustainable competitive advantage today the dividend yield is an attractive 5 3 and has been increased every year since the reit s 1998 initial public offering it s worth a close look for investors seeking to maximize the income their portfolios generate 2 a focus on brands and innovation the next name up is food maker hormel hrl 0 52 although there s nothing materially different about the food the company offers it is highly focused on the protein space that specialization distinguishes it from more diversified food companies hormel also happens to own some of the most iconic protein brands around including namesake hormel spam skippy and most recently its planters products all in the company owns an impressive collection of brands that are no 1 or no 2 in their category and spread across the grocery store aisles however the company doesn t stop there it also has a direct selling force that offers protein products to the food service industry basically it sells prepared meats that restaurants can easily incorporate into their menus and with planters the company is broadening its reach materially into the convenience space that by the way should be a wonderful outlet for the company s strong product development skills indeed the company has a long history of taking old brands and livening them up however the proof is in the pudding hormel has increased its dividend annually for over five decades it s an elite dividend king and the average annualized dividend growth rate of the past 10 years was an impressive 15 that s an incredible combination for income investors the best part the yield while modest at 2 3 is actually historically high today in other words it looks like hormel is on the sales rack despite its long track record of success 3 electricity is the future the last name up industrial giant eaton corp etn 0 92 is not cheap its 1 8 yield is at the low end of its historical yield range suggesting that value focused investors should probably pass it by for now however it has a unique focus that has served it well and will likely continue to do so for many years in the future power management while there are multiple pieces to that the core focus is on helping customers work with electricity roughly two thirds of its top line comes from electrical products and services split across north america and the rest of the world the remainder of its business comes from the auto sector its legacy business dating back to its founding over 100 years ago and aerospace but again both have a power management focus notably a few years ago eaton started a division focused on electric vehicles what s most interesting about this move is that the company didn t have to buy its way into this emerging business it simply brought together different skills it already had in its arsenal to internally form the new division that s how deep the company s bench is in the electric space and it is increasingly clear that electricity from cars to solar panels is going to be the long term future of power in the world that should give eaton an edge that will be hard for competitors to match and makes it a great option for your investment wish list for the next big market downturn a distance from the pack long term investors need to look for that special quality that separates a company from its peers you could call it a sustainable competitive advantage but sometimes it s more subtle than that for example hormel doesn t make food any better than any other company but it uses innovation iconic brands and a protein focus to excel w p carey applies a common lease structure to a globally diversified portfolio allowing it to pivot in a way that less diversified competitors can t and eaton has material skills in power management putting it in a strong position to fill the needs of the world s shifting energy demands all three should be able to use these unique models to excel for decades to come

president joe biden on friday chose dr robert califf a former food and drug administration commissioner to again lead the powerful regulatory agency califf s nomination comes after months of concern that the agency near the center of the government s covid 19 response has lacked a permanent leader more than a half dozen names were floated for the job before the white house settled on califf a cardiologist and clinical trial specialist califf 70 served as fda commissioner for the last 11 months of president barack obama s second term before that he spent one year as the agency s no 2 official after more than 35 years as a prominent researcher at duke university where he helped design studies for many of the world s biggest drugmakers since leaving government he has worked as a policy adviser to tech giant google in addition to his ongoing academic work at duke as the fda considers many consequential decisions around vaccine approvals and more it is mission critical that we have a steady independent hand to guide the fda biden said in a statement announcing his decision if confirmed by the senate califf would oversee decisions on covid 19 vaccines along with a raft of other knotty issues including the regulation of electronic cigarettes and effectiveness standards for prescription drugs he would be the first fda commissioner since the 1940s to return for a second stint leading the agency file dr robert califf testifies during his nomination hearing before the senate health education labor and pensions committee on nov 17 2015 in washington d c photo by win mcnamee getty images rob is a relatively safe choice because he is known in washington and is widely respected said wayne pines a former fda associate commissioner who has helped several commissioners through the confirmation process he will have broad support from fda stakeholders the fda regulates the vaccines drugs and tests used to combat covid 19 that s on top of its normal duties regulating a swath of consumer goods and medicines including prescription drugs medical devices tobacco products cosmetics and most foods dr janet woodcock the agency s longtime drug director has been serving as acting commissioner since january for months she was expected to be tapped for the permanent post but her nomination ran into pushback from key democratic lawmakers including sen joe manchin of west virginia over the handling of opioid prescription painkillers during her 30 plus years at the agency the white house faced a legal deadline of mid november to nominate a permanent commissioner or name another acting commissioner califf arrived at the fda in 2015 determined to modernize how the agency reviewed drug and device study data but his brief time as commissioner was dominated by unrelated pharmaceutical controversies including surging opioid addiction and overdoses he was among the first fda officials to publicly acknowledge missteps in the agency s oversight of painkillers like oxycontin which is widely blamed for sparking the ongoing opioid epidemic now driven by heroin and fentanyl if addiction to opioids and misuse of opioids is an enemy then we at the fda like every other part of society underestimated the tenacity of the enemy califf told the associated press in a 2016 interview so we ve got to adjust despite those sentiments manchin said in a statement friday that he opposes califf s nomination calling for a change in the culture at the fda dr califf s nomination and his significant ties to the pharmaceutical industry take us backwards not forward said manchin who voted against califf s confirmation in 2016 califf s extensive work with the drug industry drew scrutiny from several democrats when he was last nominated though he was ultimately confirmed by an overwhelming margin given the pressing need for a permanent commissioner he is expected to again win bipartisan confirmation he has the backing of the powerful pharmaceutical and medical device lobbying groups in washington califf has worked as a consultant for several major pharmaceutical companies and sits on the board of two smaller biotech companies federal ethics rules do not require government officials to sell all their investments but they must recuse themselves from matters that could affect those investments as part of the vetting process fda nominees typically disclose and sell stocks funds and other investments that could pose a financial conflict of interest fda watchers said califf had several key advantages over other candidates vetted for the job several of whom would have faced more scrutiny in the senate he knows how the fda works and he avoided making any outrageous decisions as commissioner said diana zuckerman of the nonprofit national center for health research those are essential if the fda is going to regain the public trust related fda recalls 2 2 million at home coronavirus tests due to false positives his first tasks would include easing burnout and boosting morale among the fda s 18 000 employees the agency s medical reviewers have been straining for months under a crushing coronavirus pandemic workload while the agency s reputation for scientific independence has been battered by a public controversies two congressional committees are investigating the agency s june approval of the much debated alzheimer s drug aduhelm against the recommendation of its outside experts three of whom resigned over the decision then in september two top fda vaccine regulators announced they would leave the agency after disagreeing with the biden administration plan to make covid 19 vaccines boosters widely available in recent weeks the fda has authorized extra doses of all three covid 19 vaccines for certain groups though not as broadly as biden originally proposed pfizer has recently applied to expand eligibility for its booster to all adults a request the fda is expected to grant the latest fda troubles followed months of turmoil between the agency and the white house under president donald trump who falsely accused the agency of deliberately slowing its review of covid 19 vaccines to sway the presidential election

fish bones dating back to 400 bc show ancient indigenous canadians practiced sustainable fishing by releasing female salmon back into the water study finds european settlers demolished the practice in the 19th century the tsleil waututh of british columbia used sex selection when fishing to ensure the population of chum salmon remained robust archaeologists conducted genetic tests on fish bones dating from between 400 bc and ad 1200 and found they were overwhelmingly male that suggests they put the females back in the water to spawn the salmon stock would have remained healthy since a single male salmon can mate with at least 10 females the researchers said a canadian tribe understood and practiced sustainable fishing for a thousand years before european settlers demolished their carefully balanced system with their arrival in the 19th century according to a new study the tsleil waututh nation that once thrived in british columbia used sex selection when fishing to ensure the population of chum salmon remained robust enough for coming seasons analyzing fish bones taken from the sites of tsleil waututh villages around the burrard inlet archaeologists found most of the remains were male the researchers said this indicates they released female salmon back into the water if you take a good number of the males out of the system the remaining males can still mate with the females to no detriment to the population lead author jesse morin an archeologist with the university of british columbia told the canadian press one male can mate with 10 females and have just as many baby salmon the next year scroll down for video archaeologists in british columbia ran genetic tests on ancient fish bones some more than 2 000 years old and found tsleil waututh fishermen had been sex selecting for male salmon and tossing the females back the bones dated from between 400 bc and ad 1200 and were from four archeological sites around the burrard inlet people were harvesting the same sort of fish consistently probably from the same places for 1 000 years morin told the press here we are 150 years worth of industrial harvesting and we ve really destroyed these resources the study was recently published in the journal scientific reports the tsleil waututh put large weirs or partial dams in the inlet to direct and then trap salmon preparing to spawn only taking male fish kept the stock replenished since one male can mate with as many as 10 females researcher said pictured members of the tsleil waututh first nation sail with olympic torch before the vancouver winter olympics in 2010 the tsleil waututh fished in the shallows of the burrard inlet above off vancouver island the haul would then be brought ashore and sorted with the females let go i would imagine big traps set up for these weirs as well so the salmon just swim into them morin said big wickerwork traps and then you just roll these traps off to the beach out of the river and then you pull up out the salmon that you want the researchers analyzed fish vertebrae that had been collected during excavations in the early 1970s using a dna test to screen for the y chromosome found only in male fish if the tsleil waututh had just been gathering fish at random the breakdown between male and female would be closer to 50 50 this is the first time the technique called a polymerase chain reaction or pcr test has been used on ancient fish remains co author tom royle a post doctoral candidate in archaeology at simon fraser university told the paper humans came to british columbia at least 14 000 years ago but europeans didn t begin to visit the area until the 1750s by the mid 1800s the hudson bay company had set up trading outposts and the vancouver islands were colonized by the british an example of a weir used by the quamichan of vancouver island a subsequent gold rush brought more even europeans to the region who destroyed the tsleil waututh weirs and began a process of overfishing that coupled with climate change has had a devastating impact today almost all species of pacific salmon are in decline and half of canada s chinook some of which still spawn in burrard inlet are considered endangered according to the guardian that s upset the environmental equilibrium and threatens the killer whales and grizzlies that prey on chinook to help rebuild stocks the press reported some members of the tsleil waututh have refrained from fishing on their traditional territory even though they have treaty rights to do so the tsleil waututh are just one of several coast salish nations in the pacific northwest that developed sophisticated and sustainable fishing methods that were lost with the arrival of western settlers the explorers exposed native coastal communities to disease and forced them from their culture and land in 1863 30 000 natives or 60 percent of the british columbia s indigenous population died from smallpox brought to the area by an unsuspecting miner from san francisco according to macleans the decimation of local tribes in the century following first contact leading to a loss of knowledge skills and techniques last month archaeologists reported that wooden stakes in the shallows off vancouver island that had baffled historians for years are the last evidence of hundreds of ancient fish traps placed there by the k ómoks people between 1 300 and 100 years ago the traps would have provided food security for up to 12 000 k ómoks the traditional inhabitants of the comox valley the sticks had been a mystery to archaeologists and even the modern k omoks community archaeologist nancy greene spent months recording the locations of the exposed stakes which range from thumb sized in the shallows to the size of a tree trunk in deeper water the remnants of more than 150 000 sticks are exposed during low tide in canada s comox estuary pictured off vancouver island she recorded 13 602 exposed stakes made from douglas fir and red cedar but predicted there would have been between 150 000 and 200 000 forming the core of 300 traps in the shallow wetland according to hakai magazine one of the most extensive and sophisticated indigenous fishing operations ever recorded the traps were laid out in two styles a heart shaped one and a chevron shaped trap that were lined with a removable woven wood panel that let water in but didn t let the fish get through archaeologists found that the stakes are what is left of hundreds of ancient fish traps placed there by canada s first nation people between 1 300 and about 100 years ago when the tide rose herring and salmon flowed into the center and when it receded they were stranded ready to be collected by k ómoks fishermen according to greene they only took enough fish to meet their needs for trade and food without depleting the overall stock advertisement if a spawn rate looked weak the tribe would opt not to fish that season according to k ómoks oral record leaving them to reproduce

introduction aconitum is a type of traditional chinese medicine tcm in the ranunculaceae family with a long medicinal history in china aconitums represented by aconiti lateralis radix praeparata aconite radix and aconiti kusnezoffii folium have high medicinal value 1 specifically aconitums cure rheumatism and show anti inflammatory and analgesic properties thus they are highly regarded by physicians and pharmacists of various dynasties 2 modern pharmacological investigations have revealed that aconitum species possess various therapeutic effects such as anti inflammatory analgesic antitumour cardiotonic and vasodilative effects 3 aconitine is an alkaloid representative of those in aconitums that has significant therapeutic effects and toxicity simultaneously specifically it shows various pharmacological effects such as analgesic cardiotonic antitumour and immunosuppressive effects 4 however countless poisoning cases caused by aconitine have been reported in recent years 5 if it is used irrationally and the therapeutic window is exceeded aconitine can cause cardiotoxicity furthermore aconitine can cause vagus nerve stimulation promote the release of acetylcholine reduce the self regulation of the sinoatrial node and cause sinus bradycardia in severe cases it can cause sinus arrest and seriously damage the heart system which greatly limits the clinical application of aconitum species 6 the mechanisms of aconitine induced cardiotoxicity are multifaceted and aconitine can cause different degrees of heart damage by affecting ion channels damaging dna affecting energy metabolism and causing cell apoptosis 7 10 however the direct target of aconitine is still unclear and research on the initial events of toxicity is not thorough enough hence identifying the key targets of aconitine and revealing the underlying mechanism of aconitine induced cardiotoxicity has become a critical issue in the toxicity research and clinical application of aconitine the target protein is an irreplaceable starting point for drugs to exert therapeutic or toxic effects in vivo small compounds reach the target organs and interact with direct target proteins which signifies the molecular initiation event of their efficacy or toxicity the key and difficult point in this study was the discovery of the direct target proteins of small molecules determining the direct targets of active compounds is needed to explain the pharmacological action and toxic effects of herbal medicine however this is a difficulty faced in the current research on chinese medicine 11 at present there are two main strategies for the discovery and identification of drug direct targets viz virtual screening and experimental research virtual screening has the advantages of being intuitive convenient and efficient which can significantly shorten the experimental cycle reduce research costs and improve the success rate of target screening virtual screening based on network pharmacology has high throughput and is easy to operate moreover this method is sensitive and does not need to consider the content of small molecules which could be used for the discovery of most drug targets 12 tcm network pharmacology integrates system biology and other disciplines and it explores the relationship between drugs and complex diseases from a holistic perspective it has the advantages of integrity synergy and dynamics which complement the basic characteristics of tcms 13 furthermore it is important in the screening of potential effective or toxic compounds as well as the research of target proteins 14 with the development and progress of chemical biology experimental research on the direct targets of small molecules currently includes click chemistry cc drug affinity responsive target stability darts cellular thermal shift assay cetsa and so on the cc strategy entails the design of small molecule probes to reflect changes in the functional state of target proteins in cells through this method it is necessary to introduce an alkynyl group to small molecules and then fish the corresponding targets after modification 15 however the cc strategy is not suitable for molecules which are not easily modified or whose activity changes after binding with an alkynyl group the principle of the darts assay is that the protein structure changes in the direction of energy reduction and becomes more stable after binding with small molecules to resist protease digestion the darts technology does not require any chemical modification of compounds and target proteins it is easy to operate and can be used together with proteomic analysis to identify unknown target proteins of most small molecules 16 17 furthermore the binding of small molecules to the targets must be verified after identifying the direct targets some verification methods such as molecular docking surface plasmon resonance atomic force microscopy afm and sirna interference can be used to explore the optimal binding mode of small molecules and targets 18 19 in this study we first predicted the potential toxic targets of aconitine based on network pharmacology and subsequently identified the direct targets using a novel proteomic approach based on darts and lc ms ms the potential direct targets and toxicity mechanisms of aconitine were explored through network integration analysis the binding sites between aconitine and its direct targets were investigated via molecular docking analysis finally the affinity of aconitine to the target protein was verified via an afm assay thereby forming a complete set of direct target exploration and verification systems figure s1 the new strategy predicted several direct targets of aconitine and explained the potential mechanism of aconitine induced cardiotoxicity this study not only provided a theoretical foundation for the safe and effective clinical use of aconitine but also inspired a new perspective for research on the toxicity mechanism of tcms materials and methods materials and reagents aconitine 302 27 2 purity 98 was purchased from chengdu herbpurify co ltd chengdu china foetal bovine serum fbs dulbecco s modified eagle

and peptide molecules discovery studio software 2017 r2 client was used for molecular docking to explore the interaction between aconitine and its direct target proteins finally a bruker dimension icontm atomic force microscope bruker germany was used network pharmacology analysis target prediction of aconitine the 3d structure of aconitine was acquired from the pubchem database target genes of aconitine were obtained by importing the 3d structure of aconitine into the swisstargetprediction and pharmmapper databases the gene official symbol format was acquired using the uniprot database finally the predicted target genes of aconitine were obtained by merging and deleting duplicate items acquisition of target genes related to aconitine induced cardiotoxicity information about cardiotoxicity associated target genes was searched in the ctd ttd drugbank genecards and omim databases after entering the keywords myocardial injury cardiotoxicity and arrhythmia the obtained targets were normalised using the retrieve id mapping of the uniprot database to obtain their official symbols next the potential target genes were identified using the venn online platform in addition the reported target genes were collected from pubmed cnki web of science and other databases after merging and deduplication the potential core target genes were identified construction of protein protein interaction network between core targets the main function of the string database is to provide physical and functional protein protein association data and construct the relationship between targets the protein protein interaction ppi network was constructed by inputting the potential core target genes in the string database then the tsv format of the ppi network was saved and imported into the network analyser module of cytoscape 3 6 1 to construct and analyse the target network relationship the correlation degree among common targets of drug disease was analysed based on the degree of nodes and the key targets in the ppi network were screened via topological analysis and number sequencing finally a ppi network diagram was constructed by defining the node size and degree centrality of colour sort reflection gene ontology and kegg pathway enrichment analysis to investigate the biological function of aconitine on potential target genes related to cardiotoxicity

15 min at 4 c and the supernatant was transferred into clean tubes the protein concentration was measured in accordance with the manufacturer s instructions using a bca protein concentration assay kit solarbio beijing china selection of types and concentrations of protease a key point of the darts technique is the addition of an appropriate protease subtilisin a thermophilic protease and streptomyces protease can be applied to darts technology with streptomyces protease being recommended by the inventor of the darts technology 20 23 the samples were divided into normal and aconitine groups neither aconitine nor enzymes were added to the normal group for the aconitine group three concentration levels 100 μm 200 μm and 400 μm were set which covered the toxicity concentration of the cell viability test fifty microliters of protein solution were added to each group after incubating for 1 h 2 μl of the corresponding proportion of the digestive enzyme mixture pronase 1 100 1 500 1

to terminate the enzyme reaction finally loading buffer was added and mixed using a vortex the protein sample was boiled for 5 min in a 95 c water bath to denature the protein the effect of the protease was verified via sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sds page co incubation of aconitine with proteins the h9c2 protein solution in the aconitine group was supplemented with varying concentrations of aconitine 100 μm 200 μm and 400 μm and allowed to incubate for 1 h at room temperature in addition the negative control group was set and the protein solution was

terminated on ice loading buffer was added to the samples and they were boiled and analysed as mentioned above electrophoresis and identification of differential proteins the total protein sample was separated on a 12 gel via sds page and stained with a coomassie brilliant blue staining solution and then decolourized until the blue background was removed the differential protein bands in the aconitine group were analysed using the odyssey gel imaging system li cor biosciences usa after reduction and alkylation trypsin was used to hydrolyse the differentially expressed proteins finally lc ms ms was used to analyse the samples the qualitative information of the target proteins was obtained using the mascot software integration analysis of potential targets of aconitine in this study we performed a network integration analysis of the targets predicted by network pharmacology and the darts technology the potential targets were imported into the string database the ppi network of the target genes was generated from the string database which helps mine the relationship between targets the direct targets of aconitine were discovered via network analysis as well as literature research molecular docking the 3d structure of aconitine was searched and downloaded from the pubchem database using the pdb database we acquired the three dimensional crystal structures of proteins cpla2 orc5 ctnna1 and gys1 containing ligands with high resolution the proteins and aconitine were prepared using the discovery studio software 2017 r2 client for the molecular docking study before the molecular docking operation it is necessary to verify whether the selected docking procedure and parameters are suitable for the structure of the receptor protein the semi flexible docking mode was selected for the molecular docking analysis afm analysis recombinant human protein cpla2 50 μg was dissolved and diluted with 1 pbs ph 7 2 7 4 to obtain a 400 μmol l solution a pbs solution containing 0 1 dmso was used to prepare the aconitine solution at a concentration of 400 μmol l the protein solution was then mixed with the aconitine solution at a ratio of 1 1 and incubated for 30 min in a water bath at 37 c ten microliters of the resulting mixture and 10 μl of protein solution were dropped onto a glass slide and placed at room temperature to prepare the crystalline sample then the crystals of the protein and protein aconitine complex were scanned via icon afm in tapping mode the morphology distribution aggregation degree and other morphological characteristics of protein crystals on each slide were recorded the crystal images were processed using nanoscope analysis 1 8 statistical analysis all experimental data are presented as mean sd statistical analyses were conducted using the spss software version 13 0 one way analysis of variance followed by tukey s post hoc test was used for two group comparisons and statistical significance was set at p 0 05 results acquisition of common target genes related to aconitine and cardiotoxicity and ppi network analysis by searching the swiss target prediction and pharmmapper databases 526 target genes of aconitine were acquired based on structural similarity and pharmacophore modelling similarly 1241 cardiotoxicity related target genes were collected from the ctd ttd drugbank genecards and omim databases the overlapping targets were obtained using the venn online platform 108 overlapping potential target genes were identified the venn diagram is shown in figure 1a in addition 46 reported target genes table s1 were identified by searching databases a total of 152 core targets were obtained after removing the repetitive targets furthermore a ppi network diagram figure 1b was constructed using the string database to clarify the relationship between core targets meanwhile using the cytoscape 3 6 1 software we screened out the top 14 target genes alb akt1 tnf tp53 casp3 egfr mapk8 mapk1 src cat ptgs2 cycs hsp90aa1 mtor with the highest degree value by analysing the topological parameters and correlation between targets among them ptgs2 also known as cyclooxygenase 2 cox 2 is upregulated when myocardial cells are stimulated by inflammation the upregulation of cox 2 and the synthesis of prostaglandins promote the release of mmps and then regulate collagen metabolism and the degree of fibrosis in myocardial tissue which is related to myocardial diseases 24 go and kegg pathway enrichment analysis to further reveal the related pathways and mechanisms of aconitine induced cardiotoxicity the kegg pathway and go enrichment analysis of 152 core targets were conducted using the metascape database specifically the go functional enrichment analysis showed that aconitine induced cardiotoxicity is mainly involved in circulatory and muscle system processes as well as in the regulation of blood circulation transmembrane transport and ion transport the enrichment results were ranked based on the p value and the integrated go analysis results are shown in figure 1c kegg enrichment analysis showed that 152 targets were mainly concentrated in 181 pathways p 0 05 of which 41 were closely related to cardiotoxicity such as the vegf calcium tnf mapk pi3k akt and mtor signalling pathways as well as gap junction apoptosis and metabolism of arachidonic acid the top 20 pathways are shown in figure 1d meanwhile the network diagram of aconitine targets pathways figure 1e was obtained using the cytoscape 3 6 1 software in which the nodes are represented by different colours and shapes yellow represents aconitine green represents the targets purple represents the signalling pathways and the edges represent the relationships between nodes the network contained 137 nodes including aconitine 95 targets related to cardiotoxicity and 41 pathways which intuitively reveal the characteristics of multiple targets and multiple pathways of aconitine toxicity of aconitine on h9c2 cardiomyocytes aconitine has a definite effect on mitochondrial dehydrogenase 25 therefore the mtt assay was applied to detect the effect of aconitine on cell viability and screen the toxic concentration to lay a foundation for fishing direct targets of aconitine the viability of cells treated with different concentrations of aconitine is shown in figure 2a compared with that in the normal group the cell viability in the aconitine treated group significantly decreased as the concentration increased p 0 01 this indicated that aconitine inhibited the viability of h9c2 cardiomyocytes in a concentration dependent manner the mtt assay revealed that the inhibition rate of aconitine on h9c2 cardiomyocytes was approximately 50 at a concentration of 400 μm hence 400 μm was selected as the experimental concentration for the follow up study figure 2 effects of different concentrations of aconitine on h9c2 cell viability a all data are shown as mean sd n 6 p 0 01 versus the normal group sds page results of protein digested with 1 100 pronase protein ratio after incubation with aconitine b d b d represent three repetitions of the experiments n 3 direct target identification based on darts technology the extraction of protein from cells is a key step in fishing the direct targets of aconitine in the darts technology however the lysates used in the process of protein extraction directly affect the sensitivity and resolution of subsequent experiments 26 in this study protein was extracted from three bottles 75 cm2 of cells by adding 500 μl m per lysate a 5 μg μl protein solution was obtained which met the requirements of the darts experiment in addition the selection of a protease is a key operation in the darts experiment pronase was selected for this experiment and the optimal digestion time was determined to be 30 min the results of the investigation of enzyme concentrations pronase to protein ratios 1 100 1 500 1 1000 and 1 3000 are shown in figure s2 the digestion ability of pronase to protein ratios 1 100 and 1 500 was higher than that of the 1 1000 and 1 3000 ratios the protein bands were clear in the normal group and became clearer when the enzyme concentration decreased thus a 1 100 pronase to protein ratio was used for subsequent experiments in this case the interference bands were smaller which could help detect differential protein bands then darts was performed in accordance with reported protocols 27 after incubation with aconitine for 1 h the protein was digested with 1 100 pronase to protein for 30 min the whole protein bands obtained via sds page and coomassie brilliant blue staining are shown in figure 2b d furthermore the differential protein bands were compared to the negative control group the protein band of the aconitine group was significantly deeper than that of the negative control group at 70 kda indicating that the protein band had a specific affinity with aconitine and thus may be the target protein of aconitine therefore the differential band was accurately cut for further enzymolysis and lc ms ms analysis figure s3 by comparing the protein mass spectrometry data between the normal and negative control groups proteins with molecular masses of approximately 70 kda were screened the peptide sequence was identified from the protein database and 15 proteins of approximately 70 kda were identified table 1 the content of 15 target proteins in the negative control group decreased sharply after the addition of protease aconitine increased the content of the proteins in a dose dependent manner which indicated that it can specifically bind proteins and improve their stability table 1 the information of direct target proteins fished by darts technology integration analysis of direct targets of aconitine in this study 152 core targets predicted by network pharmacology and 15 direct targets from the darts experiment were imported into the string database for protein interaction analysis figure 3 according to literature reviews and enrichment analysis of the kegg function the direct targets cpla2 gys1 ctnna1 and orc5 interact with network pharmacological targets and are related to myocardial injury figure 3 ppi network diagram of 152 core targets from network pharmacology and 15 direct targets from darts glycogen synthase gys is the rate limiting enzyme in glycogen synthesis and it includes glycogen synthase 1 gys1 and 2 gys2 shi et al found that gys1 mediated glycogen accumulation promotes fls mediated synovial inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis by blocking the activation of ampk thus demonstrating that glycogen metabolism is associated with chronic inflammation 28 glycogen is the storage of glucose in many mammalian tissues the ability to synthesise glycogen in cardiac muscles is crucial for the healthy development of the heart impaired cardiac glycogen synthesis could be a significant contributor to congenital heart disease 29 in addition zhang et al found that aconitine can inhibit the energy metabolism of cardiomyocytes by reducing the contents of glycogen succinate dehydrogenase and cytochrome c oxidase in cells 30 recently ctnnb1 gene levels were found to play an important rate limiting role in the regulation of insulin secretion thus researchers have investigated whether the binding partner ctnna1 also plays a role in this process the results showed that ctnna1 mediated actin remodelling may be involved in the regulation of insulin secretion 31 the origin recognition complex orc is encoded by the latheo gene it consists of six isoforms orc1 orc6 and it is involved in dna biosynthesis in the cell cycle pathway orc5 has been associated with hepatocellular carcinoma and colon cancer thus it is a new candidate biomarker for the survival monitoring of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma 32 furthermore cpla2 has a wide range of biological activities such as playing a leading role in arachidonic acid release initiating prostaglandin signalling cascade participating in membrane phospholipid remodelling and regulating inflammation and various related physiological and pathological processes 33 in the failing heart spla2 migrates into the myofibrillar membrane whereas cpla2 accumulates in the cytoplasm 34 molecular docking based on the target proteins that overlapped between ppi and the kegg network topology analysis we tested the docking precision between aconitine and the following potential direct targets cpla2 pdb 1cjy gys1 pdb 3cx4 orc5 pdb 5ui7 and ctnna1 pdb 4ehp method validation must be performed before the molecular docking of aconitine and proteins the root mean square deviation rmsd value was used as the evaluation standard for rmsd 2 0 å the smaller the value the more accurate the docking result the rmsd values of the four direct target proteins cpla2 gys1 orc5 and ctnna1 were 1 1874 å 0 7458 å 1 3682 å and 0 4265 å respectively which are less than 2 0 å thus the method selected in this study is reliable and can be used in follow up virtual screening research molecular docking was carried out using the cdocker module in the discovery studio software cdocker is a semi flexible docking program based on the charmm force field virtual computer screening was performed using this program after docking we checked the docking scores cdocker interaction energy and predicted the affinity and binding mode of drugs and proteins a higher score suggested stronger binding activity of the ligand with the receptor based on the cdocker interaction energy scores table s2 aconitine had a good binding activity with four potential direct proteins cpla2 gys1 ctnna1 and orc5 3d and 2d diagrams present the molecular docking models of aconitine with those direct target proteins figure 4 the receptor ligand interactions primarily included van der waals forces and hydrogen bonds for example aconitine could match with cpla2 by forming a stable hydrogen bond at the his62 and asn64 sites figure 4a meanwhile aconitine produced various degrees of van der waals forces with asn95 ala94 and asn65 amino acid residues in cpla2 and formed hydrocarbon bonds with tyr96 and asn64 the results indicated that aconitine is in a reasonable cavity of cpla2 and it can stably bind to this receptor protein similar to the case of cpla2 the combination of aconitine with gys1 revealed both van der waals forces and hydrogen bond interactions however the hydrogen bonding sites were arg300 his96 and asp331 whereas the sites of the van der waals interactions were his161 asp137 and thr16 figure 4b in addition the benzene ring of aconitine formed pi cation and pi alkyl interactions with his139 and tyr165 residues respectively moreover ctnna1 bound to aconitine mainly by forming hydrogen bonds with ser252 thr251 and glu128 aconitine also interacted with the receptor through van der waals forces produced by leu124 and other amino acid residues figure 4c orc5 combined with aconitine through two stable hydrogen bonds with glu502 and ala542 and various van der waals forces with amino residues such as val535 and pro505 in addition alkyl interactions existed between the ligand and residues ile689 and leu723 figure 4d these data suggest that the four target proteins can be considered direct targets of aconitine induced cardiotoxicity figure 4 molecular docking models of aconitine with 4 direct target proteins in 3d and 2d diagram aconitine with a cpla2 pdb 1cjy b gys1 pdb 3cx4 c ctnna1 pdb 4ehp d orc5 pdb 5ui7 cpla2 as a potential direct target of aconitine to further screen the direct targets of aconitine induced cardiotoxicity literature investigations were carried out from the perspective of biological pathways the direct target cpla2 was found to be the upstream signal protein of key target ptgs2 predicted by network pharmacology it is also an important starting material and key metabolic enzyme of arachidonic acid metabolism the molecular docking results showed that aconitine has a strong binding ability to the active cavity of cpla2 the metabolism of arachidonic acid by cyclooxygenase cox 1 and cox 2 is a key step in the synthesis of prostaglandins such as pgi2 pgd2 and pge2 which are also the most reported metabolic pathways of arachidonic acid arachidonic acid and its metabolite mediated inflammation are associated with the occurrence and development of myocardial injury and they can be enriched in the kegg pathway of network pharmacology furthermore cpla2 and spla2 isozymes were detected in the cytoplasm of normal cardiomyocytes by mchowat et al in the failing heart spla2 migrated into the myofibrillar membrane whereas cpla2 accumulated in the cytoplasm 34 ptgs2 gene encodes cox 2 whose expression increases when cells are stimulated by inflammation this is a decisive factor of inflammation mediated cytotoxicity 35 bolli et al found that cox 2 and its metabolites increased following 24 h ischemia in a rabbit ischemia reperfusion injury model 36 saito et al found that strong immune activity of cox 2 can be detected in myocardial cells after acute myocardial infarction the addition of a cox 2 inhibitor can significantly reduce the infarct size and improve myocardial contractility these results showed that the expression of cox 2 promotes myocardial injury and dysfunction 37 cox 2 is an important rate limiting enzyme that catalyses the conversion of arachidonic acid to pge2 pge2 is an effective mediator of inflammation and it is widely involved in ischemia induced neuronal damage inflammatory response and neurodegenerative diseases 38 aconitine has a two way regulatory effect on anti immunosuppression at low dosages it promotes the expression of peg2 via the peg2 cox 2 signalling pathway 39 based on comprehensive analysis we speculate that aconitine induces cardiotoxicity by activating the direct target cpla2 mediating the release of arachidonic acid and promoting the release of inflammatory factors via the pge2 cox 2 pathway therefore cpla2 may be a potential direct target of aconitine induced cardiotoxicity the potential mechanism of aconitine toxicity is shown in figure 5 figure 5 potential toxicity mechanism of aconitine by acting on direct target cpla2 afm analysis afm technology is used to verify the binding of bioactive small molecules to proteins from the perspective of imaging which offers intuitive image results of intermolecular interactions in the afm assay the aggregation of proteins can prove that bioactive molecules bind to proteins bioactive molecules can affect the activity and function of proteins by changing their structure and state the 2d configuration analysis in the afm assay showed that the cpla2 protein adsorbed on the quartz surface was a chain like structure and was relatively dispersed before binding with aconitine figure 6a the cpla2 protein was aggregated and expanded violently after binding with aconitine under the same scanning conditions and there were cpla2 protein clumps on the quartz surface meanwhile the length of the chain structure formed between cpla2 proteins was shortened figure 6b as shown in the 3d image the surface of the cpla2 protein is large rough loose and dispersed whereas cpla2 became compact smooth and aggregated after binding with aconitine when aconitine was bound to the protein the degree of protein aggregation and height changed significantly the latter reached approximately 1 1 times the initial height afm imaging confirmed that aconitine could bind to cpla2 protein well indicating that cpla2 might be a potential direct target of aconitine the combination of aconitine and cpla2 may affect the function of proteins leading to toxic effects figure 6 afm analysis afm images 2d and 3d of a cpla2 and b aconitine acting on the protein discussion members of the aconitum species such as aconiti lateralis radix praeparata aconite radix and aconiti kusnezoffii folium are widely used in the clinic aconitine a major bioactive alkaloid of aconitum roots has analgesic anti inflammatory and antitumour effects 4 aconitine is also the main toxic component of aconitum plants potentially causing varying degrees of cardiac injury by affecting energy metabolism causing apoptosis affecting ion channels and via other mechanisms however the direct target proteins of aconitine induced cardiotoxicity remain unclear target proteins are the key active components of tcms that exert curative effects in vivo the clarification of direct targets ie molecular initiation events is the key to explaining the mechanism of drug efficacy or toxicity hence the present study aimed to develop a new strategy for the identification and validation of potential direct targets of aconitine induced cardiotoxicity network pharmacology and the darts technology were used to explore the potential targets of aconitine induced cardiotoxicity the obtained targets were screened via network integration analysis using the string database molecular docking was used to explain the possible binding sites between aconitine and related direct target proteins further literature investigation and afm imaging confirmed that cpla2 is a potential direct target of aconitine induced cardiotoxicity in this study the potential targets of aconitine induced cardiotoxicity were predicted via network pharmacology 152 common targets involving 41 closely related pathways were identified the results of the degree value of targets and pathway analysis showed that aconitine may exert toxic effects through the pi3k akt mtor and mapk signalling pathways and the metabolism of arachidonic acid furthermore aconitine can promote the release of inflammatory factors and further accelerate the inflammatory reaction ultimately leading to myocardial injury the pi3k akt mtor signalling pathway is required for the prosurvival signalling cascade which participates in and regulates the apoptosis of cardiomyocytes 40 transforming growth factor β1 tgf β1 regulates the growth development and apoptosis of cardiomyocytes 41 fuzi extracts can upregulate the expression of pi3k p akt mtor and tgf β and induce inflammation and apoptosis in cardiomyocytes this indicates that fuzi extracts exert cardiotoxic effects by activating the pi3k akt mtor and tnf β signalling pathways and thus inducing cardiomyocyte apoptosis 42 furthermore reducing the expression of pi3k akt and mtor can ameliorate myocardial hypertrophy and fibrosis thereby reducing cardiomyocyte apoptosis 43 tumour necrosis factor α tnf α is an inflammatory cytokine produced in acute inflammation which is related to the intracellular signal transduction pathway and can cause cell necrosis or apoptosis 44 peng et al investigated the effects of aconitine on inflammation apoptosis and viability of h9c2 cardiomyocytes and they found that aconitine upregulates the expression of fadd cleaved caspase 3 and inflammatory factors tnf α caspase 1 and il 1 β and it activates the cytochrome c and nlrp3 inflammasome the results suggested that aconitine induced cardiomyocyte injury by attenuating bnip3 dependent mitophagy and the tnf α nlrp3 signalling axis 45 in the inflammatory pathway the metabolism of arachidonic acid is related to the occurrence and development of myocardial injury its metabolism in myocardial tissue is regulated by phospholipases such as cpla2 and spla2 46 47 ptgs2 also known as cyclooxygenase has a high degree value in the analysis of key targets its expression increases when cells are stimulated by inflammation the upregulation of cox 2 and synthesis of prostaglandins promote the release of mmps and further regulate collagen metabolism and the degree of fibrosis in myocardial tissue 24 target proteins are the origin and biological basis of drug efficacy and toxicity aconitine reaches the target organs and acts on direct targets which is the key molecular initiation event of its toxic effect new strategies have been applied to identify the target proteins of natural products without any chemical modification such as darts cetsa stability of proteins from rates of oxidation sprox and thermal proteome profiling tpp cetsa can be used to study the effects of small molecules on the thermal stability of proteins in whole cell lysates cells and tissues however the heating treatment may affect the permeability of the cell membrane resulting in false positives and subsequently affect the screening of target proteins the limitation of sprox technology is that it can only detect the binding of proteins that contain methionine to small molecules in addition not all methionine residues show different oxidation rates thus the interaction between proteins and ligands cannot be fully confirmed tpp is an advanced cetsa method which can be used to identify proteins that exhibit ligand induced thermal stability at higher temperatures however some proteins are broken down at low temperatures or dissolved at high temperatures which cannot be reproduced by comparison the darts technology is simple to operate and does not require washing or setting a temperature gradient it can compensate for the shortcomings of sprox cetsa and tpp and can be successfully applied to target screening with low affinity thus it has become the most popular method for identifying direct targets 48 hence based on the toxic concentration of aconitine induced cardiomyocyte damage a novel proteomic approach based on darts combined with lc ms ms was utilised to fish the direct target proteins of aconitine from myocardial cells and the mechanism of toxicity was explored the proteins directly interacting with aconitine were enriched from the total proteins of h9c2 cardiomyocytes via a molecular target fishing technique and 15 potential direct targets were identified using lc ms ms the 15 direct targets and targets predicted via network pharmacology were integrated and analysed using the string database through network topology analysis of ppi and kegg four direct target proteins cpla2 gys1 ctnna1 and orc5 were screened as interactive the molecular docking results showed that aconitine was bound to the active cavity of proteins via van der waals forces or hydrogen bonds and cpla2 was identified as a direct target of aconitine based on literature investigation and biological pathway analysis moreover cpla2 is the upstream signal protein of ptgs2 and aconitine is speculated to act directly on the target protein cpla2 which mediates the release of arachidonic acid promotes the expression of ptgs2 cox 2 and further accelerates the release of inflammatory factors ultimately leading to myocardial injury and dysfunction meanwhile the immune activity of cox is strengthened and cox 2 and its metabolites increase when myocardial ischemia or infarction occurs 36 37 moreover aconitine can promote the expression of pge2 via the pge2 cox 2 signalling pathway thereby promoting the release of inflammatory factors and causing myocardial injury 39 afm imaging verified that aconitine can bind to cpla2 well thus we further confirmed that cpla2 is a direct target of aconitine induced cardiotoxicity however the mechanism of aconitine induced cardiotoxicity through the direct targets of gys1 ctnna1 and orc5 remains unclear and will become the focus of our later studies we also will verify the mechanism of aconitine induced cardiotoxicity in vivo in the succeeding study the present study not only contributes to understanding the process of aconitine acting on direct targets but also has great scientific significance in clarifying the mechanism of aconitine induced cardiotoxicity and revealing its toxic nature conclusion in this study we established a new strategy for the rapid identification of the direct targets of aconitine based on the darts technology and network integration analysis moreover molecular docking literature investigation and afm imaging were used to screen and verify the key direct targets four potential direct targets cpla2 gys1 ctnna1 and orc5 were discovered by integrating and analysing the results of the darts technology and network pharmacology using the string database the results of molecular docking showed that aconitine could bind to the four proteins well further studies have shown that cpla2 is directly related to aconitine induced cardiotoxicity finally afm imaging was used to verify the binding effect of cpla2 and aconitine which proved that cpla2 was the key direct target of aconitine by exploring the initial event of aconitine toxicity we comprehensively explained the toxicity mechanism the established research strategy laid a foundation for the target fishing of other toxic drugs

at multiple industry and investor conferences nationally including the snn network summer virtual event the h c wainwright 23rd annual global investment conference the ld micro main event the calact 2021 autumn conference expo and the apta transform conference expo management commentary the third quarter of 2021 was instrumental in our foundation building for 2022 having secured exciting new lines of business namely ev chassis sales alongside eavx and low floor electric shuttle bus sales through our new partner optimal ev said william trainer founder and chief executive officer of vicinity motor corp while revenues from our transit bus business are at times irregular and see some periods of lower deliveries as illustrated this quarter per the financial guidance we ve released we are on a trajectory to realize over 140 million in revenue next year marking what will be a record breaking year for vicinity by any measure our entry into the high demand electric truck and electric shuttle bus market is expected to fill in the gaps for periods of lower transit bus deliveries in the future we made significant moves towards fortifying our balance sheet in recent months as well to support some of these exciting new growth initiatives supplementing our 20 million line of credit with a 10 3 million debt financing and the proceeds from a us 17 million underwritten public offering our near term sales momentum is beginning to accelerate and given the inherent delay between a customer placing a purchase order today and the revenue realized from vehicle deliveries months later i firmly believe that we are lining ourselves up for a strong 2022 this creates the potential to notably exceed our financial guidance helping to generate sustainable long term value for our

ended september 30 2020 the decreased revenue was primarily driven by the delivery of six buses in the quarter as compared to 20 buses in the third quarter of 2020 reflecting low order intake during the first nine months of the pandemic and delivery delays related to shipping delays and the global supply chain challenges for certain parts currently experienced in the industry revenue grew 128 to

revenue for the nine months ended september 30 2020 the margins for the three months ended september 30 2021 were negatively affected by sales of higher than average cost buses in inventory and the sales of fewer buses compared to the prior year period the gross profit in the nine months ended september 30 2021 was positively affected by sales mix with 2021 deliveries generally having higher margins than those realized in 2020 net loss for the third quarter of 2021 was 4 8 million or 0 16 per share as compared to a net loss of 1 3 million or 0 05 per share in the same year ago quarter net

picking baskets of related stocks rather than individual names can be a much easier less stressful and more fruitful endeavor whether you re a veteran investor or have been in the market for only a few days you know at least one thing for sure picking stocks is tough it certainly looks much easier from the outside looking in than it actually is once you re in the game odds are good you ve made some costly decisions if so welcome to the club if you d like to try something else with a little less risk and a little less stress exchange traded funds or etfs are a great alternative to individual stocks while you still get all the prospective upside that only the stock market offers these theme based baskets of stocks typically don t create the short term trading temptations that tend to cause problems for antsy investors here are three exchange traded funds that will not only help mellow out your portfolio s volatility but perhaps set the stage for even better performance 1 vanguard dividend appreciation etf most investors don t start thinking much about investment income until later in their lives and even then many of them never completely give up on growth but limiting yourself to growth names comes at a pricey risk not only can the big swings of growth stocks tend to panic you into making a bad decision they typically don t generate fresh cash that can then be used to buy other stocks at opportune times the vanguard dividend appreciation etf vig 0 15 fixes that problem even if it makes up only a small portion of your portfolio just as the name suggests the vanguard dividend appreciation etf holds stocks with a strong track record of not just paying a reliable dividend but growing it the fund is designed to reflect the s p u s dividend growers index which is a collection of u s stocks that have increased their annual payouts for at least the past 10 years the curious nuance is the index excludes the highest yielding 25 of stocks that would otherwise be eligible for inclusion as a means of weeding out the stocks that the market is suggesting are too risky to price more conventionally still the etf s dividend yield is a healthy 1 5 and of course it grows every year do note that your broker s default option is to reinvest this fund s dividend payment into more shares of the etf itself but you don t have to you can collect these payments in cash and save it up to step into a new investment without being forced to sell a different holding 2 invesco wilderhill clean energy etf just because you re investing in exchange traded funds doesn t mean you have to think and act less aggressively than those who pick individual stocks do you can still plug into the megatrends that are shaping our world and generating profits while they do take the invesco wilderhill clean energy etf pbw 0 32 as an example the exchange traded fund is solely focused on companies that contribute to the clean energy cause fuelcell energy sunpower and tesla are among this etf s biggest holdings although it s worth noting that none of these etf s positions account for more than about 2 of the fund s total value it truly is a well diversified pool of stocks and that s as it should be green and renewable energy technologies are relatively new and relatively complicated keeping close tabs on even just a few of the industry s names isn t easy and has been the source of many investor headaches by holding on to a fund like the invesco wilderhill clean energy etf you re investing in the entire movement without risking ownership of only one or two of its companies and what a movement it is the u s energy information administration estimates that renewable energy will be the source of most of the world s power production capacity growth between now and 2050 renewables account for about 15 of global electricity production now but they will be the backbone of 27 of global power production by 2050 3 vanguard real estate etf finally add the vanguard real estate etf vnq 0 34 to your watchlist if you d like to get off the stock picking train but still want solid returns on your money contrary to a common belief real estate isn t a slow and stodgy investment option even when done via an exchange traded fund it s just not tethered closely to the stock market and therefore it ebbs and flows at different times this doesn t mean owning real estate will perfectly hedge you from stock market setbacks it will buffer this volatility though helping you not to panic and subsequently make a bad decision with your portfolio a quality real estate exchange traded fund like the vanguard real estate etf also removes you from the tricky process of identifying the right real estate investment trust or reit to buy this one owns a bunch of different kinds of real estate investment trusts office buildings hotels residential stuff and more warehouse and logistics name prologis mall owner simon property group and even cellphone tower operator american tower are constituents of this fund solving your diversification challenge with ease holding all of these reits in one basket removes the temptation of trying to time entry and exit with individual reits and effectively forces you to own them with the long term mindset you should have when buying real estate anyway the kicker this etf s current dividend yield of 2 2 is well above the s p 500 s current yield of 1 3 if the vanguard dividend appreciation etf s discussion has visions of dividends dancing in your head don t misread the message though there s capital price appreciation to be had with real estate investments as well
ann arbor mi accesswire november 12 2021 zomedica corp nyse american zom zomedica or company a veterinary health company creating point of care diagnostics products for dogs and cats today reported consolidated financial results for the three and nine months ended september 30 2021 amounts unless specified otherwise are expressed in u s dollars and presented under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america u s gaap third quarter results do not include operations of pulsevet which were acquired on october 1 2021 larry heaton chief executive officer of zomedica stated that during the third quarter the team at zomedica continued building the installed base of truforma instruments through our customer appreciation program cap which provides select customers with an instrument at no charge as long as they agree to purchase assay cartridges customer response to this program has been encouraging with 144 customers enrolled to date and we plan to continue offering it through the end of the year we expect revenue from these cap program customers to build sequentially as they utilize cartridges currently available and new ones as they are released to market we continue to work with our partner qorvo biotechnologies to develop new assays for the truforma instrument and expect to release several new assays to market in 2022 mr heaton continued business development was an important focus of the zomedica team during the third quarter which led to the culmination of zomedica s first acquisition on october 1 2021 when pulse veterinary technologies pulsevet became a zomedica company we re excited about the opportunities to combine the sales and marketing efforts of the respective companies to broaden the introduction of pulsevet s market leading shock wave therapy to the small animal market and the potential future opportunity to introduce truforma technology into the equine market the third quarter reflected zomedica s dual approach to realizing growth building the installed base of truforma technology to produce organic growth and active business development efforts through strategic investments to expand our product offerings technologies and product development efforts during the balance of the year we re continuing this strategy as we expand the sales and marketing teams and provide the training needed to effectively sell into the animal health marketplace summary third quarter 2021 results zomedica recorded net loss and comprehensive loss for the three and nine months ended september 30 2021 of approximately 6 3 million or 0 01 per share and approximately 15 1 million or 0 05 per share respectively compared to a net loss and comprehensive loss of approximately 5 0 million or 0 01 per share and approximately 12 7 million or 0 04 per share for the three and nine months ended september 30 2020 revenue for the three and nine months ended september 30 2021 was 22 514 and 52 331 respectively and resulted from the sale of our truforma products and associated warranties we commenced commercialization of truforma on march 15 2021 and accordingly have had only limited sales activity in the first three quarters of 2021 cost of revenue for the three and nine months ended september 30 2021 was 17 899 and 59 433 respectively as noted above commercialization of truforma commenced on march 15 2021 we expect that cost of revenue will increase as we sell additional products in subsequent periods inclusive of costs associated with pulsevet s operations research and development expense for the three and nine months ended september 30 2021 was approximately 0 3 million and approximately 1 0 million respectively compared to approximately 2 7 million and 7 2 million for the three and nine months ended september 30 2020 respectively representing a decrease of approximately 2 4 million or 89 over the prior three month period and a decrease of approximately 6 2 million or 86 for the prior nine month period the decrease in both periods was a result of an overall reduction in research and development costs related to truforma as we completed development of the instrument and three of the first five assays and began transitioning to commercialization activities selling general and administrative expense for the three months ended september 30 2021 was approximately 6 1 million compared to approximately 2 3 million for the three months ended september 30 2020 an increase of approximately 3 8 million or 166 the increase primarily was due to an increase in share based compensation expense which was approximately 1 5 million for the three months ended september 30 2021 compared to approximately 0 2 million for the comparable period in 2020 other significant increases include professional fees of approximately 2 1 million relating to the pulsevet acquisition and increased fees associated with sec compliance requirements and salaries for administrative and sales personnel of approximately 0 4 million selling general and administrative expense for the nine months ended september 30 2021 was approximately 14 6 million compared to approximately 5 4 million for the nine months ended september 30 2020 an increase of approximately 9 2 million or 169 the increase primarily was due to an increase in share based compensation expense which was approximately 4 5 million for the nine months ended september 30 2021 compared to approximately 0 5 million for the comparable period in 2020 as a result of stock option grants made during the first quarter of 2021 other significant increases include professional fees of approximately 2 9 million related primarily to the pulsevet acquisition and the exchange of our series 1 preferred stock as well as increased fees associated with filings compliance requirements salaries of approximately 1 1 million regulatory fees incurred for the annual shareholders meeting of approximately 0 8 million largely as a result of administrative costs related to increases in the shareholder base marketing travel and office expense of approximately 0 3 million and contracted expenditures of approximately 0 1 million liquidity and outstanding share capital zomedica had cash and cash equivalents of approximately 271 4 million as of september 30 2021 compared to approximately 52 as of september 30 2020 the increase in cash is mainly a result of the cash flows from financing activities partially offset by cash flows used in operating and investing activities as discussed below after giving effect to the acquisition of

decrease of approximately 4 2 million or 40 the reduction in net cash used in operating activities resulted primarily from a 4 5 million non cash stock compensation expense in the 2021 period approximately 0 5 million in gains recognized on extinguishment of debt a loss on disposal of property of 0 2 million and an increase in accounts payable in the 2021 period of approximately 3 2

approximately 0 3 million net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended september 30 2021 was approximately 0 3 million compared to net cash provided of approximately 1 0 million for the nine months ended september 30 2020 an increase in net cash used of approximately 1 3 million or 134 the increase in net cash used in investing activities resulted from the receipt of cash from the modification of our lease in the first half of 2020 compared to investments of intangible and other property and equipment in the current period net cash from financing activities for the nine months ended september 30 2021 was approximately 219 1 million compared to approximately 64 1 million for the nine months ended september 30 2020 an increase of approximately 155 1 million or 242 the

moores sdmoores october 14 2021 more lithium means supply chain security historically it hasn t been easy to get mining permits in chile with complex processes pushing explorers to turn to argentina instead but political instability aside fundamental research corp vice president and head of research sid rajeev said it s a very positive development for the sector and makes the country an appealing jurisdiction for explorers and developers which is good news for the ev supply chain lithium is a key component of ev batteries and it is very important for battery and ev manufacturers to be able to access long term stable supply of lithium he said more lithium supply will provide security to the supply chain chile holds more than 50 of global reserves and has the potential to be a major long term supplier of lithium going forward its government sees this potential and chile holds lithium brines which have typically lower exploration costs than hard rock which is another benefit for explorers we are going to see more explorers moving to chile rajeev said expect to see more m a plays fundamental forecasts that ev sales will increase to 25 30 million per year by 2030 up from 3

salem ore nov 12 2021 prnewswire willamette valley vineyards inc nasdaq wvvi the company a leading oregon producer of pinot noir generated income applicable to common shareholders for the three months ended september 30 2021 and 2020 of 95 120 and 640 347 respectively a decrease of 545 227 or 85 1 in the third quarter of 2021 over the same quarter in the prior year sales revenue for the three months ended september 30 2021 and 2020 were 7 641 228 and 6 918 131 respectively an increase of 723 097 or 10 5 in the current year period over the prior year period this increase was caused by an increase in direct sales of 699 172 and an increase in direct sales through distributors of 23 925 in the current year three month period over the prior year period the increase in direct sales to consumers was primarily the result of increased revenue from tasting room sales phone sales and wine club sales gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the three months ended september 30 2021 and 2020 was 58 4 and 61 0 respectively a decrease of 2 6 percentage points in the current year period over the prior year period mostly as a result of higher cost vintages produced in 2020 that were sold in 2021 selling general and administrative expense for the three months ended september 30 2021 and 2020 was 3 768 765 and 2 917 363 respectively an increase of 851 402 or 29 2 in the current quarter over the same quarter in the prior year this increase was primarily a result of our tasting rooms being open for more days in 2021 compared to 2020 resulting in higher labor and related costs associated with operating the tasting rooms net income for the three months ended september 30 2021 and 2020 was 456 191 and 896 799 respectively a decrease of 440 608 or 49 1 in the third quarter of 2021 over the same quarter in the prior year jim bernau founder and ceo of the company said an unusual combination of circumstances negatively impacted the company s financial results this past quarter including the 2020 vintages sold in 2021 having a relatively higher cost of goods sold as well as the incurrence of scale up expenses including compensation costs in advance of the openings of our new winery near dundee and three new tasting room restaurants in lake oswego the vancouver waterfront and happy valley i believe these circumstances will continue to impact the company at least in the near term other factors which could negatively impact the company s financial results going forward include our inability to supply key high demand products as retailers orders have been outstripping available supply prior to the release of our next vintage as well as distributor trucking shortages and substantial increases in supply costs such as bottles which could increase our operating costs until such time as the national supply chain issues are resolved construction of the additional 50 000 cases of fermentation capacity at our turner location was completed on schedule

global consensus needed to develop climate risk disclosures for companies credit cc0 public domain as the united nations climate change conference in glasgow ends today the united states and other g7 countries need to continue to consider adoption of a global framework for mandatory climate risk disclosure by companies but making disclosures mandatory globally is challenging when there are two different corporate governance systems practiced in the world s economies said paul griffin professor in the graduate school of management at the university of california davis and lead author of an article published today in nature energy most fundamentally the borderless nature of carbon emissions and financial capital requires that any mandatory climate risk discourse framework will also have to be global to be effective griffin said in the article the article challenges for a climate risk disclosure mandate is co authored by amy myers jaffe of the climate policy lab tufts university two basic systems u s shareholders for example have strong shareholder rights with a high level of disclosure required by firms other economies such as in asia and the european union traditionally operate in a blockholder system whereby blockholders exert governance through direct intervention in a firm s operations no single corporate governance model exists that has wide scale acceptance griffin said meanwhile extreme weather events throughout the world this past summer have created a new sense of urgency to achieve a net zero global economy researchers suggest in the article asset managers and large asset owners have made efforts to force energy firms to align with global climate goals investors are demanding climate friendly environmental social and governance stocks president biden has issued an executive order calling for mandatory climate risk disclosures by firms and congress has passed legislation calling for the same regulators should work at a global level griffin said to fashion a hybrid model that addresses climate risk and climate risk disclosure in a manner that strengthens shareholder rights to press for climate disclosure but aligns with the longer term perspective of a blockholder system rapid convergence of governance systems into a hybrid global model is essential given the pressing need for a timely transition to net zero business principles and to hold global temperatures to a 1 5 degree c rise compared with pre industrial levels he said

for years rep louise slaughter d n y toiled away in virtual obscurity on the stop trading on congressional knowledge act six years says slaughter a lot of hard work the stock act would among other things explicitly ban insider trading for members of congress and their staffs they re supposed to be busy fixing the country not trading stocks says rich smith who has been looking into the issue for the motley fool an investment adviser especially at the time when they ve got the information in theory they know what s going on and the rest of us don t the bill is being debated in the senate and has strong bipartisan support which is a rare event in this deeply divided congress but for years arguments like smith s didn t even move the needle on capitol hill i was the guy said i can t believe this isn t already law says rep tim walz d minn who has been working on the stock act with slaughter more than 270 house co sponsors but then in mid november cbs s 60 minutes ran an explosive story about congressional insider trading and other conflicts of interest almost immediately the stock act got very popular today slaughter and walz have more than 270 co sponsors in the house from both parties more than enough to pass it it isn t a partisan or ideological issue says republican scott brown of massachusetts one of the stock act authors on the senate side where it now has similarly strong support it s about cleaning up washington there s actually a pretty lively debate about whether members of congress are truly exempt from insider trading laws many members of congress including democratic sen carl levin of michigan argue it s already illegal but he said on the senate floor earlier this week that this bill will eliminate any doubt it s important to remove that doubt because any appearance of a breach in trust between congress and our constituents is so corrosive to honest open and effective government said levin with an argument like that who could say no it appears ultimately very few members of congress will but that doesn t mean the stock act is on a glide path to passage because this is congress we re talking about here hitting a few bumps senators have now offered 20 amendments and counting some of them have nothing to do with congressional stock trades or anything even remotely close it s not clear when the senate will get to the point of voting on the bill itself and in the house majority leader eric cantor r va says he doesn t intend to hold a vote until the bill gets even tougher if the senate produces a bill that we believe is strengthened and something that is workable that certainly will be something well received by the house said cantor at a press conference if it does not it is my intention to move a bill to bring a bill to the floor in february that does cantor would like other transactions like land deals included and would like to require members to publicly disclose their trades more quickly this idea that you know we have to have a pinch here and a twist there is really i think just stalling says slaughter she and walz are circulating what s called a discharge petition to try to force a floor vote on their bill i think when 271 members of this house have spoken we want to pass this bill i don t know why the leadership should stand in the way of that slaughter says even with this apparent drama walz is quite certain one way or another president obama will sign the long suffering stock act it s only a matter of time i think at this point in time when people try and run all the calculus on this they come to the conclusion that it really is do this it s what the public wants says walz it s the right thing to do and the lucky thing is it s good politics too some outside observers and even members of congress argue this bill may be more symbol than substance but right now the idea of getting something done and maybe restoring a little faith in congress along the way is mighty appealing to members on both sides of the aisle copyright 2021 npr to see more visit

themarket annual inflation hits 30 year highs the stock and bond markets knew inflation was coming this week s 6 2 percent jump in the consumer price index drove home the fact that inflation has become a fact of economic life at least for the near future the jury is still out on whether inflation will prove to be transitory as the federal reserve bank argues and as some economists believe others fear that we could be on the verge of something a little more serious the fear is that the fed might be forced to raise interest rates if that were the case the producer price index ppi and the consumer price index cpi both came in a little warmer than forecasted on a year over year basis but not as high as some expected and yet the u s dollar spiked to new highs the yield on the u s treasury rose by more than 10 basis points gold and silver jumped and stocks dropped the culprit behind the ongoing pressure on the inflation rate as readers know is the heightened consumer demand caused by the reopening of the economy and the supply chain issues that do not seem to be easing the pandemic can be blamed for both conditions for me the markets were so over extended and in need of a pullback that traders were just looking for a reason to take down the averages as you may recall i had been expecting a minor bout of profit taking no more than 3 percent or so in the markets this week the s p 500 index lost almost 2 percent while some other indexes like the small cap russell 2000 index and some technology areas were down more than 3 percent before rebounding between the good news on the passage of the 1 trillion infrastructure bi partisan spending program which now awaits signing by president biden and the climbing rate of inflation the market winners have been mostly in sectors that benefit from construction and inflation mines and metals gold and silver basic materials lithium uranium and rare earth plays have climbed during the past few days these sectors have played a back seat to large cap technology stocks over the last two months we have seen this kind of rotation many times in the past once prices have been bid up to unreasonable levels short term traders will switch their focus back to technology or reopening plays what is important to understand is that the overall markets tend to rise or at worse move sideways as some sectors that are out of favor are simply replaced by those in favor consolidation is healthy for the markets a period of digesting gains possibly over the next few days would do wonders for reducing the overbought conditions that presently plague many stocks and sectors investors should keep their eyes on the u s dollar which appears to want to climb even higher if it does it could squash the present rise in commodities gold is another asset i am tracking closely it has been one of the world s worst performing assets in 2021 if inflation fears continue to worry investors there is a possibility that gold may reemerge in its traditional role as an inflation hedge last but not least is the cannabis space a bill introduced by nancy mace a republican house member from south carolina to decriminalize and regulate what is now a federally illegal substance sent pot stocks higher this could be a huge boost for the u s cannabis industry stock prices in this industry has languished all year despite improving profitability in many cases

the ongoing shortage of the latest and best graphics cards like the rtx 3080 and rtx 3090 and ps5 consoles has pretty much been the number one tech story of 2021 but as we head into 2022 we might be able to add another new product to the mix the latest amd cpus even as the best processors all got updates in 2020 and 2021 from intel alder lake to amd s zen 3 they ve largely been spared the kind of scarcity problems we ve seen with other new tech products desktop pc building is too niche for scalpers to buy up processors in bulk to engage in dastardly profiteering as with the ps5 and graphics cards and consumer cpus are too generalized for the kind of specific heavy duty number crunching required for major cryptocurrency algorithms used by bitcoin and ethereum in the case of cryptomining scalping and mining feed into each other as ethereum miners drive up demand for graphics cards that profiteers take advantage of miners also have an additional financial incentive to pay a higher price if they can still make a profit mining the speculative digital commodity bitcoin meanwhile is mined on specialized asic machines that cost thousands of dollars pounds so these are not really products the general public are even going to know about much less purchase enter raptoreum a so called altcoin that seeks to lower the bar to entry for mining by leveraging the ghostrider algorithm to produce the digital coins this algorithm according to bitcoin press can be done efficiently on a consumer cpu with a sufficiently large l3 cache in theory this should allow everyone to become a cryptominer by lowering the barrier to entry to a simple cpu the processors with the largest l3 cache sizes are amd epyc and threadripper processors but since those are server and workstation cpus respectively they are very expensive get daily insight inspiration and deals in your inbox get the hottest deals available in your inbox plus news reviews opinion analysis and more from the techradar team contact me with news and offers from other future brands receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors enter the ryzen 9 3900x and ryzen 9 5900x with 64mb l3 cache and relatively low cost these chips can mine raptoreum for profit predictably this means that demand for the chips is already starting to climb which is driving up the price for the processors will raptoreum lead to amd cpu shortages on the scale as we ve seen with nvidia graphics cards that s highly unlikely since it doesn t have the kind of enthusiast drive behind it the way ethereum does and isn t likely to catch a pop culture wave like dogecoin has what it portends though isn t good if you would like to do something with technology other than mining a speculative digital commodity image credit yevhen vitte shutterstock opinion please stop yeoman cryptomining is never going to be a thing the purpose behind raptoreum sounds like a great idea but it s also one as old as civilization itself take an asset like land and enable the people to buy into it at the lowest barrier to entry possible to combat the rapid consolidation of that asset into the hands of an elite who alone have the resources to make that asset productive the ancient romans tried it so did thomas jefferson and the early americans with jefferson waxing poetic about the united states becoming a nation of yeoman farmers with their own productive plot of land and each man and he definitely meant just the men the lord of his own little fiefdom the problem is that all that land was itself taken from the indigenous people already living on it costs are kept low by externalizing all of it onto someone else or that in a market based economic system assets inevitably accumulate at the top because of the profit motive baked into the system just as roman patricians bought out all the cheap plots of land to build gargantuan estates large commercial cryptomining operators are just going to buy up all the currently cheap processors and leave the people out in the cold as they always have and always will turning a cpu into a cryptomining asset doesn t get more people to mine cryptocurrency to speed up adoption it just means that cpus are now going to become another thing that the rest of us are going to have to go without as entities with far more resources and a profit motive simply outbid everyone else for them or buy up entire warehouses full of cpus in bulk then with all the cpus now out of reach of the people we ll do this again with some other product at this rate how long until cryptominers find a way to get a ps5 to mine nextcoin or whatever and that stock crisis just becomes even more acute this isn t even considering the devastating environmental cost of all those extra cpus being impressed into the cryptomines along with the world s graphics card stock cpus are not a low cost resource the cost is just deferred in the form of climate change please stop i m begging you

salem ore nov 12 2021 prnewswire willamette valley vineyards inc nasdaq wvvi the company a leading oregon producer of pinot noir generated income applicable to common shareholders for the three months ended september 30 2021 and 2020 of 95 120 and 640 347 respectively a decrease of 545 227 or 85 1 in the third quarter of 2021 over the same quarter in the prior year sales revenue for the three months ended september 30 2021 and 2020 were 7 641 228 and 6 918 131 respectively an increase of 723 097 or 10 5 in the current year period over the prior year period this increase was caused by an increase in direct sales of 699 172 and an increase in direct sales through distributors of 23 925 in the current year three month period over the prior year period the increase in direct sales to consumers was primarily the result of increased revenue from tasting room sales phone sales and wine club sales gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the three months ended september 30 2021 and 2020 was 58 4 and 61 0 respectively a decrease of 2 6 percentage points in the current year period over the prior year period mostly as a result of higher cost vintages produced in 2020 that were sold in 2021 selling general and administrative expense for the three months ended september 30 2021 and 2020 was 3 768 765 and 2 917 363 respectively an increase of 851 402 or 29 2 in the current quarter over the same quarter in the prior year this increase was primarily a result of our tasting rooms being open for more days in 2021 compared to 2020 resulting in higher labor and related costs associated with operating the tasting rooms net income for the three months ended september 30 2021 and 2020 was 456 191 and 896 799 respectively a decrease of 440 608 or 49 1 in the third quarter of 2021 over the same quarter in the prior year jim bernau founder and ceo of the company said an unusual combination of circumstances negatively impacted the company s financial results this past quarter including the 2020 vintages sold in 2021 having a relatively higher cost of goods sold as well as the incurrence of scale up expenses including compensation costs in advance of the openings of our new winery near dundee and three new tasting room restaurants in lake oswego the vancouver waterfront and happy valley i believe these circumstances will continue to impact the company at least in the near term other factors which could negatively impact the company s financial results going forward include our inability to supply key high demand products as retailers orders have been outstripping available supply prior to the release of our next vintage as well as distributor trucking shortages and substantial increases in supply costs such as bottles which could increase our operating costs until such time as the national supply chain issues are resolved construction of the additional 50 000 cases of fermentation capacity at our turner location was completed on schedule

nestled in rivian s s 1 ipo filings was a note that the ev company s cornerstone investors had indicated an interest in buying up to 5 billion worth of its stock at its ipo price one of those parties was amazon and the american e commerce giant appears to have pulled the trigger friday afternoon on its buy per a recent form 4 filing amazon bought roughly 200 million worth of rivian stock at its ipo price of 78 per share the buy worked out to 2 564 102 shares in total worth a hair under the target dollar amount of a flat two hundred million at their purchase price amazon now owns a total of 158 363 834 shares of rivian valued at some 20 579 380 228 3 at the company s closing price of 129 95 per share set this afternoon as amazon paid just 78 per share for its most recent tranche of rivian stock the company has already seen upside of more than 133 million on the purchase in percentage terms amazon s latest purchase of rivian stock at its ipo price works out to just 1 6 of its total stake in the company after its various pre ipo holdings and warrants converted to class a shares in the company now that it is publicly traded when considering its previous ownership amazon now owns about 22 of rivian we miscalculated what portion of rivian s stock amazon owns if you look at the ecommerce giant s most recent share tally and compare it to rivian s expected post ipo share count inclusive of its underwriters option it works out to 17 7 however if you calculate from yahoo finance s listed share count for rivian today amazon owns a slimmer 16 2 stake both figures are material if more modest rivian s ipo has been a blockbuster event raising an ocean of capital for the ev company and boosting its market cap into the stratosphere yahoo finance indicates for example that rivian is worth north of 127 billion today at the close of the week s trading cycle given that rivian built just 12 cars in q3 the company is worth around 10 billion per manufactured unit from its last reporting period that ratio will fall in coming quarters but underscores just how much of rivian s valuation is predicated on future results and not past performance

if you look under the hood of nearly any large merchant s e commerce operations there are likely more than a dozen different card acceptance platforms meshed together to serve different parts of the world with banking partners doing payment settlements and managing foreign exchange latin american companies have the added challenge of processing the many transactions that are not card based like bank transfers emerging instant payments and the cash based ones that offer in person payments that need to be electronically confirmed a merchant might need anywhere from 50 to hundreds of partners depending on complexity and the countries they are targeting if any of the aggregate transactions across platforms go down for just a millisecond that transaction will fail potentially leading to huge losses why online merchants need a new breed of infrastructure fintechs the key to growing market share and loyalty for global merchants and service providers is knocking out the friction tied to payments and the online buying experience for global merchants expanding to the region from alibaba to amazon and shopee in e commerce to tech giants offering a variety of services such as garena netflix or whatsapp latin america s payments landscape is particularly daunting in south america alone there are at least 14 different currencies across latin america and the caribbean there are more than 30 countries all with varying local customs financial regulations and consumer protections there s also the issue of most global acquirers inability to recognize many latin americans credit scores leading to a high rate of unapproved transactions while advancing quickly these global merchants have not caught up with regional e commerce giant mercadolibre which continues to lead in latin america pushing past a market cap of more than 90 billion earlier this year in a nasdaq analysis of meli s most recent earnings report writer will healy describes some crucial advantages for latam s current e commerce leader including its investments in both shipments and payments and its secret weapon in mercado pago to facilitate electronic payments in its cash dependent markets both latam based merchants and global e commerce players expanding into new countries face the considerable cost of coding into their tech stack their understanding of the local customs and regulations these may include local habits such as mexico s continued preference for cash based transactions or financial products such as brazil s use of boleto bancário bank tickets that customers pay at atms post offices or markets this is why the next wave of infrastructure fintechs is vital and why they are attracting more investors expanding operations to a highly competitive and large e commerce market such as brazil offers another strategic benefit the ability to tap infrastructure fintechs to quickly pilot and test drive offerings such as pix buy now pay later systems or installment payments that have long been used by a large portion of the population recent infrastructure fintech innovations during the pandemic people had to buy essential goods and services online in the wake of multiple lockdowns this drove dramatic shifts in consumer behavior expectations and business models that are transforming the digital business landscape at a breakneck pace in brazil infrastructure fintech zoop partnered with ifood one of the leading delivery apps in latin america to help keep its massive network of 236 000 restaurants alive together they quickly rolled out a new bank for restaurants with digital bank accounts that allowed restaurants across 1 200 cities in brazil to access financial services such as banking transfers and payments and credit transactions with prepayments of receivables via ifood similarly colombian food tech firm rappi recently said it plans to seek regulatory approval to operate as a digital bank in the country by the beginning of next year per reuters if approved it will roll out rappipay a joint venture with publicly traded banco davivienda a colombian bank in early november the minas gerais based hotmart a tech platform and app for the creator economy launched its own credit card and whatsapp integration the new hotmart card in partnership with visa provides an easy way to bill for and collect content producers online sales or subscriptions the recent public health crisis has highlighted the need to innovate around healthcare delivery driving leaps forward in telehealth and remote care in addition to the ongoing pursuit of lowering healthcare costs a great example of infrastructure fintech impacting healthcare is san francisco s payzen an early stage healthcare fintech startup tackling the growing patient payment responsibility problem payzen s fintech infrastructure platform pays hospitals upfront for patient invoices and offers patients zero interest fee free payment plans the startup aims to increase collections for hospitals by up to 50 while making quality healthcare more affordable for patients this approach is also beginning to demonstrate potential for health focused companies in latin america including health plan innovations by companies such as alice a sao paulo based health tech that offers b2c health insurance as reported by reuters in september global brands from mercedes to amazon to ikea and walmart are cutting out the traditional financial middleman and plugging in software from tech startups to offer their customers everything from banking and credit to insurance with the help of infrastructure fintechs global merchants can quickly roll out embedded financial services such as bnpl options instead of paying full price at checkout and car brands from audi to jaguar to mercedes can embed payments technology into their new models to provide their customers with a more frictionless payments experience moving from friction filled to thoughtless commerce laying down new global commerce rails through infrastructure fintechs partnering with a wide variety of sector leaders around the world promises many benefits for consumers and businesses alike the key to growing market share and loyalty for global merchants and service providers is knocking out the friction tied to payments and the online buying experience in practice consumers want this process to be thoughtless so that there are no barriers to paying using the methods they prefer and ensuring that digital transactions are fast easy painless and secure from an it and operations perspective reducing the complexity of managing dozens of disparate platforms and financial systems and a never ending array of regulatory and compliance laws and revisions could save thousands of hours and millions of dollars for businesses when it comes to e commerce the world is smaller than ever and our shopping and payment experiences need to reflect this developing a new global financial infrastructure capable of supporting a world dominated by digital commerce is a massive challenge to address in the months and years ahead but that s why the dawns of new commercial eras are both challenging and quite enticing for us as a society

cnn high gas prices are quickly becoming a political liability for president joe biden and like presidents before him he has few options to bring them down that doesn t mean he won t take steps to demonstrate his attention to the issue in fact he could take action as soon as tuesday when a key government forecast on fuel prices is released the one option consistently left on the table is tapping into us emergency crude reserves a step even white house officials privately acknowledge wouldn t have much of an effect bottom line high gas prices are one of the most frustrating phenomena for any white house because they affect almost every american but are mostly immune from presidential action what s driving higher prices as the global economy rebounds from the pandemic the price of crude oil is skyrocketing us gas prices have surged to a seven year high of 3 40 a gallon nationally and are flirting with 4 in nevada washington and oregon the rise in prices comes as demand for oil surges back as the covid 19 pandemic wanes outpacing supply what are biden s options energy secretary jennifer granholm told cnn s dana bash on sunday that biden was certainly looking at the strategic petroleum reserve as an option she said the administration was closely watching the energy information agency report on tuesday before taking next steps the president is all over this she said adding biden was looking at all of the tools that he has yet for biden those tools are somewhat limited a fact both the president and the white house have acknowledged in recent weeks there are limitations to what any president can do as it relates to gas prices press secretary jen psaki said on october 22 i don t have a near term answer biden said during cnn s town hall in october he sounded slightly more optimistic on saturday but declined to lay out what menu of options he was working from there other tools in the arsenal that we have to deal and i m dealing with other countries at an appropriate time i will talk about it that we can get more energy in the pipeline figuratively and literally speaking he said the administration has already taken some small steps to control gas prices including the federal trade commission saying it would investigate potential price gouging nearly a dozen senate democrats called on biden on monday to fight high gas prices by considering a release of barrels from the nation s emergency oil stockpile or even taking the more extreme step of banning oil exports aside from tapping the spr officials said another option cutting or banning us oil exports altogether was unlikely given the furor it would ignite both at home among producers and refiners and abroad among allies other options for biden could include attempting to lower costs for refiners limited effects of spr tapping the spr the stockpile of 600 million barrels of crude oil stored in underground salt caverns in louisiana and texas could have only a limited effect because of how much oil can be released at a time but would act as a political sign that biden is confronting the problem the impact of a sale would be short lived and it is not clear that releasing strategic stocks would help the market to adjust any faster than it would otherwise wrote ben cahill senior fellow at the energy security and climate change program at the center for strategic and international studies goldman sachs analysts said a release of 60 million barrels would only be of modest and temporary help it would reduce brent prices at the end of this year by only 3 per barrel and it could discourage us shale producers from increasing their output leading to higher prices in 2022 biden has consulted with counterparts in other non opec nations about potentially coordinating strategic reserve releases as a way of having more of a global impact biden blames opec for his part biden has blamed the refusal of russia or the opec nations to pump more oil as a reason for high gas prices in the united states we ll see what happens on that score sooner than later he said during a news conference in scotland last week unfortunately for biden what happened was the oil cartel and its partners declined to take up his demand they increase supply at last week s g20 biden had made a specific attempt to lobby those countries to increase output they responded by saying they would stick to their original plan of only slowing ramping up supply the white house responded almost immediately accusing opec of placing the global recovery for countries around the world in jeopardy we will consider the full range of tools at our disposal to bolster resilience and public confidence a nsc spokesperson said

johnson johnson is peeling off a consumer health business that helped it become the world s biggest health care products maker the company said friday that it will separate its segment that sells band aids listerine and over the counter medicines like tylenol from its pharmaceutical and medical device businesses company leaders told analysts that the split will make each business both to be traded publicly more nimble in adapting to their respective markets ceo alex gorsky said that while the company s broad focus has worked in the past the split addresses segments that have evolved as fundamentally different businesses we ve seen a significant evolution in these markets particularly on the consumer side gorsky said referring in part to a shift toward online shopping that accelerated during the covid 19 pandemic an analyst asked company leaders during a friday call why they were making the change now when they have touted j j s diversity in the past as a way to help offset a downturn in a particular segment i think we have consistently had the belief that our diversified portfolio is rooted in strategy gorsky said however it s not anchored in strategy university of michigan business professor erik gordon said he didn t think the two separate companies would wind up being more focused or nimble because the present company is already decentralized j j gives its companies a lot of autonomy he said the segment selling prescription drugs and medical devices j j s two largest businesses will keep the johnson johnson name and blockbuster drugs that include the cancer treatment darzalex and a covid 19 vaccine the new version of j j also will get incoming ceo joaquin duato who is slated to replace gorsky early next year the split comes at an ideal time for a leadership change said steve brozak who follows drugmakers as president of wbb securities he noted that the new ceo takes over what will become a completely different company one that won t have easy metrics for comparing to past performances and evaluating progress it buys time for decisions to be made on what to do next brozak said this is the perfect vehicle for a management change pharmaceuticals and medical devices pulled in a combined 19 6 billion in revenue in the company s recently completed third quarter which turned out better than analysts expected consumer health brought in 3 7 billion a leader and name for the new consumer health company have yet to be announced it will house brands including neutrogena aveeno and the iconic band aids which a company employee created more than 100 years ago that segment has more than 20 brands that each have over 150 million in annual sales gorsky noted he added that the portfolio includes well known names like tylenol and children s tylenol that have reached all time highs in market share johnson johnson also faces thousands of lawsuits claiming that one of its consumer products talc based baby powder causes ovarian cancer and mesothelioma last month j j announced that it had created a separate subsidiary to deal with those claims and that subsidiary filed for voluntary chapter 11 bankruptcy protection company officials said that the split they announced friday was separate and distinct from that baby powder liability and the bankruptcy proceedings but morningstar analyst damien conover noted in an email that if the consumer division no longer holds the deep pockets of the combined company the risk of future consumer product litigation such as the large talc settlement may decrease johnson johnson which was founded in 1886 said friday that its split will occur in the next two years if approved by the company s board of directors j j s announcement comes just days after general electric said that it plans to split into three separate companies it also follows similar moves by large pharmaceutical rivals pfizer inc which spun off its consumer health product business in 2019 and merck co shares of new brunswick new jersey based johnson johnson climbed 2 to 165 12 in afternoon trading while the dow jones industrial average rose slightly j j shares had already climbed about almost 4 so far this year while the dow has jumped about 17 j j has been a component of the dow jones industrial average since 1997

the utah legislature is taking back some of the broad authority it s given to the organization that owns the intermountain power plant in delta during this week s special legislative session sen derrin owens r fountain green introduced a bill that gives state officials more oversight of the plant s operations ahead of its transition from coal to natural gas and ultimately hydrogen this bill is not about or against the transition from coal to natural gas or to prevent hydrogen owens said this is just to roll back some of the special privileges that have been given to one entity in the state the intermountain power agency is a political subdivision of the state created in 1977 to finance and run the power plant the agency is comprised of 23 municipalities in utah but sells electricity primarily to the los angeles department of water and power and five other southern california cities since about 2002 owens said ipa has lobbied for and received numerous exemptions to state law as a result the agency was given the ability to seize private land under eminent domain avoid state audits and public meeting requirements and create additional subdivisions of its own with the same authorities owens said it made sense to grant the agency those powers in the past due to the plant s dominant economic footprint in the region it has provided close to 800 million in state and local revenue directly employs 400 people in millard county and supports another few thousand jobs in surrounding fields that service the plant but given the massive transformation ahead as well as ipa s recent deals with out of state coal and natural gas suppliers owens said it was time to transfer some of that broad authority back to the state ipa has been a great partner he said but once they pivoted away from that partnership and they ve actually gone to wyoming and signed gas agreements that really takes jobs and taxes and school support all kinds of things away from the state the bill passed wednesday subjects ipa to state audits and removes its ability to enforce eminent domain and create clone subdivisions an earlier version of the legislation would ve imposed the same restrictions on two other utah subdivisions the utah municipal power association and utah associated municipal power systems but ultimately carved them out even though uamps has some of the same authority while the bill passed some legislators voiced concerns over how it would impact the plant s future ipa is looking to raise 2 billion to fund the plant s conversion and is set to begin that process in january legal changes ahead of those investments could delay things or make it more difficult to secure the project s funding the new law could also affect other developments aiming to support the renewable transition that includes magnum development a local company developing underground salt caverns near the site to serve as long term renewable energy storage we are in the process of inking contracts as we speak said ceo craig broussard we re about to order about 35 million worth of long lead items and these will be impacted if in fact the bonds and other oversights with our bankers and lenders are impacted so there is a direct connection to the repowering and jobs ipa spokesman john ward said the power agency also objected to the limited time it was given to review the bill and speak against it lawmakers permitted ward and others speaking in opposition to the bill just about a minute each it hasn t even been a week since we found out they were doing this he said in an interview thursday so it ll take some time to work through what the impacts really are but we will remain committed to pushing the project forward if we can ward also questioned the intent behind the bill noting the carve outs for similar entities he said that ipa is audited annually by its members and a private company and is not requesting nor uses public funds the main reason for oversight of public entities is to make sure that the public s money is being spent judiciously he said this project doesn t use any utah taxpayer money he said the agency operates on revenue generated from the entities that purchase power from the plant which has primarily been los angeles and nearby cities the money it s raising will come from the municipal bond market

when elected leaders decide to look the other way from ya know the matters that actually matter to us we find out about the kinds of people america has in its reserve stock yes the supply chain is a mess but we ve got all three hosts to chat with ryan peterson ceo of flexport who hopes to fix it take a look at what is likely the first ever viral tweetstorm on shipping logistics as well as his children s book to educate youngsters about the machines that power the world they inhabit the gang ask ryan about his boat tour of the long beach port complex to see for himself what s got us so backed up he gets us into the nooks and crannies of his industry how the pandemic has showed its weak points his ideas for innovating it and naturally the regulatory burdens that slow it all down
the official u s approval of a coronavirus vaccine for elementary school students removes one of the last barriers to ending the pandemic but it s obvious that a significant portion of the country will never fully embrace vaccination we ve tried just about every form of positive motivation including emphasizing family reunions giving away beer and dangling 5 million in lottery winnings with mixed results for example researchers found that ohio s distinctive lottery program didn t actually affect vaccination rates to combat vaccine hesitancy we need to grasp its psychological roots alongside skepticism of institutions and experts exposure to misinformation and other often cited reasons for resisting vaccines sits a clear emotional explanation many people are afraid that they ll make a bad decision they re influenced by the psychology of anticipated regret understanding this reaction can help us get more shots into arms removing one of the final obstacles to controlling the virus it s widely understood that when humans make decisions they engage in a cost benefit analysis but psychologists have shown that people also conduct a less rational calculation involving the regret they might experience when deciding which of two roads to go down they not only consider the statistical probabilities but also implicitly imagine their reactions to worst case scenarios in these analyses potential bad outcomes weigh heavier on the mind than equally likely positive possibilities advertisement when do people anticipate feeling the most regret when outcomes will derive from actions they take as opposed to the consequences of declining to act research shows psychologists notably daniel kahneman who won a nobel prize in economics for his work on decision making have demonstrated these tendencies in a series of experiments for example kahneman found that people anticipate feeling more regret if they were to lose money by switching to a new stock vs taking a loss on their current stock and this regret is maximally intensified when we freely choose to take action we are not ordered or coerced and when it involves new or experimental activities for example kahneman found that people anticipate more regret when imagining an accident that occurs while driving home along a new route compared with driving on one s normal route anticipated regret is why people often prefer to stand still rather than move forward anticipated regret sheds light on why vaccine hesitant people seem more comfortable taking their chances with the virus rather than getting the shot a decision that is not rational given the relative likelihood of experiencing severe effects of covid 19 vs severe vaccine side effects when a person becomes infected with a virus and contracts a disease it is something that happens to them it is not so the mind tells itself the result of an active decision self optimism is another widespread psychological trait most people assume that they won t get infected in the first place and that even if they do they ll be fine share this article share now let s imagine someone who decides to get vaccinated and suffers some sort of severe side effect or reaction there s no evading that it was her choice to get the vaccine as a result she has only herself to blame or so she might conclude no matter how rare the side effects are some evidence suggests that the aversion to making a decision that could lead to a bad outcome is especially strong in the medical context advertisement vaccines are no longer experimental but the coronavirus vaccines do involve a new technology that probably intensifies the imagined potential regret in the minds of people thinking about side effects indeed the psychology of anticipated regret may help explain the skewed view of risk among the vaccine hesitant in a yahoo news yougov poll this summer just 29 percent of unvaccinated americans said they thought covid 19 was a bigger threat than the vaccine it s not all bad news however the psychology of regret can also help explain why coronavirus vaccine mandates have generally been so effective despite the many assertions that mandates would lead to mass resignations the employees of many organizations ultimately got on board consider new york city s largest police union which fought such mandates in court and argued that the police department would lose thousands of officers in the end out of a force of about 35 000 officers fewer than three dozen refused the vaccine similarly of the 67 000 employees at united airlines facing a mandate only 320 refused to get vaccinated the collapse of resistance to the mandates following fierce pledges to quit is puzzling until you consider the psychology of regret when people don t feel the weight of making their own choice they aren t as tormented by the anticipated negative outcomes of their decision mandates externalize responsibility for getting vaccinated shifting it from the self to others making it easier to go forward with getting a shot confronting the reality of losing a job surely also has a persuasive effect advertisement
toronto from oils and creams to capsules and gummies there appears to be countless online ads for cannabidiol cbd products with many exploiting household names in an effort to defraud unsuspecting consumers early in november maureen stumbled upon an ad for cbd gummies on instagram that appeared to feature the name and image of ctv news chief anchor and senior editor lisa laflamme laflamme does not represent nor endorse any cbd products including gummies or any other products or services her name came up and it gave a story maureen who is 65 years old and lives in mississauga ont told ctvnews ca in a phone interview it actually said how she was sort of in trouble because ctv wasn t happy with her doing this kind of stuff maureen who asked that her full name not be used tapped on the ad and was brought to an order page she initially didn t go through with the purchase but was then offered a better price of 4 95 for a bottle she made a purchase and upon completing the checkout process received a receipt of 4 95 for the gummies about 20 minutes later she received another receipt this time for 52 85 which included an order of gummies oil drops and skin cream i called them i said i didn t order the cream i don t want the cream she said well that s what you ordered i said no i didn t they said well you clicked on everything i said there was one thing to click on and that s what i clicked on further to that she says the customer service agent indicated she would be charged for more products in the future they told me i ll keep getting orders i said i don t want it i said cancel me she said oh we can t do that you have to call back maureen was refused a refund on the products she says she didn t order i never do stuff like this she said i should have known better although she doesn t recall the name of the website through which she made her initial order her receipt shows the url perfecthealthexperience com the site was displaying a 403 forbidden error when trying to access it at the time of publication ctvnews ca called the customer service line a representative who identified themselves as daniel said the company he works for has nothing to do with the marketing of products we are a third party customer service that provides assistance to several brands he said we actually do not have anything to do with how the promotions are being presented daniel refused to name his employer he also said customers who call about being charged for extra products may have ordered discounted items as part of a bundle daniel wouldn t divulge any of the brands his company represents save for one max healthy products meanwhile days before speaking with the representative ctvnews ca received a message from a reader saying a website with the url maxhealthyproducts com was claiming laflamme endorsed a cbd gummy product like perfecthealthexperience com this website was also displaying a 403 forbidden error at the time of publication these instances aren t the first time laflamme s name and image have apparently been falsely used to promote cbd products they made it sound like she was the ceo in early may tricia was perusing instagram when she saw an ad for a free bottle of cbd gummies that appeared to feature the name and image of ctv news chief anchor and senior editor lisa laflamme laflamme does not represent nor endorse any cbd products including gummies or any other products or services they made it sound like she was the ceo of the company tricia told ctvnews ca during a telephone interview from her home in peterborough ont it made it sound like she was saying that they had saved her life and so she decided to start up a company when she clicked on the ad tricia who requested that her full name not be used for privacy reasons said she was taken to a website with the url verdenaturalbest com which is no longer active she then proceeded to order one bottle of cbd gummies for 39 95 she didn t see an option to claim an additional bottle for free but says she decided to order one anyway tricia who is in her 70s said she d been thinking about buying cbd gummies or oil for a while to ease symptoms from the progressive arthritis in her spine after she had given her credit card information and completed the checkout process tricia realized she had not received a summary of her order instead her account on the verde natural best website only showed a confirmation of her order without any total for the amount she would be charged that s when the bell rang in my head like how stupid can i be to think that it was lisa laflamme at the head of this company tricia said the next morning when tricia called the number listed on the website to cancel the order she said the customer service representative told her that it was too late because the order had already been processed and shipped after several more days of calling she eventually spoke to one representative who told her that she was being charged c 334 for six bottles of cbd gummies as part of a subscription even though she thought she had only ordered one bottle tricia said she asked about returning the items and the representative told her she would only receive a refund of 50 per cent of the total and she would be charged an additional 15 per cent stock return fee she said her credit card company told her they would have to wait two weeks before they could put a stop payment on the charge finally tricia said she was able to obtain a full refund for the order after she called the customer service representative again and accused the company of using laflamme s name and image without her consent to promote cbd products when ctvnews ca reached out to the customer service line for verde natural best a representative answered who works for a distribution company called natural brands usa which handles consumer inquiries for multiple companies the representative who didn t provide his name said they re not affiliated with the ads that feature celebrity endorsements when asked if the companies he represents send consumers more products than they ordered as in tricia s case he denied it what she ordered is what she gets he said maybe actually she did something wrong with placing the order in the website that s probably most of the reasons for those products to be added to the order when the six bottles of cbd gummies arrived tricia said she didn t even try them before sending them to the toronto return address included with the shipment i should have known better i know better she said while tricia said she should have recognized a potential scheme she s far from alone impersonating celebrities on the rise in canada there has been a marked increase in complaints about these types of schemes in recent years steve baker a former investigator for the u s federal trade commission ftc and an international investigations specialist for the better business bureau bbb conducted a study on subscription traps and free trial scams for the bbb in 2018 in the study he cites data from the canadian anti fraud centre cafc that showed a dramatic uptick in complaints about these types of scams according to the cafc they received 518 complaints from march 2016 to march 2017 up from just 54 complaints from 2011 to 2016 of those 518 complaints 474 people lost money with a total loss of c 192 419 and an average loss of c 248 more recently the cafc said they received 2 557 complaints in 2019 about broader merchandise scams which include subscription traps and free trial scams that resulted in more than 2 699 000 in losses in 2020 the cafc said there were 4 056 reports of merchandise scams resulting in more than 9 730 000 in losses in the u s over a 10 year period baker said there were more than us 1 3 billion in losses affecting more than a million victims in the u s due to such scams there is a massive industry of deceptive free trial offers i think almost anybody has run across them by now he told ctvnews ca during an interview from st louis miss they simply use the names and supposed endorsements of celebrities without permission in the past few years household names such as tom hanks ellen degeneres don lemon katie couric sandra bullock and dr mehmet oz among others have spoken out to refute ads claiming they have endorsed certain products including cbd products keto and diet pills and anti aging creams baker said they use celebrities or well known journalists in the product ads because they know the public will be more likely to click on them they realize that people really do put more trust in something that s endorsed by a celebrity that they re familiar with he explained they think rightly the celebrity wouldn t really endorse it unless it probably worked so that gives people a lot more confidence that it works in a statement to ctvnews ca the cafc said scammers try to impersonate all celebrities in what they call a merchandise continuity scam which is any scam that involves a victim being signed up for a subscription resulting in multiple and subsequent monthly charges on their credit card after buying a product or service the cafc said such schemes typically involve email an online pop up or ad that relates to a free gift or product the consumer then fills out a survey or questionnaire and enters in their credit card details to pay for shipping for the free product there are subsequent charges on the cc in the following months mostly related to prize merchandise and service scams and often related to known company names or even celebrity names being used the cafc said in general the cafc said the emails or ads don t target a specific group but try to scam anyone willing to click on the link and provide their credit card information these companies don t want to be flagged that s exactly the reason why terry who requested that only his first name be used decided to order three bottles of cbd gummies for 39 95 in order to receive three free jars he said he made the order after seeing an ad that featured a supposed study on the benefits of cbd the 68 year old from ottawa said the study in the fake ad cited canadian news outlets including ctv news cbc news the globe and mail as well as the university of toronto i ve never used these products i ve never had a desire to use them but my arthritis hurts so badly he said during a telephone interview with ctvnews ca when i saw ctv and cbc etc etc and the university of toronto i figured you know what these are major canadian legitimate organizations i felt that if you thought that this was a really effective product why not try it after terry placed his order however he realized something was wrong when the email confirmation he received showed an invoice for us 294 56 or c 357 terry called the customer service number and learned that he had been signed up for a monthly subscription for a cbd oil and cream which is why his charges were so high he said he was told the company would not cancel the order because it had already been shipped he spent the next 16 days disputing the charges before his credit card company became involved he said as soon as his credit card company launched an investigation he received a full refund and confirmation that his account with the cbd company had been cancelled it demonstrates that these companies don t want to be flagged he said although he complained terry said there could be other consumers out there who failed to check their invoice until it was too late or they paid off their credit cards without noticing the extra charges terry said he never bothered to try the cbd gummies oil and cream he received in the mail and sent them back to the return p o box address located in toronto ctvnews ca reached out to a customer service line associated with indigo ultra shop which is where terry says he purchased the cbd gummies and was directed to the same distribution company natural brands usa as before with verde natural brands this time a customer service representative who would only give the name ezzy said their company is not affiliated with any artists right now when he was asked about the ads he said he would direct ctvnews ca s questions to the company s head office but there has not been a response as of the time of publication baker said it can be difficult to track down who is behind some of these companies because the websites themselves can appear differently depending on how they re accessed he said if the url is typed into a browser it may appear legitimate without any deceptive claims but if the same website is visited through a link in an email text message or social media post the website may have different information on it what s more baker said a lot of the time the websites will only be up for a few days before they re taken down or changed these folks are very clever they re extremely computer savvy and it s something that makes it more difficult to go after he said how to protect yourself while it may be difficult to obtain a refund or track down those responsible for these types of merchandise continuity scams there are ways to protect yourself from becoming victim to them in the first place the bbb recommends research the company online see what other people are saying about the company s free trials complaints from other customers can tip you off to catches that might come with the trial understand what happens after the free trial ends always read the terms of the offer before signing up if there aren t any terms or it s difficult to understand what you re agreeing to don t sign up and don t provide your credit card information watch for the fine print be aware that promotions or free samples are often not risk free look for any fine print that says you will keep getting products and you will be charged for them be skeptical be wary of any endorsements from a celebrity or well known figure or organization scammers often fake these endorsements report losses to credit card companies if you pay with a credit card you can dispute fraudulent charges keep an eye on your monthly statements and notify your credit card company of any suspicious charges baker stressed that he would discourage anyone from doing a free trial or signing up for a free product from any type of medical or nutraceutical company online for anyone who believes they have been the victim of an online scam baker recommends they alert their credit card company and contact local law enforcement so they can investigate in addition to reporting the fraud to local police victims in canada can also file a report with the cafc online or by phone

a series of sharp knocks on his driver s side window startled jason burt awake it was the middle of the night on a saturday in 2016 burt was sleeping in his pickup truck in the parking lot of st jude children s research hospital in downtown memphis tennessee where his 5 year old daughter was being treated for brain cancer he d driven more than 500 miles from his home in central texas to visit her a st jude security guard peered into the truck and asked burt what he was doing burt explained that his daughter and her mother his ex girlfriend were staying in the hospital s free patient housing but st jude provides housing for only one parent burt a school bus driver making 20 000 a year told the guard he couldn t afford a hotel the guard let the exhausted father go back to sleep st jude would do no more to find him a place to stay they were aware of the situation burt said i didn t push anything i was just grateful she was getting treated and i was doing what i needed to do st jude is the largest and most highly regarded health care charity in the country each year the memphis hospital s fundraisers send out hundreds of millions of letters many with heart wrenching photographs of children left bald from battling cancer celebrities like jennifer aniston and sofia vergara sing the hospital s praises in televised advertisements this year st jude s fundraising reached outer space the spacex inspiration4 mission in september included a former st jude patient as a crew member last year st jude raised a record 2 billion u s news world report ranked it the country s 10th best children s cancer hospital and st jude raised roughly as much as the nine hospitals ahead of it put together it currently has 5 2 billion in reserves a sum large enough to run the institution at current levels for the next four and a half years without a single additional donation st jude makes a unique promise as part of its fundraising families never receive a bill from st jude for treatment travel housing or food because all a family should worry about is helping their child live but for many families treatment at st jude does not relieve all the financial burdens they incur in getting care for their children including housing travel and food costs that fall outside the hospital s strict limits a propublica investigation has found while families may not receive a bill from st jude the hospital doesn t cover what s usually the biggest source of financial stress associated with childhood cancer the loss of income as parents quit or take leave from jobs to be with their child during treatment for many families the consequence is missed payments for cars utilities and cellphones others face eviction or foreclosure because they can t keep up with rent and mortgage payments parents at st jude have exhausted savings and retirement accounts borrowed from family and friends or asked other charities for aid propublica identified more than 100 st jude families seeking financial help through the online fundraiser gofundme with half of the campaigns started in the past two years we counted scores of other events like concerts and yard sales organized to help st jude families in need one family relied on a mixed martial arts fighter to help raise money for expenses like car repairs and cellphone bills items that st jude would not cover another spent 10 000 originally saved to purchase a home on costs related to treatment at st jude only about half of the 7 3 billion st jude has received in contributions in the past five fiscal years went to the hospital s research and caring for patients according to its financial filings with the internal revenue service about 30 covered the cost of its fundraising operations and the remaining 20 or 1 of every 5 donated increased its reserve fund further propublica found a substantial portion of the cost for treatment is paid not by st jude but by families private insurance or by medicaid the government insurance program for low income families about 90 of patients are insured bringing in more than 100 million in reimbursements for treatment a year if a family shows up at st jude without insurance a company hired by the charity helps them find it st jude does cover copays and deductibles an unusual benefit st jude spends about 500 million a year on patient services a figure that includes all medical care and other assistance very little of what st jude raises from the public goes to pay for food travel and housing for families the investigation found last year it was 2 of the money raised or nearly 40 million in written responses to propublica lawyers for st jude and its fundraising arm the american lebanese syrian associated charities or alsac emphasized that countless families have benefited from the charity provided since the hospital opened its doors in 1962 propublica should be celebrating st jude and alsac for their commitment to finding cures saving children s lives and optimizing patient outcomes one of their letters said it is unquestioned that st jude has helped thousands of children and their families over the decades patients have offered scores of testimonials about the hospital s generosity and care this often comes as a huge relief to families who often expect to sell all their belongings just so their children can get the medical care and treatment they need to save their lives the hospital s lawyers wrote st jude and alsac understand that this arrangement cannot cover all financial obligations of all families nor can st jude or alsac shield families from all the financial and emotional effects of a child s illness st jude said it discloses the limits of its aid to families on its website and in material provided to those whose children are admitted to the hospital that includes the rule burt ran into that the hospital covers the travel and housing costs of only one caregiver and one patient for many families the daily food budget is capped at 50 in some cases hotel stays en route are provided only if families travel more than 500 miles to get to st jude st jude said its assistance is based on guidelines to ensure fairness and responsible use of donor funds and on remaining compliant with a federal anti kickback statute that makes it a criminal offense to offer something of value to induce a medical referral st jude declined to explain how the law affects the amount or type of financial assistance it provides to families st jude has never promised anyone neither patients nor the public in general that it can solve all financial problems the letter said when parents need additional financial help st jude s social workers often send them to smaller charities or in some cases suggest that they apply for government aid they refer many to the andrew mcdonough b foundation which gives more than 2 5 million a year in grants to thousands of families of pediatric cancer patients at hospitals across the country to help cover rent utilities and other urgent expenses joe mcdonough the foundation s founder and president said st jude families have the same money problems as families of patients at other children s hospitals even though he said st jude s marketing creates the public perception that it alleviates these burdens people say to me why are you helping st jude families mcdonough said well what happens when a family lives in augusta georgia and they re being treated at st jude they still have to pay the rent on their apartment back in augusta georgia they still have to make their car payment and it s not my position to say whether st jude should be paying for all those expenses or not i m just explaining that it s not a totally free ride the help st jude provides to families may soon be increasing after propublica provided st jude with the findings of its reporting the hospital informed families of a dramatic expansion in the assistance it will give to parents and other relatives during their kids treatment in memphis among the most significant changes are increasing travel benefits to two parents instead of one and covering regular trips to memphis for siblings and other loved ones st jude s letter to parents said the changes take effect nov 15 that would ve made a big difference for burt burt s daughter whom propublica is not identifying at her mother s request was originally diagnosed with cancer in early 2015 when doctors discovered a tumor pressing against her brain stem she had successful emergency surgery to remove the mass at dell children s medical center in austin texas medicaid and dell children s covered the bill but the family was still faced with the cost of her ongoing treatment at that point i m thinking what am i going to do i guess i m selling my house whatever it takes burt recalled honestly that was probably a big deciding factor for st jude st jude accepted burt s daughter into a clinical trial and the family moved to the hospital s patient housing in memphis for several months both parents stopped working for a time and people in their hometown raised cash to pay their bills her cancer relapsed the following year with several new inoperable brain tumors burt and his daughter s mom broke up during that round of treatment and financial problems piled up burt said his credit score dropped so low that utility companies refused to set up service unless he first paid a deposit one of the family s cars was repossessed he said burt s 2005 chevrolet colorado pickup has 300 000 miles on it many of them logged on trips from texas to memphis when burt s daughter was at st jude for treatment or exams he d work all week then visit on many weekends where he would spend saturday night sleeping in the hospital parking lot he asked hospital officials if he could sleep in st jude s housing but they turned him down he said burt said he was happy with the care st jude provided his daughter s health is stable he said and brain scans taken during her september exam confirmed her two remaining tumors haven t grown but he s still trying to recover financially it s five years now burt said and i m not completely caught up yet a fundraising giant st jude began with a fledgling entertainer praying for a career break when danny thomas a comic and actor best known for the tv sitcom make room for daddy was struggling to earn a living in the late 1930s the devout roman catholic went to church and asked for help from the patron saint of desperate cases st jude thaddeus if he made it big thomas promised to build a shrine where the poor and the helpless and the hopeless may come for comfort and aid according to a history published by alsac within five years thomas became a star and worked to fulfill his promise by building a children s hospital named after st jude and a fundraising organization to support it thomas whose parents were lebanese immigrants recruited others who shared his middle eastern roots to help he used his fame to raise the hospital s profile appearing in ads for st jude and hosting fundraising events starring the likes of elvis presley and sammy davis jr thomas daughter marlo herself a tv star succeeded him in championing st jude today st jude is a specialty treatment and research center with about 5 700 employees and 73 beds other top children s hospitals have more staff and beds and they also treat more conditions though st jude raises money across the world most of its patients come from tennessee and surrounding states patients from elsewhere are usually enrolled in clinical trials alsac which handles st jude s fundraising and investments has 2 188 employees in memphis and in 36 regional offices across the country more than 400 of the fundraising arm s employees are paid over 100 000 according to irs filings the charity takes in so much money each year that it regularly steers hundreds of millions of dollars in donations to reserve accounts the filings show overall st jude s reserve has grown by 58 over the past five fiscal years during which it has added 1 9 billion to its investment accounts and shifted its portfolio toward financial products designed to generate bigger returns than stocks bonds and mutual funds traditionally deliver the charity stowed more than a third of the new surplus 688 million in riskier private equity investments irs rules do not limit the size of a nonprofit s reserves and experts on charitable finance differ on best practices st jude meets better business bureau guidelines which call for charities to maintain reserves of less than three times total expenses but other experts expressed alarm that the hospital had accumulated such a large sum of money the size of the st jude reserve is staggering said laura otten the director of lasalle university s master program in nonprofit leadership she said a typical reserve for a nonprofit the size of st jude is one to two years of expenses donors generally want to know their dollars are being put to work she said the hospital said it needs a large reserve because its unique operating model relies on donations to fund annual operating costs e are highly donor dependent and subject to the economic driven vagaries of charitable giving the hospital said in a written response to propublica questions but the hospital s reserve is already more than large enough to buffer against recessions and potential drops in donations said ge bai a professor of accounting and health policy at johns hopkins university they should be spending the money as aggressively as they raise it but they seem to be hoarding bai said the hospital said it is also raising billions to fund the construction of new housing and research space although its plans do not currently include spending any of the reserve on new facilities st jude s reserves have ballooned at a time when researchers oncologists advocates and families complain about a dearth of funding for pediatric cancer studies nationally dozens of other children s hospitals across the country have research divisions devoted to pediatric cancer and enroll their patients in clinical trials for new drugs and procedures they pay for research staff and studies in part with donations from their local communities often competing directly against st jude alsac has regional offices in several u s cities with elite pediatric cancer centers of their own including atlanta chicago denver and seattle coury shadyac an alsac vice president and daughter of the organization s ceo richard shadyac jr oversees a team of 45 fundraisers along the west coast raising 300 million annually for st jude according to her linkedin profile that s 100 million more in donations than either children s hospital los angeles or seattle children s hospital two of the nation s leading pediatric cancer institutions received in fiscal year 2019 irs disclosures show but it s only a small part of st jude s fundraising haul alsac s ubiquitous fundraising has led to concerns that it undercuts other hospitals campaigns some doctors interviewed by propublica said they have encouraged donors to give their money to hospitals closer to home david clark a pediatrician and former longtime chairperson of pediatrics at albany medical center in new york said st jude raises tens of thousands of dollars in his region that does little to benefit the children with cancer in his area since almost all are treated locally alsac has a fundraising office located a few miles from albany medical they think of every way they can to make money and the least amount of ways to spend it clark said they deceive people into supporting something that is totally dishonest nearly all st jude solicitations feature the hospital s patients the children usually smiling and bald from treatment along with the familiar promise that it never sends families a bill it s a message that alsac has tested and researched to maximize donations donors appreciate the promise to never bill families said mary kate tolan an alsac executive in a podcast last year she added that no parent should have to take out a second mortgage or lose their job because their child is being treated at st jude alternative messaging to the no bills promise did not perform as well said tolan who develops emerging technologies for alsac tolan did not return requests for comment borrowing and begging catherine rainey thought she would be free of financial worry when her 2 year old daughter harlee was admitted to st jude last year the first thing my dad said was catherine you have nothing to worry about they raise billions of dollars anytime you have a problem you tell them and they will take care of it she said but like many families the raineys discovered that st jude s charity came with limits on payments for expenses such as travel that could be bewildering harlee ended up at st jude after first going to nearby niswonger children s hospital in johnson city tennessee in october 2020 the doctors there discovered a cancerous mass attached to her right kidney the hospital is a st jude affiliate and the doctors recommended the toddler be treated in memphis rainey a single mother of two young girls had to leave her job as a nurse for months to be with harlee at st jude the loss of income quickly created problems my family we don t come from money she said we are not doctors and billionaires we make it that is it st jude did provide food and housing on campus but the hospital said it couldn t help with the items that were causing rainey to worry including car payments insurance and cellphone bills rainey s boss set up a gofundme account to help make up some of her lost income a small local charity kari s heart foundation also helped out by paying about 3 000 worth of phone bills and car payments staving off repossession it was just a bunch of borrowing and begging rainey said of her experience while her daughter was treated in memphis they acted like it was coming out of their own pocket harlee has checkups at st jude every three months that last about four days the costs of travel to and from st jude put an additional strain on rainey and harlee st jude is an eight hour ride without stops from rainey s home in appalachia virginia a town of 1 432 people near the kentucky border rainey said her daughter generally can make it about two thirds of the way with frequent stops before she has had enough when she is done she is really done rainey said she will scream cry and kick in july in advance of an august trip to memphis rainey called the patient services department at st jude to see whether they could help pay for a hotel to break up the travel day an expense rainey said she could not afford to qualify for a hotel reimbursement rainey said st jude told her she had to live more than 500 miles from memphis the ride from her home to the hospital is 530 miles a measurement propublica confirmed with mapping tools however rainey said st jude told her it measured the trip from city limit to city limit and came up with a distance of 491 miles even using that metric the distance is still more than 500 miles propublica found when she challenged the hospital s stance rainey said she was berated by a patient services representative i was feeling pissed off and i was crying rainey said of the interaction you give up your whole life for your child and they tell you don t worry about anything we will cover this and then they tell you to just push through the drive rainey did what she could to make the trip go smoothly she configured a small table to extend across her daughter s car seat so harlee could play with the coloring books markers and play doh bought for the ride she packed snacks and a cooler full of drinks since harlee was still potty training she brought extra towels and clothes for accidents the final step was handing harlee her baby yoda doll once she settled into her car seat rainey had sewed a port in the doll s chest to mirror the one harlee has in hers about three hours from memphis harlee was crying inconsolably rainey pulled off the interstate and stopped at the first hotel she could find she later learned it had been described in online reviews as awful a nightmare disgusting and horrible i didn t know the area she said the hotel was garbage it just made it worse the drive home also required a hotel stop but this time rainey was able to find one that was cleaner a 100 donation from a local charity helped to offset the cost among the changes st jude is making is to reimburse families like rainey s who live more than 400 miles from the hospital for an overnight stay at a hotel when making the trip to memphis rainey said she was called by a st jude representative after propublica asked about her situation and was told the hospital would pay for her past hotel stays when traveling back and forth to st jude the representative rainey said also told her the hospital discovered the way it had been measuring mileage was inaccurate i am not the only one rainey said there are others they should reimburse all the families the anxiety of unpaid bills piling up combined with caring for a child undergoing chemotherapy or radiation takes a severe toll on parents and guardians said christopher hope a ups driver who started a memphis based foundation after meeting st jude parents who were in financial crisis hope s small charity spent 12 000 last year to help families parents in st jude social media groups often refer families in need to it the charity has helped families cover mortgage and car payments i never knew anything about this until hearing about it from families hope said all we hear is about kids and treatment not the other side of it it s not free in addition to charities like hope s st jude families have repeatedly turned to fundraising sites and networks of their relatives friends and neighbors to help cover basic expenses while unable to work during their children s treatment parents requests on fundraising sites are sometimes desperate pleas in january 2017 one father in north carolina said he d had to abandon a business venture to take time for his son to receive care at st jude his income had plummeted he asked friends to give as little as 10 to at least make it possible to survive this year a mother in memphis whose 1 year old son receives care at st jude for sickle cell disorder ran out of medical leave and couldn t work her shifts at a clothing distribution center after the child had a flare up in july requiring several days of treatment at the hospital she said she returned home to find her power shut off sitting in a dark apartment unable to pay her utility bills she set up a gofundme campaign she received less than 20 through the site her relatives eventually pooled 350 to get her electricity restored even parents with stable jobs and private health insurance often take on debt and need outside help when taylr and treg murphy s 17 year old son peyton was diagnosed with cancer and needed monthslong treatment at st jude in 2017 the entire family mom dad sister and brother went with him traveling from their home in lafayette louisiana to memphis treg took a leave from his job at an oil mining company and taylr who works at her mother s bakery did the same we knew that it was going to be a collective team effort treg said without even a discussion we figured that if peyton s got to go for the surgery we re all going peyton had an enormous tumor that had grown out of his right femur and was crowding his knee rounds of chemotherapy appeared to have killed osteosarcoma cells elsewhere in his body but he needed to undergo a procedure called limb sparing surgery that would require weeks of recovery time at the hospital the hospital agreed to allow all five family members to stay for free at st jude if they bunked together in a single room it assigned them a spot in tri delta place its hotel like short term patient residence on the campus tri delta is set up for visits of up to seven days according to the hospital s guide for volunteers but the murphys were there for almost 50 taylr said the unit at tri delta had no oven or stove and st jude provided no grocery money instead allotting them a 50 per day credit at the hospital cafeteria kay kafe not enough to feed the family of five as the weeks wore on the murphys split grilled cheese sandwiches and paid for food out of pocket after propublica asked about the hospital s food allowances st jude said it would increase them as part of the changes scheduled to go into effect this month the hospital switched from a 50 a day cap per family to providing 25 a day to each family member for a family of four that would double the food benefit a weekly stipend given to families in long term housing was increased to 150 from 125 for the murphys it was the loss of their work income more than out of pocket expenses that put them into a financial hole as peyton s treatment went on treg s employer couldn t pay him during his long absences fearful of being evicted or having their car repossessed taylr said she asked a st jude social worker for assistance the social worker helped her apply for grants from other charities taylr said the b foundation paid their rent one month which ensured they d have a home to return to in the years since his initial treatment peyton has gone back to st jude repeatedly for exams and surgeries to remove malignant growths in his lungs taylr and treg have missed more work to bring peyton to memphis costing them thousands of dollars more in income by the start of this year taylr and treg said they were about 20 000 in debt and panicking dustin poirier a former ufc champion from their hometown heard from a friend about peyton and the family s financial trouble he donated 10 000 to them from his personal charity and in may hosted a local fundraiser that collected enough to pay off their credit cards st jude families sometimes commiserate about money problems with each other taylr said but few are aware of the extent of the hospital s unspent resources the murphys said they didn t know st jude has more than 5 billion in reserve or that it continues to raise hundreds of millions of dollars in surplus donations each year that s just insane taylr said that just blows my mind when we first started getting treated people would be like oh st jude covers everything that s awesome that s not how it works people don t understand that i truly didn t understand before i got into st jude taylr and treg said the doctors at st jude are amazing and they re grateful for their son s care but they bristled at the assumption that it was covered by the hospital s charity the family s insurance paid a substantial part of the bills it s not free taylr said my husband works very hard for the insurance we have and they are billed the murphys pay 12 000 in health insurance premiums each year their struggle continues peyton s cancer has relapsed and he s making regular trips with his mom or dad back to st jude for chemotherapy the family is again applying for help from other charities wiped out savings the costs associated with care at st jude caused at least one family to stop going to memphis altogether last winter kelly edwards was excitedly searching through tulsa real estate listings after years of diligently saving 10 000 for a down payment on a house she craved a permanent home for herself and the two young brothers she had taken in five years earlier at the behest of a family friend she hoped to adopt the boys now 13 and 9 who call her mom in february the older boy dj was lethargic and uninterested in his schoolwork after several doctor visits he was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia at a tulsa hospital the cancer referred to as all is the most common type among children with survival rates that exceed 90 a day after his diagnosis dj and edwards were driving six hours to memphis for treatment at st jude which is affiliated with the oklahoma hospital the pair stayed for free at an independently operated ronald mcdonald house near st jude and a weekly stipend from the hospital helped to pay for meals aid that edwards said was a blessing dj had health insurance through the oklahoma medicaid program but as with the murphys lost income soon put edwards family into financial jeopardy she works as a supervisor for a company that delivers packages for amazon after she used up two weeks of paid time off she stopped getting paychecks the bills however kept coming rent car payments utilities to that was added the 250 a week she paid a friend to stay with dj s younger brother and her two dogs in tulsa within four months her house savings were wiped out edwards said she told her st jude social worker about her financial woes but got no additional help one of edwards adult daughters started a gofundme campaign to help bringing in just over 3 000 edwards said she appreciated the aid but believes donations were kept low by the widespread perception that st jude families don t have financial problems everyone hears that everything is taken care of by st jude she said that is not true but everyone has that mentality she said someone she knew asked her what is that money going for if st jude s is paying for everything dj was scheduled to go back to st jude for three weeks of treatment in august but edwards decided she simply couldn t afford it i don t have the money to go back and forth she said she worked with dj s local doctors and found that the hospital near her home in tulsa could provide the same treatment he was scheduled to get in tennessee the local treatment allowed her to continue working some shifts and to be at home with both of her boys dj is also happier when he is home edwards said edwards and the boys are now living in a small house her brother owns just outside tulsa late on a recent weekday afternoon dj slowly shuffled into the living room exhausted from a day of chemotherapy treatment he is in the midst of a 20 week regimen where he receives the cancer killing drugs every other day just one phase of a nearly three year treatment plan he wore an orange knit hat t shirt and shorts he rubbed his eyes before asking a visitor how is your day going he smiled at the positive response when he heard the family was eating steak for dinner he eagerly jumped up to start helping in the kitchen after they moved in edwards hung family portraits on the walls to make it feel homier she doesn t expect they will be moving again any time soon the dream of buying a home of their own is gone former propublica reporter

municipal bonds were slightly weaker friday inside 10 years but trading was light and munis still outperformed u s treasuries which weakened further on the day from wednesday s large sell off investors put nearly 2 billion into municipal bond mutual funds for the most recent week with high yield reversing a downward course to hit 1 2 billion following 1 million a week prior according to refinitiv lipper data it was the 36th consecutive week and the largest reported inflows since july and the second largest inflows into high yield in 2021 the focus this week shifted to economic releases with the cpi topping the list and the above projected read led to the bear steepening of ust despite the large u s treasury sell off munis are in much better shape technically than last month said barclays strategists in a friday report ratios have declined meaningfully as a result we suspect municipal yields have some catching up to do to the upside in the near term said mikhail foux clare pickering and mayur patel in a weekly report ratios fell further on friday municipal to treasury ratios were at 50 in five years at 68 in 10 years and 78 in 30 years according to refinitiv mmd s 3 p m read ice data services had the five year at 48 the 10 at 70 and the 30 at 80 given rising investor concern that the fed is falling behind the curve and moving too slowly despite stronger payrolls and inflation data treasury yields have been trending higher and yield curves have been flattening the barclays strategists said while lagging a bit muni curves have also been getting flatter and the long end has finally started performing with the 10s30s curve flattening by about 10 basis points in november they said as investors await the start of tapering and given that the economic data will likely remain strong as the effects of the delta strain abate we could see more flattening of muni curves near term although the long end especially the 20 year part of the curve is far from cheap compared with shorter dated maturities the report said but they said because municipal credit largely managed through the pandemic and most sectors have recovered from it largely befitting from the federal support the market saw this well in advance credit spreads even for high beta credits have fully recovered and are currently trading at or close to their all time tights even the ig hy index differential is near its lows the report said in the taxable space they said municipals have been lagging corporates since the second half of 2020 more so for intermediate bonds as long dated taxables have recovered faster but the muni index is now trading well through the similar maturity corporate index as such we do not see a meaningful selloff in muni credit in the current market environment as municipalities fundamentals remain strong and they are flush with cash however we also do not expect much of a rally from current levels for credit spreads sideways trading is the most likely outcome in our view they said for next week a robust new issue calendar greets investors totaling 9 127 billion of that 2 9 billion is taxable with 6 507 negotiated and 2 619 billion in the

brainard may be chosen to replace him analysts say the difference between the two in terms of monetary policy might be minimal the market seems to be concentrating on the arguably unfounded assumption a brainard fed would result in a slower more accommodative pathway than would a second term powell fed said stifel chief economist lindsey piegza with inflation at the level it s at she said we contend the leadership at the fed would matter less than many anticipate at least in the near term with both candidates likely to maintain the asset reduction pathway previously discussed and moving on to rate hikes by the end of 2022 rising inflation expectations suggests the market is less convinced the fed will move at an appropriate pace to quell the upward momentum the odds of a powell renomination are about 2 to 1 according to luigi speranza chief global economist at bnp paribas markets 360 and his team with brainard given a vice chair role among the benefits of a powell renomination he said are continuity when monetary policy is at a crucial period easier senate confirmation and shields somewhat the white house against republican attacks on inflation with two open spots and possibly more depending on whether powell and vice chair richard clarida are renominated the next fomc is likely to have a more dovish inclination than the current one speranza said but a brainard appointment is likely to give further confidence to the markets that the fed is in no rush to spoil the party while powell would have some support from democrats although sen elizabeth warren strongly opposes another term given her belief his fed has walked backed too much supervision many republicans see brainard as too progressive he said if nominated and confirmed brainard would have to tone down some of positions in an attempt to build consensus in our view but her position would still make a difference at the margin especially in the context of an overall more dovish committee with data will determine the fed s monetary policy path speranza said a brainard appointment would not significantly change the fed s overall policy stance over the next four years however her dovish bias could still make the difference at the margin by making an acceleration of tapering plans less likely and delaying rate liftoff a bit longer in data released friday the university of michigan consumer

right now as the covid 19 pandemic continues and will it be a good buy going forward how did disney stock do before the pandemic disney stock was a big winner for those holding it since 2010 by 2015 the stock had more than quadrupled in price before trading sideways from 2015 to 2019 in 2019 before the covid 19 pandemic struck disney stock had begun another big run gaining over 30 how did the pandemic affect disney stock employees bore much of the initial brunt of the crisis in april 2020 disney announced that it was suspending pay to 100 000 workers or roughly half of the company s global workforce the company shuttered its theme parks on march 14 2020 and its cruise line and entertainment divisions suffered similar lockdowns in its second fiscal quarter disney reported an astonishing 93 drop in revenue disney s stock took a precipitous tumble in 2020 after hitting its all time high to that point of 151 64 on nov 26 2019 disney stock fell as low as 79 07 per share in march of 2020 disney stock as the us economy recovers disney stock is struggling to regain its footing as the economy bounces back from the worst of the pandemic although shares are down almost 16 from a year ago and 13 since the beginning of 2022 they ve rallied over the past month and as of the market close on feb 15 had regained their january loss it should be noted that the overall market has been skittish of late analysts have actually have been impressed by disney s comeback and return to profitability with some such as bank of america upgrading their outlooks considering disney s history and its ubiquitous place in american culture not to mention investors portfolios dips likely represent buying opportunities more than they do red flags for the company s long term prospects what are disney parks and cruise ships like now the parks have reopened and are operating without any significant mandatory covid 19 related restrictions although disney continues to manage capacity for the sake of employee and guest safety according to the company s first earnings release of the new year all of the cruise ships have returned to the sea albeit at reduced capacity late last year christine mccarthy disney senior executive vice president and cfo noted that vacation lead times had been longer due to the pandemic which meant the company wouldn t see substantial recovery in international attendance at u s parks until the end of fiscal 2022 however higher volumes and to a lesser extent guest spending drove growth at u s theme parks and experiences the first quarter 2022 earnings report said income from international parks and resorts also grew all told disney parks experiences and products revenues increased from 3 6 billion in the first quarter of 2021 to 7 2 billion in the first quarter of 2022 there was also good news regarding disney s direct to consumer business which includes its streaming services revenue increased 34 compared to the same quarter last year although operating losses also increased by 27 due to higher programming production marketing and technology costs at disney and higher sports programming costs at espn however disney subscribers grew by 12 million to 129 8 million beating the 125 73 million analysts had predicted according to cnbc the company plans to make disney available in over 50 countries next year and over 160 countries by the fiscal year 2023 is disney stock still a good buy just because disney is a well known popular company doesn t necessarily mean its stock is a good investment many factors go into evaluating whether a stock is a good purchase including market capitalization or the total value of a company s outstanding shares price earnings ratio calculated by dividing a company s share price by its annual earnings future earnings prospects or how much money a company is expected to make going forward company news such as new products or events that might be a catalyst for the stock keep in mind in an effort to

year so far the company hasn t indicated whether it will resume dividends in 2022 in retrospect disney would have been a great buy when it traded at its 52 week low of 129 26 but even at its current 156 35 the stock is considerably lower than its 52 week high of 203 02 and analysts median 12 month forecast of 191 of 29 analysts surveyed by cnn 18 rate the stock a buy one rates it outperform and 10 rate it a hold if you re a believer that disney can achieve its former glory it may still be a good time to buy is disney a good long term stock evaluating stocks over the long term can often be

cells unmodified nk cells genetically modified nk cells and ascs which have resulted in four key cell therapeutic programs cycart 19 cynk 001 cynk 101 and appl 001 focused on six initial indications cycart 19 is a placental derived car t cell therapy in development for the treatment of b cell malignancies initially targeting the cd19 receptor the construct and related cars for which are in licensed from sorrento therapeutics inc sorrento we plan to file an ind in the first quarter of 2022 and commence a phase 1 clinical trial of cycart 19 in the second quarter 2022 cynk 001 is a placental derived unmodified nk cell in development for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia aml a blood cancer and for glioblastoma multiforme gbm a solid tumor cancer cynk 001 is currently in phase 1 trial for aml and other blood cancers and phase 1 2a trial for gbm we also plan to submit an ind in 2021 for a genetically modified version of a placental derived nk cell cynk 101 cynk 101 will be evaluated in combination with a monoclonal antibody mab to target her2 cancers such as gastric cancer appl 001 is a placenta derived asc being developed for the treatment of crohn s disease a degenerative disease we intend to submit the ind in the first half of 2022 and commence the phase 1 2a study of appl 001 for the treatment of crohn s disease in 2022 our impact manufacturing process is a seamless fully integrated process that is built to optimize speed and scale from sourcing of human full term healthy postpartum donated placentas through proprietary processing methods cell selection product specific 33 chemistry manufacturing and controls cmc advanced cell manufacturing and cryopreservation the result of which is a suite of allogeneic inventory ready and on demand placental derived cell therapy products since inception we have had significant operating losses we had a net loss of 96 1 million and 208 2 million for the nine months ended september 30 2021 and year ended december 31 2020 respectively we had an accumulated deficit of 659 6 million at september 30 2021 our primary use of cash is to fund operations which consist primarily of research and development expenses and to a lesser extent selling general and administrative expenses cash used to fund operating expenses is impacted by the timing of when it pays these expenses as reflected in the change in our outstanding accounts payable and accrued expenses we expect to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future and expect our research and development expenses selling general and administrative expenses and capital expenditures will continue to increase in particular we expect our expenses and losses to increase as we continue development of and seek regulatory approvals for our therapeutic candidates and begin to commercialize any approved therapeutics as well as hire additional personnel develop commercial infrastructure for therapeutics pay fees to outside consultants lawyers and accountants and incur increased costs associated with being a public company such as expenses related to services associated with maintaining compliance with nasdaq listing rules and sec requirements insurance and investor relations costs our net losses may fluctuate significantly depending on the timing of our clinical trials and our expenditures on other research and development activities based upon our current operating plan we do not believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents as of september 30 2021 will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through the next twelve months to date we have not had any cellular therapeutics approved for sale and have not generated any revenues from the sale of our cellular therapeutics we generate limited revenues from our biobanking and degenerative disease businesses we do not expect to generate any revenues from cellular therapeutic product sales unless and until we successfully complete development and obtain regulatory approval for one or more of our therapeutic candidates which we expect will take a number of years if we obtain regulatory approval for any of our therapeutic candidates we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to therapeutic sales marketing manufacturing and distribution as our current commercialization efforts are limited to our biobanking and degenerative disease businesses as a result until such time if ever as we can generate substantial revenue from therapeutics we expect to finance our cash needs through equity offerings debt financings or other capital sources including potentially collaborations licenses and other similar arrangements however we may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other arrangements when needed on favorable terms or at all any failure to raise capital as and when needed could have a negative impact on our financial condition and on our ability to pursue our business plans and strategies if we are unable to raise capital we will need to delay reduce or terminate planned activities to reduce costs covid 19 pandemic the covid 19 pandemic has resulted in increased unemployment commodity and stock market volatility and uncertainty about conditions that will prevail in the months ahead the extent of the ultimate impact of the pandemic on our operational and financial performance will depend on various developments including the duration and spread of the outbreak and its impact on potential customers employees and vendors all of which cannot be reasonably predicted at this time should this emerging macro economic risk continue for an extended period there could be an adverse material impact to our financial condition operating results and timing and amounts of cash flows although we were able to operate continuously throughout 2020 we implemented work from home policies as needed following local health recommendations for non essential employees and employees whose roles are able to be performed remotely management of remote workers can present special challenges and productivity may not be as high for remote workers because certain elements of our operations such as processing placental tissue certain biological assays translational research and storage of cord blood cannot be performed remotely it instituted controls and protocols including mandatory temperature checking symptom assessment forms incremental cleaning and sanitization of common surfaces to mitigate risks to employees although we have not experienced any material disruption to date there can be no assurance that our mitigation measures will continue to be effective and that there will not be a disruption to an important element of our business in the future due to a broad decline in economic activity and restrictions on physical access to certain medical facilities we did experience a decrease in the net revenues of our degenerative disease business due to the pandemic selling general and administrative expenses also decreased due to lower commercial expenses in the areas of business impacted by covid 19 restrictions as for clinical trials we did not cancel or postpone enrollment solely due to the risks of covid 19 however enrollment in the clinical trial evaluating cynk 001 for aml experienced some delays in the first half of 2020 as sites assessed their safety protocols and experienced high volumes of covid 19 patients enrollment has continued in the aml trial and remains ongoing as of the date of this quarterly report as a result we had a year over year increase in research and development expenses in 2020 notwithstanding the enrollment delays we also initiated a clinical trial evaluating cynk 001 in patients with covid 19 which necessitated additional research and development and project management resources a portion of which will be reimbursed from lung biotechnology pbc we believe that we would have deployed our human and capital resources to other efforts such as our cycart 19 clinical development program had the covid 19 pandemic not struck covid 19 did not have a material negative impact on oncology clinical trial patient accrual rates during the first nine months of 2021 however screenings and enrollments in the covid 19 trial were lower once vaccines became more widely available through 34 the third quarter of 2021 we continued to utilize mandatory temperature checking and symptom assessment forms and commencing with the third quarter of 2021 instituted additional safety protocols for unvaccinated employees we also utilized a liaison to help schedule vaccination appointments for employees the extent to which covid 19 or any other health epidemic may impact our results will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted including new information that may emerge concerning the severity of covid 19 and the actions to contain covid 19 or treat its impact among others accordingly covid 19 could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and prospects business segments prior to the third quarter of 2020 we managed our operations as one segment in the third quarter of 2020 we began to manage our operations through an evaluation of three distinct business segments cell therapy degenerative disease and biobanking the reportable segments were determined based on the distinct nature of the activities performed by each segment cell therapy broadly refers to cellular therapies we are researching and developing which are unproven and in various phases of development all of the cell therapy programs fall into the cell therapy segment we have no approved cell therapy product and have not generated revenue from the sale of cellular therapies to date degenerative disease produces sells and licenses products used in surgical and wound care markets such as biovance and interfyl we sell products in this segment both using our own sales force as well as independent distributors we are developing additional tissue based products for the degenerative disease segment biobanking collects stem cells from umbilical cords and placentas and provides storage of such cells on behalf of individuals for future use we operate in the biobanking business primarily under the lifebankusa brand for more information about our reportable business segments refer to note 18 segment reporting of our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial

the following acquisitions can be found in note 1 nature of business and basis of presentation to our annual financial statements for the year ended december 31 2020 included in the prospectus human longevity in may 2017 we acquired hli cellular therapeutics llc hli ct from human longevity inc human longevity hli ct operated lifebankusa a private umbilical cord blood stem cell and cord tissue bank that offers parents the option to collect process and cryogenically preserve newborn umbilical cord blood stem cells and cord tissue units the hli ct acquisition also provided us with rights to a portfolio of biomaterial assets including biovance and interfyl as well other assets that we are no longer pursuing in aggregate the fair value of the consideration to acquire hli ct was 28 9 million the acquisition led to goodwill and intangible assets including in process research and development ipr d and a licensing agreement at the time of the hli ct acquisition biovance and interfyl were subject to an exclusive distribution arrangement with alliqua biomedical inc alliqua in may 2018 we acquired certain assets from alliqua including alliqua s biologic wound care business which included the marketing and distribution rights to biovance and interfyl as well as a class ii medical device the mist and ultramist therapy systems in connection with the alliqua apa we paid cash consideration of 29 0 million the alliqua acquisition led to goodwill and intangible assets in august 2020 we sold the assets comprising our mist ultramist business to sanuwave health inc sanuwave and entered into a five year licensing agreement with sanuwave for total consideration of 24 5 million of which 20 0 million was paid at or prior to closing the remaining 4 5 million of the purchase price was financed through a convertible promissory note due on or before august 6 2021 the convertible promissory note can be converted into common shares of sanuwave stock at our election any time on or after january 1 2021 the five year licensing arrangement with sanuwave includes i an exclusive biovance license for distribution and commercialization in the wound care market and ii a non exclusive license for the distribution and commercialization of interfyl in the wound care market under the licensing agreement we receive a quarterly license fee and a defined royalty on each product sale a credit is provided to sanuwave for biovance royalties up to the quarterly license fee during the third quarter of 2021 the license arrangement with sanuwave was terminated due to an uncured material breach anthrogenesis in august 2017 we acquired anthrogenesis a wholly owned subsidiary of celgene the anthrogenesis acquisition included a portfolio of pre clinical and clinical stage assets including key cellular therapeutic assets that we continue to develop the anthrogenesis acquisition gives us access to anthrogenesis proprietary technologies and processes for the recovery of large quantities of high potential stem cells and cellular therapeutic products derived from postpartum human placentas each an anthrogenesis product as part of 35 the anthrogenesis acquisition some of the inventors of the anthrogenesis products and other key members of the anthrogenesis product development team joined us in aggregate the fair value of the consideration to acquire anthrogenesis was 346 4 million the acquisition led to goodwill and intangible assets including ipr d and a licensing agreement and contingent value rights cvr agreement see licensing agreements below caricord in october 2018 we acquired caricord inc caricord a family cord blood bank established by clinimmune labs university of colorado cord blood bank and the regents of the university of colorado a body corporate for and on

annual financial statements for the year ended december 31 2020 included in the prospectus sorrento in september 2020 we entered into a license and transfer agreement the sorrento agreement with sorrento therapeutics inc sorrento henry ji ph d a member of legacy celularity s board of directors currently serves as president and chief executive officer of sorrento sorrento is also a significant stockholder of ours and invested in the pipe pursuant to the sorrento agreement we obtained a worldwide license with the right to grant sublicenses with sorrento s consent under certain of sorrento s

cd19 car construct licensed from sorrento forms the basis of the genetic modification for cycart 19 under the sorrento agreement we have sole responsibility for the development and commercialization of licensed products subject to certain reserved rights of sorrento with respect to cd19 car t therapeutics additionally we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize licensed products under the sorrento agreement we are obligated to pay sorrento a low double digit percentage of non royalty sublicensing income payments received in connection with a grant of any sublicense for cd19 car t licensed products additionally we are obligated to pay sorrento a low single digit royalty on net sales of cd19 car t licensed products in perpetuity we are currently in the process of negotiating a supply agreement with sorrento for the manufacturing and supply of the cd19 car construct licensed from sorrento celgene now part of bristol myers squibb in august 2017 in connection with the anthrogenesis acquisition we entered into a license agreement the celgene license with celgene which has since been acquired by bristol meyers squibb pursuant to the celgene license we granted celgene a worldwide royalty free fully paid up non exclusive license without the right to grant sublicenses other than to its affiliates under anthrogenesis intellectual property in existence as of the date of the celgene license or as developed by celgene in connection with any transition services activities related to the merger for non commercial pre clinical research purposes as well as to develop manufacture commercialize and fully exploit products and services that relate to the construction of any car the modification of any t cell or nk cell to express such a car and or the use of such cars or t cells or nk cells for any purpose which commercial license is sublicensable either party may terminate the celgene license upon an uncured material breach of the agreement by the other party or insolvency of the other party in august 2017 legacy celularity also issued shares of its series x preferred stock to celgene as merger consideration and entered into a contingent value rights agreement the cvr agreement with celgene pursuant to which legacy celularity issued one cvr in respect of each share of legacy celularity series x preferred stock issued to celgene in connection with the anthrogenesis acquisition the cvr agreement entitles the holders of the cvrs to an aggregate amount on a per program basis of 50 million in regulatory milestones and an aggregate 125 million in commercial milestone payments with respect to certain of our investigational therapeutic programs which would include the current cynk 001 and cynk 101 pipeline candidates and the legacy pda 001 and pda 002 programs certain placenta derived adherent cells proprietary to anthrogenesis that are formulated for intravenous delivery with respect to pda 001 and subcutaneous or intramuscular delivery with respect to pda 002 that are no longer in development 36 such payments under the cvr agreement also expressly cover pnk 007 which includes certain nk cells proprietary to anthrogenesis produced by a process proprietary to anthrogenesis as of the closing of the anthrogenesis transaction and certain pnk 007 cells with a genetic modification but not including nk cells with a chimeric receptor including a car along with any derivatives parts subparts or progeny of any of the foregoing or any therapeutic based or derived in whole or in part on certain related development programs as they existed as of the closing of the anthrogenesis transaction accordingly as we expand our nk cell type franchise into new indications and as a general matter because these payments are not payable until a later stage of development we expect to continue to evaluate our present and future therapeutic candidates as they develop and evolve in light of the specific terms in the cvr agreement to determine the specific therapeutics on which such amounts will be payable in addition with respect to each such program and calendar year the cvr holders will be entitled to receive a royalty equal to a mid teen percentage of the annual net sales for such program s therapeutics from the date of the first commercial sale of such program s therapeutic in a particular country until the latest to occur of the expiration of the last to expire of any valid patent claim covering such program therapeutic in such country the expiration of marketing exclusivity with respect to such therapeutic in such country and august 2027 i e the tenth anniversary of the closing of the acquisition of anthrogenesis no payments under the cvr agreement have been made to date we estimate the liability associated with the cvr quarterly changes to that liability include but are not limited to changes in our clinical programs assumptions about the commercial value of those programs and the time value of money components of operating results net revenues net revenues include i sales of human cells tissues and cellular and tissue based products hct p s including biovance biovance 3l interfyl and mist ultramist therapy system equipment and single use applicators collectively product sales and rentals ii the collection processing and storage of umbilical cord and placental blood and tissue after full term pregnancies collectively services and iii license fees and royalties received under the license agreement with sanuwave as well as license fees received under the exclusive distribution arrangement with alliqua biomedical inc alliqua prior to our acquisition of alliqua s biologic wound care business in may 2018 collectively license royalty and other mist ultramist revenues are only included within 2020 as the business was divested in august 2020 cost of goods sold cost of goods sold consists of labor material and overhead costs associated with our two existing commercial business segments biobanking and degenerative disease biobanking costs include the cost of storage and transportation kits for newly banked materials as well as tank and facility overhead costs for cord blood and other units in storage degenerative disease costs include costs associated with procuring placentas qualifying the placental material and processing the placental tissue into a marketable product costs in the degenerative disease segment include labor and overhead costs associated with the production of the biovance biovance 3l and interfyl product lines research and development expense our research and development expenses primarily relate to basic scientific research into placentally derived allogeneic cells pre clinical studies to support our current and future clinical programs in cellular medicine clinical development of our nk cell programs and facilities depreciation and other direct and allocated expenses incurred as a result of research and development activities we incur expenses for third party contract research organizations cros that assist in running clinical trials personnel expenses for research scientists specialized chemicals and reagents used to conduct biologic research expense for third party testing and validation and various overhead expenses including rent and facility maintenance expense basic research research collaborations involving partners and research designed to enable successful regulatory submissions is critical to our current and future success in cell therapy we anticipate that our research and development expenditures will increase as we engage in further clinical trials investigate incremental car constructs for our allogeneic t cell and nk cell platforms and conduct further pre clinical studies on cynk 101 in conjunction with various antibody candidates the amount of increase will depend on numerous factors including the timing of clinical trials preliminary evidence of efficacy in clinical trials and the number of indications that we choose to pursue general and administrative expense general and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel costs including salaries bonuses stock compensation and benefits for specialized staff that support our core business operations executive management finance legal human resources and information technology are key components of general and administrative expense and those expenses are recognized when incurred we expect that as we engage in more clinical trials and potentially prepares for commercialization of any approved therapies that our general and administrative costs will increase over time the magnitude and timing of any increase in general and administrative expense will depend on the progress of clinical trials the release of new products within the degenerative disease portfolio changes in the regulatory environment or incremental staffing needs to support the growth of the business as well as any incremental expenses associated with being a public company 37 change in fair value of contingent consideration liability because the acquisitions of anthrogenesis from celgene and hli ct from human longevity were accounted for as business combinations we recognized acquisition related contingent consideration on the balance sheet in accordance with the acquisition method of accounting see acquisitions and divestitures for more information the fair value of contingent consideration liability is determined based on a probability weighted income approach derived from revenue estimates and a probability assessment with respect to the likelihood of achieving regulatory and commercial milestone obligations and royalty obligations the fair value of acquisition related contingent consideration is remeasured each reporting period with changes in fair value recorded in the consolidated statement of operations changes in contingent consideration fair value estimates result in an increase or decrease in our contingent consideration obligation and a corresponding charge or reduction to operating results key elements of the contingent consideration are regulatory milestone payments sales milestone payments and royalty payments regulatory payments are due on regulatory approval of certain cell types in the united states and the european union regulatory milestone payments are one time but are due prior to any potential commercial success of a cell type in a specific indication royalty payments are a percentage of net sales sales milestone payments are due when certain aggregate sales thresholds have been met management must use substantial judgement in evaluating the value of the contingent consideration estimates used by management include but are not limited to i the number and type of clinical programs that we are likely to pursue based on the quality of our preclinical data ii the time required to conduct clinical trials iii the odds of regulatory success in those trials iv the potential number of patients treatable for the indications in which we are successful and v the pricing of treatments that achieve commercial status all of these areas involve substantial judgement on the part of management and are inherently uncertain results of operations comparison of three months ended september 30 2021 to september 30 2020 three

r1t truck make rivian segment sports car the owners at rivian will likely be having a massive party this weekend following an epic debut on the nasdaq rivian s original ipo was set at 77 billion putting it in the same league as ford and gm as it turned out the initial price per share was 78 increasing to 116 that means the company ended up with a valuation of 95 billion to put that in context it s the sixth highest valuation in us history rivian is now worth the same as companies like 3m and lockheed martin and worth more than ford and gm rivian s customers will also be celebrating this weekend as the ev manufacturer set a chunk of shares to the side for its customers close amazon which owns around 20 of rivian will also welcome the good news amazon initially signed on so rivian could produce 10 000 ev delivery vans the extra bit of cash means jeff bezos can afford to go to space twice in 2022 not everyone was happy however elon musk threw some subtle shade by tweeting tesla is the only american carmaker to reach high volume production positive cash flow in past 100 years musk has made it quite apparent that he doesn t see a future for rivian which is hardly surprising considering the two companies are currently busy with an extensive legal battle it could also just be sour grapes considering that rivian is the first manufacturer in automotive history to produce an electric pickup successfully at the same time the cybertruck remains nothing but an empty promise with no clear introduction date close to be fair tesla is hardly struggling it made the news recently by hitting a trillion dollar valuation which puts it quite a few steps above rivian ceo elon musk made the news again last week after asking his 63 million twitter followers whether he should sell 10 of his stock tesla shares fell by 16 but made a recovery the sale did indeed go through netting musk 5 billion musk is paid in stock options and the last time he cashed out was 2016 when he sold 600 million worth of stock it will be interesting to see how this battle plays out going forward the original ev success story versus the new guy on the block that happens to have the backing of amazon and ford it s not difficult to figure out why so many people bought into rivian the r1t has been receiving rave reviews and rivian wants to produce 100 000 units before the end of the year this success comes despite rivian losing vast amounts of cash in recent years which was discovered in the paperwork rivian had to file in order to go public

washington president biden on friday chose dr robert califf a former food and drug administration commissioner and prominent medical researcher to again lead the powerful regulatory agency califf s nomination comes after months of concern that the agency near the center of the government s covid 19 response has lacked a permanent leader more than a half dozen names were floated for the job before the white house decided on califf a cardiologist and clinical trial specialist califf 70 served as fda commissioner for the last 11 months of president barack obama s second term before that he spent one year as the agency s no 2 official after more than 35 years as a researcher at duke university where he helped design studies for many of the world s biggest drugmakers califf faced some concerns over his drug industry connections in 2016 but he was ultimately confirmed by an overwhelming 89 4 senate vote since leaving government he has worked as a policy adviser to tech giant google in addition to his ongoing academic work at duke as the fda considers many consequential decisions around vaccine approvals and more it is mission critical that we have a steady independent hand to guide the fda biden said in a statement announcing his decision advertisement if confirmed by the senate califf would oversee decisions on covid 19 vaccines along with a raft of other knotty issues including the regulation of electronic cigarettes and effectiveness standards for prescription drugs he would be the first fda commissioner since the 1940s to return for a second stint leading the agency rob is a relatively safe choice because he is known in washington and is widely respected said wayne pines a former fda associate commissioner who has helped several commissioners through the confirmation process he will have broad support from fda stakeholders the fda regulates the vaccines drugs and tests used to combat covid 19 that s on top of its normal duties regulating a swath of consumer goods and medicines including prescription drugs medical devices tobacco products cosmetics and most foods dr janet woodcock the agency s longtime drug director has been serving as acting commissioner since january for months she was expected to be tapped for the permanent post but her nomination ran into pushback from key democratic lawmakers including sen joe manchin of west virginia over the handling of opioid prescription painkillers during her 30 plus years at the agency the white house faced a legal deadline of mid november to nominate a permanent commissioner or name another acting commissioner califf arrived at the fda in 2015 determined to modernize how the agency reviewed drug and device study data but his brief time as commissioner was dominated by unrelated pharmaceutical controversies including surging opioid addiction and overdoses advertisement he was among the first fda officials to publicly acknowledge missteps in the agency s oversight of painkillers including oxycontin which is widely blamed for sparking the ongoing opioid epidemic now driven by heroin and fentanyl if addiction to opioids and misuse of opioids is an enemy then we at the fda like every other part of society underestimated the tenacity of the enemy califf told the associated press in a 2016 interview so we ve got to adjust despite those sentiments manchin said in a statement friday that he opposes califf s nomination calling for a change in the culture at the fda dr califf s nomination and his significant ties to the pharmaceutical industry take us backwards not forward said manchin who was one of just four senators who voted against his confirmation in 2016 the white house foresaw no problems when asked about manchin s opposition to califf we feel he s a qualified person who has the exact experience for this moment press secretary jen psaki said friday advertisement the powerful pharmaceutical and medical device lobbying groups issued strong statements of support friday as did a number of physician and patient groups califf has worked as a consultant for major drugmakers including eli lilly and merck co and he sits on the board of two smaller biotech companies federal ethics rules do not require government officials to sell all their investments but they must recuse themselves from matters that could affect those investments as part of the vetting process fda nominees typically disclose and sell stocks funds and other investments that could pose a financial conflict of interest fda watchers said califf had several key advantages over other candidates vetted for the job several of whom would have faced more scrutiny in the senate he knows how the fda works and he avoided making any outrageous decisions as commissioner said diana zuckerman of the nonprofit national center for health research those are essential if the fda is going to regain the public trust his first tasks would include easing burnout

with joe biden in conspicuous decline the need for a qualified vice president waiting in the wings is critical yet kamala harris is totally unfit for the presidency a dilemma that puts the united states in an awful bind less than a year in office vice president kamala harris the highest ranking female official in us history has already shattered some political records but none that would merit much celebration unless you happen to be a republican this week a survey taken by usa today suffolk university showed that just 28 of americans approved of harris and whatever the heck she s doing in the white house not only did harris manage to underperform her doddering boss joe biden but she even bested dick cheney one of the most loathsome creatures to have ever emerged from the fetid swamp read more president biden s approval rating tumbles vp harris does even worse to put this achievement into its proper perspective harris managed to fare worse in a popularity contest against the man who manipulated us intelligence to start the hugely unpopular 2003 invasion of iraq not done there cheney beefed up his evil portfolio through his connections to halliburton the company that the bush administration contracted to rebuild iraq s destroyed oil infrastructure and where cheney served as ceo from 1995 to 2000 he said he donated any profits he made from his halliburton stock to charity and let s not even get started on the darklord and his role in waterboarding detainees abroad and spying on americans at home in other words sidelining dick cheney as the most unpopular vice president was a herculean feat yet kamala harris managed to pull it off with relative ease the question is how the short answer is that kamala harris has no business being anywhere near the white house not to mention the hallowed oval office not only does this woman shirk from the most obvious tasks like paying a visit to the us mexico border at the peak of a migrant crisis only after donald trump announced his own visit was she prompted to pack her bags she lacks the necessary people skills to even sit down for a chat with children without looking more plastic than a lego factory yet there she is one biden heartbeat or two away from one of the most powerful political offices in the world harris conforms wonderfully with the dictates of these radical woke times where politicians are judged less by their personal talents and accomplishments than by their identity less by the size of their intellect than the color of their skin us politics which once upon a time was built on the rock of personal merit has been reduced to a box ticking exercise that is increasingly willing to substitute raw political talent with pretenders that s not to say of course that just because a politician ticks all of the correct boxes that they are automatically inferior and unworthy of public office tulsi gabbard for example a samoan american hindu from hawaii comes off as a highly qualified candidate with strong leadership skills she is someone i would have enthusiastically endorsed had the media gatekeepers not disappeared her while gabbard fulfilled all of the necessary diversity requirements the former member of the us army failed to tick the box for pro war that is a character flaw that makes her prospects for attaining high office in the current political climate about as easy as ascending mount everest the democrats were betting that kamala harris the wrong woman of color at probably the right time would appeal to the damaged sensitivities of the american people traumatized as many were by the lurid murder of george floyd in may 2020 by a white police officer that tragedy followed up with months of black lives matter protests just before the biden trump showdown ingrained in the public mind the media fueled narrative that not only the us but its police forces suffer from a malignancy known as systemic racism some may argue that biden had made the right decision by choosing harris as his running mate since the duo went on to defeat donald trump and mike pence in the 2020 presidential election presently however it looks as though the democratic party has suffered a pyrrhic victory with the biden harris tag team and one that may have set the party back light years the democrats blatantly ignored a serious consideration when they paired harris with biden and that was the former s conspicuous unpopularity amid a large field of democratic presidential candidates harris was forced to withdraw early from the race with a public approval rating below 4 did the democrats think that those harsh public sentiments would somehow magically disappear because harris is a female who comes from a mixed racial background and us inner cities had been burning coast to coast today harris appears to be no more popular among her colleagues who have complained that they toil in an abusive environment and are treated like s t than she was with democratic voters just over a year ago the takeaway here is that the voting public aside from a radicalized minority are not really interested whether a candidate is black brown white or polka dot what they are mostly concerned about is whether the individual is qualified to represent their interests once they have been elected to office had the democrats used a scale based on merit as opposed to identity when choosing a running mate for old joe biden they would be much more prepared to face the severe political challenges quickly approaching instead the democratic party is breaking under the pressure of a president and vice president who are beyond the help of their best handlers while becoming actual liabilities disaster is fast approaching for the democrats and liberals who just like their counterparts in the world of academia have forsaken the necessity of merit and excellence for the self limiting dead end road known as identity politics rt com
