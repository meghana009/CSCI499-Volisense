vision jon lewis is turning capita into a high tech outsourcer jon lewis looks pained as he describes the mess capita was in when he joined five years ago branded the turnaround king lewis was parachuted in to clean up the bloated government contractor which he says spent too long indiscriminately buying other firms and racking up debt while continuing to pay handsome dividends to shareholders he was most shocked by the toll that years of neglect and underinvestment had taken we didn t even have cyber security on some of our pcs says lewis 60 wincing at the memory of its creaking infrastructure the public may wince too capita s work includes everything from collecting the bbc licence fee and london s congestion charge to running army recruitment many in both the city and whitehall were at the time convinced capita was a lost cause as rival carillion would later become lewis back then embarking on his fourth turnaround and arriving after a series of profit warnings says he had not fully realised the scale of the task he is far more chipper now in his first interview since the very very challenging restructuring finished last year his sense of relief is palpable after admitting the outcome could have been very different let s remember this is a business that is integral to the fabric of the uk the welshman says that may sound like a grandiose statement but we engage with 50 per cent of the population of this country in some way or form virtually every week we collectively as a board and as a leadership team have saved the company so that we can continue to do that and do it better than we ve ever done it before since arriving in late 2017 he has sold off large chunks of the business and strived to position capita as a high tech firm away from staples like traditional call centres and into artificial intelligence and running chatbots for the likes of firms such as o2 a recent royal navy contract handed capita the task of modernising whole training systems that included simulation technology in the process he has slashed capita s own staff numbers from 73 000 to 52 000 and reduced debt to more manageable levels but it s the change in culture at the group that for him is the real transformation part of this stems from setting up a consulting division which he now compares to businesses such as accenture he has also overhauled the way capita deals with clients he says in the past we would decide which then bid for them the group would then deliver the contract and not one iota more we didn t manage relationships with our clients in the way that other businesses or big four professional services firms might there were no partners that would own that relationship he insists things have moved on and is mystified why capita is still compared with the likes of serco and mitie rather than a rival to deloitte digital accenture and infosys the reality seems to be that its reputation and an unfortunately crude nickname crapita may take more time to shift did they think about renaming and rebranding the group yes he says but this was quickly dismissed when their research found that clients didn t have a problem with it when we started this transformation five years ago if you d done a google search on crapita you d get quite a few hits you get far fewer hits today he offers if you d done a google search on crapita you d get quite a few hits you get far fewer hits today but he adds the way to addressing that is not through some superficial change of company name that s just putting lipstick on it for all lewis s enthusiasm how ever the share price has remained stubbornly low at 25p the group is worth around 430million a fraction of its former value and significantly less than the 97p at the time of 2018 s 700million emergency rights issue that lewis launched to help stem losses he responds simply that it has been a very challenging time for investors but he rattles off a list of things he still wants to do growing the group s business divisions at the rate of the markets they each serve and erasing capita s debt at that point one may pause and say is it time to go off and do something else but we are not there yet when do you think you will be well i can t give a timeframe on all that he is optimistic that its stock will hit the pre rights issue price in the next year or two whether the market will be convinced is another matter lewis perhaps not surprisingly for someone rejuvenating the business as a consultancy has a habit of speaking in the jargony language used by many bosses he uses the word transformation on repeat and admits he s most likely to be found saying the phrase are we delighting that customer around the office that and his fathomless enthusiasm is perhaps partly explained by the 20 years he spent working in america a geologist by training he spent two decades at us oil services behemoth halliburton his time there came to a bruising end when he was passed over for the top job a career low point he says i was on the succession plan there for many years he says there were six of us then five then three and then two i got to the two i didn t get to the one and had devoted years of my life to the belief that at some stage i would be ceo of that company when that kind of prospect is dangled in front of you you pretty much give your life to that company now he seems to have found peace at home as well as relatively speaking at least at work raised in south wales lewis went to a local comprehensive where he met his wife of 37 years he arrived at capita via a short stint at another oil services group amec foster wheeler his family now live in a vicarage in the same village that he grew up in and where he is devoting much of his spare time to redoing the garden i bump into people i was in infant school with i bump into people from my comprehensive school and it s nice to have those connections still they don t know what the hell i do it s kind of grounding actually i ve come home really and i love it

today baku is most well known for being the capital of the azerbaijan republic thousands of tourists every year flock to baku to visit the walled city of baku and the palace of the shirvanshahs and its maiden tower as tourists walk the ancient streets today and take in the sights they re probably unaware that from the 12th century bc until well into the 20th century baku was in a near constant state of bloody turmoil few cities have been put through the wringer as many times as the walled city of baku the walled city of baku s ancient origins when we talk about the walled city of baku what we re referring to is the very center of modern baku its historic core the walled city is the oldest part of baku and is surrounded by the walls that have been used to protect it for hundreds of years the walled city has been around for almost a thousand years and has survived many many regime changes and several foreign invasions this makes the city s survival record incredibly impressive most historians interested in the area agree that the walled city of baku as we know it today dates back to around the 12th century ad it was around this time that the process of heavily fortifying the city began it was around this time that the maiden tower the ramana nardaran shagan mardakan and sabayil castles were built why all the fortification because baku had a habit of coming under assault prior to the 10th century baku was repeatedly attacked by the khazars a semi nomadic turkic people dating back to the 6th century ad from the 10th century the rus another medieval people began raids on baku as well these attacks were put to an end when shirvanshah i built a huge navy in the baku harbor and repelled one last massive rus assault in 1170 after a huge earthquake struck shamaky in 1191 shirvanshah s court moved to baku in 1191 shirvanshah was all too aware of baku s history of being invaded by its neighbors he soon got to work fortifying the city and building a mint this work continued long after his death and between the 12th and 14th centuries baku saw a massive increase in fortifications this was somewhat of a golden period for the walled city of baku by the 14th century muhammad oljeitu was in charge he lowered the heavy taxes that the city had previously been under and this led to prosperity and growth baku had soon made a name for itself as a major port of trade even marco polo wrote of baku oil exports during this period the city was known to trade with the golden horde the moscow princedom and european countries the shirvan era greatly influenced baku with massive fortifications including legendary sabayil castle the maiden tower and the city walls were rebuilt and strengthened relics found among the ruins of sabayil castle walter callens cc by 2 0 as would become a common theme in regard to the walled city of baku it soon became a victim of its own success the city had become famous for its wealth and strategic position on the caspian sea baku soon caught the eye of king ismail i the leader of the newly formed safavid dynasty based in modern day iran and in 1501 he and his army laid siege after nearly three hundred years of relative peace baku was back to being invaded of course baku s inhabitants resisted they d spent over 200 years fortifying the city and believed their mighty walls would protect them they were wrong their plan worked until ismail ordered his men to undermine the walls and the city s defenses soon fell the city soon followed suit and many of its inhabitants were put to the sword by ismail and his men ismail initially allowed the shirvanshahs to stay in baku under his watchful eye and safavid rule his successor tahmasp i wasn t so generous however he altogether removed the shirvanshahs from power permanently in doing so the house of shirvan was effectively destroyed and never recovered during the 1578 1590 ottoman safavid war depicted here from a palace of the shirvanshahs painting the ottomans were the victors and one of their prizes was baku this victory was somewhat short lived and by 1607 baku was back under iranian control rita willaert cc by nc 2 0 back and forth russia and persia fight for baku for the most part baku remained under the rule of successive iranian dynasties until the russian empire officially took over in 1813 with the treaty of gulistan however this was not a peaceful period for baku the persians would repeatedly lose control over baku in the coming years baku s population would never get a chance to grow beyond a tiny 5 000 and constant warfare took a huge toll on the once bustling economy war returned to baku during the 1578 1590 ottoman safavid war the ottomans were the victors and one of their prizes was baku this victory was somewhat short lived and by 1607 baku was back under iranian control then in 1722 the safavids lost power back home in iran peter the great in russia saw his chance and went in and invaded the safavids who were in total disarray didn t stand a chance and ceded baku to the russian empire this was also a short lived victory peter had over reached and by 1730 russia was struggling on the 10th of march 1735 russia signed the treaty of ganja giving iran back basically every territory they d lost to russia including the walled city of baku the russians returned once again in 1796 under catherine ii the russians sent in 13 000 men and the city was quickly overwhelmed and taken with little resistance this is probably baku s shortest occupation lasting only a year in 1797 russia s new emperor paul i ordered an end to the russian persian hostilities and the russians abandoned baku gifting it back to the persians sadly this wasn t the end of baku s turmoil russia and persia were soon back at war and the result of the 1804 1813 russo persian war was the treaty of gulistan within which the persians handed baku back to the russians shockingly this isn t the end of the story there was another brief russo persian war between 1826 and 1828 during this war the iranians briefly recaptured baku however once again they ended up losing to russia and the 1828 treaty of turkmenchay officially made baku a permanent part of russia baku city s prosperous neftchiler avenue circa 1920 shows how the walled city of baku took to modern european architecture paid for by oil wealth from the 1830s onward ariel varges public domain the walled city of baku under russian rule one can only think that for several hundred years it must have been hard for the residents of baku to know if they were coming or going with their rulers seemingly changing every five minutes from 1828 onward baku entered a period of peace and relative stability in 1828 the population reached around 7000 and the walled city was home to around 700 homes and 700 shops between 1807 and 1811 the new russian rulers worked on repairing and extending the city s fortifications furthermore dozens of cannons were placed on the walls sending the message that the russians were there to stay as the constant warfare finally came to an end prosperity also returned and the people of baku could finally focus once again on what they were good at trade the port was reopened and in 1809 a customs office was built baku was back in business soon the walled city outgrew its walls and new neighborhoods were built outside its storied walls it is around this time baku was split into the inner city and outer city those who lived in the inner city considered themselves true natives of baku and tended to look down on those who dwelled outside the walls evidence of baku s change in fortunes soon began to show as money came into the city the architecture began to change some of the traditional persian architecture was replaced with european architecture of the gothic and baroque styles as you wander the streets of the walled city of baku today its history is clearly evident in its architecture oil workers digging an oil well by hand in the bibi heybat suburb of baku city in 1846 public domain baku s black gold petroleum wells dug by hand baku s growth kicked into overdrive during the 19th century with the discovery of oil in baku the digging for petroleum began with hand dug wells in the 1830s and 1840s and by 1946 baku had its first mechanical oil well in 1972 russian authorities started selling off pieces of oil rich baku land to private investors big names soon began to appear the nobel brothers started an operation in baku in 1873 which was soon followed by the infamous rothschilds in 1882 it turned out baku was swimming in black gold as the 18th century rolled into the 20th half of all oil sold internationally came from baku oil wells oil brought money and money brought massive expansion whilst the walled city couldn t grow the outer city s population grew at a faster rate than that of london paris or new york this newfound prosperity does not mean baku was safe from bloodshed however baku s bloodiest period yet was just around the corner violence would come to baku several more times before the fall of the ussr in 1991 in 1905 russia was hit with massive political unrest as working class russians rose up against the tsar nobility and the russian ruling class in general this uprising had enormous repercussions across the russian empire in february of the same year violence erupted in baku between the local armenian population and tatars modern day azerbaijanis there are conflicting accounts of who actually started the violence as is so common with massacres of this nature reliable sources are hard to find and both sides blame each other the british historian christopher walker amongst others argues that tatars sparked the fighting by killing unarmed armenian civilians which led to a strong armenian response the argument for this side is that with the russians distracted by the revolution the tatars took their chance to take out the armenians and plunder their properties on the other side it is claimed that the armenians were responsible for a series of terrorist attacks that led to a swift and brutal tatar response no solid official figures are available but we know that thousands of armenians and tatars lost their lives in the ensuing violence it is also likely that this violence and the long lasting bad blood it caused later led to much worse bloodshed an iranian postcard showing the iranian consul m s vezare maragai standing in front of a few of baku s many muslim victims from the march days of 1918 ublic domain world war i and baku s bloody fight for independence during world war i baku became a major german target baku was responsible for supplying huge amounts of oil each year to the allies not trusting its turkish allies to get the job done germany sent troops to georgia in order to enter baku britain responded in kind and sent in its own troops to halt the german advance the germans were desperate to get their hands on the baku oil and the brits couldn t afford to lose it in 1917 the russian revolution once again brought bloodshed to the streets of baku the power vacuum created by the fall of the russian empire once again led to bloody massacres in baku called the march days in 1918 the bolsheviks and dashnaks armenians sought to take over baku and the local azerbaijanis resisted sadly this did not go well for the baku natives and it is estimated that anywhere between three to twelve thousand people lost their lives in the ensuing massacre the result of all this bloodshed was the creation of the azerbaijan democratic republic the adr the adr just had one small problem they couldn t defend themselves without a proper army this was a major problem for a country with such a long standing history of being invaded the adr turned to the ottomans for help and began their march on baku capturing it on september 15th 1918 this was known as the battle of baku sadly this led to yet another massacre this time it was baku s armenian citizens who were the victims as the adr and ottoman forces flooded into baku the local armenians fled to the harbor in a desperate escape attempt rather than an avenue of escape the harbor became a choke point over the next few days ottoman and azerbaijani troops massacred up to 30 000 armenians this massacre is known as the september days thankfully it was the last massacre of wwi and the last massacre in the bloody history of baku the adr s victory was short lived the end of wwi was also the end of the ottoman empire without its greatest ally the adr was left vulnerable and the russian bolsheviks were eager to regain what they had lost on april 28th 1920 the red army invaded baku and reinstalled the bolsheviks to power under the ussr baku once again prospered the ussr was heavily reliant on baku oil and the city of baku became a crown jewel of the soviets the russians went on to invest heavily in the baku oil fields and the face of baku itself changed as the soviets built up the area whilst the axis powers were desperate to get their hands on baku during wwii the city for once never saw any violence today the walled city of baku beckons visitors with its dazzling skyline of skyscrapers and ancient islamic structures from more than a thousand years ago urkaimmortal adobe stock conclusion with the fall of the ussr baku and azerbaijan finally gained independence for good in 1991 for the first time in almost a thousand years the walled city of baku is under azerbaijani rule and it continues to prosper the city is proud of its relatively newfound independence azerbaijan has worked hard to return the walled city of baku to its former glory many of the ugly utilitarian buildings of the soviet area have been demolished and replaced with green belts the walled city of baku has been invaded countless times but it would seem that has finally come to an end in 2000 the walled city of baku along with the palace of the shirvanshahs and maiden tower became unesco world heritage sites now the only foreign invaders to be found in baku are tourists wielding their wallets and cameras top image azerbaijan s walled city of

cnn by clare duffy cnn business the securities and exchange commission has continued to examine elon musk s investment in and 44 billion deal to buy twitter a letter sent by the sec to musk on june 2 includes questions about the billionaire s use of twitter to discuss the deal including his tweets about the deal being paused according to a thursday regulatory filing the agency previously questioned musk in an april letter about his apparent delay in disclosing his large ownership stake in twitter on may 13 musk tweeted that the twitter deal was temporarily on hold pending the receipt of information from twitter about how it calculates the number of bot accounts on its platform four days later he tweeted again that the acquisition cannot move forward unless he received more information related to the prevalence of bots and accused the social media platform of falsifying spam account numbers in its public filings in its letter the sec said the word cannot in the latter tweet suggests that mr musk and his affiliates are exercising a legal right under the terms of the merger agreement to suspend completion of the acquisition of twitter or otherwise do not intend to complete the acquisition however it notes musk s regulatory filing related to the deal was not amended to reflect the apparent material change immediately following the tweet the agency asked for an explanation as to why the filing was not updated as well as a clear statement as to mr musk s current plans or proposals with respect to the acquisition of twitter in a response to the agency dated june 7 musk s lawyer wrote that musk does not believe that the tweet required an update to the filing despite mr musk s desire to obtain information to evaluate the potential spam and fake accounts there was no material change to mr musk s plans and proposals regarding the proposed transaction at such time musk s response letter states news of the latest sec communication comes after musk on friday moved to terminate the deal to acquire twitter accusing the company of violating the agreement by failing to share sufficient data about bot accounts on tuesday twitter filed a lawsuit alleging that musk is the one in breach of the deal and asking a court to force him to follow through with the acquisition it s unclear whether the sec s inquiries would have any bearing on the litigation but they do add to the tesla ceo s rocky history with the agency in 2018 musk tweeted that he was considering taking tesla private at 420 and that he had funding secured sparking a frenzy and sending shares in the automaker up to 371 from 342 the sec later said the funding had in fact not been secured and sued musk for misleading investors musk eventually settled with the sec for 20 million and gave up his position as chairman of tesla musk tried to fight a provision of that settlement that requires him to have certain tweets about tesla reviewed by lawyers before posting them and has made a number of disparaging comments about the agency a judge earlier this year refused to strike down the settlement saying in his ruling that none of musk s arguments hold water the cnn wire 2022 cable news network inc a warnermedia company all rights reserved

example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video america s dinged and dented economy managed to add a vigorous 372 000 jobs in june well above what economists had expected washington inflation is raging the stock market is tumbling and interest rates rising american consumers are depressed and angry economists warn of potentially dark times ahead but employers they just keep hiring the labor department reported friday that america s dinged and dented economy managed to add a vigorous 372 000 jobs in june well above the 275 000 that economists had expected and the unemployment rate remained at 3 6 just a tick above the 50 year low that was recorded just before the coronavirus pandemic flattened the economy in early 2020 the labor market s continued strength is simply astonishing despite all the headwinds new hiring faces said christopher rupkey chief economist at the research firm fwdbonds llc dismissing concerns that the economy might headed for a downturn sometime soon this isn t what a recession looks like the american job market has staged a remarkable comeback from the depths of the covid 19 recession in the spring of 2020 in march and april that year the united states lost a staggering 22 million jobs but the government s vast infusions of spending including expanded unemployment benefits and relief checks to most households and ultra low interest rates set by the federal reserve fueled a propulsive recovery employers added a record 6 7 million jobs last year and they ve been tacking on an average of 457 000 a month more so far in 2022 the nation is now just 524 00 jobs short of the number it had in february 2020 just before covid erupted counting last month s hiring in fact the private sector has regained all the jobs it lost to the pandemic recession the remaining shortfall resides entirely on government payrolls the strong recovery does have a downside it has fueled the hottest inflation in 40 years and the fed will likely see june s hiring spree as another reason to keep aggressively raising its benchmark short term interest rate as it did in march may and june to try to tame inflation higher rates will probably weaken the economy because they will make loans steadily more expensive for consumers and businesses here are five takeaways from the june jobs report hiring strong but slowing the recent numbers usually would be consistent with a raging economic boom noted ian shepherdson chief economist at pantheon macroeconomics but hiring has lost some momentum from april through june employers added an average 375 000 jobs a month down from an average of 539 000 in the first three months of 2022 and a monthly average of 562 000 last year what s more in its employment report friday the government said hiring was weaker during the spring than it had originally estimated its revisions lopped a combined 74 000 jobs from april and may payrolls pay raises are getting smaller average hourly wages rose 0 3 from may to june and 5 1 over the past year the year over year gain was the lowest since december and it wasn t nearly enough to keep up with the 12 month jump in consumer prices which reached a 40 year high of 8 6 in may economists sarah house and michael pugliesi of wells fargo said the fed s policymakers would likely welcome the tepid rise in earnings because it might ease concerns that rising pay would fuel ever higher prices far above the central bank s 2 target at the same time the economists cautioned that decelerating pay gains are another blow to households grapping with the highest inflation in more than a generation and as households lose purchasing power to higher prices they may slash their spending which typically accounts for about 70 of the economy s output manufacturing jobs are back american factories added 29 000 jobs last month restoring manufacturing payrolls to nearly 12 8 million just above pre pandemic levels locked in at home during the pandemic and sitting on savings from relief checks and in some cases lower commuting costs consumers have been eagerly buying up manufactured goods everything from appliances to lawn furniture to cars the institute for supply management a trade group of purchasing managers says its manufacturing index has signaled growth for 25 straight months although it dipped in june but factory boom may not last higher interest rates are raising borrowing costs more expensive loans in turn could slow demand for factory goods and drive up the value of the u s dollar which makes american made products more expensive in foreign markets help wanted at restaurants bars and hotels as the covid 19 threat recedes or seems to consumers have been shifting their spending away from manufactured goods and toward the services they had to forgo while hunkered down at home restaurants bars and hotels devastated in the early days of the pandemic are now on a hiring spree eating and drinking establishments added nearly 41 000 jobs last month hotels tacked on nearly 15 000 payrolls in both businesses though remain well below pre pandemic levels leisure and hospitality companies

liz peek twitter vs musk who is lying in battle over social media company s future elon musk wants out of his deal to buy twitter the world s richest man claims that twitter s management is in material breach of various provisions in the purchase agreement and that the company has made false and misleading representations about its business management denies musk s complaints musk wants to know how many active daily users on twitter are actually bots or fake accounts he says management refuses to turn over information that could accurately determine the number since 90 of the firm s revenues come from advertising the information is critical to advertisers and to valuing the company management says only 5 of its adu average daily users are spam and claims it kicks one million bots off the site each day as recently as may ceo parag agrawal claimed the number of fake accounts ejected was half a million the lack of consistency is not reassuring who is telling the truth my bet is on musk after all who has more to lose if twitter s management is found to have fudged its numbers heads will roll and the stock will collapse if musk s charges turns out to be a phony excuse to bow out of an overpriced deal the billionaire s reputation will take a hit for sure but the brilliant tesla and spacex founder is already considered erratic few will be surprised by his about face yes there is that pesky billion dollar fee that either side may owe for torching the transaction musk can afford it make no mistake when on april 25 elon musk agreed to pay 44 billion for a social media company even in the midst of a giant sell off of tech stocks it was a risky bet the 54 20 per share offer constituted a hefty 38 premium over the stock price prior to musk divulging his significant ownership position too much in hindsight nonetheless musk had a vision and was willing to roll the dice our country will be divided over the merits of musk s claims liberals will judge musk to be welching on a reckless and overpriced bid for the social media giant conservatives will believe musk after all they have distrusted the social media firm for years for good reason ultimately the dispute will probably be hashed out in court but there is a lot on the line not just for musk and for twitter shareholders but also for the millions of americans hopeful that musk would indeed create as he pledged to do a virtual town square where all voices would be welcome a promise that terrifies liberals accustomed to shutting down divergent views misinformation on climate change or covid 19 for instance musk s disdain for the censorship imposed by social media companies and in particular by twitter has earned him the wrath of the left it has also earned him the admiration of those incensed by the political bias evident on twitter facebook and youtube unfortunately for twitter there is plenty of evidence to suggest that contrary to claims made by former ceo jack dorsey and other members of management the company operates with a profound left wing bias in 2018 in prepared remarks for congress dorsey claimed twitter does not use political ideology to make any decisions whether related to ranking content on our service or how we enforce our rules and yet there was twitter in the weeks leading up to the 2020 election refusing to allow the new york post to tweet materials found on hunter biden s laptop that appeared to compromise candidate joe biden not only did they suppress information about joe biden s involvement in his son s controversial business transactions they also banned the post a leading newspaper in the aftermath of musk s deal to buy twitter suspicions about shadow banning and giving preferences to voices on the left appeared confirmed numerous conservatives found their follower count suddenly increase substantially donald trump jr for instance acquired more than 100 000 new followers in just a few days florida gov ron desantis also saw an overnight jump in his numbers as did others it appeared that whatever tools twitter used to minimize the presence of right wing opinion had suddenly been lifted maybe by a management trying to hide those practices from the new boss musk s lawyers state in a filing that twitter has not divulged how they audit the spam accounts what kinds of samples are used and how they determine the suspension of bots musk has requested the information on daily active users that is provided to twitter s board the company has not divulged it in addition musk has pressed for board materials including a working bottoms up financial model for 2022 a budget for 2022 an updated draft plan or budget and a working copy of goldman sachs valuation model underlying its fairness opinion twitter has provided only a pdf copy of goldman sachs final board presentation if twitter has misstated its audience by undercounting bots and is covering that up musk has an excellent rationale for exiting his purchase agreement the company is going to have to become more transparent its refusal to do so arguing that some of the necessary information is private does not inspire confidence this battle is far from over it is possible that musk will attempt to negotiate a lower price for twitter if management is not being truthful about the number of real people active on its site it will likely embrace another go at a deal either way the millions hoping for an open and honest social media platform may have to wait a while longer that s a shame with our country bitterly polarized and trust in media at a record low a neutral town square is critical comments are closed

america s dinged and dented economy managed to add a vigorous 372 000 jobs in june well above what economists had expected example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video washington inflation is raging the stock market is tumbling and interest rates rising american consumers are depressed and angry economists warn of potentially dark times ahead but employers they just keep hiring the labor department reported friday that america s dinged and dented economy managed to add a vigorous 372 000 jobs in june well above the 275 000 that economists had expected and the unemployment rate remained at 3 6 just a tick above the 50 year low that was recorded just before the coronavirus pandemic flattened the economy in early 2020 the labor market s continued strength is simply astonishing despite all the headwinds new hiring faces said christopher rupkey chief economist at the research firm fwdbonds llc dismissing concerns that the economy might headed for a downturn sometime soon this isn t what a recession looks like the american job market has staged a remarkable comeback from the depths of the covid 19 recession in the spring of 2020 in march and april that year the united states lost a staggering 22 million jobs but the government s vast infusions of spending including expanded unemployment benefits and relief checks to most households and ultra low interest rates set by the federal reserve fueled a propulsive recovery employers added a record 6 7 million jobs last year and they ve been tacking on an average of 457 000 a month more so far in 2022 the nation is now just 524 00 jobs short of the number it had in february 2020 just before covid erupted counting last month s hiring in fact the private sector has regained all the jobs it lost to the pandemic recession the remaining shortfall resides entirely on government payrolls the strong recovery does have a downside it has fueled the hottest inflation in 40 years and the fed will likely see june s hiring spree as another reason to keep aggressively raising its benchmark short term interest rate as it did in march may and june to try to tame inflation higher rates will probably weaken the economy because they will make loans steadily more expensive for consumers and businesses here are five takeaways from the june jobs report hiring strong but slowing the recent numbers usually would be consistent with a raging economic boom noted ian shepherdson chief economist at pantheon macroeconomics but hiring has lost some momentum from april through june employers added an average 375 000 jobs a month down from an average of 539 000 in the first three months of 2022 and a monthly average of 562 000 last year what s more in its employment report friday the government said hiring was weaker during the spring than it had originally estimated its revisions lopped a combined 74 000 jobs from april and may payrolls pay raises are getting smaller average hourly wages rose 0 3 from may to june and 5 1 over the past year the year over year gain was the lowest since december and it wasn t nearly enough to keep up with the 12 month jump in consumer prices which reached a 40 year high of 8 6 in may economists sarah house and michael pugliesi of wells fargo said the fed s policymakers would likely welcome the tepid rise in earnings because it might ease concerns that rising pay would fuel ever higher prices far above the central bank s 2 target at the same time the economists cautioned that decelerating pay gains are another blow to households grapping with the highest inflation in more than a generation and as households lose purchasing power to higher prices they may slash their spending which typically accounts for about 70 of the economy s output manufacturing jobs are back american factories added 29 000 jobs last month restoring manufacturing payrolls to nearly 12 8 million just above pre pandemic levels locked in at home during the pandemic and sitting on savings from relief checks and in some cases lower commuting costs consumers have been eagerly buying up manufactured goods everything from appliances to lawn furniture to cars the institute for supply management a trade group of purchasing managers says its manufacturing index has signaled growth for 25 straight months although it dipped in june but factory boom may not last higher interest rates are raising borrowing costs more expensive loans in turn could slow demand for factory goods and drive up the value of the u s dollar which makes american made products more expensive in foreign markets help wanted at restaurants bars and hotels as the covid 19 threat recedes or seems to consumers have been shifting their spending away from manufactured goods and toward the services they had to forgo while hunkered down at home restaurants bars and hotels devastated in the early days of the pandemic are now on a hiring spree eating and drinking establishments added nearly 41 000 jobs last month hotels tacked on nearly 15 000 payrolls in both businesses though remain well below pre pandemic levels leisure and hospitality companies including hotels restaurants and bars raised hourly wages 9 1 last month from a year ago staying ahead of inflation and 1 from may three times the average month over month private sector pay hike black unemployment dips the unemployment rate for black americans dropped to 5 8 last month from 6 2 in may at 21 2 million the number of black americans in the labor force which includes those either working or looking for work tops pre pandemic levels though the figure dipped from may the number of whites in the labor force is 1 4 million short of where it stood in february 2020 white unemployment ticked up to 3 3 from 3 2 in may hispanic joblessness was unchanged at 4 3

california it s an ambitious piece of legislation to say the least in pennsylvania the state which pew research center ranked fifth in number of registered guns in 2022 and which industry trade group nssf puts behind only texas and florida in total semi automatic rifles bought in 2020 add to those hurdles a republican dominated general assembly with a leadership that generally thwarts any effort to tighten gun laws what is included on the pa senate assault rifles bill santarsiero s bill which he refers to as an assault weapons ban would make it illegal to possess manufacture import sell or transfer an assault weapon or large capacity magazine those who currently possess such weapons would be allowed to keep them if they obtain a certificate of possession by providing certain information to the pennsylvania state police that would include the owner s name address date of birth race sex citizenship status height weight signature hair and eye color a photograph as well as a description of the weapon that includes the manufacturer s name the gun s model number serial number and any unique marks or characteristics that could be used to identify it anyone who fails to obtain a certificate or whose application is denied following subsequent criminal background juvenile delinquency and mental health background checks plus a character and reputation investigation would have to surrender any weapons on the bill s list the list is composed of semiautomatic center fire rifles that accept detachable magazines and have a conspicuously protruding pistol grip a thumbhole folding or telescopic stock a flash suppressor grenade or flare launcher or a forward pistol grip the ban would also include semiautomatic rifles with an overall length of less than 30 inches or a fixed magazine capable of holding more than 10 rounds of ammunition more bucks lawmaker introduces assault weapons ban watch video from sen santarsiero s june 9 press conference semiautomatic pistols would make the list if they can fire more than 10 rounds without reloading they accept detachable magazines or have a threaded barrel a second handgrip or any shroud to prevent hand burns that s more complex than a slide enclosing the barrel not surprisingly there are no republicans co sponsoring sb 1300 which would also establish a voluntary buy back program for individuals that currently own the listed firearms a bipartisan group of u s senators last month proved that compromise is still possible on guns when they managed to strike a deal to expand the background check system for prospective gun buyers under the age of 21 by giving authorities up to 10 business days to examine juvenile and mental health records the measure also toughens laws against the trafficking of guns and straw purchasing and closes the so called boyfriend loophole that had exempted dating partners from a ban on domestic abusers buying firearms previously the law only applied to spouses those who live together or have children together by no means is that deal a home run for gun control advocates but at least call it an infield single that breaks up a no hitter in light of that it s fair to wonder whether instead of swinging for the fences with an assault weapons ban that has hardly any hope of getting out of committee santarsiero ought to be seeking consensus with republicans on more achievable gun related measures while acknowledging the importance of compromise santarsiero pushes back on that suggestion i am always open to talking with my colleagues on the other side of the aisle and gun advocates about a compromise but i can t do that if they are not willing to talk about any compromise he said in an email he went on the characterize aiming at say an assault weapons registry or certification process instead as negotiating against himself and to be sure this is not the harrisburg veteran s first go round on guns after cosmo dinardo lured four young men to his family s solebury farm and murdered them with a family member s gun in july of 2017 santarsiero introduced senate bill 137 at the start of the 2019 2020 legislative session it would have required gun owners to safely store firearms if they lived with someone who is prohibited from possessing one because the commonwealth currently has no requirements regarding the safe storage of firearms no member of his dinardo s family was charged for permitting him access to the firearm used in the murders santarsiero said at the time in a memo seeking support for the legislation he didn t get any from the right side of the aisle and the bill died in the senate s judiciary committee without ever getting a vote and despite santarsiero re introducing it early in the 2021 2022 session it still hasn t gotten out of the judiciary committee what gun control efforts are being made in pennsylvania in early 2021 democratic state senators introduced bills calling for universal background checks red flag laws the reporting of lost and stolen firearms and a 72 hour waiting period for all firearm transfers for consideration this session all of them are mired in the judiciary committee which is chaired by state sen lisa baker r 20 whose district includes pike wayne and wyoming counties plus parts of luzerne and susquehanna counties following the mass shooting in uvalde democratic senators mounted a push to remove all of those bills from the judiciary committee s jurisdiction via a series of discharge resolutions and have them voted on by the entire chamber on june 13 all 28 republican state senators opposed moving the bill on red flag laws out of the judiciary committee and to the floor the following day all 28 republican state senators similarly voted to keep the bill on universal background checks locked up in the judiciary committee as well seeing the writing on the wall the democrats didn t call for votes to discharge the other bills this is happening in the state house as well on june 13 the same day that the senate s red flag laws bill failed to escape the judiciary committee the house voted to kill an effort to suspend the rules to immediately consider an assault weapons ban house bill 770 the only republican to buck the gop by voting for immediate consideration of the ban was state rep todd stephens of montgomery county s 151st district at a press conference announcing his assault weapons ban last month santarsiero encouraged pennsylvania residents who want to see gun law reforms to pressure their republican legislators to support the ban on assault weapons saying the power to make this happens rests with the public because absent a monumental push from residents there ll be no movement on even the most moderate of gun proposals in harrisburg let alone something as ambitious as santarsiero s assault weapons ban

although melvin page had a long career in public service retiring proved to be much more difficult than he thought three years into his retirement page suffered a brain aneurysm that left him with crippling medical debt and no chance of keeping his apartment the then 70 year old ended up experiencing homelessness in denver for more than a year beginning in 2019 he told denver voice that he was lucky to escape within a year but getting back on his feet has been a struggle nearly four years later page 73 works part time as a lot attendant for enterprise rent a car at denver international airport but his hourly income is not enough to pay for food rent and transportation each month page said he s grown increasingly reliant on his social security income to pay for necessities and is worried that another economic shock could send him back to the streets i m still willing to go to work and i take full responsibility for my future page said but i still can t help wondering if i ll be able to afford any more help than what i receive now chasing progress denver voice examined denver s poverty rate for black and latino seniors as part of chasing progress a colorado news collaborative project on social economic and health equity among black and latino coloradans the project analyzed the census bureau s five year american community survey data from 2010 2015 and 2020 a period of historically long economic expansion bookended by the great recession and the onset of the pandemic overall denver s poverty rate for seniors defined as people aged 65 and over decreased from 15 4 to 10 5 but the data also showed continued disparities among black and latino seniors when compared to white seniors the poverty rate for black seniors dropped from 21 4 to 16 3 over the past decade while the poverty rate for latino seniors dropped slightly from 20 9 to 19 9 according to the census bureau s 2010 and 2020 five year american community survey for comparison the poverty rate for white seniors declined from 11 7 in 2010 to 6 7 in 2020 during that same period put another way black seniors are now more than twice as likely to live in poverty as white seniors latino seniors are now nearly three times as likely as white seniors to live in poverty as well meanwhile denver s population has gotten older with people over age 65 making up 12 2 of the population in 2020 compared to just 7 a decade ago experts point to several reasons for denver s declining poverty rates among black and latino seniors such as spending more time in the workforce and the plethora of programs that the city has created to help supplement daily expenses for food and medical care but others are concerned that programs designed to aid seniors may not be able to withstand mounting economic pressures from denver s rising cost of living and persistent inflation moreover some point to a rising number of seniors experiencing economic instability as evidence that denver s declining senior poverty rate could reverse course in the future more time in workforce page who is black said his retirement wasn t his choice initially he was working as a landscaper when his declining health ushered him out of the labor force without that setback page said he would have never stopped working in fact census data also shows that an increasing number of seniors like page are working longer the labor force participation rate for people aged 65 to 74 increased by three points from 27 to more than 30 over the last decade the participation rate for seniors ages 75 and up also grew from 5 8 to more than 8 over the same time and the labor contributions of older adults in denver is hard to overlook according to the latest community assessment survey for older adults by the denver regional council of governments older adults contributed an estimated 1 6 billion in economic productivity over a 12 month period in 2018 approximately 875 million of that total came from unpaid contributions such as volunteer hours and informal labor like helping friends and family but spending more time in the workforce doesn t necessarily guarantee that a senior will be able to afford to retire perla gheiler who leads denver s office of aging told denver voice that one reason black and latino seniors experience higher poverty rates is that they often don t have enough savings when they retire our seniors are living much longer which is putting additional strain on their savings and retirement accounts gheiler said even those who were able to put away a sizable nest egg have seen it dwindle recently because of inflation and high housing costs another issue that gheiler pointed to is the wage gap between male and female seniors who are employed research from the nonpartisan bell policy center bpc a financial policy think tank shows that the median income for denver seniors is roughly 25 000 per year with male seniors averaging more than 30 000 in income while women average around 20 000 for page who earns a gross income of approximately 3 400 per month between employment and social security income saving money every month is challenging at best on top of taking the bus from the southmoor park ride in southeast denver up to the airport for work he also must budget for medications to treat his high blood pressure and other ailments page said he has no stocks or bonds he can fall back on for additional income he also doesn t qualify to participate in his employer s retirement program because of his part time employment status making him one of the 63 of black coloradans that do not have access to retirement funding outside of social security according to research from the bpc there s a whole array of people who have fallen through the cracks that just don t have the strength or financial resources to overcome the challenges they re facing page said featured local savings making ends meet programs like social security have also been instrumental in helping many black and latino seniors in denver make ends meet gheiler added but the pandemic tested the efficacy of these programs to reach seniors living on the fringes of poverty one mechanism that has helped reduce the poverty rate for denver s seniors is the automatic cost of living adjustments cola that determine the level of social security benefits paid to individuals on jan 1 the federal social security administration announced it was increasing disbursements by 6 the upcoming year the largest spike in the administration s history the center on budget and policy priorities credited the cola as one reason that more than 201 000 seniors in colorado were lifted out of poverty because of the program between 2018 and 2020 a time when colorado s overall cost of living increased sharply black and latino workers benefit substantially from social security because they have higher disability rates and lower lifetime earnings than white workers on average kathleen romig cbpp s director of social security and disability policy wrote in a blog post in april gheiler added that denver has made significant strides to improve its service pipeline for seniors for example the city worked closely with the area agency on aging within the denver regional council of governments to provide seniors with services to those who need assistance applying for benefits like the supplemental nutrition assistance program and medicaid denver also created several programs to help seniors age in their homes for example the city partners with brothers redevelopment to provide some seniors with home repairs the city also has several tax exemptions that seniors can claim according to the assessor s office there s really been a greater focus on improving coordination between city departments as it relates to how we serve senior citizens in denver gheiler said and our office really tries to ensure we connect seniors who call us with the right services to fit their situation page said he is a testament to how well denver s services can work for seniors he was placed in a room at the aloft hotel in downtown during the pandemic after he tested positive for covid 19 while at the hotel page was connected to services and other resources that helped him recover he said the service providers page connected with were able to help him find his apartment at the brookdale senior living center in southeast denver they also helped page apply for his job at the airport and find furniture for his new home he added that s when i really started to feel stronger page said i don t know where i d be if i hadn t ended up there risks remain despite the help from social security and local programs page said that he faces a challenging financial future over the last year food prices have gone up 10 6 in the denver metro area while household energy costs advanced 11 7 respectively according to the bureau of labor statistics the 2 100 per month that page pays to rent his apartment is also more than 60 of his monthly earnings housing experts consider people who spend more than 30 of their monthly income on housing expenses to be housing burdened although the senior living facility provides additional services like on site skilled nursing and memory care he hopes to move to a cheaper apartment by november when his lease ends the move could allow him to save more of his paychecks so he can afford the extra care later he said not everyone from different economic groups reaches the same level of success as the others page said some people will inevitably fall through the cracks we need to recognize that and plan accordingly outside of inflation chrissy esposito a policy analyst at the colorado health institute told denver voice that the rapidly rising cost of living resulting from the covid 19 pandemic is one of the biggest threats to the overall financial health of many seniors in denver it s not surprising that many seniors have been able to escape poverty over the last decade esposito said but the challenges that this population continues to face often go unnoticed once their income gets above the poverty threshold esposito points to data showing that the number of seniors experiencing economic instability meaning they live between zero and 200 of the federal poverty line as evidence that denver s declining senior poverty rate could reverse course in the future according to the data the total number of seniors ages 65 and up that fall into this category increased from 28 9 in 2018 to nearly 30 in 2019 these percentages dipped in 2020 which esposito said is likely a result of pandemic related data collection issues it s sad because people face higher risks for having health conditions as they age esposito said but they re also more likely to live in poverty which can make it difficult to deal with these challenges on top of increased health risks denver s rising average rent is another issue plaguing the more than 30 of denver seniors who rent their homes according to the 2018 casoa survey and interest rates are also twice as high as they were at this time last year which makes it much more expensive to buy a home in the first place aging is expensive esposito said and we as a society seem to be underprepared for it

the argument that vaping helps people quit smoking tobacco has been widely made in recent years but there is now growing concern at the number of young teens who vape as a rite of passage through secondary school advocates for the youth information service spunout have said vaping is increasingly seen as attractive to teens e cigarettes known also as vapes heat nicotine water and propylene glycol or glycerine with flavourings but do not produce tar or carbon monoxide the vaping market has grown exponentially in recent years with an endless offering of flavours that appeal to younger people including banana cola apple pink lemonade bubblegum coffee and mango the dizzying array of colourful packaging is a million miles away from the old fashioned marlboro man the eu recently identified a 10 sales growth in heated tobacco across the region with sales spiking even higher in some countries the european commission is considering a ban on some products under its smoking reduction policies nineteen year old katelyn benson says discussions around vaping often ignore the views of young people and instead focus on whether or not vaping helps smokers quit tobacco half of the people i know who vape have never touched a cigarette in their lives said katelyn benson picture james connolly half of the people i know who vape have never touched a cigarette in their lives she said people would shun you if you smoked but they have no problem with vaping vaping is more attractive she said as there is no giveaway reek of tobacco to alert adults it is easier to hide from your parents she said it tastes sweet and you can sit on your bed and do it or in the bathroom no one is going to know you are vaping because it smells sweet it could pass as perfume or candles they re very cheap too you go in and get them for 7 or 8 she said they re for nothing compared to what you spend on cigarettes while it is assumed vaping is healthier than smoking ms benson is concerned at the lack of long term information on what are relatively new products we don t really know what it is doing to your system she said in cork one mother who did not wish to be named was surprised at how quickly vaping caught on with her teenage son and his friends my son is vaping and he is so healthy fitness mad he plays rugby and hurling it s so contradictory she said all my fellow mams and dads in the school are so concerned we are unaware of the long term health issues that vaping will have on this generation representatives of the irish vape vendors association ivva recently told tds they would not object to raising the legal age for buying e cigarettes upwards from 18 ivva director and managing director of vapourpal joanne o connell said it s better than smoking but it is not better than not smoking i would have no problem with the age being increased to 21 in her own shop they do police customers ages but she is not reassured this is done in non specialist shops i agree that some packaging is probably overly colourful i would not say it is targeted towards kids because adults are attracted to these things too she said while it is seen by some as a way to wean oneself off cigarettes joanne o connell md of vapourpal says is better than smoking but it is not better than not smoking stock picture adults are attracted to colours and flavourings we find many of our customers will start on a tobacco flavour but once they start vaping they really want to be away from the flavour of tobacco completely the health research board has found that e cigarettes are less harmful than combustible cigarettes but health risks remain the hse advises the safety of long term use of e cigarettes is not known and they do not recommend them as an aid to quitting smoking the ivva and others argue the market is already tightly regulated with maximum nicotine concentrations and volumes for cartridges tanks and nicotine liquid containers the public health tobacco and nicotine inhaling products bill 2019 is under review it says shops must apply for a licence to sell vapes and heated tobacco or a different licence to sell these and cigarettes it has been estimated that about 200 000 people use vaping products and they can be bought at more than 300 retailers and newsagents john dunne from vape business ireland told tds nicotine warnings on products are also mandatory manufacturers importers and distributors are required to notify the hse if they believe any product to be unsafe he explained in may the hse called on the public to stop using some aroma king e cigarettes sales were halted because they were found to have as much as 50 4mg ml nicotine despite labelling saying 20mg ml the alert included disposable aroma king bar 600 puffs in flavours such as ice skittles and monster at bridgeways family resource centre in longford grace kearney said in her experience children cannot handle any level of nicotine in e cigarettes describing them as addictive grace kearney project co ordinator with the bridgeways family resource centre balllymahon co longford photo bob morrison they have the vape all of the time sitting and puffing on it regularly she said even a chainsmoker doesn t have a cigarette all the time whereas this is constant it is like an extension of their hand when children do water sports at the centre she sees their lung capacity is affected and they are dropping out it is not attractive to smoke but it is attractive to vape she said i know people who got off smoking with vaping and i understand that but i don t agree with children 13 and 14 years old vaping they have never smoked they are just vapers she said it has become a rite of passage into first year at secondary school it s not a problem it s an epidemic and it is ruining young people s lives she said i have never seen a craze like this it is so accessible so cheap it s completely geared for young people with all the different flavours i feel that parents and kids don t realise the impact these highly addictive vapes are having on their lungs their capacity and their concentration because they are so addicted to them she said i am doing summer camps at the minute they are doing kayaking they are doing water activities they are doing obstacles and they are not fit for anything she said i am looking at 13 and 14 year olds absolutely gasping for breath this has to do with vaping ms kearney is reluctant to ban vaping outright at the centre and instead has restricted use as she worries teenagers would go somewhere less safe instead when an adult wants to vape by all means off you go and vape that s fine she says i m talking about young people and how it s nearly a rite of passage now into first year her concerns are echoed at in the new junior cycle social personal and health education sphe curriculum which includes lessons on vaping tobacco nicotine addiction and marketing by vaping and tobacco industries unease is growing too at the involvement of global tobacco companies in vaping and the development of heated tobacco some of the biggest most widely available e cigarette brands are owned by tobacco companies california s department of public health research programme still blowing smoke has found indeed the website of the altria group formerly known as philip morris international of marlboro man fame states they are in transition to a smoke free future the us food and drug administration fda recently banned sales of a juul vaping device and tobacco and menthol flavoured cartridges for failing to meet health standards the fda has since put its ban on hold and said it will do an additional review of the company s marketing application the company part owned by altria has appealed imperial brands formerly imperial tobacco says it is expanding into potentially less harmful alternatives to traditional tobacco products a smart move by a dying industry or a cynical bet that vaping keeps the puffing habit alive the health research board said they found teenagers who use e cigarettes are three to five times more likely to start smoking tobacco cigarettes compared to those who never vaped it is far from just an irish challenge with british data showing the proportion of children aged 11 to 17 currently vaping jumped from 4 in 2020 to 7 this year disposable vapes were favoured by 52 of those who vaped up from 7 tiktok was mentioned most often as the source of online promotion 45 followed by instagram 31 and snapchat 22 ms benson said it s more of a norm these days i was at longitude there a few days ago and you just saw people vaping all the time you re surrounded by it so much you can t really be like i don t care about it it is everywhere

it s hard to escape the impression that rowling is having a lot of fun wheaton writes this wheaton puts down to the fact that her side seems to be winning on that alone she may be right advertisement in america left leaning commentators such as bill maher and bari weiss have been unafraid to speak critically of transgender orthodoxy recently even the new york times has been publishing trans skeptical perspectives times columnist pamela paul aligned herself with british terfs including rowling arguing that both the far left in its transgender policies and the far right in its abortion policies agree that women don t count even the word women has become verboten paul complained in its place are unwieldy terms like pregnant people menstruators and bodies with vaginas all this she said is a bitter way to mark the 50th anniversary of title ix for liberals having right wing tendencies and sympathies is one of the worst accusations you can face however this weapon can be wielded in both directions in wheaton s politico piece she takes care to emphasize that on the one hand there are celebrities and harry potter cast members and on the other side of the spectrum vladimir putin who said rowling was a victim of cancel culture but popularity contests are not proof of argument and arguments of guilt by association are similarly unserious as the feminist philosopher and trans skeptic kathleen stock recently wrote there are also many on the left who are not so shallow or contrarian who can grasp basic humane points about children s health or women s rights without waiting to see who else agrees with them
washington d c democrats in congress are seeking to authorize medicare to negotiate lower prescription drug prices for older and disabled americans potentially lowering government health costs by billions the plan which has been held up by contentious intra party negotiations on taxes climate change and other elements of a proposed domestic policy bill is popular with voters and has been a long term objective of congressional democrats according to the kaiser family foundation the drugs covered could include bristol myers squibb s top selling cancer drug revlimid abbvie s rheumatoid arthritis drug humira and bayer s blood thinner pill xarelto the sources said all 50 senate democrats support the drug plan but while negotiations are continuing its medicare portion was to be submitted to the senate to ensure it complies with complex budget rules allowing democrats to bypass republicans and pass the bill with a simple majority in the 100 seat chamber with vice president kamala harris breaking a potential tie under the plan the medicare health program for disabled people and those aged 65 and older would allow the government to negotiate discounts for the most expensive drugs and penalize companies that raise prices faster than inflation as well as introduce a 2 000 annual cap on out of pocket costs for medicare beneficiaries a kaiser family foundation analyst juliette cubanski said medicare could annually negotiate prices for 10 of the most expensive single source drugs starting in 2026 with that number increasing to 20 drugs by 2029 though newer drugs would not be eligible a november report from the non partisan congressional budget office determined that the plan would reduce the federal budget deficit by 297 billion over 10 years however democrats hope to pass the legislation before the midterm elections on 8th november when republicans could win control of one or both chambers of congress
letters to the editor expending any city resources to challenge ohio law is a really bad idea especially on the abortion front if the city has ample resources to pursue such an effort the mayor should evaluate the financial prudence for such resources a reduction in headcount in the city s law department is in order ohio permits cities to raise revenue in particular imposition of taxation on the earnings of non residents there is a long overdue and active effort underway in the ohio legislature and within professional trade associations to lobby for changes in how cities levy taxes this taxation without representation is the means by which cities can pursue financially reckless agendas at no incremental cost to its residents because the burden was shifted to non residents non voters the city s unlawful and immoral covid taxation scheme only furthered taxation without representation by deeming people to be working in the city when they weren t in reality a case headed to the ohio supreme court may be the wake up call for ohio s cities approximately 85 of the city of cincinnati s income tax is paid by persons who don t reside in the city and can t vote in city elections

dewine and ohio s legislators are eager to pass laws restricting abortion rights but i haven t heard any of them proposing legislation that would help all these women and children where is the bill

would like to write legislation that gives mothers the opportunity to have nutritious food on the table for herself and her children three times a day and a decent affordable place to live in which to raise all those kids at the very least i d think at least one of our legislators concerned as they are with potential life would propose a bill to provide universal free pre and post natal care being

cops scott wartman s article on elmwood place we just need cops june 24 sheds light on many small declining communities in greater cincinnati some like elmwood place are in the mill creek valley from lower price hill to camp washington to lockland and lincoln heights these communities were once the heart of our region s industrial base which provided jobs to much of our population what they have in common is loss of industrial jobs and tax base ageing out of the original ethnic population as in elmwood place s german catholics and appalachians turnover from owner occupied to rental housing units the closing of elementary schools churches and small businesses weaken community life and morale and contribute to an increase in crime there are variations on the story of course lincoln heights never was allowed to have an industrial base to lose millvale was created as a segregated public housing enclave elmwood place got its independence but was landlocked and could not do much expansion of housing stock or population reading has a broader land base and room for a thriving housing and institutional base on the hilltop but mayor annekin of elmwood place is right when he says we are not unique other places are struggling lockland is one of these it helps to be a cincinnati neighborhood police and fire services for example are assured but carthage has lost its elementary school and has seen some decline communities that are separately incorporated can benefit from sharing services with larger municipalities or hamilton county elmwood place for example shares a school

chasing him with several police vehicles when he left the car and fled on foot why chase him you have his car you know where he lives he will be caught no need to chase him especially when it was claimed that a shot was fired from the car if all that s involved is a traffic violation why not just tow the car and wait at home i don t understand why eight officers needed to chase the guy and

annihilate why do non military citizens require these weapons our senators and representatives are so fearful of the nra its members and more importantly losing votes that they are willing to dance around the obvious we can no longer safely go to the grocery store buffalo church laguna woods holiday parades highland park large concerts las vegas or send our most precious citizens children to school sandy hook ulvade columbine and marjory stoneman douglas to name a few i propose that congress be required to personally view up close and personal the horrific carnage caused by these weapons with that they might stop offering prayers and condolences and get something done that will at least make it more difficult to obtain the weapons unfortunately i m sure mass shootings will continue to

unnatural when the catholic church as a whole has refused to accept responsibility for the sexual abuse committed over decades unnatural is a man of the cloth preying upon children who are taught to

nine unelected autocrats instead of the democratically elected representatives of the people in point of fact this supreme court actually returned the decision to the people via their elected representatives to the state legislatures because the 1973 court took it away from us for no constitutionally sound reason janice wilson mason
the 21 year old charged with killing seven people and wounding two dozen others at an independence day parade in chicago suburb highland park reportedly used a smith wesson m p15 rifle to fire 83 rounds from his rooftop perch he emptied two 30 round magazines and most of a third he reportedly wanted to carry out a second july 4 mass shooting in wisconsin this time using a kel tec sub 2000 and 60 rounds of ammunition he d had in his car both the smith wesson and the kel tec are on the list of more than 150 guns that d be banned under pa state sen steve santarsiero s senate bill 1300 which the bucks county democrat introduced in late june following the mass shooting that killed 19 elementary school students and two teachers in uvalde texas modeled after existing laws in connecticut and california it s an ambitious piece of legislation to say the least in pennsylvania the state which pew research center ranked fifth in number of registered guns in 2022 and which industry trade group nssf puts behind only texas and florida in total semi automatic rifles bought in 2020 add to those hurdles a republican dominated general assembly with a leadership that generally thwarts any effort to tighten gun laws what is included on the pa senate assault rifles bill santarsiero s bill which he refers to as an assault weapons ban would make it illegal to possess manufacture import sell or transfer an assault weapon or large capacity magazine those who currently possess such weapons would be allowed to keep them if they obtain a certificate of possession by providing certain information to the pennsylvania state police that would include the owner s name address date of birth race sex citizenship status height weight signature hair and eye color a photograph as well as a description of the weapon that includes the manufacturer s name the gun s model number serial number and any unique marks or characteristics that could be used to identify it anyone who fails to obtain a certificate or whose application is denied following subsequent criminal background juvenile delinquency and mental health background checks plus a character and reputation investigation would have to surrender any weapons on the bill s list the list is composed of semiautomatic center fire rifles that accept detachable magazines and have a conspicuously protruding pistol grip a thumbhole folding or telescopic stock a flash suppressor grenade or flare launcher or a forward pistol grip the ban would also include semiautomatic rifles with an overall length of less than 30 inches or a fixed magazine capable of holding more than 10 rounds of ammunition more bucks lawmaker introduces assault weapons ban watch video from sen santarsiero s june 9 press conference semiautomatic pistols would make the list if they can fire more than 10 rounds without reloading they accept detachable magazines or have a threaded barrel a second handgrip or any shroud to prevent hand burns that s more complex than a slide enclosing the barrel not surprisingly there are no republicans co sponsoring sb 1300 which would also establish a voluntary buy back program for individuals that currently own the listed firearms a bipartisan group of u s senators last month proved that compromise is still possible on guns when they managed to strike a deal to expand the background check system for prospective gun buyers under the age of 21 by giving authorities up to 10 business days to examine juvenile and mental health records the measure also toughens laws against the trafficking of guns and straw purchasing and closes the so called boyfriend loophole that had exempted dating partners from a ban on domestic abusers buying firearms previously the law only applied to spouses those who live together or have children together by no means is that deal a home run for gun control advocates but at least call it an infield single that breaks up a no hitter in light of that it s fair to wonder whether instead of swinging for the fences with an assault weapons ban that has hardly any hope of getting out of committee santarsiero ought to be seeking consensus with republicans on more achievable gun related measures while acknowledging the importance of compromise santarsiero pushes back on that suggestion i am always open to talking with my colleagues on the other side of the aisle and gun advocates about a compromise but i can t do that if they are not willing to talk about any compromise he said in an email he went on the characterize aiming at say an assault weapons registry or certification process instead as negotiating against himself and to be sure this is not the harrisburg veteran s first go round on guns after cosmo dinardo lured four young men to his family s solebury farm and murdered them with a family member s gun in july of 2017 santarsiero introduced senate bill 137 at the start of the 2019 2020 legislative session it would have required gun owners to safely store firearms if they lived with someone who is prohibited from possessing one because the commonwealth currently has no requirements regarding the safe storage of firearms no member of his dinardo s family was charged for permitting him access to the firearm used in the murders santarsiero said at the time in a memo seeking support for the legislation he didn t get any from the right side of the aisle and the bill died in the senate s judiciary committee without ever getting a vote and despite santarsiero re introducing it early in the 2021 2022 session it still hasn t gotten out of the judiciary committee what gun control efforts are being made in pennsylvania in early 2021 democratic state senators introduced bills calling for universal background checks red flag laws the reporting of lost and stolen firearms and a 72 hour waiting period for all firearm transfers for consideration this session all of them are mired in the judiciary committee which is chaired by state sen lisa baker r 20 whose district includes pike wayne and wyoming counties plus parts of luzerne and susquehanna counties following the mass shooting in uvalde democratic senators mounted a push to remove all of those bills from the judiciary committee s jurisdiction via a series of discharge resolutions and have them voted on by the entire chamber on june 13 all 28 republican state senators opposed moving the bill on red flag laws out of the judiciary committee and to the floor the following day all 28 republican state senators similarly voted to keep the bill on universal background checks locked up in the judiciary committee as well seeing the writing on the wall the democrats didn t call for votes to discharge the other bills this is happening in the state house as well on june 13 the same day that the senate s red flag laws bill failed to escape the judiciary committee the house voted to kill an effort to suspend the rules to immediately consider an assault weapons ban house bill 770 the only republican to buck the gop by voting for immediate consideration of the ban was state rep todd stephens of montgomery county s 151st district at a press conference announcing his assault weapons ban last month santarsiero encouraged pennsylvania residents who want to see gun law reforms to pressure their republican legislators to support the ban on assault weapons saying the power to make this happens rests with the public because absent a monumental push from residents there ll be no movement on even the most moderate of gun proposals in harrisburg let alone something as ambitious as santarsiero s assault weapons ban

thirty nine year old american edward joseph snowden a former computer intelligence consultant who leaked highly classified information from the national security agency in 2013 when he was an employee and subcontractor said there can be no faith in government if our highest offices are excused from scrutiny they should be setting the example of transparency similarly the seventh secretary general of the united nations co recipient of the 2001 nobel peace prize and deceased ghanaian diplomat kofi atta annan also said that if corruption is a disease transparency is a central part of its treatment in a first of its kind protest letter in the 58 year history of the apex court the 14 justices chronicled the operational challenges that have almost crippled the efficient adjudication of cases worried stakeholders in the legal profession are already of the view that the development could have dire consequences for effective adjudication of cases in the court and by extension the entire justice delivery system without mincing words the justices reiterated that in as much as they serve the country diligently and to the best of their abilities they deserve the best just as they rejected the treatment meted to them by muhammad in the leaked letter the justices accused the former cjn of gallivanting with his spouse children and personal staff while not allowing them to travel with an assistant on foreign trips adding that they even lack access to legal research assistants despite the magnitude of cases that are being adjudicated we are responsible citizens of this country it would be a tragedy if the nigerian public were to know that we are unable to resolve our problems internally without going public the decision to write to you formally must be seen by your lordship as an effort on our part to preserve the dignity of the judiciary and the respect accorded to us by governments and the people of nigeria god forbid the day that our internal issues become a matter of national discourse it would be a catastrophe better imagined they wrote the justices recalled that at an earlier meeting with the cjn they tabled and discussed their demands on justices accommodation operational vehicles electricity tariff diesel supply of internet services to judges residences and chambers as well as epileptic electricity supply to the court we also raised the issue of the failure of the honourable chief justice to carry the justices along in managing the affairs of the court the deteriorating condition of services generally and the state of the litigations department at the meeting your lordship agreed that a welfare committee is constituted to compile and forward our demands on march 24 2022 the welfare committee submitted to your lordship a request for the review of electricity allowance because of the increase in electricity tariffs nationwide the welfare committee also submitted our request for diesel allowance because of the epileptic electricity supply the astronomical hike in the price of diesel and the fact that justices require electricity to work at home the committee also requested the restoration of our monthly internet allowance because we require uninterrupted internet service to have access to materials online to write our judgments your lordship received and ignored these demands since march 24 2022 they complained justices who signed the letter include ariwoola adamu jauro tijjani abubakar kudirat motonmori o kekere ekun chima centus nweze musa dattijo mohammed and john inyang okoro others are amina adamu augie uwani musa abba aji mohammed lawal helen moronkeji ogunwumiju abdu aboki ibrahim saulawa and emmanuel agim but in his response muhammad who noted that the supreme court is also affected by the prevailing economic and socio political climate stressing that it was doing all within available resources to keep the court afloat responding to some of the specific allegations the cjn said the high cost of electricity tariff and diesel are national problems the chief registrar might have budgeted for n300 per litre but diesel is now selling for over n700 per litre and therefore has to find a way around it without even bringing it to the attention of the cjn but there is no way that the generator would be put off if the court is sitting the amendment of court rules is in the process it has to be critically reviewed to avoid conflict with the constitution and other extant laws not all the cjns have reviewed the rules in the past the internet services have been restored to justices residences and chambers just as some allowances have been paid to them the cjn held a meeting with his brother justices last thursday and another one is due to hold this week parts of the statement read the nigerian bar association nba also stressed the compelling need for fundamental reforms of the administration and governance of the country s judiciary president of the association olumide akpata in a statement noted that the situation has not only affected the judicial responsibilities of the justices but also impacted the justice administration process the judiciary must entrench the principles of accountability and probity in the manner in which it expends allocated resources while the fight for increased budgetary allocations for the judiciary continues it is important that available resources be used for the welfare and wellbeing of our judicial officers as well as for the improvement of infrastructure and facilities required by our judges and justices to effectively discharge their duties the statement said this is glaringly a threat to justice sambo stated he therefore called for robust dialogue and proactive measures aimed at combating the numerous challenges affecting both the bar and the bench to safeguard the integrity of the profession for the director lawyers alert nigeria a civil society organisation cso bamidele a jacobs members of the bench occupy very critical positions in the society therefore a judge that works in an atmosphere of epileptic power supply and poor working conditions will not be able to conduct the much needed research to enrich his judgment how then are we not making justice available only to the highest bidder by our neglect of members of the bench he asked

yuliet colon center in tank top waits her turn outside an agricultural market in havana cuba colon is among several cubans who with more ingenuity than resources help their compatriots cope with shortages with facebook posts of culinary creations designed around the limited number of foods they re actually likely to find at the market or with government rations shortages are growing acute and inflation has soared by 70 for some items ramon espinosa ap friends of socialist cuba like good news about that country now bad news has its use grief and hardship currently are such that clearly the u s economic blockade of cuba must end at once the harsh details of the current situation testify to potential destabilization in cuba danger to cuba s socialist project and the nefarious role of the blockade a major mobilization against the blockade is due the need for action is obvious the blockade a 60 year old relic of history places few heavy demands on the u s public no governmental funding is required the treasury department issues fines and presidents make ritualistic declarations people dodge travel restrictions it s a slow motion affair distracted pro cuba activists may lose track of harassment details here we provide a refresher course for motivation toward action it emphasizes the blockade s effects on people s lives in the beginning cuba s vulnerability is the result mainly of u s policies directed at denying money and supplies to cuba to bring about hunger desperation and overthrow of government the words are those of a state department memorandum of april 6 1960 the flow of money to cuba international loans and export income has long been feeble international banks financial institutions and corporations handling dollars on cuba s behalf risk big u s treasury department fines u s legislation blocks cuba from importing the products of multinational companies with branches in the united states even food and medical supplies for almost 30 years third country ships docking in cuba have been prohibited from entering a u s port for the six months that follow since 2019 the u s government has sanctioned venezuelan ships carrying oil to cuba the u s government harasses cuba s tourism industry the source of most of the country s foreign currency restrictions variably regulated operate against u s citizens travel to the island why they would spend money there to discourage potential investors u s legislation enables the heirs of properties nationalized in cuba to take legal action in u s courts against investors who make use of such properties cuba s commerce with the united states has been nil for 60 years except for heavily regulated cuban agricultural exports the northern neighbor used to be and still could be cuba s most convenient trading partner but cold war anti communism and imperialism stand in the way cuba s people are hurting the u s blockade constitutes the main impediment to cuba s industrial production and overall economic development trade with the socialist nations of eastern europe chiefly the soviet union formerly provided relief but since the end of socialism in those places strictures placed on imports have caused shortages of raw materials replacement parts consumer goods new tools and machines and reagents for drug and vaccine manufacture the blockade recently has complicated lives already beleaguered by the covid 19 pandemic and a 1 economic recession resulting from the pandemic an associated press report of june 22 highlights a lack of new housing and impediments to repairing existing houses in 2019 44 000 homes were built in 2000 32 000 homes and in 2021 18 000 building materials are in short supply and hurricanes and the pandemic have aggravated the situation elderly cubans experienced isolation and lack of supplies during the pandemic for two years they ve confronted weakened cultural and support services and reduced housing options fuel shortages in late 2021 led to fewer bus runs in havana wait times were even longer and pharmacies in 2020 had available only 35 of their normal stock in recent times infant death rates in cuba matched the favorable rates of well resourced countries and were lower than u s rates astoundingly cuba s infant mortality rate in 2021 was 7 6 infant deaths per 1000 births up from 4 9 in 2000 and 5 0 in 2019 cuba s 2021 rate of mothers dying from pregnancy and childbirth difficulties was 176 6 out of 100 000 mothers giving birth up from 40 0 mothers in 2000 and 37 4 in 2019 the increases stem from covid 19 infection mortality added to deaths in non covid times experts say the deaths of children and mothers can reflect social factors mothers low educational levels reduced access to healthcare and other services and poor nutrition therefore the u s blockade which has been affecting social well being for decades has likely imposed an additional toll in this area too cuba s food supply is unstable with reduced food production inefficient distribution marketing based on income levels and quality variations at an annual cost of 2 billion cuba s government still must import 60 70 of the food consumed in cuba production levels remain low despite reforms introduced after 2008 among them land distribution allowances for farmers permanent use of land marketing reforms governmental assistance to individual farmers and agricultural cooperatives new distribution systems local decision making on assistance and policies and ecologically sustainable methods the u s economic blockade is not responsible for soil deficiencies officials inaction drought conditions overgrowth of invasive plants and the appeal of urban life for rural youth blockade effects do show up in farmers reduced access to credit and lack of funds for fertilizer seeds breeding stock spare parts new equipment and fuel however inflation holds sway in cuba now as in most areas of the world prices rising for two years are up now by 70 and more access to essential goods is impaired frustration at high prices and shortages helped trigger island wide protests on july 11 2021 and has contributed to record emigration the u s blockade set the stage for inflation after losing its commercial partnership with the soviet bloc which disappeared in 1991 cuba was in trouble the blockade blocked access to international loans and interfered with income derived from exports the latter effect stemming from export restrictions consequently funds have been short for importing essential products and for developing the economy cuba desperately needed foreign currency and therefore brought tourists to the island to spend money that would end up with the government from 1993 on their money was captured via a new currency called the cuban convertible peso cuc tourists surrendered their own currencies in exchange for the cucs cubans not all of them acquired cucs and were able to buy goods and dollars unavailable to cubans without cucs inequalities emerged responding the government gradually withdrew cucs from circulation beginning in january 2021 anticipating hardships it raised salaries and pensions payable in cuba s national peso new money in circulation stimulates inflation especially when goods for sale are in short supply as in cuba the national currency lost value tourists who disappeared during the pandemic returned in late 2021 their money circulating added to inflationary pressures cucs with a prominent role in cuba s informal economy and still circulating did likewise the role of cucs suggests the blockade s indirect contribution to inflation persevering those defenders of cuba worried about diminished cuban government commitment to bettering people s lives may need reassurance of note cuban president miguel díaz canel on june 21 addressed a meeting which elevated the role of social work discussion centered on mothers living in cities in situations of vulnerability support programs are in place for elderly cubans experiencing isolation for example the accompany me acompáñame project of telephone assistance and the national program for comprehensive attention to elders as of 2021 423 so called projects of local development promoted food production small workplaces and tourism along with socio cultural environmental and research programs the government promotes its program known as micro small and medium businesses these mostly privately owned enterprises numbering 1 188 last year produce food products building materials furniture textile products footwear cleaning supplies computer accessories and more in april 2021 the government approved 43 measures directed at increased agricultural production and food availability results are far from ideal however an observer notes prime minister manuel marrero cruz on june 24 visited a district in cardenas to assess progress toward improvements of roads water supply housing construction and social work what to do resistance to the u s blockade within the united states has been constant for decades but to no avail thanks to the helms burton law of 1996 the hurdle now is forcing congress to act for that to happen masses of people must stand up together and weigh in but that won t happen it seems as long as activists continue to view the blockade as an isolated issue what s needed is collective action on many issues toward changing the direction of the u s government itself the common ground would be justice and decent lives for all people everywhere cubans among them also required would be a new understanding that the u s assault on cuba happens as part of the larger u s project of capitalist and imperialist domination worldwide the big mobilization to end the blockade would be part of a larger mission to take apart that u s project oppressed and plundered nations would be rescued cuba among them one adjustment u s progressives ought to reject that old dictum that politics stops at the water s edge it sends the message that solidarity with and struggle for oppressed peoples overseas doesn t matter that s not so by no means will these suggestions bear fruit in time to end the blockade soon hope and struggle will remain u s public opinion favors ending the blockade people in the united states now fighting the blockade are experienced and want to enlarge the movement maybe the chaos attending capitalism s failures new wars and international divisions will distract the u s government from bothering with cuba maybe international solidarity with cuba will continue growing revolutionary cuba with unity and effective leadership is known for overcoming challenges right now it faces some of the greatest challenges in decades

indication that fulton county georgia da fani willis may be the first and perhaps only prosecutor to indict trump suggests banzhaf whose criminal complaint triggered her investigation and who also played a role in obtaining special prosecutors for former president richard nixon and finally bringing former vice president spiro agnew to justice banzhaf notes that willis has already officially reported that evidence gathered earlier including that filed with her office by the law professor indicated a reasonable probability that the state of georgia s administration of elections in 2020 including the state s election of the president of the united states was subject to possible criminal disruptions previously willis had promised that anyone who violates the law will be prosecuted no matter what their social status is no matter what their economics are no matter what their race or gender is we are not going to treat anyone differently she has also announced that the grant jury plans to issue additional subpoenas to people in trump s inner circle and that she hasn t ruled out even issuing one to trump banzhaf has just filed additional evidence and analysis with willis which might help strengthen what appears to be an already strong criminal case against trump the subpoenas which had to be approved by judge robert mcburney because those being compelled to testify reside outside georgia include key members of trump s legal team including his personal lawyer rudy giuliani other subpoenaed key members of trump s legal team who advised him about how to get around the official election results include john eastman cleta mitchell kenneth chesebro and jenna ellis georgia subpoenaed lindsey graham in an unusual move u s senator lindsey graham was also subpoenaed to testify because he like trump called georgia s secretary of state and his staff at least twice about reexamining certain absentee ballots cast in georgia in order to explore the possibility of a more favorable outcome for former president donald trump his subpoena alleges graham s lawyer have announced that they will challenge his subpoena it s customary and usually the best practice to interview and lock in the testimony of smaller fish in a criminal investigation before prosecutors work towards those higher ups who also participated says banzhaf with this arrangement prosecutors can offer immunity in exchange for damaging testimony and sometimes also incriminating documents to people whose culpability is smaller and also obtain important information to use when they finally force those who culpability is higher to answer questions under oath so moving on to giuliani graham and others very close to trump strongly suggests that the investigation is about to come to an end possible with an indictment of trump predicts banzhaf others agree for example laurence tribe professor emeritus of constitutional law at harvard university wrote it wouldn t surprise me for georgia to become the first jurisdiction to indict a former president on felony charges and i think the charges will stick the most serious prospect of prosecution that trump faces is in fulton county georgia reported the new york times recently in an op ed by two experienced prosecutors one democrat and one republican a conclusion reinforcing an earlier 100 page analysis by seven legal experts who concluded that the former president faces a substantial risk of possible state charges predicated on multiple crimes as the two former prosecutors concluded da fani willis s work may present the most serious prospect of prosecution that mr trump and his enablers are facing she has a demonstrated record of courage and of conviction she has taken on and convicted a politically powerful group atlanta s teachers as the lead prosecutor in the city s teacher cheating scandal and she is playing with a strong hand in this investigation the evidentiary record of mr trump s post election efforts in georgia is compelling the piece also noted that important as congressional investigations are willis s work may present the most serious prospect of prosecution that trump and his enablers are facing the recently begun investigation by a special grand jury of trump s telephone call seeking to pressure secretary of state brad raffensperger and others to change georgia s presidential vote tallies is especially important at this time because manhattan district attorney alvin bragg has seemingly folded and will not pursue criminal charges against trump notes banzhaf the other remaining major investigation of whether trump can be criminally charged with inciting the january 6th riot presents many legal and other problems including a major free speech constitutional defense which are not present if willis proceeds with her promise to punish all those involved in attempting to corruptly change the result of the state s election returns indeed she has a statute at her disposal seemingly meant for this very purpose and fitting these very facts as the new york times piece explains what s more georgia criminal law is some of the most favorable in the country for getting at mr trump s alleged misconduct for example there is a georgia law on the books expressly forbidding just what mr trump apparently did in ms willis s jurisdiction solicitation of election fraud under this statute a person commits criminal solicitation of election fraud when he or she intentionally solicits requests commands importunes or otherwise attempts to cause another person to engage in election fraud banzhaf s complaint to willis also charged trump with violating two additional criminal statutes ga code 21 2 603 conspiracy to commit election fraud and also ga code 21 2 597 intentional interference with performance of election duties the law professor suggests that the investigation by willis is more likely to return an indictment against trump than the other major investigation by the department of justice which is investigating whether it can and should indict him for his role in allegedly inciting a riot on january 6th here are four reasons why trump s january speech first he says the evidence in georgia is clear and uncomplicated unlike the words of trump s january speech which many see as ambiguous and where prosecutors might have to argue from possible inferences in the georgia case the language of trump s telephone call to is very precise in its demands the tone on the audio recording shows that trump was not joking or speaking in generalities others who listened to the call undoubtedly made notes and passed some of them to trump and there is ample supplemental evidence of trump s criminal intent to affect the election results the fact that trump in a position to direct the department of justice specifically mentioned possible criminal penalties if his wishes were not granted and had others in his camp place similar calls provides overwhelming evidence of his criminal intent concludes banzhaf who notes that many other criminal law experts including several very familiar with georgia law have publicly announced that they have reached the same conclusion second an indictment and trial in georgia would not raise suspicion and create very bad optics of an incoming president seeking political retribution and protection from competition in future elections by trying to throw his opposition into prison incoming presidents jailing their predecessors is what we and others around the world associate with tin horn dictators in third world countries with corrupt governments not the u s banzhaf argues here it s even worse because polls indicate that trump would be the strongest opponent of joe biden or of any other democrat in the 2024 presidential race so indicting him much less putting him behind bars during this election would be seen by many as a politically motivated prosecution also for many it would seem unfair to invoke the full resources of the united states government against one person even a rich and powerful one such as trump a prosecution by a county da would avoid all of these problems and perceptions notes banzhaf so it might even have a greater chance of success and of avoiding juror nullification at a trial third there is no free speech problem as there would be in a criminal prosecution based upon trump s speech at the rally under the supreme court s brandenburg ruling the government may criminally punish someone for making a political speech only if it is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action in other words it must create a clear and present danger but since considerable time elapsed between trump s speech and the lawless actions by his followers enough time for example for authorities to have taken preventive steps if seemingly warranted it s not clear that the lawless action was imminent in the same sense of a hypothetical crowd being urged to hang him now more importantly can it be said much less proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the statements were likely to provoke lawless action for example at the time of the speeches why didn t various public and law enforcement officials issue clear warnings about possible lawlessness if his words were likely to incite or produce violence if they didn t this suggests that even professionals may not have believed that lawless action was likely not just possible or conceivable in this regard hindsight may be questionable suspect and not very persuasive argues banzhaf finally willis plans to use georgia s rico its racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act in any prosecution of trump banzhaf who is familiar with the federal rico statute since he produced the memo which led to the federal government s successful rico prosecution against the major tobacco companies points out that the georgia rico statute is even more powerful and far reaching than the federal one among other things it defines racketeering more broadly than the federal law does takes less to prove a pattern of racketeering activity and does not always require the existence of an enterprise especially an illegal or criminal enterprise to constitute racketeering indeed willis successfully used rico to prosecute a teacher cheating case at a school also notes banzhaf although rico requires at least two independent illegal racketeering activities predicate acts to prove a pattern of corruption by trump and his alleged co conspirators making false statements such as trump and some of his allies are alleged to have made would more than satisfy georgia s rico law racketeering which is a felony in georgia can carry penalties of up to 20 years in prison a hefty fine and disgorgements of ill gotten gains most felons in georgia convicted of racketeering offenses do serve time in prison so with manhattan now out of the running and persons very close to and closely involved with trump finally being subpoenaed everyone who feels that trump must be prosecuted should keep a very sharp eye on fani willis in georgia counsels the law professor updated on

the good brigade it s a bleak mid winter for most of the cyclical stocks as 2022 s bear market has taken its toll on high beta assets nonetheless with chaos comes opportunity today s article is a pair trade analysis many of our readers might be surprised at our selections as we ve been bearish on ford nyse f for quite some time now and we released a bullish article on tesla nasdaq tsla earlier this year however the financial markets are fluid as such we ve changed our minds and we re now bullish on ford and bearish on tesla here s why a look at stock market dynamics risk aversion is ugly for most investors unless you understand beta sensitivity beta sensitivity measures the covariance between a stock and the market relative to the variance of the broader market additionally beta sensitivity looks at market segmentation which parts assets into different categories that are independently correlated to different phases of the economic cycle based on the chart below it s relatively straightforward that since the turn of the year higher dividend stocks low volatility and value stocks have outperformed the s p 500 on a normalized basis this is quite common as investors usually seek high dividend portfolios during inflationary environments low volatility portfolios during uncertain markets and value portfolios in early to mid stage bear markets koyfin if we consider the yield curve below it s clear that the economic climate is expected to contract until further ado the higher interest rates would likely cause stock market capital to further center towards the aforementioned factors high dividend low volatility and value gurufocus thus although ford s stock exhibits high volatility beta of 1 21 it could benefit from its high forward dividend yield of 3 43 and its price to book ratio 1 04x which is at a 16 11 5 year discount on the other end of the spectrum tesla pays no dividend has a high beta 2 11 and is an overvalued stock at a price to book of 22 30x so based on market segmentation dynamics which were initiated by eugene fame and kenneth french and developed by numerous other researchers ford stock is likely to proliferate in the current market while tesla stock could decline operating differentials i want to part the operational discussion into subheadings here as i believe it would make for clearer reading however there s a preliminary discussion that needs to take place first let s discuss ev and ice growth before we get into the nitty gritty the addressable market for electronic vehicles evs by region is anticipated to grow by north of 20 in europe asia and north america until 2026 as most of you know tesla is an ev pure play but ford is still pivoting into ev specifically only 2 86 of the company s north american sales are ev statista on the other side of the spectrum the forecasted cagr for ice internal combustion vehicles geared towards ford is at 4 5 until 2027 however the addressable market is still significantly more prominent with ev uptake still growing as an example a recent report by ing claims that in may this year only 13 of global car registrations were evs although it s solid progress it remains a small part of the overall addressable market seeking alpha ing ford s key operating metrics ford released a report this week in which it unveiled its worst ever china sales quarter this definitely shouldn t be overlooked the company s sales decreased by 22 year over year however much of the regional sales decline could be re ignited with china s 220 billion stimulus plan and pandemic re openings of the nation s economy furthermore ford delivered a stellar u s june sales report which admittedly shocked me the company s u s motor sales rose by 31 5 and its ev sales surged by 76 6 this report illustrates that ford possesses resiliency as it can perform well during a cyclical economic downturn quantitative metrics convey ford s strength the company s market share as of last year was dominant although the chart is lagged it provides enough of a trend line to suggest that ford s year end 2022 market share will likely be impressive as its organic growth is noteworthy for instance ford s profits from continuing operations sit at a 5 year cagr of 25 18 which is illustrious considering the company s maturity level statista lastly ford is successfully monetizing its capex as seen by the upward sloping revenue capex ratio below ford s capex has surged by 16 87 year over year implying that the company s growth prospects remain intact data by ycharts tesla s key operating metrics tesla s growth in the past decade has been sumptuous there s no denying that however i feel as though all of that growth has already been priced in by the market give me a chance to explain why seeking alpha we all saw this week that warren buffett backed byd otcpk byddf had exceeded tesla in ev sales although i m not claiming that this event in isolation is enough to sway tesla into a failure i m arguing that the industry has reached a hyper competitive stage as such we can t rely on tesla s exponential ex post growth metrics and we need to consider the possibility of its income statement receding to a more normalized distribution furthermore tesla s on the back of a weak broad based sales report sure the company s preliminary june china sales lifted by 1 42x amid manufacturing re openings however the firm s holistic sales declined by 17 9 year over year in its second quarter although much of tesla s receding second quarter sales was due to lockdowns in china it s clear as well that the demand side for ev vehicles is finding calm lastly tesla isn t monetizing its capex as well as ford the downward trend line of tesla s capex to revenue related to the firm allocating 68 23 less to the line item than its 5 year average implies that growth could stagnate soon data by ycharts valuation although i mentioned valuation in the a look at stock market dynamics section this should be treated as an independent vantage point although not mutually exclusive the previously mentioned price to book metrics were for market segmentation purposes yet a holistic valuation must be performed to juxtapose the two stocks let s start with ford based on a holistic relative valuation ford is trading below its sales below the generally accepted benchmark for price to cash flow 10x and at a price to earnings which is 63 99 below the sector median price to earnings 4 06x price to sales 0 35x price to cash flow 4 59x click to enlarge source seeking alpha ford valuation moving on to tesla tesla needs to be considered differently as it exhibits secular growth prospects thus looking at the stock s price to sales and price to cash flow metrics are more appropriate as they can be utilized for hypergrowth stocks whereas most of the other price multiples can t based on tesla s relative valuation metrics the stock s trading at a premium to its sales and its cash flow i d usually say that it shouldn t be a worry considering we re in a bear market i d opine that tesla s overvalued status could be a problem for its stock price to sales 11 85x price to cash flow 54 89x click to enlarge source seeking alpha tesla valuation in a nutshell evidence implies that ford is undervalued on a relative basis although tesla is in an exponential growth phase its top line cash and accrual metrics imply that it s an overvalued stock concluding thoughts based on an array of quantitative metrics and a robust qualitative overlay it s clear that tesla and ford face opposing destinies ford positions itself as a high dividend value play while tesla is an overvalued asset with significant commercial headwinds i m not exceptionally bullish on durable goods at the moment nevertheless if i were an auto centric investor i d sell tesla and buy ford as a pair trade
san francisco california courted and then jilted by the world s richest person twitter looks well positioned to win a court battle with elon musk over a 1 billion breakup fee and more but the company will not emerge unscathed the entire saga has left observers baffled by what wedbush analyst dan ives described as one of the craziest business stories ever i think it starts off as a circus show and it s ending as a circus show ives told afp musk the founder of electric car company tesla sent a letter to twitter on friday saying he was pulling out of the controversial deal he made in april to buy the platform for 54 20 per share or 44 billion in total but such merger agreements are designed to prevent buyers from getting cold feet and deciding they want to walk away explains ann lipton a professor of law at tulane university who specializes in corporate litigation musk who also heads spacex has accused the social media giant of false and misleading representations about the number of fake accounts on its platform his lawyers also point to recent twitter employee layoffs and hiring freezes which they say are contrary to the company s obligation to continue operating normally those arguments may be valid but they do not merit pulling out of the deal says lipton dismissing them as nitpicky it s not enough unless he can show that the representations about fake accounts are not just false but also that they dramatically call the fundamentals of the deal into question she explains looks very much like musk is legally wrong twitter would die off that leaves the possibility that the multi billionaire is actually trying to renegotiate the price down this tactic has been used successfully elsewhere such as by lvmh two years ago the global luxury giant broke off a deal to acquire tiffany before getting a discount but experts don t see how musk and twitter could agree on a different price at this point given that the platform s stock has lost more than a quarter of its value since late april both have a lot to lose lipton points out if twitter wins in court the mercurial entrepreneur will at a minimum have to pay a few billion dollars in damages at worst he could be forced to honor his commitment and buy twitter at a price that has become exorbitant while his fortune has melted down by tens of billions of dollars in recent months but though this would be a victory for shareholders it would still leave twitter in musk s hands and his libertarian vision of absolute free speech is not aligned with that of many of the employees users and advertisers on whom the platform s business model depends twitter is worse off than six months ago but in the long run it s better off without him says creative strategies analyst carolina milanesi it feels like a toy that a spoiled kid wants but doesn t really know what to do with so he would get bored of it and not give it the attention it deserves and forget it in a corner twitter would die off slowly and painfully she predicts battle on all fronts any court proceedings are expected to last for months especially since musk will drag it out according to lipton twitter is in a strong position she says but musk followed by more than 100 million people on the platform will try to embarrass them it will be distracting and demoralizing for employees she argues he has already harassed the platform with highly critical tweets mockery and outlandish suggestions encouraged by his many fans for twitter it s going be a battle on all fronts keeping employees competitors going after their business brand issues investors believing the numbers says ives the wedbush analyst unlike its silicon valley neighbors twitter has never been a money making machine able to turn users attention into astronomical advertising revenues the past few months have been a huge distraction for twitter keeping it from focusing on its business fundamentals notes debra williamson of emarketer if musk is able to terminate the deal twitter will still be left with the same problems it had before he came on the scene she says its user growth is slowing and while ad revenue is still growing marginally twitter is now dealing with a slowing economy that could squeeze ad spending on all social platforms related stories musk pulls plug on 44 b twitter deal elon musk grimes welcome first child together

published sun 10 jul 2022 10 10 am last updated sun 10 jul 2022 10 44 am the us dollar has been surging so much that it s nearly equal in value to the euro for the first time in 20 years that trend though threatens to hurt american companies because their goods become more expensive for foreign buyers if us exports were to weaken as a result so too would the already slowing us economy yet there s a positive side for americans too a stronger buck provides modest relief from runaway inflation because the vast array of goods that are imported to the us from cars and computers to toys and medical equipment become less expensive a strengthened dollar also delivers bargains to american tourists sightseeing in europe from amsterdam to athens the us dollar index which measures the value of american money against six major foreign currencies has jumped nearly 12 per cent this year to a two decade high the euro is now worth just under 1 02 also read the dollar is climbing mainly because the federal reserve is raising interest rates more aggressively than central banks in other countries are in its effort to cool the hottest us inflation in four decades the fed s rate hikes cause yields on us treasurys to rise which attracts investors seeking richer yields than they can get elsewhere in the world this increased demand for dollar denominated securities in turn boosts the dollar s value also contributing to the currency s appeal notes rubeela farooqi of high frequency economics is that despite concern about a potential recession in the united states the us economy is on firmer footing compared to europe also read not since july 15 2002 has the euro been valued at less than one dollar on that day the euro blew past parity with the dollar as huge us trade deficits and accounting scandals on wall street pulled down the us currency this year the euro has sagged largely because of growing fears that the 19 countries that use the currency will sink into recession the war in ukraine has magnified oil and gas prices and punished european consumers and businesses in particular russia s recent reduction in natural gas supplies has sent prices skyrocketing and raised fears of a total cutoff that could force governments to ration energy to industry to spare homes schools and hospitals european leaders have denounced moscow s move as an effort to blackmail europe

european slowdown could eventually give the european central bank less leeway to raise rates and moderate economic growth to address its own inflation problem the ecb has announced that it will raise its key interest rate by a quarter point when it meets later this month and possibly by up to a half point in september a weaker euro feeds inflationary pressures by making imports to europe more expensive analysts at unicredit said global recession fears were a prime driver in foreign exchange markets amid the general view that the fed might ultimately have more opportunity than many other central banks to raise rates the analysts also noted the dollar s role as a globally recognized safe haven in light of recent financial market turmoil as another factor that s boosting demand for the buck in the meantime the dollar s rise is complicating an already uncertain outlook for the united states the world s biggest economy on the one hand the stronger greenback makes foreign goods less expensive for americans and eases inflationary pressures but not by much mark zandi chief economist at moody s analytics calculates that a 10 per cent rise in the dollar over the past year against the currencies of its trading partners reduced inflation by about 0 4 percentage point though zandi calls that a meaningful impact he notes that consumer prices have soared 8 6 per cent over the past year the biggest year over year gain since 1981 and a sturdier currency takes a toll on us companies that do business overseas for one thing it erodes the profits of multinational companies that rely on overseas sales the stronger dollar makes their foreign revenue worth less when they convert it to dollars and bring it home the united states microsoft for example last month downgraded the outlook for its april june earnings due to unfavourable foreign exchange rate movement worse a stronger dollar makes us made products more expensive in overseas markets while giving foreign products a price edge in the united states the stronger dollar zandi said weighs on economic growth as it results in reduced exports more imports and thus a wider trade deficit indeed a growing trade gap subtracted 3 2 percentage points from us economic growth in the january march period that was the main reason why the nation s gross domestic product the broadest gauge of economic output shrank at a 1 6 per cent annual rate in the first quarter economists say the risk of recession is already rising in the united states as the fed raises borrowing costs and consumers deplete the savings they built up during the pandemic the strength of the dollar said eswar prasad an economist at cornell university and the brookings institution will certainly do no favors for us exporters

johannesburg the acquittal by the south gauteng high court this past week of four police officers charged for the alleged killing of mthokozisi ntumba has shocked many ntumba was killed during a student protest in braamfontein while he was leaving a surgery he had been visiting in the area from what we know the case was dismissed because the state failed to secure the appearance of the technician naresh suredin who would have given testimony about the cctv footage that allegedly shows the incidents surrounding ntumba s killing the claims by the state that they could not secure surendin s appearance has since been proved wrong by one of the daily newspapers which located suredin and spoke to him as if to add salt to the injury surendin is said to have stated that he was never summoned to appear in court on the other hand the country is still waiting for the finalisation of the case brought against the mobile phone giant vodacom by the inventor of the call me back platform nkosana makate even though makate won the case against the mobile phone giant the company has used every avenue available to them in law to reduce the compensation due to him in another case former steinhoff ceo markus jooste is yet to pay a fine for insider trading after he is alleged to have sent out an sms to four friends warning them to sell off their shares in steinhoff just before the spectacular collapse of the group s stocks the financial services tribunal set aside a r162 million fine imposed on him in october 2020 by the financial sector conduct authority the tribunal argued that the sms was not explicit and ordered the authority to redetermine an appropriate fine meaning a lesser penalty marius jooste former c e o of steinhoff these and many other cases which demonstrate inconsistencies in how the entire justice system approaches cases is what some people have attempted to raise as evidence of how the law is applied differentially depending on the race class gender and of late factional politics that one may be identified with unfortunately and unlike say in the usa where a well established tradition of critical socio legal studies exists our legal scholarship in south africa is still dominated by the liberal tradition with its fallacy of the objective rule of law equality before the law and fairness within and by the legal system almost all law academics and most legal practitioners subscribe to the liberal school it is for this reason that those who raise even a short sentence that is critical of the legal system are dismissed and negatively labelled a chorus made of the practitioners themselves academics ngo actors and many in the mainstream drown out any critical voice that attempts to draw attention to the inherent contradictions of the legal system students of marxism on the other hand believe steadfastly that the law is the instrument of the ruling class that it reflects the class dynamics of any given society the rich and powerful are mostly favoured by the legal system while the poor and powerless often find themselves on the sharp end of the stick summing up the marxist perspective on crime karl thompson observed that the legal system police lawyers and the courts are used to control the masses prevent revolution and keep people in a state of false consciousness revisiting crimes of the powerful marxism crime and deviance edited by steven bittle laureen snider steve tombs and david whyte is a collection of scholarly essays that examine how the powerful in most societies manipulate the justice system to their favour the collection revisits the 1976 book by frank pearce that went by the same title crimes of the powerful marxism crime and deviance pearce was thus the first to coin the concept of the crimes of the powerful referring to the actions of the rich companies and powerful politicians and how they often collude to break the law and at times use it against the poor and powerless divided into three main sections the collection demonstrates how the powerful in most societies are protected by the law abuse legal processes and victimise the poor and powerless nkosana kenneth makate former vodacom employee during an interview in jhb gauteng photo leon nicholas the first section examines theoretical and conceptual understandings of the law and the criminal justice system as enablers of ruling class dominance and manipulation it is this analysis that is sorely missing in south africa where all known public commentators on the legal system present predictable analysis of the system regurgitating tired liberal theories and agitating for the disciplining and punishment of offenders in order to deter those who may want to offend the contributors in this section demonstrate how capitalist societies produce ideological whitewashing of the crimes of the powerful while on the other hand tightening coercion against the powerless capital accumulation is also examined as an enabler for exemption from accountability the ideological apparatus of capital represented as it were by liberal commentators and the mainstream media reinforce this clear examples of these include how alleged private sector violators are said to engage only in insider trading collusion and negligence and not plain corruption and crime which is what they do section two provides case studies in the recent research into the crimes of the powerful here different contributors examine crimes committed by major corporations the rigging of interbank interest rates crimes committed by the fossil fuel and gas industry colluding with politicians against poor communities rampant use of pesticides and we may add here genetic modification of crops wage exploitation as a crime against the workers and the construction of major dams as an act of appropriating natural resources for private benefit while causing devastating damage to the environment the final section examines the confluence between state actions and the criminal acts of the powerful here the contributors point to new research on how the powerful in society are enabled by the state to commit their crimes and extract benefits from the criminal justice system the global or imperialist dimensions of crime are also examined in ways that liberal commentators always fail to show while written from an international perspective and examining jurisdictions that are different from ours the book is critical reading for two major reasons as argued earlier the local legal scholarship and commentariat is dominated by the sterile liberal tradition that upholds the fallacy of the fairness of the legal system a radical perspective of the law crime and the justice system is sorely missing in south africa second some of the developments within the political financial and broader economic realms which often require the intervention of the legal system and how the system responds to and is in fact used and abused by those involved will better be understood if we adopted elements of radical analysis as the compilers of this book have done long standing and recent allegations against business leaders and some politicians and how some are made to pay for their sins while others literally get away with murder can best be understood if the analysis in this book was to be employed by academics activists commentators and journalists

i didn t grow up in the marvel universe between the ages of 8 and 13 i was raptly devoted to dc comics to the adventures of superman flash green lantern and the whole crew of the justice league of america in fact one of the half dozen greatest days of my life occurred when a friend simply gave me two dozen dc comics he no longer wanted after riding my bike home from his house i spread out this miraculous bounty under a living room lamp and then spent a long evening with a plate of freshly baked cookies while reading reading reading my heart almost bursting with delight all this past spring then i was eagerly looking forward to recapturing some of that ancient enchantment by immersing myself in six colorful volumes of marvel superhero comics three penguin classics collections of the early adventures of spider man captain america and black panther and three folio society best of collections devoted to spider man captain america and hulk for fans both series are desirable and contain little overlap the general editor of the penguin editions ben saunders a comics scholar from the university of oregon provides historical background on how stan lee jack kirby steve ditko and others co created these modern legends contemporary writers such as qiana j whitted gene luen yang jason reynolds and nnedi okorafor contribute additional introductions or winningly personal forewords appendixes feature recommended reading lists and sometimes supplemental essays such as don mcgregor s memoir of how he wrote the multi issue panther s rage which supplied some of the plot elements to the black panther movie each of these collectible penguin hardbacks runs to roughly 350 pages and is priced at 50 paperback editions cost 28 the folio society volumes cost 125 apiece but for purists they offer a slightly more authentic reading experience while penguin s imaging is bright and crisp its paper stock looks a little too shiny smooth and white folio more faithfully replicates the slightly faded colors and pulpiness of the original comics roy thomas a former editor in chief at marvel not only chose the contents of each omnibus but also outlines the creative decisions behind these high spot adventures of hulk spider man and captain america each volume is housed in a sturdy slipcase and comes with a significant extra a separate facsimile of the actual issue in which the superhero first appeared now comes the sad part being a devotee of older popular fiction i was surprised no dismayed that these marvel comics never really cast a spell on me perhaps i expected too much from them while the art and page layouts are dynamic and highly imaginative the writing ranges from hokey to flatly utilitarian to histrionic the stories carry few surprises and the majority contain the same general plot driver an acute tension between each protagonist s actual self and his public persona between the all too human beings inside those skintight get ups and the formidable superhumans they have been called to be as a result nearly all marvel superheroes at least as far back as the 1960s fantastic four are troubled and unhappy they accept that great power confers great responsibility but remain unsure whether they can shoulder the burden in principle their self doubt sometimes verging on self pity invests them with a humanizing psychological complexity similarly we are even made to sympathize with their adversaries who regularly view themselves as deeply wronged or entitled to revenge angst among both heroes and villains is the predominant emotion within the marvel universe thus the teenage spider man lacerates himself as a social misfit and suffers guilt over the deaths of several loved ones thawed from a cryonic deep freeze world war ii s captain america feels alienated in the modern era and misses his long dead junior partner bucky barnes black panther endures both physical ordeals and grave questions about his worthiness to carry on the kingdom of wakanda s traditions and the invincible hulk is dumbly aware that inside his green skin lingers an unwillingly transformed bruce banner banner s own hulk inducing rages are eventually almost inevitably shown to be a consequence of abuse as a child compared with the dc comics i enjoyed in elementary school marvel targets a slightly older audience consisting mainly of adolescents and 20 somethings who can readily identify with sensitive emotionally roiled characters no doubt this shift was partly market driven older readers have deeper pockets than allowance dependent 10 year olds but marvel s better writers and artists were also hungering to make it new to explore and extend the aesthetic possibilities and cultural impact of their medium something which contrarian underground comix had already been doing after all before this still ongoing sea change superhero comics generally proffered a suburban picket fence vision of american life and hurtfully ignored social sexual and racial realities in that sense today s marvel universe represents a highly welcome advance nonetheless by growing increasingly relevant and naturalistic superhero comics not just from marvel gradually lost much of their joy along with their naivete that process though has barely begun in these albums which emphasize work published in the 1960s 70s and 80s here the story arcs still tend to be as action oriented as one could want pitting costumed good guys against highly melodramatic bad guys mad scientists and improbable monsters by contrast contemporary superhero comics from a variety of publishers are quite another matter my childhood s brightly colored land of dreams has morphed into a universe of nightmares and case histories enter any specialty comics shop the days of drugstore spinner racks are sadly long gone and the darkness will surround you much of the artwork you ll see is shadowy stylized and brutalist while numerous covers spotlight busty super babes in gleaming leather but as i say that s now for the most part these penguin and folio society retrospectives only hint at the bleakness to come claims for artistic greatness however strike me as exaggerated you may feel differently michael dirda will be away for the rest of the summer his weekly book columns for the washington post will resume on sept 8 folio society comics collections
opinion richard latimer guest columnist it is obvious that steve gallant is not as he says a math major june 19 he compares the number of covid 19 deaths under president biden unfavorably against those that occurred under trump in a linear fashion as if it were a matter of simple arithmetic that betrays a basic ignorance of mathematics as applied to mass phenomena like a pandemic infections and death during a pandemic increase geometrically where patient number 1 unmasked and unvaccinated infects patients number 2 3 or 4 each of whom unmasked and unvaccinated proceeds to infect several more unmasked and unvaccinated patients and so on this is not measured by a straight line but an upward curve and that curve increased exponentially during trump s presidency but has been on a steady downturn under president biden trump should have been removed not simply for the number of pandemic deaths that occurred but the reason why the curve increased so dramatically during the first quarter of 2020 when trump minimized the threat falsely claiming he had it under control he had gutted the national security council s global health unit that president obama created for counterproliferation and biodefense to organize rapid pandemic responses which would have in fact started to get it under control much earlier saving many thousands of lives more opinion letters we are not to blame for mass shootings when covid 19 initially began to infect americans in significant numbers trump dismissed concern about the potential for pandemic related deaths calling it a democrat hoax comparing it with the flu which he said causes only 35 000 deaths annually at that time february 2020 there had been no known covid 19 deaths in the u s but there had been 2 857 deaths in china since the start of january when the virus emerged there trump consistently downplayed the risk as on april 3 2020 when he questioned the cdc s advice on wearing a mask thus fueling the anti mask element of the republican base he did not authorize operation warp speed to develop vaccines until the end of april 2020 obama s pandemic response team would have had vaccine development well underway by then and mask mandates recommended saving many thousand american lives trump was more concerned about the stock market and his own political advantage than the public s health mr gallant s included and that is why trump should have been removed for his handling of the covid 19 pandemic based on his self promotion arrogance and stupidity in the face of a real public health emergency that is also why he in fact lost the election in 2020 with we the people removing him from office for cause richard latimer falmouth

elon musk the chief executive officer of tesla and the world s richest person said on friday he was terminating his 44b deal to buy twitter because the social media company had breached multiple provisions of the merger agreement twitter s chairman bret taylor said on the micro blogging platform that the board planned to pursue legal action to enforce the merger agreement the twitter board is committed to closing the transaction on the price and terms agreed upon with mr musk he wrote in a filing musk s lawyers said twitter had failed or refused to respond to multiple requests for information on fake or spam accounts on the platform which is fundamental to the company s business performance twitter is in material breach of multiple provisions of that agreement appears to have made false and misleading representations upon which mr musk relied when entering into the merger agreement the filing said musk also said he was walking away because twitter fired high ranking executives and one third of the talent acquisition team breaching twitter s obligation to preserve substantially intact the material components of its current business organization musk s decision is likely to result in a protracted legal tussle between the billionaire and the 16 year old san francisco based company disputed mergers and acquisitions that land in delaware courts more often than not end up with the companies re negotiating deals or the acquirer paying the target a settlement to walk away rather than a judge ordering that a transaction be completed that is because target companies are often keen to resolve the uncertainty around their future and move on twitter however is hoping that court proceedings will start in a few weeks and be resolved in a few months according to a person familiar with the matter there is plenty of precedent for a deal renegotiation several companies repriced agreed acquisitions when the covid 19 pandemic broke out in 2020 and delivered a global economic shock in one instance french retailer lvmh threatened to walk away from a deal with tiffany co the us jewellery retailer agreed to lower the acquisition price by 425m to 15 8b i d say twitter is well positioned legally to argue that it provided him with all the necessary information and this is a pretext to looking for any excuse to get out of the deal said ann lipton associate dean for faculty research at tulane law school shares of twitter were down 6pc at 34 58 in extended trading that is 36pc below the 54 20 per share musk agreed to buy twitter for in april twitter s shares surged after musk took a stake in the company in early april shielding it from a deep stock market sell off that slammed other social media platforms but after he agreed on april 25 to buy twitter the stock within a matter of days began to fall as investors speculated musk might walk away from the deal with its tumble after the bell on friday twitter was trading at its lowest since march the announcement is another twist in a will he won t he saga after musk clinched the deal to purchase twitter in april but then put the buyout on hold until the social media company proved that spam bots account for less than 5pc of its total users the contract calls for musk to pay twitter a 1b break up if he cannot complete the deal for reasons such as the acquisition financing falling through or regulators blocking the deal the break up fee would not be applicable however if musk terminates the deal on his own some employees expressed disbelief and exhaustion on friday publicly posting memes on twitter such as of a rollercoaster ride and a baby screaming into a phone in apparent commentary on the breakup employees have worried about what the deal will mean for their jobs pay and ability to work remotely and many have expressed scepticism about musk s plans to loosen content moderation musk s abandonment of the deal and twitter s promise to vigorously fight to complete it casts a pall of uncertainty over the company s future and its stock price during a time when worries about rising interest rates and a potential recession have hammered wall street shares of online advertising rivals alphabet meta platforms snap and pinterest have seen their stocks tumble 45pc on average in 2022 while twitter s stock has declined just 15pc in that time buoyed in recent months by the musk deal daniel ives an analyst at wedbush said musk s filing was bad news for twitter this is a disaster scenario for twitter and its board as now the company will battle musk in an elongated court battle to recoup the deal and or the breakup fee of 1b at a minimum he wrote in a note to clients
by george magnus oxford for more than three decades the global economy was defined by unbridled integration and unprecedented interdependence neither political spats nor localized wars could slow the globalization train markets were markets business was business and multinational firms became more multinational not anymore in this new era of strategic competition between china and the west disengagement is the order of the day while this trend will impede economic growth increase business costs via supply chain restructuring and raise prices for everyone the economy that loses the most may well be china s the people s republic would not be where it is today without globalization international trade investment and capital market access drove economic growth while knowledge transfer aided by engagement among students scientists and scholars enabled technological leveling up ties with the outside world also forced china to introduce a legal system capable of establishing and enforcing contract and intellectual property law and the expansion of china s economic might enabled the country increasingly to project power abroad but in recent years the openness that underpinned globalization the rising tide that lifted all boats has given way to a geopolitically focused zero sum mindset international commerce and finance have increasingly been shaped by national security considerations export controls the blacklisting of companies and restrictions on market access in sensitive sectors such as certain cutting edge technologies have become commonplace the sino american rivalry has reflected and accelerated this shift the united states has targeted china with a variety of measures including restrictions on imports exports and investment and added dozens of chinese companies to its so called entity list other countries have also increased their scrutiny of chinese investment and restricted certain types of commercial exchanges with china sanctions over china s human rights abuses in xinjiang and hong kong have been introduced as well china might not have initiated the disengagement process but it seems committed to seeing it through in refusing to condemn russia s war on ukraine its leaders made clear that in their view the u s and the west more broadly is in terminal decline and now is the time to challenge the existing world order beyond retaliatory sanctions and tariffs china has been ramping up its efforts to become self reliant in advanced technology and science through highly state centric and protectionist industrial policies its goal is to sanction proof its economy especially by de americanizing its supply chains the extent to which this is possible is impossible to know precisely but china s efforts to achieve self reliance will certainly not succeed across the board as the economist reported in february china is struggling the most in areas where supply chains are longer and more complex such as mrna vaccines agrochemicals computer operating systems and payments systems in semiconductors china remains dependent on foreign suppliers despite government investment worth tens of billions of dollars china has similarly failed to break its foreign dependency in aerospace and automobiles and its efforts to develop a renminbi based alternative to u s dollar based finance and payments systems have yet to gain traction but china s bid for self reliance might not only fail it could backfire as the economist report also pointed out when chinese companies are cut off from foreign competition and expertise their capabilities are stunted despite the unfavorable economic consequences we should expect geopolitics driven disengagement to continue china will try to build an alternative financial infrastructure and the u s will delist chinese firms from its stock exchanges the u s congress is already reportedly considering legislation to restrict or prohibit u s foreign direct investment abroad in several sensitive sectors much as it does to chinese investment in the u s trade measures aimed at diversifying supply chains and ensuring supplies of critical inputs such as rare earths are also to be expected as disengagement progresses many critical sectors such as the internet will likely split into two distinct blocs each with its own rules and standards the divide in digital standards data management and usage provisions and network equipment and telecommunications services will grow market access restrictions and new approval and licensing requirements will proliferate these changes will come at a time when china is already grappling with several serious challenges including unfavorable demographics a weak property market an over extended banking sector stalled productivity politicized governance and the consequences of its zero covid policy china s economic miracle seems to be well past its peak annual economic growth could well drop to 2 3 percent in the coming years meaning that the official goal of doubling per capita income and gdp between 2020 and 2035 would not be realized this slowdown will have far reaching consequences for starters china s ability to compete with the u s will be compromised china s economy might never overtake america s especially if the renminbi s value falls by 20 25 percent over the next few years moreover prices for commodities especially those that are key to china s housing and construction sector will decline while the higher costs of newer more regional supply chains will generate inflationary pressures weaker chinese demand and a cheaper renminbi will reduce them foreign investment flows into china will decline with funding increasingly allocated to other asian countries or emerging markets while china will not become uninvestable as long as military conflict does not break out international investors will keep their china portfolios underweight though the renminbi will enjoy a status on par with the japanese yen the british pound and the canadian dollar it will not come close to displacing the u s dollar chinese president xi jinping has staked his government s legitimacy on china s continued prosperity but that is becoming increasingly difficult to deliver and disengagement is an important reason why george magnus a research associate at the university of oxford s china centre

with the largest pension payments in state history being made connecticut taxpayers will be saving billions of dollars over the next two decades a new actuarial analysis released thursday says taxpayers will save an estimated 11 5 billion over the next 24 years through reduced payments for debt the savings total an average of more than 440 million per year after about 5 3 billion has been earmarked to fund the long neglected pension funds for decades the state legislature and multiple governors failed to set aside the amount needed to pay for the pensions leading to about 40 billion in unfunded liability today for state employees and teachers officials said thursday but that is being turned around with surplus money that includes a historic payment of 3 7 billion from the just completed fiscal year on top of an additional 1 6 billion the previous year as economic volatility impacts all aspects of everyday life the state s budgetary situation is increasingly stable and still improving in stark contrast to the years of sacrifice and chaos following the great recession state comptroller natalie braswell said in releasing an independent financial analysis a series of reforms that were negotiated by republican and democratic legislators in 2017 prevented the legislature from spending additional money that has been generated from capital gains on wall street as such that money has been set aside in the rainy day fund for fiscal emergencies that has now reached about 7 billion the 3 7 billion payment for the pensions will be taken from the 7 billion fund with wall street losing more than 20 of its value in a bear market the state has taken a cautious approach in revenue forecasting for the current fiscal year that started on july 1 capital gains are expected to be down about 14 and the pass through entity tax which is paid largely by rich investors who operate through limited liability companies is also expected to be down by 14 in the current fiscal year my hunch is you ll see more of a dip when it comes to capital gains said gov ned lamont a longtime greenwich investor who follows the stock market closely while the state had an operating surplus of more than 1 billion for the just completed year that ended on june 30 the projected deficit for the 2024 fiscal year is about 800 million which is an improvement from an earlier deficit projection of 1 2 billion it will change state budget director jeffrey beckham said of the projected deficit it could get better on the campaign trail republican gubernatorial candidate bob stefanowski of madison has repeatedly said that the state should offer tax cuts of 1 billion representing about one third of the rainy day fund that includes immediately reducing the state sales tax to 5 99 down from the current 6 35 lawmakers should also eliminate the 1 surcharge on prepared foods at supermarkets and restaurants he said he has also called for suspending the gross receipts tax on gasoline which is about 26 cents per gallon and is collected separately from an additional 25 cents per gallon excise tax that has been suspended until dec 1 as republicans have done for months stefanowski is calling for suspending the highway use tax on large trucks that is scheduled to begin on jan 1 2023 and would raise about 90 million per year to be sitting on a 3 5 billion rainy day fund when it is pouring rain right now on every single small business and every single person in connecticut is absolutely unconscionable stefanowski said recently but lamont sharply rejected those ideas thursday i disagree with him profoundly on that lamont said when asked by the courant the rainy day fund is there in the face of a recession to make darn sure i don t have to raise anybody s taxes or slash spending i think this is a buffer it s a cushion it s a smart thing to do for the people stefanowski though countered that the 24 2 billion state budget was balanced largely because of billions in funding from the federal government in responding to the nationwide coronavirus pandemic stefanowski and republican legislators have repeatedly complained that lamont and the legislature did not move to block the 9 cents per gallon increase in the diesel tax on july 1 the governor s celebrations from under the capitol dome are completely out of touch with reality for connecticut s working and middle class families said senate republican leader kevin kelly and deputy leader paul formica the governor is celebrating government being awash with cash meanwhile family budgets are broken not only are connecticut democrats refusing to deliver relief now they are actually asking people to pay more taxes to a government that is flush with cash christopher keating can be reached at ckeating courant com

pipeline at the end of the quarter remained as vibrant as it had been for the last several quarters therefore loan growth will most probably remain robust through the mid of 2022 further bankwell financial has invested in a new online banking platform during the second half of 2021 which should bear fruit this year further the robust job market in bankwell financial groupâ s operating regions bodes well for loan growth the company operates in the state of connecticut where the unemployment rate is worse than the national average but still very good from a historical perspective as shown below the unemployment rate is near multi decade lows data by ycharts around 90 of the total loan portfolio is made up of commercial and industrial loans â c iâ and commercial real estate loans â creâ therefore the purchasing managers index is also a good gauge of loan demand as shown below the pmi index has continued to remain comfortably in the expansionary territory above 50 which bodes well for loan growth data by ycharts however loan growth will most probably decelerate in the latter part of 2022 because heightened interest rates will take a toll on credit demand overall i m expecting the loan portfolio to increase by 14 5 by the end of 2022 from the end of 2021 further i m expecting deposit growth to match loan growth in the last three quarters of 2022 meanwhile securities growth will lag loan growth in the last three quarters because the growth in deposits and borrowings will mostly go towards funding the heightened loan growth the following table shows my balance sheet estimates

estimates in usd million unless otherwise specified click to enlarge loan growth to counter liability sensitivity bankwell financial group s balance sheet is liability sensitive as more liabilities than assets are subject to repricing this year interest bearing transactional deposits namely negotiated order of withdrawal â nowâ money market and saving accounts made up a hefty 60 of total deposits at the end of march 2022 these deposits will re price soon after every rate hike the managementâ s interest rate sensitivity analysis given in the 10 q filing shows that a 200 basis point increase in interest rates can reduce the net interest income by 3 0 over twelve months on the plus side strong loan growth will likely drive margin expansion the management mentioned in the earnings presentation that it was originating loans at higher yields than the existing portfolioâ s average yield the yield on new loans will continue to improve in the year ahead as rates rise therefore the loan additions will lift the margin moreover loan growth will likely crowd out the growth of lower yielding assets this improvement in the asset mix will also boost the margin overall i m expecting the net interest margin to remain unchanged in the last three quarters of 2022 from 3 30 in the first quarter of the year combining the loan growth and margin estimates i m expecting the net interest income to grow by 20 year over year in 2022 the management mentioned in the earnings release that it is targeting net interest income growth of 12 to 14 in my opinion the management can easily beat this target thanks to the loan growth provision normalization likely i m not expecting the threats of a recession or heightened interest rates to boost bankwell financial groupâ s provision expense in the near term bankwell is not subject to the current expected credit losses â ceclâ accounting standard the bank calculates its allowance level in accordance with the incurred loss model as a result i believe bankwell financial will not have to bolster its reserves ahead of a possible recession unlike other banks moreover the interest rate outlook will not require additional provisioning until rates start affecting credit performance which i believe will not happen until the last quarter of 2022 on the other hand provisioning will likely increase for the existing portfolio and new loan additions this is because the current allowance level just barely covers the portfolioâ s credit risk nonperforming loans made up 0 79 of total loans at the end of march 2022 as mentioned in the earnings presentation in comparison allowances made up 0 86 of total loans as the coverage is a bit tight i believe bankwell financial will have to build its reserves to get to a more comfortable level overall i m expecting the provision expense to be at a normal level this year i m expecting the net provision expense to make up 0 12 of total loans in 2022 in comparison the net provision expense averaged 0 11 of total loans from 2017 to 2019 earnings set to grow by 21 the anticipated loan growth will likely be the chief driver of an increase in earnings this year on the other hand provision normalization will likely limit earnings growth meanwhile the margin will likely remain mostly stable for the remainder of the year overall i m expecting bankwell financial to report

author s estimates in usd million unless otherwise specified click to enlarge actual earnings may differ materially from estimates because of the risks and uncertainties related to inflation and consequently the timing and magnitude of interest rate hikes further a recession can increase the provisioning for loan losses beyond my expectation adopting a buy rating due to a high total expected return bankwell financial is offering a dividend yield of 2 5 at the current quarterly dividend rate of 0 20 per share the current dividend and earnings estimate suggest a payout ratio of 19 6 for 2022 which is in line with the average of 20 from 2017 to 2019 further bankwell financial usually increases its dividend only once per year therefore another dividend hike is out of the question for

flt180a generated protective fix levels with no bleeding or need for fix replacement the treatment was well tolerated with a good safety profile london july 10 2022 globe newswire freeline therapeutics holdings plc nasdaq frln today announced the presentation of safety and initial efficacy data from the first cohort of the phase 1 2 dose confirmation b lieve trial for flt180a the company s aavs3 based gene therapy candidate for people with hemophilia b at the international society on thrombosis and haemostasis isth congress being held in london july 9 13 2022 as of the data cut off of may 23 2022 a one time flt180a dose of 7 7e11 vg kg generated a rapid increase of coagulation factor ix fix reaching levels in the normal range 93 92 and 80 iu dl for the three patients in cohort 1 through days 77 56 and 36 respectively patients stopped fix prophylaxis and did not require fix replacement or experience bleeding following treatment with flt180a the treatment and the prophylactic immune management regimen were well tolerated no serious adverse events or infusion reactions were observed and there has been no evidence of fix inhibitors all adverse events aes were mild and most were transient aes related to immune management were consistent with the known profiles of corticosteroids and tacrolimus dosing of cohort two was completed in june with early results showing a similar initial response to flt180a based on the data from cohort one and consistent with the advice of the independent data monitoring committee of the b lieve trial patients in cohort two received the same dose of flt180a and prophylactic immune management regimen that were used in the first cohort as the data continue to evolve since the data cut off for cohort one two patients have experienced a decrease in fix expression together with a mild and transient increase in liver enzymes all patients continue to have expression levels above baseline and no patient has experienced a bleed or required fix supplementation the initial data show that flt180a provides rapid and consistent elevations in fix to normal levels which can prevent bleeding and the need for regular fix replacement in people with hemophilia b said pamela foulds md chief medical officer of freeline emerging data suggest that while fix expression was maintained at protective levels a further refined immune management regimen may be required to avoid mild and transient transaminitis and to sustain fix levels in the normal range potential adjustments in cohort two and forthcoming results from that cohort will help us interpret this further our strategy is to advance gene therapy programs that have the potential to deliver best in class or first in class treatments said michael parini chief executive officer of freeline while we continue to believe flt180a has the potential to deliver a best in class gene therapy for people with hemophilia b the availability of other treatment options and the need to prioritize our valuable resources dictate that we evaluate strategic options for flt180a these include but are not limited to seeking a partner that would enable the continuation of flt180a through phase 3 development with two other promising programs in fabry disease and gaucher disease in the clinic each with the potential to be first in class gene therapy treatments for these

are we heading into a recession a friend asked me a couple of weeks ago and i was quick to give an opinion starting with china in an order of increasing likeliness i d say the us non commodity exporting developing countries europe and the uk the uk is probably soonest to head into a painful depression i was quick to answer as quick answers go they are not based on known or knowable facts but a reflection of my own emotions pundits asset managers and the ceos of big banks and investment vehicles are dispensing their wisdom in a similar fashion they cannot know what will happen but shout at each other trying to drown out opposing views it is difficult to see the wood for the trees for everyone but as experts go they cannot lean back and admit to knowing nothing what we all can see clearly is a bout of inflation not witnessed for two generations the last time prices went bonkers in a similar fashion was in the 1970s and 80s i have tried to explain the multiple reasons for this in my last piece starting with an explosive demand push after mandated lockdowns we see greenflation chinaflation and putinflation the cost push of energy transition china s zero covid policies and its communist inspired common prosperity programme and the shortages and dangers emanating from russia s invasion of ukraine i d wish to add the inflationary effects of an ever stronger dollar and the corresponding fall of most other currencies which force countries to import inflation and we can witness the universal answer of central banks to deal with this mess they raise interest rates and shrink their balance sheets to increase the cost of money in an attempt to lower demand demand induced price exuberance can be brought under control in a gradual fashion imported inflation of the sort described above cannot it is therefore necessary to engineer a crash if inflation is to be avoided at all cost if no one buys anything goes the logic prices will have to come down the notable exceptions are the bank of japan and russia s central bank the boj after decades of crippling disinflation is for now still doubling down on monetary easing and controlling the yield curve in the hope to get at long last some inflation back into their economy as a result the yen is losing its exchange value precipitously increasing the inflationary impact of ever more costly energy imports and russia being awash with dollars derived from unhindered oil exports at ever higher prices has seen the rouble going from strength to strength this is not only due to the energy bonanza capital controls forced foreign currency conversion and sanction induced import limitations have made the dollar a less desirable currency domestically there is no use for the greenback if it cannot be used the rcb can therefore ease financial conditions domestically giving much needed support to the economy it is therefore necessary to engineer a crash if inflation is to be avoided at all cost andreas weitzer what we can also see clearly is the impact inflation higher interest rates and uncertain future demand have on financial markets and hence on our retail portfolio stocks are falling having lost more than 20 per cent of their value the us market is according to a somewhat arbitrary definition in bear territory future income expectations are sharply discounted reducing the present value of shares tech shares and start ups which promise profitability in the future are hurt most but fear of soon dwindling margins damage valuations of solid income earners like consumer goods companies too the spectre of a possible recession has recently brought down even money coiners like oil and mining companies bonds have followed suit they lose in value as interest rise higher interest rates make both mortgages and rents more expensive depressing the housing market house prices are coming down most prominently at the lower end of the price spectrum and so does the value of commercial property both gold and crypto has proven to be anything but a reliable hedge against inflation holding cash is a losing proposition investors take flight in ever more obscure alternatives like gemstones and collectibles narratives vacillate between inflation fears and recession scare between certain doom and a crisis on the way of bottoming out bond yields rise and fall on a daily basis now so does as a consequence of vacillating interest rates the valuation of shares volatility is high not only fuelled by disorientation but also by shrinking market depth data indicating market direction are contradictory contributing to disorientation and opposing quickly alternating bets the 10 year us government bonds change yields by half a per cent within days signalling worse inflation one day and a likely recession the other while inflation seems to reach double digit price rises any time soon some items in the consumer goods basket are getting cheaper a university of michigan survey gauging inflation expectations tell of 3 1 inflation five to 10 years from now and 5 3 over the next year while consumer price inflation is measured at 8 6 a broadly used measure of expectations the 10 year breakeven which subtracts inflation protected yields from unprotected 10 year treasury yields signals 2 5 at the time of writing monetary authorities dismiss fears of a recession one day but seem to reckon with it the next stock market pundits scrutinising the history of market downturns are convinced that a rebound of shares after a 20 per cent drop can only be temporary a dead cat bounce worse will come while investing in bonds when interest rates are continuously hiked upwards is a losing proposition some bond experts point to the shrinking yield differentials between stocks and bonds while us shares at current prices have an earnings yield of 5 3 investment grade bonds are sold at a yield of 4 7 and junk bonds deemed as risky as shares yield already 8 6 this view ignores worsening credit risk looking at my own investment portfolio there s not much i can do as always i am fully invested bereaving me of opportunities sadly we retail investors cannot go short which is a shame when i watch the yen changing course anytime soon i nurse losses of 15 per cent by now a third comes from currency losses the weak euro is weighing on my us referenced portfolio a third comes from my russian bonds which are nominally worthless losses on my other bonds are paper losses only as i will hold them all to maturity my share losses albeit are a reflection of the general malaise the extracting industry is less buoyant than a few weeks ago oil services companies were a losing proposition for years already and a dearth of oil field investments and the loss of the russian market is permanently depressing them fancy bets like the fake truck maker nikola or my wiped out cannabis investment will probably never recover what illustrates the current confusion of direction best is my european banking shares while rising interest rates should in principle boost profitability their shares are rightly showing the signs of weakness the whole eurozone encapsulates the energy crisis the labour crisis and endangered demand is corroding profitability as is rising credit risk banks will be hesitant to grant credit while they fear a worsening of credit standing of their clients nowhere is this more apparent than in the banks mortgage business with rising credit costs real estate lending will not only slow but also accumulate losses rapidly my shares in lloyds bank santander and bnp are a case in point their share price is an underestimated recession gauge the purpose of this column is to broaden readers general financial knowledge and it should not be interpreted as

by kimala price in a mere few days after the u s supreme court s decision to overturn roe v wade in dobbs v jackson women s health organization at least seven states banned abortion and even though judges blocked the enforcement of trigger abortion bans in three states more bans in other states are expected in the coming weeks it is believed that 26 states are likely to ban abortions abortion will likely remain legal in 20 states and the district of columbia with 14 of these states having recently enacted legislation that has enhanced access to abortion what will be the impact of these bans especially on women of color and other marginalized communities as a scholar who studies reproductive policy and politics reproductive justice and social movements i have always been aware that even when roe was in place women of color women in rural areas and women in poverty have had difficulty obtaining reproductive health services including abortion additionally the debate over abortion often overshadows the other reproductive health inequities such as high pregnancy related complications and deaths that women of color face this recent decision will only widen these gaps reproductive health inequities since the early 1980s there has been a general decline in the abortion rate in the united states despite claims to the contrary by anti abortion advocates the rate went from 29 3 abortions per 1 000 women ages 15 44 in 1981 to 13 5 per 1 000 women in 2017 however african american and latina women do have disproportionately higher rates of abortion than their white counterparts the abortion rate for white women is 6 6 abortions per 1 000 while the rates for african american women 23 8 per 1 000 and latinas 11 6 per 1 000 are three times and twice that rate respectively additionally low income women account for 75 of all abortion procedures according to public health researchers christine dehlendorf lisa h harris and tracy a weitz these higher rates are attributed to the higher rates of unintended pregnancies among these groups which itself is attributed to limited access to health services poor people and people of color are more likely to live in contraceptive deserts places where the number of health centers offering the full range of contraceptive methods is not enough to meet the contraceptive needs of the people who live in those places the proliferation of these deserts was worsened by policies enacted by the trump pence administration that limited family planning funding to clinics reproductive health inequities go beyond abortion the infant mortality rates among african americans native americans and native alaskans are very high the mortality rate for white infants is 4 5 deaths per 100 000 live births compared with 10 6 for african american infants and 7 9 for native americans native alaskan infants additionally african american native american and native alaskan women are the most likely to die from pregnancy related complications as a study by lynn paltrow and jeanne flavin has shown poor women of color are the most likely to be arrested and prosecuted for homicide manslaughter and child endangerment while pregnant these charges are often made after a woman has terminated a pregnancy refused to consent to a medically unnecessary cesarean section endured a miscarriage or stillbirth or tested positive for illegal drug use there is also the troubling history of the systematic coercive sterilization of women of color in the u s women of color and other social groups have had to fight just as hard for the right to have children as for the right to not have them by 1937 32 states had enacted laws that authorized the sterilization of people who were deemed unfit to reproduce including immigrants racial and ethnic minorities poor people unmarried women people with disabilities people with mental health issues and people with criminal records as historian alexandra stern explains this practice was viewed as a necessary public health intervention that would protect society from deleterious genes and the social and economic costs of managing degenerate stock scholars have documented the history of sterilization abuse among women of color in the 20th century including women of mexican and mexican american heritage in southern california african american women in the south native american women using indian health services and women in puerto rico many were sterilized without their full informed consent although most of these formal sterilization laws were abolished by the mid 1980s this practice unfortunately is still happening as reports about sterilization abuse in detention centers run by immigration and customs enforcement have surfaced a post roe post dobbs world in the coming months and years we will see more women traveling to terminate their pregnancies to states such as california colorado and new york where abortion is likely to remain legal but long distance travel may not be a viable option for those who cannot afford the costs or time off from work or who may not be able to secure child care for their children studies have shown that travel distance is a major barrier to obtaining abortions as women will forgo an abortion if they must travel more than 50 miles to the nearest clinic as with their pre roe predecessors many women may decide to self induce abortions out of necessity and desperation this can make them even more vulnerable to charges of fetal homicide if they are discovered studies have also shown that unsafe abortions can lead to serious health risks including hemorrhage infection infertility and death anti abortion advocates have pushed adoption as a solution for unintended pregnancy but this is not a realistic option for people of color among the more than 400 000 children in the foster care system children of color are the least likely to be adopted these children linger in the foster care system erosion of rights in his concurring opinion in dobbs justice clarence thomas argued that the court should reconsider reversing other related landmark rulings including access to contraception in griswold v connecticut lgbtq sexual behavior and sodomy laws in lawrence v texas and same sex marriage in obergefell v hodges thomas sentiments reveal a broader ultraconservative agenda to roll back the social and political gains that marginalized communities have won since the 1960s in my view if thomas gets his wish women of color will see further erosion of their personal autonomy and right to make the fundamental decisions about the most intimate aspects of their lives kimala price is a professor of women s studies at san diego state university she wrote this piece for the conversation where it first appeared

doing these three things can make you money warren buffett has lived through 26 periods where the s p 500 was in a bear market eleven of them came after he first invested in berkshire hathaway brk a 0 59 brk b 0 74 in 1965 the legendary investor has led berkshire to trounce the market during the past 57 years his decisions made during major downturns made a big difference in his overall performance here s what buffett does in bear markets and you should too 1 don t be afraid one of buffett s most famous quotes is be fearful when others are greedy and be greedy when others are fearful during bear markets many investors are fearful but that s exactly the time when buffett isn t afraid at all in 2008 and 2009 the stock market reeled as the u s economy experienced what would be called the great recession anyone who lived through this time knows how scary it was for most investors however buffett wrote in his annual letter to berkshire hathaway shareholders after the dust settled it s been an ideal period for investors a climate of fear is their best friend that s almost certainly still his view during the current bear market 2 put your money to work in that shareholder letter buffett also wrote we ve put a lot of money to work during the chaos of the last two years he wasn t exaggerating at the beginning of 2008 berkshire s cash position stood at 44 3 billion over the next two years the company retained operating earnings of around 17 billion but berkshire finished 2009 with a cash stockpile of 30 6 billion buffett practiced what he preached by being greedy when others were fearful guess what the multibillionaire is doing in this bear market putting berkshire s money to work so far in 2022 buffett and his investment managers have bought 16 stocks he s especially loaded up on shares of occidental petroleum oxy 0 97 berkshire now owns a 17 4 stake in the oil and gas company oxy has been a big winner with its shares more than doubling year to date one common denominator in all the stocks that buffett buys is that he looks for high quality businesses at an attractive price as he wrote in early 2009 whether we re talking about socks or stocks i like buying quality merchandise when it is marked down that s a smart approach for all investors most stocks are available right now at a discount to their prices last year however not all of them have quality underlying businesses 3 think long term regardless of what the economy or the stock market is doing buffett always maintains a long term perspective during the dark period in the midst of the great recession he wrote to berkshire shareholders amid this bad news however never forget that our country has faced far worse travails in the past america has had no shortage of challenges without fail however we ve overcome them in the face of those obstacles and many others the real standard of living for americans improved nearly seven fold during the 1900s while the dow jones industrials rose from 66 to 11 497 compare the record of this period with the dozens of centuries during which humans secured only tiny gains if any in how they lived though the path has not been smooth our economic system has worked extraordinarily well over time it has unleashed human potential as no other system has and it will continue to do so america s best days lie ahead the current state of affairs isn t nearly as bad as it was in 2008 and 2009 this bear market presents a huge opportunity for long term investors who aren t afraid to put their money to work

economists look at the price of copper as an indicator that the economy is at risk of recession and it is flashing red while not as commonly talked about as other economic metrics such as the unemployment rate or yield curves copper has proven over centuries to be a procyclical commodity which means that when its price goes up so typically goes the economy but when its price starts to fall it could mean the economy is heading in the same direction eight recession warnings from important people and institutions copper is now trading at about 3 57 per pound that is a steep and aggressive decline from its peak of 4 94 in march a nearly 28 decline in just a matter of months meanwhile u s gdp also declined by 1 6 in the first quarter of this year and appears to be in danger of contracting again during the second quarter last week the atlanta federal reserve s gdpnow tracker predicted gdp growth will decrease for a second straight quarter i think that it is correctly moving with the economy so we ve seen a softening in terms of real gdp and copper is reflecting that campbell harvey a finance professor at duke university s fuqua school of business told the washington examiner copper has been a strong indicator of recessions in the past and is so well regarded that some refer to it as doctor copper a tongue in cheek suggestion that the metal has a doctorate in economics in early 2008 copper prices were trading between 3 and 4 per pound peaking at about 3 95 in late june of that year then they suddenly collapsed plunging to just about 1 30 in december 2008 an abrupt decline of 67 similarly economic output cratered and stocks plummeted in what is now known as the great recession copper fell just prior to and then in tandem with the recession of the early 2000s as well as during the recessions of the early 1980s a period that featured paul volcker s fed aggressively jacking up interest rates by double digits to rein in the country s historic inflation a scenario that is somewhat analogous to the situation the economy is in right now price of copper per pound copper prices 45 year historical chart the reason copper is such a good indicator is that it is used in just about everything that consumers buy from household appliances to automobiles it is also used in the construction of new homes and commercial buildings when copper prices are soaring it means people are going out and buying things and that workers are building new structures signs that the economy is hot and consumers are spending thus prices of the commodity go up to match demand conversely when prices start to slow it can show that manufacturers are slowing output because demand is falling an indication that gdp is starting to contract and in the extreme that the economy is tumbling into a recessionary period harvey said that of all the commodities copper is the one that most closely tracks what is happening in the overall economy he said other commodities such as oil aren t as good of indicators because of the complexity of supply problems embargoes and other exogenous factors while a reliable indicator copper isn t a perfect one and it is subject to price fluctuations that don t always portend a recession the price of copper is also tied to the mining and refining of copper itself for copper miners it is important to get a sense of where the economy is going because it determines whether they will open a mine close a mine or cut back production in anticipation of dampened demand copper prices have historically been tied to major events and economic shifts for instance in the late 18th and early 19th centuries ships which were the only way to carry goods from europe to the americas began to be built with copper bottoms after the royal navy decided to re hull its fleet copper prices exploded more than doubling from 1785 to 1807 copper prices also skyrocketed during world war i when the metal was in hot demand for cartridges machinery and other weapon parts the great war sent prices up and created an economic windfall for miners other commodities while less reliable as economic bellwethers have also been in decline west texas intermediate crude the united states s oil benchmark fell earlier this week and was trading at less than 100 per barrel for the first time since early may while it has since ticked up a bit it is still well below the 120 prices experienced earlier lumber a key building material has also been falling for the past several months while cotton has shed more than a third of its price since early may additionally a broad index of commodities maintained by bloomberg was down by about 15 on friday from a month ago many economists say a recession is very likely this year the national bureau of economic research a private academic group defines a recession as a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and that lasts more than a few months two straight quarters of downward growth are typically seen as recessionary and given that the first quarter of this year saw negative growth and the second quarter might also show negative growth some economists believe the u s is already in a recession or on the brink of recession recessions are difficult because they aren t typically known to be in that state until well after they have begun for instance it took until july 2021 for the national bureau of economic research to put out a release noting that the brief recession at the start of the coronavirus pandemic lasted two months the missive came a year after the recession had ended some prominent figures and institutions have been warning about the state of the economy particularly given that the fed has begun to jack up rates much more aggressively than previously thought to tamp down inflation something that naturally depresses the economy click here to read more from the washington examiner copper prices taken together with other key economic indicators will be essential in planning for an economic downturn given all of the uncertainty that we face today both managers and consumers need to exercise caution and this is just one more piece of evidence that s consistent with a slowing economy harvey said

the memory chipmaker will face another boom and bust cycle micron technology mu 0 94 is one of the world s largest producers of dram and nand memory chips it s the third largest dram manufacturer after samsung and sk hynix according to ic insights while trendforce ranks it as the fifth largest producer of nand chips unlike more broadly diversified companies like samsung and western digital which only generate a portion of their revenues from memory chips micron is a pure play on the memory market in its latest quarter it generated 73 of its revenue from dram chips 26 from nand chips and the remaining sliver from other types of memory sk hynix is also a pure play memory chipmaker like micron but it s difficult for american investors to directly buy shares of the south korean company micron s direct exposure to the cyclical memory market is a double edged sword it usually generates robust growth as memory prices rise but it tends to underperform its semiconductor peers when those prices decline nevertheless micron has repeatedly rewarded patient investors who ride out those boom and bust cycles with impressive long term returns its stock declined about 40 this year as it faced the end of its current growth cycle but it s still nearly doubled over the past five years will micron s stock replicate those gains over the next five years let s evaluate its challenges and potential catalysts to find out micron s previous boom and bust cycle between fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2021 which ended last september micron s annual revenue more than doubled from 12 4 billion to 27 7

produced too many chips as the market s demand for consumer electronics especially smartphones slowed down as a result a supply glut occurred memory prices tumbled and micron s revenue declined year over year for six consecutive quarters through fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020 but over the past nine quarters micron s revenue grew again as the robust demand for new pc data center consumer electronics and automotive chips outstripped the industry s available supply the ongoing chip shortage further amplified the market s demand for new memory chips predicting the next boom and bust cycle micron s revenue rose 24 year over year to 24 1 billion in the first nine months of fiscal 2022 but it expects its revenue to decline 13 year over year in the fourth quarter and end its current growth cycle the midpoint of its guidance implies its revenue will grow just 13 for the full year the bulls believe micron will recover quickly as its data center consumer electronics industrial and auto customers continue to install more memory chips to support advanced 5g cloud and ai features it s also been actively throttling its production to avoid flooding the market with cheap chips again so this cyclical downturn might be less painful than the previous one the bulls will also point out that micron trades at just nine times next year s earnings so its inevitable slowdown might have already been priced in many of micron s industry peers are trading at similar discounts western digital trades at five times forward earnings while intel which is in the process of selling its nand business to sk hynix trades at just 10 times forward earnings the bears will argue that macroeconomic headwinds especially inflation rising interest rates supply chain disruptions and a potential recession will make the next few years much more challenging for micron even if micron slams the brakes on its production the macro headwinds could curb the market s appetite for new chips and memory prices will tumble again for now analysts expect micron s downturn to be shorter than the one it experienced in fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020 but for its subsequent recovery to also be milder than its growth spurt in 2021 metric fy 2022 fy 2023 fy 2024 estimated revenue growth 13 3 19 estimated eps growth 54 22 73 these forecasts could be too optimistic during micron s latest conference call cfo mark murphy said the market s long term demand trends remain constructive but select market weakness and macroeconomic uncertainty would impact its near term outlook and visibility but even if micron s slowdown drags on through fiscal 2024 its sales should eventually rebound therefore investors should still expect micron s revenue to rise again in fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2026 where will micron be in five years if micron matches analysts expectations through fiscal 2024 then continues to grow its top line at an average rate of 15 over the following two years it could generate 48 billion in revenue by fiscal 2026 that would be more than 70 higher than its fiscal 2021 revenue so it s certainly possible for micron s stock to nearly double again over the next five years but it definitely won t be a smooth ride
the oracle of omaha still believes in the iconic soda maker warren buffett s berkshire hathaway brk a 0 59 brk b 0 74 owns 400 million shares of coca cola ko 0 24 which gives it a 9 2 stake in the beverage company coca cola now accounts for 7 9 of berkshire s portfolio and it s the diversified holding company s third largest investment after apple and bank of america buffett who claims to drink at least five 12 ounce cans of coke every day initiated berkshire s position in the company back in 1988 the stock has rallied 2 560 since the beginning of 1988 and it s generated a total return of 5 810 after factoring in reinvested dividends during that same period the s p 500 generated a total return of 1 450 let s review the four main reasons warren buffett fell in love with coca cola and see if it s still a sparkling investment for long term investors 1 the stock was undervalued berkshire bought 23 million shares of coca cola in 1988 and 1989 when the market was still recovering from the black monday crash of 1987 buffett paid an average price of 43 81 per share 2 73 on a split adjusted basis or 15 times coca cola s earnings per share eps in 1988 that price to earnings p e ratio didn t make it a deep value stock but buffett believed it was undervalued relative to its growth potential after all coca cola was already an evergreen brand that had dominated the beverage market for decades before berkshire bought its first shares 2 it s a forever stock in berkshire s 1988 shareholder letter buffett said he planned to hold coca cola and its other latest investments for a long time he also explained that when we own portions of outstanding businesses with outstanding managements our favorite holding period is forever the company has grappled with declining soda consumption over the past decade but it s largely offset that pressure by buying and developing new brands of juices teas sports drinks bottled water coffee and even alcoholic beverages it s also consistently refreshed its carbonated drinks with new flavors smaller serving sizes and healthier sugar free versions that s why coca cola s annual revenue rose from 8 3 billion in 1988 to 38 7 billion in 2021 representing a steady compound annual growth rate cagr of 5 even as sales of its namesake product stagnated 3 it s a dividend king coca cola has raised its dividend annually for 60 straight years making it a dividend king it s tough to join that elite club which only consists of the s p 500 companies that have raised their payouts annually for at least 50 straight years because paying consistent dividends for decades requires a company to generate stable profits through countless crises and recessions coca cola currently pays a healthy forward dividend yield of 2 8 therefore berkshire s 400 million shares of the company now net a whopping 704 million in dividend payments each year 4 coca cola buys back its own stock back in 2004 buffett told investors that buybacks are probably the best use of cash when a company s stock is undervalued berkshire didn t launch its own buyback plan until 2011 but it frequently invests in companies that aggressively repurchase their own shares in 1987 coca cola announced that it would repurchase up to 10 6 of its shares over the following three years even though its stock had already risen every year since 1980 that bold decision likely convinced buffett that the stock was cheap and still had room to run coca cola has reduced its share count by 30 since the beginning of 1987 after pausing its buybacks during the pandemic it plans to repurchase about 500 million in shares this year that might seem like a drop in the pond for a 274 billion company but coca cola s slow and steady buybacks will reward its long term investors just as its reinvested dividends will boost their total returns is coca cola still a good long term investment coca cola s stock has risen about 17 over the past 12 months as rising interest rates drove investors toward defensive blue chip stocks the stock doesn t look cheap at 26 times forward earnings but it will likely retain that premium valuation as long as interest rates keep climbing for 2022 it expects its organic sales to rise 7 to 8 and for its comparable eps to grow 8 to 10 on a constant currency basis that sunny outlook indicates it will easily weather the inflationary headwinds and remain an attractive investment throughout the bear market when the bear market finally ends some investors might sell coca cola to buy higher growth stocks but over the long term i believe it will remain a well balanced consumer staples stock and an evergreen investment
