washington the sudden collapse of one of the world s largest cryptocurrency exchanges rattled the nation s capital this week as lawmakers grappled with the wide ranging fallout and began to confront the consequences of neglecting the surging financial sector only a few weeks ago top democrats and republicans alike had been cashing campaign checks and working side by side with the vanguards of the industry including ftx founder sam bankman fried as they labored to craft new regulation in the frenetic cutting edge digital space instead bankman fried unexpectedly became a potential case study of the costs of congressional inaction while washington dithered he appeared to place a series of risky bets that incinerated his own fortune jeopardized billions of dollars in silicon valley capital threatened smaller investors and upended an entire ecosystem of cryptocurrency start ups in response investigators in the united states and abroad have opened probes into bankman fried and his holdings the treasury department has quietly placed calls to other large crypto exchanges to assess the risks of a broader contagion and a slew of congressional committees have readied their own reviews including a house inquiry announced wednesday that could see bankman fried testify under oath next month in the process federal policymakers have been left to ask themselves a familiar if uncomfortable question could they have prevented a crisis if they had paid close attention sooner over the years the regulators sorta invited them in these crypto companies and we ve seen the damage they ve caused said sen sherrod brown d ohio leader of the senate banking committee advertisement brown called for comprehensive cryptocurrency legislation something that congress repeatedly has proposed as the sector grew yet time and again has failed to achieve in the face of staunch industry lobbying in that time a wide array of crypto firms have experienced meteoric rises and once unfathomable collapses on the promise of great wealth that didn t always materialize still brown remained bullish that congress could rein in cryptocurrency companies that have put investors large and small at risk they need to be held accountable in some ways the tumult around ftx tells the story of a capitol often outpaced by the deft technology giants ostensibly under its watch from the burst of the dot com bubble at the turn of the millennium to the rampant privacy mishaps at facebook decades later federal policymakers historically have been slow to anticipate the troubles of the digital age only after massive costly scandals have lawmakers and regulators been stirred to action sometimes with less than desirable results the nascent world of cryptocurrency where digital tokens replace dollars investments and payments all without the need for traders governments or banks has presented perhaps the most complicated challenge to date as an entirely new financial system has come online washington has been forced to choose whether to institute stringent rules on crypto or stay out of silicon valley s way the u s government largely has adopted the latter approach much to the relief of crypto companies executives and investors that has enabled the rapid growth and soaring valuations of bitcoin a wide array of related currencies and an entire ecosystem of firms to support them until recently that included ftx a marketplace for buying and selling tokens that boasted its own currency an exchange that at its height was the third largest in the world advertisement but the peril of that approach came into sharp relief as ftx began to unravel questions about its finances and whether bankman fried used ftx deposits in potentially illegal ways prompted large investors to sell off their ftx issued tokens known as ftt with nowhere to turn and losses mounting bankman fried filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy last week setting off a cascading effect that has hammered silicon valley venture firms and start ups that depended on ftx other crypto exchanges soon after found themselves at risk with their own assets tied up in the fallout on capitol hill the fiasco quickly captured unexpectedly wide bipartisan attention the shift began tuesday as lawmakers sorted out the repercussions of the 2022 elections at a news conference normally reserved for democratic leaders to lob political barbs and issue policy announcements rep hakeem jeffries d n y the caucus chair said the party had plenty of priorities in the waning weeks of the year and the situation related to the cryptocurrency industry will be one of them the house financial services committee led by rep maxine waters d calif later announced its plans to hold a hearing on ftx potentially featuring bankman fried s testimony unfortunately this event is just one out of many examples of cryptocurrency platforms that have collapsed just this past year lamented waters describing an urgency to act across the capitol the fallout from ftx quickly overshadowed what normally might be a somnambulant hearing in the senate banking committee about credit unions sen patrick j toomey pa its soon retiring top republican seized on the moment to highlight several high profile collapses of crypto companies including one prominent example last week a reference to ftx if not explicitly by name toomey previously has purchased cryptocurrency assets his personal financial disclosures show but he focused his opening statement on the repercussions when a firm like ftx which was based in the bahamas can run roughshod over the u s economy advertisement as a general matter the failure of congress to pass legislation in this space and the failure of regulators to provide clear guidance has created ambiguity that has driven developers and entrepreneurs overseas he warned and we ve just once again seen how that ends in recent years democrats and republicans at various turns have tried to regulate cryptocurrency introducing a range of measures to empower federal agencies and pursue abuses including fraudulent coin offerings and international money laundering they ve also held a number of major hearings even grilling facebook ceo mark zuckerberg in 2019 over his company s doomed crypto effort known as libra law enforcement agencies meanwhile have prosecuted some of the worst actors unveiling charges in august for example against 11 individuals allegedly involved in a 300 million pyramid scheme and president biden himself recently has been engaged signing an executive order in march that offered an early road map for how washington might approach cryptocurrency regulation but the government at times has faced blowback for acting too aggressively this march for example a bipartisan group of lawmakers known as the congressional blockchain caucus took aim at the securities and exchange commission over its attempts to gather information from unregulated cryptocurrency and blockchain industry participants its signatories included rep tom emmer r minn a caucus co chair who has argued in the past that the sec has misused its authorities to assert jurisdiction over cryptocurrency emmer is set to serve in a key house leadership role under a republican majority next year appearing at an industry conference on wednesday the gop lawmaker urged congress not to adopt a wet blanket of regulation in the wake of the ftx crisis we need to use the stage that is congress to promote all of you beyond the walls of the capitol added emmer whose comments were first reported by the publication coindesk people need to understand more out there that they shouldn t be afraid of this advertisement his office declined further comment adding to the challenge the government has faced an onslaught of lobbying from an increasingly powerful and profitable industry since january alone cryptocurrency exchanges and their advocates have spent more than 14 8 million to influence regulators and lawmakers according to lobbying data compiled by opensecrets bankman fried and other ftx leaders including ryan salame the company s co chief executive also donated more than 70 million in the 2022 election the analysis showed that made them the third largest contributor in the two year cycle opensecrets found the senate has trouble keeping up with things that lobbyists prefer the senate not keep up with said sen elizabeth warren d mass a veteran of the 2008 financial crisis after which she oversaw congressional efforts to keep watch over big banks reflecting on the reasons for congressional inaction she added i have said for a very long time now that we need better regulation in this space on capitol hill ftx and its lobbyists actively guided lawmakers in writing legislation that would govern the company and its industry rivals a regular in washington bankman fried personally provided input to sens debbie stabenow d mich and john boozman r idaho who introduced a bill this year that would shift some crypto oversight to the commodity futures trading commission the cftc regulates complicated financial instruments known as derivatives as well as futures contracts for agricultural products the crypto industry generally prefers that agency over the sec which governs stock and bond markets and is perceived as more aggressive lawmakers and administration officials have split over which regulator should have jurisdiction partly a reflection of the complexity in defining crypto assets whether they are commodities or securities under law advertisement as she raced to a senate vote this week stabenow acknowledged she had solicited feedback from all the stakeholders including sam on cryptocurrency regulation a beneficiary of more than 20 000 in campaign donations from bankman fried this election the senator added she was extremely surprised of course we all were extremely surprised and disappointed at the downfall of ftx but stabenow still stood by her legislation as an antidote to the risk and abuse seemingly rife in cryptocurrency that s exactly why we need our legislation so the cftc can proactively provide regulation and transparency to consumers other lawmakers though feared that the bill had become tainted by ftx s influence brown the leader of the senate banking committee specifically acknowledged concern that bankman fried and his industry allies had too great a hand in shaping the legislation noting it needs major improvement i think you look at any of the legislation any legislation written here and it s always the fingerprints of the big banks in this case the big crypto companies are always all over it brown continued that s the fight i make every day in this committee and it s the fight we ll make on this as the ftx collapse rippled through the crypto world the biden administration urged congress to act on wednesday treasury secretary janet l yellen issued a public warning about dangers to the economy as she called on lawmakers to fill in the remaining regulatory gaps she said the agency s prior reports had identified a wide range of risks that ultimately were at the center of the crypto market stresses observed over the past week behind the scenes top treasury officials have been in close contact with major cryptocurrency exchanges and other companies in recent days to assess the ftx fallout according to an aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the conversations some lawmakers meanwhile signaled they were exploring a raft of new proposals in the hopes of protecting americans who buy own and sell cryptocurrency advertisement sen ron wyden d ore a tech expert and leader of the tax focused senate finance committee said in an interview that he planned to put forward a consumer protection package targeting cryptocurrency in the coming days the lawmaker worked with other democrats and republicans last year in instituting the first ever tax reporting requirements for digital tokens sen mark r warner d va said this week he had tried to reserve judgment given the promise of the technology but the lawmaker another top member of the banking committee stressed there s a reason we have rules around investor and consumer protection safety and soundness and the prevention of financial crime as she left the tuesday banking hearing sen cynthia m lummis r wyo similarly stressed that the ftx meltdown left congress no choice but to legislate lummis who once took to the senate floor to thank god for bitcoin has put forward her own sweeping bill that would shift more oversight to the cftc i think it s really important now that senators really focus on digital assets she said in the past it s been easy to put that on the back burner and address other issues that were more front burner issues this is now a front burner issue we have put ourselves at a regulatory disadvantage send questions comments to the editors previous next
the plane is careening toward the sea without a pilot air traffic control s mission teach a passenger to land a plane the selfie darren harrison has just taken shows him dressed casually in white shorts and a t shirt with his bare feet propped up on a plush gray leather seat he is the lone passenger in the roomy six seat cabin of a single engine cessna 208 turboprop some 12 000 feet above the atlantic off the east coast of florida he sends the photo to his wife brittney harrison who is six months pregnant with their first child harrison a 39 year old flooring sales executive is returning to his home in lakeland florida after taking part in an offshore deep sea fishing tournament in marsh harbour bahamas it s around noon the early may weather is perfect and the views brilliant blue skies and crystalline ocean below are drop dead beautiful the plane is being flown by ken allen a 64 year old veteran pilot to allen s right in the co pilot s seat is his friend russ franck 70 franck s no pilot but he does enjoy going along for the ride around 45 minutes into their scheduled 75 minute flight to treasure coast international airport in fort pierce florida air traffic controllers in miami clear allen to begin his approach to fort pierce which is now about 70 miles to the west they instruct him to descend to 10 000 feet november 333 lima delta roger miami center says allen using the plane s call sign a few minutes later as allen continues his descent the right side of his head starts pounding boom boom boom every time his heart beats allen feels as if his head is being hit with a hammer what the heck allen wonders as he winces in pain out of his right eye he begins seeing bright blue lights flashing guys i don t feel good he tells harrison and franck the pain is severe the pounding intensifies his voice shaking he says everything is fuzzy it s one of the scariest possible moments as a pilot harrison answers immediately what does that mean i don t know my head is killing me i don t allen suddenly stops talking and harrison watches him slump back in his seat the plane is now careening toward the sea without a pilot marie bergeron for reader s digest harrison manages to undo his seat belt and fighting g forces that want to pin him back to his seat stumbles a few feet to allen he and franck try to rouse allen no response the pilot is unconscious and the plane is out of control plummeting in a deep dizzying 340 mile per hour dive to the ocean below instead of blue sky the two men see whitecaps on waves below that are getting bigger and bigger as the plane continues to drop to 9 000 then 8 000 then 7 000 feet the cessna caravan s automatic emergency alarms are wailing although he s never taken a flying lesson harrison has flown on enough small planes and observed enough pilots to know that he has to pull back on the plane s yoke to bring the plane s nose up but he has to do it slowly it s an unfortunate airplane feature that if you pull the yoke too quickly the motor could stall or the wings could be ripped off squatting behind allen s seat he reaches over the unconscious pilot and grabs the yoke while franck grabs the co pilot s yoke as the plane falls both harrison and franck struggle to level off the plane which has dropped nearly 4 000 feet in 30 seconds soon the plane s nose levels off and turns up before climbing back to 9 000 feet can you hold this steady harrison asks franck while holding the co pilot s yoke franck helps harrison unbuckle allen s seat belt and harrison pulls him off the seat and gently lays the unconscious pilot on the floor of the cabin harrison quickly climbs into the pilot s seat and takes stock of the situation first and foremost they are alive but they are a long way from home and neither man has ever flown a plane before marie bergeron for reader s digest a serious situation air traffic controller chip flores has been on duty in the control tower at fort pierce s treasure coast international airport since 7 a m because the winds have recently picked up many of the student pilots who would normally be flying have been grounded and flores is thankful for the low traffic the quiet is interrupted when flores gets a call on his headset it s harrison traffic n triple 3 lima delta come in he says using the plane s call sign the way he d heard allen say it flores responds caravan 333 lima delta fort pierce tower i ve got a serious situation here says harrison my pilot uh has gone incoherent i have no idea how to fly the airplane flores jumps from his seat and hits a button on his console that broadcasts the radio transmission through the control tower s loudspeakers alerted to an emergency everyone in the tower drops what they are doing and listens to the call flores asks harrison what s your position i have no idea i see the coast of florida in front of me and i have no idea flores takes a deep breath what he doesn t know is that somehow the cessna s display screens have gone blank harrison must have hit a switch that turned them off when he tugged allen from his seat the only instruments that are still operational are the altimeter a basic compass and the attitude indicator which shows whether the plane is level what flores does know is that he may lose radio contact with harrison at any minute because the plane is flying south and will soon be beyond the airport s radio transmission limits flores is also concerned about those first words harrison said i have no idea how to fly the airplane harrison flores decides needs a quick flying lesson he radios harrison and calmly tells him try to hold the wings level and see if you can start descending for me push forward on the controls and descend at a very slow rate flores and the entire tower team await harrison s response yeah we are descending right now at 550 feet a minute what heading do i need to be at flores never gets the chance to tell him he s lost contact with the plane as it flies out of the airport s radio transmission zone flores radios harrison this is fort pierce tower are you on the frequency no answer inside november 333 lima delta harrison and franck realize they have lost contact with the tower flores s voice is replaced by static then nothing once again harrison and franck are on their own while harrison holds the plane steady franck tries to figure out where they are and if they are even flying in the right direction franck had ceded control of the plane to the younger harrison under the mistaken belief that he may have had some flight simulator experience because he seemed so focused franck peers out his window and says look there s the coast over there he checks his compass to double check his bearings we need to go west to get to the airport harrison nods and makes a gradual turn toward the coast franck instinctively reaches down to where ken allen is lying on the floor and taps his feet the stricken pilot moves ever so slightly and franck whispers hang in there ken hang in there my friend a high stakes mission as the plane flies into palm beach international airport airspace air traffic controllers there take over from flores their main mission find someone to teach a passenger who has never flown before how to land a plane greg battani air traffic control specialist at the palm beach airport pages robert morgan who is sitting outside and reading a book on his break morgan an experienced air traffic controller and flight instructor hears the page morgan come to the radar room immediately he slips on his shoes and rushes inside marie bergeron for reader s digest the airport s operations manager mark siviglia meets him at the door and quickly briefs him we have passengers flying a plane a cessna 208 the pilot is unconscious can you help land this plane morgan s eyes widen and he thinks is this really happening this sounds like a movie morgan sits down at a radar scope in the darkened radar room and thinks what am i going to tell this guy gathering his nerves he radios harrison who is now about 20 miles to the south and flying west toward the florida coastline this is 322 palm beach approach what we are going to do is get you to boca raton airport harrison responds i am not a pilot my screens are black no problem i want you to make a shallow turn to the north and hold steady at 3 000 feet morgan and the other controllers follow the cessna on their radar screens as it turns slightly to the north on a heading for the airport at boca raton morgan radios harrison that s great you look good then because he knows it s important to keep in radio contact with a trainee pilot he adds reassuringly don t worry i m here for you standard practice in an aviation emergency is to get the plane on the ground as soon as possible in this case that would mean landing at the boca raton airport but boca raton is a congested area and the airport has only one runway so morgan decides to reroute harrison farther north to the larger palm beach international airport with its three massive 10 000 foot long runways and a host of emergency services maintain your height at 3 000 and start a shallow turn to the right shallow turns are key too steep a turn by an untrained flier could cause the plane to spiral to the ground as soon as morgan radios the change the palm beach international airport staffers swing into action air traffic controllers man the radios stop all departures at the busy airport and place incoming flights into holding patterns emergency responders are ordered into positions along the runway and all vehicles and planes are moved away from the airport s three runways harrison and franck are glued to their headsets listening to morgan s instructions franck scans the ground for familiar landmarks he sees the i 95 freeway and nudges harrison they follow it north to palm beach international airport as they do so harrison practices controlling the cessna s altitude pushing the yoke forward to descend a bit and pulling it back to go up again he also makes some small turns to the right then to the left the plane is now about 6 miles south of the palm beach airport you should see the airport straight ahead morgan tells harrison i want you to start descending to 2 000 feet that guy is amazing as harrison descends morgan grows concerned that harrison is still flying too fast for a safe landing he s also worried about 28 mph crosswinds swirling around the runway which can easily force a small plane off course on landing morgan tells him to make a slight turn to the west we re going to bring you out to the west and give you more time to get lower and perfectly lined up with the runway he says harrison follows each of morgan s instructions and is now turning the plane back to the airport to make his approach to the massive runway 10l let s slow you down says morgan see that black throttle control in front of you pull that back a little bit keep your speed above 110 knots harrison throttles back and lines up the runway which is 3 miles away the radar room is quiet everyone s eyes are glued to the radar screens watching this final approach your speed looks fine morgan tells harrison as you get closer the runway will get wider and once it gets really wide i want you to pull the power back to you and also pull back on the controls hey i don t know how to use the brakes what do i do when i land when you get to the ground just put your feet on the top of the pedals and apply a bit of pressure morgan quickly adds gentle be very gentle when you press on the pedals what he doesn t mention is that putting too much pressure on the brakes too early can blow a tire causing a pilot to lose control of the plane possibly crashing on the runway as the cessna nears the airport morgan reads out the plane s altitude to harrison 600 feet 500 feet 400 feet you re doing great harrison now 1 mile from landing descends to 300 feet and is on target to land on runway 10l the airport s radar cannot pick up planes under 300 feet and november 333 lima delta disappears from morgan s screen are you still there morgan shouts ten seconds of torturous silence follow morgan swallows deeply as he and the other controllers in the blacked out radar room stare at the blank radar screens marie bergeron for reader s digest three seconds four seconds five seconds six seconds nothing seven seconds eight seconds nine seconds then the room s loudspeaker crackles to life it s harrison i m on the ground how do i stop this thing morgan hits the radio call button use the toe brakes gently harrison still barefoot presses the tops of the pedals gently and brings the plane to a stop smack dab in the middle of the runway 25 minutes after taking the controls the radar room erupts in cheers exhausted but flushed with adrenaline morgan stands and blinks back tears harrison feeling comfortable at the plane s controls radios morgan hey do you want me to taxi this off the runway morgan chuckles amazing he says to himself that guy is amazing editor s note ambulances rushed ken allen to the nearby palm beach gardens medical center where he was diagnosed with an aortic dissection a tear in the inner layer of the aorta that is often fatal doctors operated immediately and he is expected to make a full recovery next learn

hippos poached for their skin and teeth sharks targeted by the fin trade and a tiny frog with translucent skin are among the hundreds of species that could get greater protection at a united nations wildlife conference opening monday the 184 nation convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora or cites meeting over the next two weeks in panama will consider tightening trade regulations on around 600 plants and animals potentially at risk of extinction nine other species are recommended for less restrictive international trade regulations cites goal is to ensure that these wild species can survive in the wild for future generations secretary general ivonne higuero told the associated press the concern is that if we don t regulate that trade too much will be used too much will be traded and enter into commerce because it s highly valuable the international wildlife trade treaty which was adopted 49 years ago in washington d c has been praised for

sign up for nbc south florida newsletters the u s fish and wildlife service says it can not locate a trace of 23 species that were previously endangered including the ivory billed woodpecker and other pacific birds and bats 8 species of river mussels and some plants but it has come under fire for its limitations including its reliance on cash strapped developing countries to combat illegal trade that s become a lucrative 10 billion a year business millions of species are not listed under cites including according to one study more than a third of the online reptile trade domestic markets are beyond the reach of the treaty and some experts have complained cites listings often come after a species is too far gone the internet is fueling the illegal trade a wildlife conservation society investigation this month found that jaguar parts trade commercially banned under cites were widely available online still conservationists said cites remains the only available tool to ensure trade in plants and animals is done sustainably governments will list species that require permits bringing some level of transparency to the trade or if trade is putting a plant or animal at risk a listing will limit or outright ban it cites is working but it s only as good as its implementation by exporting countries transit countries importing countries said susan lieberman the vice president of international policy at wcs the treaty is excellent it s the only tool we have in the midst of a biodiversity crisis she continued we don t need to weaken it we need to strengthen cites and maybe even cover more species we also need to ensure whether through multilateral donors foundations whatever that there s more resources going to help countries who are challenged implementing cites fans of hippos found in more than three dozen african countries and regulars in nature documentaries are counting on the convention to ban commercial trade ten african countries have proposed banning trade in

2009 and 2018 according to the cites trade database with a majority coming from tanzania another 79 000 pounds 36 000 kilograms of hippo ivory went to hong kong and china for hunting trophies figurines and knife handles the concern is that hippos already suffering due to climate driven droughts and development cannot survive extensive poaching it s great when countries do things domestically try to take matters into their own hands to protect their own populations said tanya sanerib the international legal director at the center for biological diversity which in march joined with the humane society international in requesting that the u s fish and wildlife service list the hippos under the endangers species act but unless we have that sort of international collaboration which is what cites is designed to foster you have mixed signals being sent about what really is happening and whether a product is legal or illegal sanerib said so getting this commercial trade ban would be significant in terms of sending that signal loud and clear that ivory is off the table the proposal to ban the hippo trade is opposed by the european union some african countries and several conservation groups who argue many countries have healthy hippo populations and that trade isn t a factor in their decline sharks too are poised for increased protection global shark populations are declining with annual deaths due to fisheries reaching about 100 million the sharks are sought mostly for their fins which are used in shark fin soup a popular delicacy in china and elsewhere in asia conservation groups argue proposals at cites to list about 90 species including the family of requiem sharks would significantly limit the trade if approved the proposals would increase the portion of shark species in the fin trade covered by cites from around 25 to about 90 according to the wcs what is driving down shark populations is overfishing they have been slyly labeled bycatch when in reality they are targeted said philip chou senior director of global policy for the conservation group oceana there is a huge active trade and money to be made from the trade of shark meat and there has always been for their fins opposition is likely to come from japan and other east asian countries the hub of the global fin trade they argue the trade should be regulated by fisheries bodies turtles snakes glass frogs and lizards increasingly targeted by the pet and collector trade would get increased protection as would several timber species including african mahogany that have been decimated by illegal logging the united states association of reptile keepers which advocates for responsible private ownership and trade in reptiles and amphibians said in a statement that addressing reductions in wild populations by limiting captive breeding and legal trade is counterproductive there also are controversial proposals to ease the ban on the elephant ivory trade zimbabwe which has threatened to leave cites has pushed to allow sale of its ivory stocks and elephant skin and to use the money to manage its growing elephant population but conservation groups and the u s oppose easing the ivory ban enacted in 1989 most countries have domestic bans on elephant ivory markets and the fact that there are existing stockpiles out there of ivory is very troubling said the u s department of the interior s matthew strickler who will head the american delegation at cites you certainly don t want to see that product get on the market and kind of rekindle demand for more ivory which we all know leads to more and more poaching secretary general higuero said there is no appetite for opening the market for ivory sales but that the debate at cites could spark a larger conversation on how to help poor countries fund conservation efforts many of these countries she said are struggling to manage their elephant populations amid worsening drought and expanding ranges that are increasing elephant human conflict we all benefit from the existence of these animals she said therefore it s a global responsibility to ensure that these developing countries can meet their

affordable housing crisis leads to historic rise in calls for help in hampton roads norfolk va hampton roads is at the center of an affordable housing crisis in virginia leading to a record number of calls for assistance to the regional housing crisis hotline what we re seeing right now is the highest ever call volume we have ever seen since we ve operated the hotline said thaler mccormick the chief executive officer of forkids a non profit organization aimed at providing services to children and families experiencing homelessness in october we had over 7 800 answered calls those are the calls we answered not the total volume that came in mccormick said the expiration of federal rental assistance earlier this year in addition to inflation and soaring rent prices is putting working families on the brink of experiencing homelessness donate to the forkids rental assistance fund everyone s starting to understand it s a critical problem that impacts our kids our seniors our families and our workers said mccormick we have people calling and they need thousands in assistance just to remain in their housing mccormick also said the increasing number of people in need of assistance with rent utilities and food have drained their resources too we ve completely lost any tools in the toolbox to be able to help working people that have gotten a little behind to help them get caught back up said mccormick our shelter stays have gotten so long that we re actually serving far less people because we can t move people out and if you can t move people out you can t move in related thousands waiting for affordable housing in hampton roads according to research by the joint legislative audit and review commission virginia has a shortage of 200 000 affordable housing units for low income and extremely low income residents tracey smith who led the jlarc study said the shortage is concentrated in hampton roads and northern virginia folks who are for example in hampton roads i think we estimated they are the most likely to be cost burned than households living in any other region of the state smith said related news 3 investigates looks at trends in hampton roads rental industry since 2019 according to smith and her team s research some of the largest occupations in the state like health care aides teacher s assistants and bus drivers earned salaries below the affordable housing wage in virginia we re actually pretty surprised that some of some of the occupations that people really rely on for getting through the day for their services are those occupations that are more likely to have trouble affording their homes smith said related seniors on fixed income face housing challenges as rental prices rise according to the national low income housing coalition virginia has the 14th highest housing wage in the country the nlihc estimates the fair market value for a one bedroom apartment in virginia is roughly 1 100 meaning you would have to earn 20 40 per hour working full time to afford rent and pay other bills the situation is even more fire for virginians who earn minimum wage at 11 dollars per hour a minimum wage worker would have to clock 78 hours per week to afford a one bedroom apartment in virginia smith pondered how in the world can people who are working in these extremely important but lower paying jobs how can they afford to continue doing what they re doing smith said the jlarc team identified key hurdles to developing more affordable housing in virginia including barriers in zoning the lack of land and of affordable housing zoning policies is really the primary barrier to developing new affordable housing said smith when a developer has to pursue rezoning for affordable housing that adds time and cost related the hurdles to housing your guide to homeownership hampton roads smith said the jlarc report urged general assembly members to address rigid zoning policies so localities can pursue more affordable housing developments the report also cited a need for increased incentives to encourage developers to take on affordable housing projects she estimated addressing these issues could take years and more than a billion dollars it s a complicated problem it s an expensive problem said smith hopefully what our report has done is provided some solutions at least from a state government level another hurdle some affordable housing developers face is a not in my backyard in some communities according to delegate angelia williams graves open your mind a little bit to see what can be said delegate williams graves referencing the uphill battle the franklin johnson group faced on its journey to building the new riverside station apartments in norfolk if it were not for complexes like this and developers who build affordable housing then those people would most likely be homeless todd walker the executive director of the judeo christian outreach center in virginia beach is championing the development of a new affordable housing complex in the resort city over the summer walker and the jcoc were awarded 900 000 in funding from the virginia department of housing and community development i thank god that he s using me to be a part of the solution said walker who shared design plans for the 38 unit affordable housing complex he hopes to see up and running by 2024 i dream about the ribbon cutting ceremony walker said the city of virginia beach sentara and the hampton roads community foundation is assisting in the effort to get the project off the ground he said it will primarily serve people exiting homelessness and those earning less than 25 000 a year it s hitting the working class now the working middle class where before it was people right below the poverty line walker said mel price the principal and co founder of work program architects points to the missing middle concept to help address affordable housing too housing that falls in between a single family home which most of our cities are now zoned only for single family homes and a really large apartment complex said price citing duplexes and triplexes as missing middle examples in norfolk we could fit more people on property and make it affordable by design price along with the city of norfolk developed the missing middle program book to give developers an idea of what is possible if zoning laws are reimagined i think there s an opportunity to build generational wealth again by revisiting our past and doing it in a contemporary way price said while governments debate on the best ways to solve the affordable housing crisis mccormick with forkids urges immediate action to keep families from experiencing homelessness let s convert hotels let s think out of the box on how we can make a vital housing stock right here in the community said mccormick there s not enough housing at any level so let s get started mccormick said while resources are stretched people struggling are still urged to

stocks or other investments now lock in your losses removing any chance for future growth research suggests people who work with a financial advisor feel more at ease about their finances and could end up with about 15 more money to spend in retirement 1 consider this example a recent vanguard study found that on average a hypothetical 500k investment would grow to over 3 4 million under the care of an advisor over 25 years whereas the expected value from self management would be 1 69 million or 50 less in other words an advisor managed portfolio would average 8 annualized growth over a 25 year period compared to 5 from a self managed portfolio 2 a 2020 northwestern mutual study found that 71 of u s adults admit their financial planning needs improvement however only 29 of americans work with a financial advisor 3 assuming 5 annualized growth of 500k portfolio vs 8 annualized growth of advisor managed portfolio over 25 years the hypothetical study discussed above assumes a 5 net

lettuce for the time being we apologize for the inconvenience swiss chalet swisschaletca november 7 2022 on the order section of its website subway canada says it s grappling with a lettuce shortage and is instituting a temporary lettuce portion reduction on its sandwiches because of supply issues the shortage is largely due to a dry growing season in california followed by a round of a virus that killed off a lot of the lettuce crop explained sylvain charlebois who researches food distribution security and safety at dalhousie university primarily the shortage is affecting romaine and iceberg lettuce in california the weather has been quite dry which has made plants weaker and a virus actually ravaged many crops there and so a lot of farmers just couldn t have anything to sell explained charlebois advertisement 3 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content the shortage has made it challenging for grocers to get ahold of supply and that s assuming charlebois said that they want to even carry a product that s selling for well above usual prices they just don t want to carry an overpriced product and being stuck with excess inventory and that inventory will likely go to waste said charlebois prices have tripled or quintupled over the past six months statcan reported that lettuce was 30 per cent more

lettuce expensive not just for your average consumer but for restauranteurs as well who aren t looking to buy a single head of iceberg to chop up for a supper salad the regular person can go without lettuce for a bit restaurants can t a case of lettuce would normally be between 30 to 40 and they re now upwards of 150 per case they re struggling the most out of anybody else in our customer base

to have to be more creative in canada there isn t any good way to overcome the shortfall there s little lettuce production this time of year because of the temperatures and while there are some greenhouses they cannot fill the overwhelming demand during these type of shortages explained bamford the good news said charlebois is that around december importers usually switch from california lettuce to lettuce grown in arizona and mexico which means the shortage ought to be temporary since those crops are looking to be in good shape this is good news for grocers as lettuce along with onions cucumbers and tomatoes are high volume sellers and for canadians who tend to buy a lot of lettuce in the winter months we should actually have plenty of leafy greens on the market by the time

robin miller special for the arizona republic plenty of work goes into preparing the thanksgiving turkey so it s no surprise we want to gobble up every last tasty bit conventional recipes for leftover turkey are okay but in my opinion they re overplayed turkey tetrazzini is great but the cream based casserole is heavy not a characteristic we often crave after a day of feasting paninis sandwiches and turkey salads make great use of what you have on hand but don t stray far from the flavor profiles you ve already enjoyed so this year think outside the turkey leftover box in just minutes you can transform thanksgiving turkey into a tortilla soup that s savory satiny can be made mild or spicy and is totally different this soup features a chili and cumin broth tomatoes sweet corn black beans jalapen os and cilantro it s commonly made with chicken but slow roasted turkey works great just before serving top the flavorful broth with crunchy tortilla strips and set up a toppings station with things like avocado cotija cheese green onions and sour cream so everyone can customize their bowl the recipe couldn t be easier but i do have a few tips to ensure you get the best results use stock use good quality chicken stock since chicken stock makes up the bulk of the liquid in this soup choose a variety that delivers decent flavor that doesn t mean a pricey brand just one with depth yes you can use chicken broth if that s what you have handy you can also choose low sodium make tortilla soup spicy or not adjust the heat level with fresh jalapen o this recipe calls for one jalapen o

s operating performance to other periods j nci adjustment bellring has included an adjustment to reflect the removal of non gaap adjustments which are attributable to redeemable nci in the periods prior to the spin off in the calculation of adjusted net earnings available to common stockholders and adjusted diluted earnings per share of common stock k income tax effect on adjustments bellring has included the income tax impact of the non gaap adjustments using a rate described in the applicable footnote of the reconciliation tables as bellring believes that its gaap effective income tax rate as reported is not representative of the income tax expense impact of the adjustments adjusted ebitda bellring believes that adjusted ebitda is useful to investors in evaluating bellring s operating performance and liquidity because i bellring believes it is widely used to measure a company s operating performance without regard to items such as depreciation and amortization which can vary depending upon accounting methods and the book value of assets ii it presents a measure of corporate performance exclusive of bellring s capital structure and the method by which the assets were acquired and iii it is a financial indicator of a company s ability to service its debt as bellring is required to comply with certain covenants and limitations that are based on variations of ebitda in its financing documents management uses adjusted ebitda to provide forward looking guidance and to forecast future results adjusted ebitda reflects adjustments for income tax expense interest expense net and depreciation and amortization including accelerated depreciation and amortization and the following adjustments discussed above loss on extinguishment and refinancing of debt net separation costs provision for legal matters restructuring and facility closure costs excluding accelerated depreciation resolution of dispute with former contract manufacturer foreign currency gain loss on intercompany loans mark to market adjustments on commodity hedges and adjustment to tra liability additionally adjusted ebitda reflects adjustments for the following items l stock based compensation bellring s compensation strategy after the initial public offering the ipo includes the use of bellring stock based compensation to attract and retain executives and employees by aligning their long term compensation interests with bellring s stockholders investment interests bellring s director compensation strategy includes an election by any director who earns retainers in which the director may elect to defer compensation granted as a director to bellring common stock earning a match on the deferral both of which are stock settled upon the director s retirement from the bellring board of directors bellring s compensation strategy prior to the ipo included the use of post stock based compensation to attract and retain executives and employees by aligning their long term compensation interests with post s shareholders investment interests after the ipo bellring was charged for post stock based compensation through the master services agreement with post through the vesting date bellring has excluded stock based compensation as stock based compensation can vary significantly based on reasons such as the timing size and nature of the awards granted and subjective assumptions which are unrelated to operational decisions and performance in any particular period and does not contribute to meaningful comparisons of bellring s operating performance to other periods m net earnings attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interest bellring has included adjustments for the portion of its consolidated net earnings which was allocated to redeemable nci for the periods prior to the spin off allowing for the calculation of adjusted ebitda to include 100 of bellring as bellring s management evaluates bellring s operating performance on a basis that includes

sets the record straight on diffusion s misleading narrative and raises concerns about a troubling pattern of entrenchment and lack of accountability on the board has nominated a slate of highly qualified directors new york nov 17 2022 globe newswire lifesci special opportunities master fund ltd lifesci special opportunities or we the holder of 96 976 shares of common stock of diffusion pharmaceuticals inc diffusion or the company nasdaq dffn or approximately 4 8 of the company s outstanding shares today issued a statement in response to the company s misleading press release from november 14 2022 and announced that it has nominated a slate of high quality director candidates for election at the company s upcoming annual meeting to be held on december 30 2022 the 2022 annual meeting lifesci special opportunities statement the company s november 14 2022 press release announcing that its board of directors the board has authorized a review and evaluation of potential strategic opportunities appears to have been deliberately timed in order to obscure prior attempts by third parties including lifesci capital llc ls capital a commonly owned affiliate of lifesci special opportunities acting on behalf of its clients to engage the board in discussions regarding potential strategic alternatives the company s press release endeavors to mislead stockholders regarding the facts as to ls capital s efforts to constructively engage with the company on possible pathways to unlock significant value for all of the company s stockholders further the announcement of the strategic review process appears to be a desperate and thinly veiled effort to distract stockholders and the market from the company s failures including the board s and management s inability to develop their lead asset trans sodium crocetinate tsc and the catastrophic erosion of diffusion s cash balances and stockholder value that has occurred under their leadership we believe that stockholders will be able to see through these transparent attempts to deflect attention away from the company s operational and share price underperformance including the fact that the company s share price has declined by approximately 78 from november 15 2021 to november 11 2022 1 we encourage stockholders to review our proxy materials as they become available which will include additional information regarding our concerns with the company background information on october 17 2022 on behalf of a client and unaffiliated investor in the company ls capital presented an unsolicited offer to the company to purchase 100 of the company s outstanding common stock not already owned by its client for 6 58 per share in cash which represented a 20 premium to the company s closing stock price as of the close of business on friday october 13 2022 the company unceremoniously rejected the offer on october 25 2022 since may 2022 ls capital had attempted to engage constructively with the company on behalf of ls capital s client to discuss potential strategic alternatives that ls capital believed would be in the company s best interest and unlock value for all of the company s stockholders following ls capital s initial contact the company ignored all attempts by ls capital to continue engaging for nearly four months until mid september with the board and management continuing to refuse to engage directly ls capital had the opportunity to speak with an investor relations firm representing the company and continued to request to speak with diffusion s management as a precursor to a call with management ls capital discussed entering into a non disclosure agreement with the company however the company s proposed non disclosure agreement was far from customary in ls capital s experience and sought to impose a multi year standstill and other burdensome restrictions which ls capital viewed as a deliberate and troubling attempt by the board to disenfranchise stockholders and further ensconce themselves in diffusion s failing business ultimately a call with the company proceeded without a non disclosure agreement in place and ls capital shared its thoughts with the company on potential strategic options following this call the company ceased engaging with ls capital refusing requests for follow up discussions and negotiations not surprisingly the company s behavior appears to be consistent with its vague october 25 2022 press release which stated there is no timeline for this review and there is no assurance that the board s review will result in any transaction being consummated diffusion does not intend to comment on the process or make further disclosures until it determines an update is appropriate lifesci special opportunities as a large stockholder of the company is naturally concerned about the board s motives and willingness to actually engage in substantive conversations that in our view would result in the company achieving its stated goal of enhancing shareholder value lifesci special opportunities is also concerned that the company has not held an annual meeting to elect directors in nearly 17 months which appears to be yet another entrenchment tactic by the board to maintain the status quo when the 2022 annual meeting of stockholders is finally held assuming the company does not delay it again it will be over 18 months since directors were elected at the 2021 annual meeting of stockholders furthermore it appears the company only announced that it would hold the 2022 annual meeting as a reactive measure to external pressure such as the third party offer from ls capital s client and did so with very little notice which prompted an accelerated timeline for stockholders to provide notice of any nominations or business proposals the timing of the company s public announcement of its strategic review process also seems to be only in response to the unsolicited offer to acquire the company rather than any genuine initiative by leadership to take actions that are in the best interest of diffusion stockholders we also question the circumstances surrounding the recent and abrupt weekend resignation of one of the company s directors that was announced concurrently with the company s misleading press release in lifesci special opportunities view these are all clear and unfortunate symptoms of a reactive and troubled board that is trying to avoid being held accountable by its stockholders the urgent need for fresh perspectives given the board s track record of overseeing significant value destruction and seeming indifference towards the company s stockholders the true owners of the company we believe it has become abundantly clear that the current board and management are not worthy stewards of our company we have serious concerns about whether they can be trusted to run the strategic review process especially given their entrenchment tactics and the timing of the stated commencement of the review process which appears to only have been undertaken in response to an unsolicited offer while we are open to working constructively with the company we do not intend to stand idly by and allow the board and management to continue unchecked on this path of value destruction to that end we have nominated the following highly qualified individuals for election at the 2022 annual meeting jill

when they write the market history of 2022 chances are there will be a chapter devoted to bear market rallies the s p 500 has seen at least two of them since that index fell 20 from recent peaks in may early last month we saw the biggest two day pop on the asx since march 2020 since that pop the index is up 700 points so naturally the question has been asked did the equity bear market of 2022 bottom out in october the team at macquarie certainly don t think so just as investors and consumers alike drank the punch bowl from central banks now we must all deal with the hangover and analysts there believe the hangover will last into next year so much so that they are recommending it s time to reduce risk as the end of another bear market rally approaches in this wire we continue our series into the professional investors market outlook for 2023 by examining why 2023 will be a year for buckling up and preparing for an economic contraction rather than a chance to buy the dip plus we ll share not one but 24 moves the analysts are making to their model portfolio ahead of another eventful year on markets the best opportunities come in the worst times if you were hoping we re through the worst of this market turmoil macquarie analysts wrote this recently we think equities are near the end of a bear market rally not the start of a new bull market why they have three key reasons 1 reduced rate hike expectations are fuelling the rally which in turn were caused by a beat on inflation prints in the us if you re betting on a federal reserve pivot then last week s inflation print certainly added to your case but a slew of central bank speakers not least st louis fed president james bullard has repeatedly said interest rates need to move higher possibly a lot higher while inflation is still more than three times the central bank s target nonetheless a pivot or wishing for one is a topic we ve addressed on this very website macro brace yourself why a 6 interest rate in america still can t be ruled out view macro wish thinking a pivot into existence is the same tomfoolery that got us here view 2 quantitative tightening is still ongoing with less money in the bank account of the world s most important central bank there could be liquidity issues that spill over into the equity market 3 a us recession is imminent in the team s view possibly starting as soon as q1 in calendar 2023 in theory if unemployment begins to rise and inflation begins to cool central banks will have to start cutting rates if this scenario plays out as the team expects it to the first signal will be in the bond market as this chart shows so what are we preparing for an early contraction then maybe a bull market analysts say for the moment the team believes a us recession is coming so they say your portfolio needs to reflect the fact that earnings will fall and valuations will diverge over the coming months in their view the only thing that would potentially mitigate the effects of a recession is if central banks actually stop or slow the pace of rate hikes imminently but recessions also generally bring rate cuts given many economists and strategists predict the federal reserve will stop hiking mid to late next year and the reserve bank even sooner than that macquarie analysts are looking to shift their exposures away from rates beneficiaries to quality defensives we shifted exposure from rate beneficiaries to stocks that benefit from lower yields this led us to add defensives across infrastructure and increase exposure to other defensives we also reduced exposure to cyclical stocks across a range of sectors the buys and additions for 2023 there are five brand new positions for 2023 with financials and materials making up 50 of the model portfolio alone the addition of so many new positions also highlights their core thesis the best time to buy stocks is in a recession and you can do it as soon as the intention to ease policy becomes obvious bhp is still the largest position in the strategy portfolio with a weighting of 11 78 there are a total of 28 stocks in the portfolio all with neutral or outperform ratings there are also seven increases to existing positions in the model portfolio and all reflective of the add defensives when cheap thesis the reduces and removals for 2023 since we spoke about the team s desire to remove exposure to rates beneficiaries you will be totally unsurprised to hear these names have had their positions reduced and australia and new zealand banking group asx anz was removed altogether as the team switched its preference to cba for quality reasons in the wider commodities space the team have reduced exposure to three key names in the consumer space four names have been removed completely and you ll sense a broadly discretionary theme in these stocks and in the materials space south32 asx s32 and james hardie asx jhx has been deleted necessary caveats i d like to close with two very necessary caveats and reminders firstly livewire is just passing this information on we are not recommending these stocks ourselves and secondly every base case has potential pitfalls which need to be declared here is theirs if central banks achieve a soft landing and lower inflation is achieved without a us recession unemployment may not rise materially real disposable incomes may rise and stock prices may have seen their lows while this scenario is possible we do not think the conditions for a sustainable low in equities have been met a delayed recession could also cause the portfolio to underperform until the recession arrives never miss an insight if you re not an existing livewire subscriber you can sign up to get free access to investment ideas and

thanksgiving is one of the great american traditions a perfect holiday consisting of food family football and movies what s not to like well for starters the local grocery store always runs out of cranberry sauce families spend more time arguing than eating the detroit lions and dallas cowboys are perennial losers and great thanksgiving movies are typically hard to come by we can t help with the first three issues but we did some digging and found a few flicks worth checking out over the holiday check out the list below dutch dutch one of the lesser john hughes productions finds ed o neil transporting ethan randall from georgia to chicago over the thanksgiving holiday predictably the trip goes awry leading to a series of madcap episodes that somehow bring the duo together while the film mostly plays like a john hughes greatest hits album replete with bb guns kicks to the crotch and an abundance of goofy pratfalls dutch nonetheless entertains in spades plop it on after the main course home for the holidays jodie foster directed this forgotten holiday dramedy from 1995 starring holly hunter robert downey jr anne bancroft dylan mcdermott claire danes and the guttenberg well acted and directed home for the holidays gets lost trying to stock both sides of the aisle leaving us with a comedy lacking laughs and a drama missing the required emotional payoff still there are enough terrific moments to make this low key family drama worthwhile tower heist you know the pickings are slim when a forgettable ben stiller comedy from 2011 appears on the list alas this star studded affair co starring eddie murphy matthew broderick casey affleck alan alda michael peña and téa leoni has enough laughs and action to hold one s attention for a few hours unfortunately there s not much in the way of thanksgiving on display but the picture is centered around the thanksgiving day parade and ends on a hopeful positive note murphy alone is worth the price of admission don t expect anything more than subpar entertainment and you ll have a good time pieces of april this early aughties dramedy from director peter hedges features katie holmes in her best role as april a poor girl who invites her estranged dysfunctional family to thanksgiving as april struggles to prepare the meal with the help of other tenants in her apartment building her family makes the trip to new york city and reexplores past familial issues along the way sweet and funny with a touching ending that will likely produce a lump in your throat hannah and her sisters woody allen s hannah and her sisters chronicles the lives of several people namely hannah mia farrow and her sisters holly dianne wiest and lee barbara hershey between three separate thanksgiving feasts like most allen projects the film tackles several weighty issues suicide love affairs regret drug addiction but also provides light hearted humor and enough holiday cheer for those seeking positivity during the thanksgiving weekend michael caine won a well deserved oscar for his efforts planes trains and automobiles while the above list offers a solid mix of comedy and drama all of the entries pale compared to john hughes classic planes trains and automobiles starring steve martin and john candy the film chronicles the tumultuous journey undertaken by uptight neal page martin and big hearted del griffith candy to get home in time for thanksgiving hughes who wrote and directed carefully ratchets up the hilarious mayhem but never loses sight of the intimate character relationship that raises the film to extraordinary heights one of the best holiday films ever produced other thanksgiving movie recommendations funny people judd apatow s overlong bloated dramedy isn t necessarily about thanksgiving but features a terrific scene set during the holiday in which the entire cast adam sandler seth rogen leslie mann and jonah hill among them gathers to discuss the importance of appreciating the time we have on this tiny blue planet the ice storm ang lee s powerful drama takes place over thanksgiving weekend but is certainly not the type of flick to watch with the family however if you re looking for an incredibly well acted dark and moody drama this one s for you dan in real life dan in real life feels like a thanksgiving movie despite not being a thanksgiving movie maybe it s the family gathering the warm hearted finale all the food or perhaps we just really like steve carrell but we won t judge if you pop this one in during your second slice of pumpkin pie addams family values those seeking zany dark humor should enjoy barry sonnenfeld s addams family values which features a sequence in which wednesday addams christina ricci recreates the first thanksgiving at summer camp that scene alone makes the film worthwhile you ve got mail another not really thanksgiving movie that feels like a thanksgiving movie you ve got mail stars tom hanks and meg ryan as rival bookshop owners who unknowingly engage in an online relationship the results are trite and simplistic but fun

alumnus of georgetown university in washington dc mr chiura was also very passionate about the development of his beloved zimbabwe former delta chief executive joe mtizwa a protégé and admirer of mr chiura as a business leader and person and attended the late business leaders burial yesterday spoke highly of the huge positive impact mr chiura left at delta and on zimbabwe s private sector in general i am at a loss for words he was unique you know he was very very different from the rest of the people i knew he was a very professional person but the distinguishing characteristic that i always say about him is that he was selfless he put the interests of other people first he was always wanting to make sure that everybody he came into contact with was uplifted talent developed so that people were successful he is the guy who was very strong on succession planning and human resource development at delta he really transformed delta in terms of the complexion of the leadership in the post independence period he was the champion for african and black advancement it was really a mission for him and he succeeded incredibly well by the time he retired in 1996 the majority of top leaders at delta were black by then so we leant a great lesson from him he was a man of integrity a man of unquestionable integrity he used to say to us we must be squeaky clean no corruption no underhand deals highly ethical i am running out of words to describe him he was very humble i remember after i had retired from delta and i started writing books i went to his house to see if i could convince him to write a book about him he said joe i don t want publicity mr mutizwa he pointed out that mr chuira s impact went beyond delta to a national level his relationship with the government was exemplary mr mtizwa said he worked very closely with every cabinet minister in the early government in independent zimbabwe he was if i recall correctly always hosting cabinet ministers right up to the vice president of zimbabwe vamuzenda he would come to delta he would sit with him and he would give him the best advice so i think he played a much larger role than people realise in terms of stakeholder management interacting with the government and ensuring there was a smooth relationship between the government and private sector mr mtizwa said in every company that he chaired outside of

decline to 3 2 after rising 0 5 in the previous half year the us lei fell for an eighth consecutive month suggesting the economy is possibly in a recession said ataman ozyildirim senior director of

north of the border massachusetts south shore south coast fishing report watch your step folks everything is covered with ice so be careful while the exact words may be different as well as the order if i may paraphrase captain jason colby this will pretty much be the message to his charters guests until he pulls the little sister at the end of the month when i think back of tog fishing on his

hot tog bite single digit mornings are just an illusion to anglers who have gotten soft but double digit tog are definitely a reality the fish are feeding ferociously now but they are on the move and

our weekly conversation with talk about blitzes and just as i was about to ask the size of the stripers he pivoted and said mackerel mackerel this time of the year can be the great impostor as they ll push small herring silversides and most any small prey and when combined with bird play looks for all the world as if it were a striper feed but it is often not however some of his customers are touting smelt pictures accounts on social media in winthrop harbor a few hardcore tog fishers are finding an occasional one off cedar point minot and the glades i ve also heard of some coming from

there s some smelt scuttlebutt out there lisa from fore river bait and tackle in quincy said that a customer flashed some pictures of a cooler full of the tasty critters while in the shop recently word has it that the fish were caught off summer street news continues to trickle in about winthrop smelt as well bait acquisition is tough this time of the year as shops aren t wont to carry seaworms because of lack of demand trout worms will work but grass shrimp are gold should you be fishing off a lit pier then bring along a dip net those lights will attract all kinds of critters including grass shrimp which cling to vegetation under and around the pier but will be drawn out in the open by the lights there are times when we ve been able to scoop up our bait on site anglers such as charlie murphy are still snapping up eels at fore river which is a sure indication that stripers are still in residence mackerel are no problem from nut island pier and i suspect the castle island and deer island piers trout are still being taken from houghton s pond jamaica pond and white pond not all the fish are rainbows as there was an eclectic stocking this fall which included brook trout and brown trout pete santini of fishing finatics in everett told me that tautog are cooperating for one of his customers who targets them off a myriad of piers and wharves in and around boston harbor

trout action should you be yearning for one of these indigenous members of the char family rod knows a few local honey holes which hold natives up to 12 long for a walk wade on the wild side i m fairly certain that if you picked up a few worms in the shop he d point you in the right direction hint one of those spots is in wendell regarding wild trout wild brook trout as well as brown trout can be caught from the shelburne section of the deerfield river rod is a master fly tier and he has just the pattern in stock that will work while not wanting to put the cart in front of the horse i could t resist asking spenser of berkshire bass when he expected to have safe ice to which he replied early january in addition to being a topnotch open water fisherman and guide spenser is right at home on hardwater and will be sharing his intel all winter long in this report meanwhile dropping water temperatures on the housatonic river have pushed largemouth bass into deeper water and pulled smallies and pike in close look for blowdowns and any kind of wood for the pike and pockets of hard bottom among weedbeds for the smallies he s been catching with megabass jerkbaits and in spite of the fact that it s november topwater lures still the key with working on top now is to work the bait very slowly massachusetts fishing forecast i m almost ashamed not to have a single striper picture for this weeks report i did get out on wednesday and in spite of perfect overcast rainy conditions the only striped critter i encountered was the skunk we always have reasons excuses why our fishing efforts fall flat don t we mine on this day was that i found no evidence of bait which was further verified when an eagle perched near me and after surveying the scene went on it s way when old eagle eyes doesn t see much of interest it s a safe bet there s not a heck of a lot of fish around while i was whistling dixie my mind drifted to the red hot tog bite in buzzards bay while saltwater options are shriveling up like like frost killed plants freshwater alternatives remain good wachuset reservoir is still holding salmon in the stillwater and quinapoxet rivers but that run will be ending soon the quinapoxet is a more diverse river with the occasional brown trout rainbow trout and even laker part of the catch lake trout will remain in close to the shoreline until the season closes at the end of november with really nice rainbows a viable option if you re lamenting the loss of landlockeds by wachusett take a trip out to the west branch of the swift river where the run should still have legs farther out west the housy is hot for pike and smallmouth bass in tight to the shoreline

washington joins ranks with alaska california and oregon in not having industrial fish farms rochelle baker local journalism initiative reporter canada s national observer open net pen fish farming on the pacific coast took a one two punch after operations closures were announced in both b c and washington state this week the shishalh nation said wednesday that aquaculture giant grieg seafood is removing salmon farms from the nation s waters along b c s sunshine coast by february 2023 meanwhile on monday washington state s department of natural resources dnr said it s not renewing atlantic canada s cooke seafood s last two open net pen leases in puget sound and farm operations will end by dec 14 wild salmon conservationists are celebrating both decisions saying it s writing on the wall for open net pen fish farms as well as a win for indigenous rights and first nations food security both decisions significantly benefit wild salmon at increased risk from sea lice and diseases that are amplified by open net fish farms in the ocean said stan proboszcz senior scientist at watershed watch salmon society this week s closures coupled with the previous phaseouts of salmon farms in b c s discovery islands and broughton archipelago regions suggest a domino effect is underway proboszcz said it s kind of amazing he said it puts a lot of pressure on our federal government to follow through with its commitment to remove the rest of the open net pen at salmon farms in british columbia by 2025 it also means b c is the last bastion for open net fish farms on north america s pacific coast he said cooke seafood was the only commercial open net pen operator in washington waters the dnr decision in effect means washington has joined ranks with alaska california and oregon which either don t have or don t allow industrial fish farms hiwus chief warren paull said the shishalh have longstanding concerns about the impacts of fish farms on b c s declining wild stocks and the nation s way of life shishalh waters were a hub for salmon farms at the industry s start in the province in the 1980s he said fewer farms exist now but our concerns remain shishalh has worked tirelessly to restore salmon populations and protect fish habitat paull said in a statement protecting this precious resource for future generations has always been our priority the nation relies on the precautionary principle consistent with shishalh laws and responsibilities to make decisions protect resources and ensure the long term sustainability of fisheries the statement said we commend grieg seafoods for working co operatively with shishalh nation through the decision making process paull said adding consent based decision making is an aspect of implementing the united nations declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples undrip grieg seafood supports the first nations in whose territories it operates including recognizing the rights of first nations to self determine what aquaculture development they choose for their nation the company said in a statement greig held eight fish farm licences in shishalh territory with six farms already inactive as they were older smaller sites that were difficult to farm due to warm water temperatures and higher salinity which can boost sea lice numbers harvesting at the two remaining farms in the region is finished other sites have already been dismantled and outstanding ones will be decommissioned early next year the company said the refusal to renew cooke seafood s licences to raise steelhead is a critical step to support washington waters fishermen tribes and the wild salmon everyone is ferociously fighting to save hilary franz the state s public lands commissioner said in a statement monday removing the fish farms will restore full access to culturally important fishing areas in northern skagit bay said steve edwards swinomish indian tribal community chairman cooke s net pens have interfered with the exercise of our treaty rights for far too long we look forward to the day when the hope island net pen facility will be a distant memory said edwards the announcement ended the saga with cooke seafood that started in august 2017 when hundreds of thousands of atlantic salmon escaped the company s cypress island site into the salish sea franz said cooke was fined 332 000 and found negligent by the state department of ecology in 2018 washington passed a law phasing out open net pen farming of non native fish but cooke pivoted to raising steelhead in response ultimately the dnr refused to renew the company licences after finding its operations posed a risk of environmental harm to state owned aquatic lands but in the interim the company fought us every step of the way franz said bob chamberlin chair for the first nations wild salmon alliance in b c it was gratifying to see the washington state government respond meaningfully to first nations concerns and recognize the need to protect food security and treaty rights my wish is the canadian government and specifically fisheries minister joyce murray takes note of the decision chamberlin said and they use it as a very clear example of what needs to be done to look after b c s pinnacle salmon runs that are at historic lows the shishalh decision recognized the importance of precautionary principle in protecting salmon an important resource and a thread that ties coastal and interior to one another he said activist and biologist alexandra morton said the pending fish farm removals are pushing open net pens into fewer and fewer locations on the b c coast making production more vulnerable to algal blooms disease or warm water that can kill farmed fish it s questionable whether grieg had any choice but to respect the shishalh wishes to vacate the territory given the b c government now requires first nations approval before a fish farm s tenure is renewed she added it s shocking to me that the salmon farming industry doesn t see the writing on the wall said morton if the industry recognized it was time to move to closed containment on land companies would likely benefit from public and private support and investment she said adding other infrastructure like hatcheries processing plants and transport would all remain in place but nobody s going to invest in closed containment if the cheap and dirty open net pen farms are still happening neither grieg seafood nor the b c salmon farmers association responded to questions from canada s national observer and no one was made available for an interview grieg s exit from shishalh territory is in line with the development of sites well suited to salmon farming with the additional aim of improving operations environmental footprint and fish welfare while reducing costs the company statement said the changes won t result in job losses and grieg s total harvesting volume targets will not be impacted the aquaculture company shares concerns for declining wild salmon population and is developing new farming technologies that reduce interactions between farmed and wild fish the grieg statement said related vancouver island first nations worry

alumnus of georgetown university in washington dc mr chiura was also very passionate about the development of his beloved zimbabwe former delta chief executive joe mtizwa a protégé and admirer of mr chiura as a business leader and person and attended the late business leaders burial yesterday spoke highly of the huge positive impact mr chiura left at delta and on zimbabwe s private sector in general i am at a loss for words he was unique you know he was very very different from the rest of the people i knew he was a very professional person but the distinguishing characteristic that i always say about him is that he was selfless he put the interests of other people first he was always wanting to make sure that everybody he came into contact with was uplifted talent developed so that people were successful he is the guy who was very strong on succession planning and human resource development at delta he really transformed delta in terms of the complexion of the leadership in the post independence period he was the champion for african and black advancement it was really a mission for him and he succeeded incredibly well by the time he retired in 1996 the majority of top leaders at delta were black by then so we leant a great lesson from him he was a man of integrity a man of unquestionable integrity he used to say to us we must be squeaky clean no corruption no underhand deals highly ethical i am running out of words to describe him he was very humble i remember after i had retired from delta and i started writing books i went to his house to see if i could convince him to write a book about him he said joe i don t want publicity mr mutizwa he pointed out that mr chuira s impact went beyond delta to a national level his relationship with the government was exemplary mr mtizwa said he worked very closely with every cabinet minister in the early government in independent zimbabwe he was if i recall correctly always hosting cabinet ministers right up to the vice president of zimbabwe vamuzenda he would come to delta he would sit with him and he would give him the best advice so i think he played a much larger role than people realise in terms of stakeholder management interacting with the government and ensuring there was a smooth relationship between the government and private sector mr mtizwa said in every company that he chaired outside of his roles at delta he would leave a lasting positive impact and these including banabc and cbz he had that kind of impact he also set an example to other corporates in terms of what should be done mr mtizwa reckoned you saw other companies starting to emulate delta for example on good succession planning he was visionary in the sense that when some of us came in at an early age in the 1983 era he had a plan for for me in particular over a 15 year period he said businessman and renowned economist eddie cross who had not heard about mr chiura s death was shocked by this publication he s dead he exclaimed further expressing his disbelief oh my goodness he is a legend asked what kind of person he knew mr chiura to mr cross said i think enos chiura was one of the most outstanding business persons and he made a huge contribution to the private sector in zimbabwe he was a person of absolute integrity nobody ever challenged enos integrity in any way whatsoever i think he was an example of an outstanding business leader and passing i think we should all recognise that it s a real loss to zimbabwe we are all getting older but all the same enos was exceptional in every way i think he was a real gentleman and a family man mr cross said

the forecast does not reflect a recession just the threat of one but it notes that the longer inflation persists the more likely a national recession becomes the shortfall is driven mostly by declines in income tax revenue and drop offs in the stock market though analysts noted job losses in the tech sector may also contribute to deepened revenue deficits it s not insignificant but it s also manageable legislative analyst gabe petek said in a briefing with reporters we don t think of this as a budget crisis we just think of it as a notable budget problem california has about 37 billion in several different savings accounts about 23 billion of which lawmakers could dip into for next year s budget but the lao recommends lawmakers save the money in case of a recession based on historical experience should a recession occur soon revenues could be 30 billion to 50 billion below our revenue outlook in the budget window the report states in that case the state may need to draw from its rainy day fund analysts also say spending cuts could be avoided if lawmakers instead pause or delay some funding that was allocated in previous years petek pointed to certain climate programs as an example of funding that could wait until revenues are more stable we re not saying they shouldn t still be done but it s a matter of timing he said they could adjust the timing of the roll out of the funding to help manage the near term budget pressure a new chapter in california s boom and bust cycle the announcement underscores california s volatile tax revenue system which has whiplashed between record deficits and surpluses since the covid 19 pandemic struck in 2020 that year the state legislature cut spending to fill a 54 billion deficit in what lawmakers and analysts now acknowledge was an overcorrection in 2021 and 2022 lawmakers had close to 100 billion in surplus funds and federal aid which they used to boost spending on education homelessness health care for undocumented residents and more the budget also included a 17 billion inflation relief package with rebates between 200 and 1 050 for middle and low income taxpayers the state s revenue collections rely heavily on its top 1 of earners who provide nearly half of all income tax revenue through a progressive income tax and capital gains taxes on stock and property sales while higher earners did well during the past few years an economic slowdown will mean reduced revenues for the state democratic lawmakers newsom stress budget resilience state lawmakers and governor gavin newsom have stressed that the vast majority of surplus funds from recent years have been spent on one time allocations but the report notes a small number of ongoing expenditures are expected to grow in the coming years placing new pressure on the budget democratic leaders in the legislature say they are committed to protecting new investments in areas including education while budgeting responsibly the california constitution requires lawmakers to pass a balanced budget annually state senate leader toni atkins d san diego said thanks to using previous surplus funds to pay down debts and boost reserves we are confident that we can protect our progress and craft a state budget without ongoing cuts to schools and other core programs or taxing middle class families we can and will protect the progress of recent years budgets said assembly speaker anthony rendon in particular the assembly will protect california s historic school funding gains as districts must continue to invest in retaining and recruiting staff to help kids advance and recover from the pandemic earlier this fall newsom vetoed dozens of bills that would have put the state on the hook for new unbudgeted spending citing lower than expected revenues a spokesperson for the department of finance said in september the combination of a shrinking unemployment rate and declining income tax revenues likely means the state is feeling the effects of job losses in higher earning industries such as tech those job losses will likely have a disproportionate impact on state revenues legislative analysts acknowledged recent layoffs at twitter meta and amazon could lead to further impacts to california s budget assembly republican leader james gallagher r yuba city said the minority party has fought democrats who control the legislature on increased government spending we overtaxed californians and grew government while ignoring investments in critical infrastructure like new water storage gallagher said in a statement it s not too late to focus our spending on the fundamental priorities save for the rainy day to come and pursue policies that will grow the economy and lower everyday costs for californians newsom will present a proposed budget in january which will outline his priorities for the next fiscal year copyright 2022 capradio

endangered amazon retail giant warns layoffs will continue into next year as it prepares to fire 10 000 staff and warns them that number could rise this week amazon announced its first round of significant layoffs as the company prepares to shed 10 000 employees in the next several months the layoffs primarily hit the amazon alexa team and will continue impacting the hr and retail divisions employees were left scrambling earlier this week when news broke that layoffs were coming and some were then summoned to a meeting with executives the company is planning to shed at least three percent of its corporate work force as the tech sector continues massive rounds of layoffs amazon ceo andy jassy said the company will continue to layoff workers into the new year in a memo sent around thursday the news arrives following the announcement earlier this week that the company will be laying off at least 10 000 workers as the entire tech sector continues to struggle i ve been in this role now for about a year and a half and without a doubt this is the most difficult decision we ve made during that time and we ve had to make some very tough calls over the past couple of years particularly during the heart of the pandemic wrote jassy in the memo it s not lost on me or any of the leaders who make these decisions that these aren t just roles we re eliminating but rather people with emotions ambitions and responsibilities whose lives will be impacted the massive company employs about 330 000 white collar and tech employees meaning the 10 000 layoffs will amount to about 3 3 percent of its corporate staff amazon ceo andy jassy sent a memo to employees wednesday regarding the recent round of layoffs in which he indicated that more will be coming the company reportedly offered buyouts to employees to voluntarily walk away by offering three months severance pay plus one week of salary for every six months of tenure at the company it is still unknown which employees will get the boot next as layoffs continue amazon hq in seattle washington the company has become the latest tech sector firm to announce major layoffs tech companies across the sector have announced massive layoffs over the last several months as inflation and a weakening economy hit the field especially hard in his note to those who remain at the company for now jassy wrote that despite current setbacks he remains optimistic about the future of the company the key will be to do what amazon does best obsess over customers and invent relentlessly on their behalf and if we do that we should all be very optimistic about amazon s future i know i am he wrote a chaotic environment quickly emerged at the company earlier this week after a number of employees learned they were the first of the expected 10 000 to be laid off during a 15 minute meeting with executives news of the coming layoffs broke on monday as employees got a calendar invitation to the quick scripted meeting with executives on tuesday the first round of layoffs specifically impacted members of the alexa voice assistant division the company reportedly offered buyouts to the employees to voluntarily walk away with three months severance pay plus one week of salary for every six months of tenure at the company vox reported amazon executive dave limp who oversees the alexa departments finally broke the news to workers on wednesday many of those employees have since flooded linkedin looking in search of new opportunities today i found out that i ve been laid off raj kansagra a software engineer said i m joining many others who are experiencing the feelings that come with losing your dream job many of those reaching out on linkedin also noted that they had limited visas and were desperate to find a new job that will allow them to stay in the us zukeun cao who was only hired in march was one such employee living in seattle on stem opt a 24 month visa for students working or studying in stem fields that can be extended for three years after graduation it is still hard to digest the fact that i was amongst the employees affected due to layoffs at alexa ai cao wrote it s unfortunate and heartbreaking to learn this before the holiday for all impacted 10 000 ex amazonian all the best to us many of the laid off workers went to linkedin to announce they had lost their dream job many of those reaching out on linkedin also noted that they had limited visas and were desperate to find a new job that will allow them to stay in the us it took 48 hours from the initial news breaks for executives to confirm that many team members were in fact getting the axe in a message to workers on wednesday limp wrote after a deep set of reviews we recently decided to consolidate some teams and programs one of the consequences of these decisions is that some roles will no longer be required it pains me to have to deliver this news as we know we will lose talented amazonians from the devices services org as a result it is not currently known how many employees have so far lost their jobs an amazon senior manager who spoke under the condition of anonymity condemned the way the company laid off his colleges this is a horrendous way to treat people the manager told vox i don t even know if i want to work for this company anymore many former amazon employees asked for help on linkedin as they noted that they had limited visas and were desperate to look for a new job to help them stay in the us following limp s message to workers amazon released a public statement confirming the new layoffs as part of our annual operating planning review process we always look at each of our businesses and what we believe we should change the statement read as we ve gone through this given the current macro economic environment as well as several years of rapid hiring some teams are making adjustments which in some cases means certain roles are no longer necessary we don t take these decisions lightly and we are working to support any employees who may be affected according to the new york times the online retailer plans to layoff 10 000 people in corporate and technology jobs in what would be the largest jobs cut in the company s history the cuts will primary impact the alexa team as well as the company s retail division and human resources the 10 000 lost jobs represent about 3 percent of amazon s corporate workforce though the cuts account for less than 1 percent of the company s global workforce of more than 1 5 million which comprises mainly hourly workers amazon executive dave limp above who oversees the alexa departments informed employees on wednesday that the reported layoffs were indeed coming executives reportedly axed the workers in a 15 minute scripted meeting the company was trading at 95 77 down 46 percent from the same time last year the proposed layoffs mark a dramatic turn of events for amazon which had seen its most profitable era during the covid pandemic when people across the world were forced to stay at home it doubled its workforce over the course of just two years and funneled its massive earnings into new projects in an effort to hire even more employees earlier this year amazon more than doubled its cap on cash compensation for tech workers citing a particularly competitive labor market but in its quarterly earnings report at the end of september executives warned investors that its growth may stumble and possibly decline to the lowest point since 2001 amid record high inflation as of thursday afternoon the company was trading at 95 77 down 46 percent from the same time last year apple ceo tim cook told cbs mornings on monday he plans to freeze hiring on monday apple ceo tim cook also told cbs mornings that it is slowing some hiring as well what we re doing as a consequence of being in this period is we re being very deliberate in our hiring he said that means we re continuing to hire but not everywhere in the company are we hiring at the same time though cook said we don t believe you can save your way to prosperity advertisement we think you invest your way to it he said

washington joins ranks with alaska california and oregon in not having industrial fish farms rochelle baker local journalism initiative reporter canada s national observer open net pen fish farming on the pacific coast took a one two punch after operations closures were announced in both b c and washington state this week the shishalh nation said wednesday that aquaculture giant grieg seafood is removing salmon farms from the nation s waters along b c s sunshine coast by february 2023 meanwhile on monday washington state s department of natural resources dnr said it s not renewing atlantic canada s cooke seafood s last two open net pen leases in puget sound and farm operations will end by dec 14 wild salmon conservationists are celebrating both decisions saying it s writing on the wall for open net pen fish farms as well as a win for indigenous rights and first nations food security both decisions significantly benefit wild salmon at increased risk from sea lice and diseases that are amplified by open net fish farms in the ocean said stan proboszcz senior scientist at watershed watch salmon society this week s closures coupled with the previous phaseouts of salmon farms in b c s discovery islands and broughton archipelago regions suggest a domino effect is underway proboszcz said it s kind of amazing he said it puts a lot of pressure on our federal government to follow through with its commitment to remove the rest of the open net pen at salmon farms in british columbia by 2025 it also means b c is the last bastion for open net fish farms on north america s pacific coast he said cooke seafood was the only commercial open net pen operator in washington waters the dnr decision in effect means washington has joined ranks with alaska california and oregon which either don t have or don t allow industrial fish farms hiwus chief warren paull said the shishalh have longstanding concerns about the impacts of fish farms on b c s declining wild stocks and the nation s way of life shishalh waters were a hub for salmon farms at the industry s start in the province in the 1980s he said fewer farms exist now but our concerns remain shishalh has worked tirelessly to restore salmon populations and protect fish habitat paull said in a statement protecting this precious resource for future generations has always been our priority the nation relies on the precautionary principle consistent with shishalh laws and responsibilities to make decisions protect resources and ensure the long term sustainability of fisheries the statement said we commend grieg seafoods for working co operatively with shishalh nation through the decision making process paull said adding consent based decision making is an aspect of implementing the united nations declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples undrip grieg seafood supports the first nations in whose territories it operates including recognizing the rights of first nations to self determine what aquaculture development they choose for their nation the company said in a statement greig held eight fish farm licences in shishalh territory with six farms already inactive as they were older smaller sites that were difficult to farm due to warm water temperatures and higher salinity which can boost sea lice numbers harvesting at the two remaining farms in the region is finished other sites have already been dismantled and outstanding ones will be decommissioned early next year the company said the refusal to renew cooke seafood s licences to raise steelhead is a critical step to support washington waters fishermen tribes and the wild salmon everyone is ferociously fighting to save hilary franz the state s public lands commissioner said in a statement monday removing the fish farms will restore full access to culturally important fishing areas in northern skagit bay said steve edwards swinomish indian tribal community chairman cooke s net pens have interfered with the exercise of our treaty rights for far too long we look forward to the day when the hope island net pen facility will be a distant memory said edwards the announcement ended the saga with cooke seafood that started in august 2017 when hundreds of thousands of atlantic salmon escaped the company s cypress island site into the salish sea franz said cooke was fined 332 000 and found negligent by the state department of ecology in 2018 washington passed a law phasing out open net pen farming of non native fish but cooke pivoted to raising steelhead in response ultimately the dnr refused to renew the company licences after finding its operations posed a risk of environmental harm to state owned aquatic lands but in the interim the company fought us every step of the way franz said bob chamberlin chair for the first nations wild salmon alliance in b c it was gratifying to see the washington state government respond meaningfully to first nations concerns and recognize the need to protect food security and treaty rights my wish is the canadian government and specifically fisheries minister joyce murray takes note of the decision chamberlin said and they use it as a very clear example of what needs to be done to look after b c s pinnacle salmon runs that are at historic lows the shishalh decision recognized the importance of precautionary principle in protecting salmon an important resource and a thread that ties coastal and interior to one another he said activist and biologist alexandra morton said the pending fish farm removals are pushing open net pens into fewer and fewer locations on the b c coast making production more vulnerable to algal blooms disease or warm water that can kill farmed fish it s questionable whether grieg had any choice but to respect the shishalh wishes to vacate the territory given the b c government now requires first nations approval before a fish farm s tenure is renewed she added it s shocking to me that the salmon farming industry doesn t see the writing on the wall said morton if the industry recognized it was time to move to closed containment on land companies would likely benefit from public and private support and investment she said adding other infrastructure like hatcheries processing plants and transport would all remain in place but nobody s going to invest in closed containment if the cheap and dirty open net pen farms are still happening neither grieg seafood nor the b c salmon farmers association responded to questions from canada s national observer and no one was made available for an interview grieg s exit from shishalh territory is in line with the development of sites well suited to salmon farming with the additional aim of improving operations environmental footprint and fish welfare while reducing costs the company statement said the changes won t result in job losses and grieg s total harvesting volume targets will not be impacted the aquaculture company shares concerns for declining wild salmon population and is developing new farming technologies that reduce interactions between farmed and wild fish the grieg statement said related vancouver island first nations worry

summary china has changed since 2019 but so has the world china s zero covid policy is causing serious economic damage internally and globally but the virus is again spreading as china seeks to reopen asian aviation and markets are most deeply affected by the closure econo strategic moves like the belt and road will potentially influence aviation policy weaponising tourism flows could again be a tool used full reopening looks unlikely until well into 2023 the geopolitical canvas has been repainted since 2019 with little clear evidence to go on china s aviation outlook remains inscrutable so it is possible only to speculate on what the differences will look like when it emerges from covid lockdown in addition the rest of the world is reassessing a wide range of issues that will have an effect on global aviation both independent of china and in their attitudes towards the country wider trade and security issues have always influenced aviation strategy fluctuating according to the contemporary international environment in turbulent times aviation can be little more than a rowboat in a storm casual damage like the saudi strategic ban on airspace access by qatar is one example and the aircraft and airline sanctions involved in the russian invasion of ukraine a more pungent one there have been many others involving airspace and market access where geopolitics intrudes today that environment is as acutely sensitive as it has been for several decades as china rattles the sabre against taiwan and expands its reach across the south china sea and into the south pacific while north korea recommences provocations against the south and more widely northeast asia is potentially a dangerous place europe is already dangerous as russia escalates its attacks in ukraine supported by iran and not opposed by china all of this too is against a background of the intensifying rivalry for global leadership between the us and china so that trade and security issues aggregate to form a new set of strategy priorities interpreting what influence these will have on china s future aviation outlook is no easy task beyond assuming there will be changes much of the new status quo has evolved since 2019 during which time china has been effectively closed to international passenger aviation until earlier this year most of the rest of the world had been closed as well the summer 2022 reopening of international air services in north america and europe might offer some indicators of what might be expected meanwhile intra americas international services had been largely restored when china reopens there was the expected surge in tourism demand as barriers to travel were removed although it wasn t clear if the anticipated uptake was as enthusiastic across the board as hoped for in most markets around the world the waters were further muddied by overwhelming staffing and infrastructure logjams with immediate operational impacts that will almost certainly last into the longer term a clear legacy of covid 19 will the same occur in china perhaps not given the lessons learned as well as the way china s domestic system continued with ups and downs through most of the past three years it s also unlikely that china s reopening will be anything like as gung ho as europe s and america s instead allowing for a more phased and cautious and targeted reintroduction of traffic flows with president xi now in complete control the zero covid policy can be revisited early signs are that president xi will look to re establish business as usual this may well be an imperative as china s economic growth slows there are enough economic problems at home to suggest restricting international links that could have repercussions domestically during the president s active round of discussions at the mid nov 2022 g20 meeting in bali indonesia suggests an eagerness at least to open doors which had closed over recent months in both political and trade areas if restoring foreign trade is essential it comes with the qualification that under a now all powerful president xi china s increased assertiveness internationally elevates its influence on overall policy since his reappointment as general secretary effectively for life and the removal from the powerful politburo standing committee of any opposition the utterings of the chinese president will be law in early nov 2022 while welcoming german chancellor scholz the first european leader to visit china at the head of a trade mission president xi expressed the hope that the two countries could continue to collaborate amid times of change and turmoil and to contribute more to global peace and development however more ominously according to xinhua the chinese president added the proviso that this could occur as long as the two countries uphold the principles of mutual respect seeking common ground while reserving differences carrying out exchanges and learning from each other and win win cooperation for european countries and the eu overall a major issue in this regard would be concern over china s human rights performance but for china s east asian neighbours the concern will be even more challenging as the security divide between the us and china widens most have until now managed to tread a fine line between clear cut support for either side a sort of stable ambiguity the elevation of tensions in east asia over taiwan and disputes over territorial waters is making fence sitting with opaque positions much more difficult most notably for japan and south korea for both of them china is unavoidably a key aviation partner and the us and its allies is the key security partner the partial reopening only amplifies the complex challenge beijing faces some analysts have suggested that now president xi s position is so secure he will relax the strict zero covid policy that has kept china shuttered to the outside world or more specifically subject to at least 10 days quarantine on arrival or return this would assume a purely political and potentially dangerous decision from a health viewpoint such a move must seem very unlikely numbers are spiking across china even with lockdowns eight out of ten major cities reported cases in oct 2022 the result of holiday travel so it was unsurprising that immediately following beijing s announcement of an easing of entry requirements in early nov 2022 china s airline stocks surged and airline booking numbers doubled within an hour china s hang seng index rose 8 and asian share markets made their largest gains in two years such is the importance attached to the chinese market air china share price one month to 16 nov 2022 but the euphoria was short lived for practical purposes the move was more symbolic than functional airlines operating to and from china were pleased because the unattractive system of penalising them for bringing a covid case into the country was terminated for visitors though the improvement was limited previously arrivals had to stay a week under guard in a hotel or similar facility plus three days confined to home the week was reduced to five days plus three days at home it was a step in the right direction but hardly enough to open the floodgates as the economy stutters and the public becomes visibly more unhappy with lockdowns some locked down guangzhou residents staged a noisy outbreak on 14 nov 2022 the virus is spreading rapidly with nearly 18 000 new cases that day 5 000 of them in guangzhou large conurbations including chongqing and zhengzhou are also experiencing surges with the new more infectious variants spreading around the world it is hardly a time to be allowing greater mobility within china so despite the rising economic and social cost of semi isolation it would be bold and even foolish to remove all entry restrictions in the near future look out for the future parts of this focus on china including more detailed aviation insights on the country

arugula meanwhile the price for lettuce has skyrocketed with romaine and iceberg going for as much as 5 99 a head we have not seen prices this high that i recall in my 30 years in the industry said steve bamford the president of bamford produce in an email advertisement 2 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content hi given the recent industry wide shortage facing lettuce our garden and caesar salads are temporarily unavailable some of our other items that normally contain lettuce like wraps burgers will be served without lettuce for the time being we apologize for the inconvenience swiss chalet swisschaletca november 7 2022 on the order section of its website subway canada says it s grappling with a lettuce shortage and is instituting a temporary lettuce portion reduction on its sandwiches because of supply issues the shortage is largely due to a dry growing season in california followed by a round of a virus that killed off a lot of the lettuce crop explained sylvain charlebois who researches food distribution security and safety at dalhousie university primarily the shortage is affecting romaine and iceberg lettuce in california the weather has been quite dry which has made plants weaker and a virus actually ravaged many crops there and so a lot of farmers just couldn t have anything to sell explained charlebois advertisement 3 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content the shortage has made it challenging for grocers to get ahold of supply and that s assuming charlebois said that they want to even carry a product that s selling for well above usual prices they just don t want to carry an overpriced product and being stuck with excess inventory and that inventory will likely go to waste said charlebois prices have tripled or quintupled over the past six months statcan reported that lettuce was 30 per cent more expensive this october compared to last year a search of ontario grocery store websites had iceberg and romaine lettuce going for 4 99 or 5 99 a head this week gypsy souliere the assistant manager at the kensington location of h w produce an alberta fruit and vegetable grocer said they re struggling to get stock and can t even guarantee if they ll end up with fulfilled orders souliere said 1 49 to 2 49 would be a reasonable price but lettuce is going for 5 99 per head there s a wow factor souliere said when people see prices though h w is trying to keep prices low advertisement 4 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content it s been a really tough year for produce in general said souliere over the past week i ve tried ordering head lettuce specifically romaine lettuce other various types almost on a daily basis and i ve received it maybe two out of the past seven days and the subsequent increase in costs has made lettuce expensive not just for your average consumer but for restauranteurs as well who aren t looking to buy a single head of iceberg to chop up for a supper salad the regular person can go without lettuce for a bit restaurants can t a case of lettuce would normally be between 30 to 40 and they re now upwards of 150 per case they re struggling the most out of anybody else in our customer base said souliere advertisement 5 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content for those who can t swap out romaine or iceberg for arugula or kale said souliere they have no choice but to bite the bullet they just end up suffering with the profits of their business souliere said in swift current sask shaun hanna the co owner of nightjar diner company said it s disheartening to see prices so high and the quality not as good as might normally be expected while restaurants can make decisions to pull items from their menus or hike prices he said people are facing loads of pressures on their wallets and they still want to offer a decent affordable dining experience we re looking at ways of doing that without having produce in canada it s a very challenging prospect hanna said advertisement 6 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content we re looking down the pipeline and we know that it s likely going to be to the point where maybe we re not going to be able to get that produce in to properly garnish our burgers and our salads and that sort of thing so we re going to have to be more creative in canada there isn t any good way to overcome the shortfall there s little lettuce production this time of year because of the temperatures and while there are some greenhouses they cannot fill the overwhelming demand during these type of shortages explained bamford the good news said charlebois is that around december importers usually switch from california lettuce to lettuce grown in arizona and mexico which means the shortage ought to be temporary since those crops are looking to be in good shape this is good news for grocers as lettuce along with onions cucumbers and tomatoes are high volume sellers and for canadians who tend to buy a lot of lettuce in the winter months we should actually have plenty of leafy greens on the market by the time we get to the holidays said charlebois email tdawson postmedia com twitter tylerrdawson recommended from editorial would mask mandates doom us to a perpetual pandemic by delaying kids immunity is the

practice in binary options trading for beginners from latin america if you are new to trading binary options trading might be a good choice for you it has become the most popular way to trade because it can be used in many different ways and covers everything also you don t have to know a lot about it to understand how it works a good broker can help you by giving you all the information you need most binary options are short term investments that can be cashed out in as little as a few minutes or as long as a few hours they are considered high risk investments because it is hard to know what will happen but binary site options can give investors the chance to make a lot of money in a short amount of time strategies as binary options trading gets more popular more and more people look for ways to make money trading there are a lot of different types of strategies and many of them can be very helpful but there is no strategy for trading binary options that will guarantee you make money that s because success in this kind of trading depends so much on risk and taking chances still if you have a plan trading can be a little bit easier some of the most common strategies are follow the trends this is the most common way to use binary options and trade financial assets in general it s pretty obvious that you should go with the flow as the name suggests you keep an eye on the current price trends of any underlying asset you re trading for example if the price of gold is going up which it often does during times of inflation you can make predictions based on how the price is moving right now if the price looks like it s going up you call if it looks like it s going down you put 60 second strategy the 60 second binary options strategy is based on trades with a 1 minute expiration this plan is popular for more than one reason first the number of trades you can make every day is much greater than what you can do with hourly or daily trades second both beginners and experienced traders like the 60 second strategy because it is easy to use to figure out where the price will be when the trade ends you need to look at technical indicators the support and resistance levels which show the typical highs and lows of an asset are the most important metrics hedging strategy the hedging strategy for binary options also called pairing is to buy and sell the same asset at the same time by playing both sides a trader can keep losses to a minimum because they will win something no matter what this strategy comes from betting where you cover possible losses by putting money on both teams with this strategy traders can get rid of many of the risky and uncertain parts of trading binary options benefits most of the time binary options are easier to trade than traditional options because you only have to guess whether the price of the underlying asset will go up or down you don t have to guess how exactly the price will move traditional options can pay out less than binary options as the payout is often all or nothing if your prediction is right you get the whole payout but if it is wrong you get nothing among other things you can trade binary options on stocks commodities currencies and indices this gives you a lot of options when it comes to what you sell profitability trading binary options can be a good way to make money but there are also some risks so much of a trader s success depends on how good their trading strategy is how their broker works how much risk they are willing to take and how the market is in general trading binary options isn t really a full time job instead it s more of a way to make some extra money on the side risks first you might not have enough experience to trade well you can lose a lot of money if you don t know what you re doing the market could also be unstable and change quickly which is another risk this can make it hard to tell where the market is going which could cause you to lose money not to mention there is always a chance that the company you are doing business with is not real there have been cases of companies going out of business overnight leaving traders with no money make sure you know a lot about a company before you decide to invest in it conclusion binary trading can be very profitable but new traders need to know that it can also be very risky when trading binary options you ll do very well if you use a good strategy and look at the market correctly share

they are not displaying their anxiety in public unlike a young demonstrator i wrote about in my last column all the businesspeople i interviewed for this article requested anonymity for fear of punishment by authorities but they are expressing dissent in their own way pledging to withhold further investment in china or even contemplating leaving their country for another that would exchange a passport for their wealth the party under xi has taken control of nearly every aspect of society costing chinese people agency over their destinies members of the business class especially those working at the top of the technology sector who operated with relatively few restrictions until a few years ago have taken it especially hard china s strict covid zero policies have started to ease credit bloomberg these tech entrepreneurs mostly grew up in the age of economism when money making economic principles and economic rationality trumped everything else said minxin pei professor of government at claremont mckenna college in california now they see the regime puts politics in command he said for them this is incomprehensible in the past decade xi s economic thinking can be summed up like this bigger roles for the state and smaller roles for the market he left the private sector largely alone in his first term when he was busy consolidating his power within the party and the military in his second term which began in 2017 xi kept private enterprises on a much tighter leash the government cracked down on businesses sending some of the country s most successful business people into early retirement or self imposed exile china s harsh zero covid policy has left the economy in the worst shape in decades to chinese in the business elite who grew accustomed to the privilege and attention their success brought the big boss as many of them refer to xi doesn t care about the economy or people like them in his opening address at the party congress xi mentioned security 52 times marxism 15 times and markets three times loading there s no question about the shift both in political rhetoric and in action and in also the appointment of the team said pei who said he believes that xi s leadership lineup shows that he does not value expertise in managing a market oriented economy he values people who can implement his policy regardless of the economic consequences that makes the business community anxious under xi the ability of china s bureaucracy to dictate to the public has increased while its ability to govern has decreased guoguang wu an adviser to former premier zhao ziyang in the 1980s told me on my chinese language podcast when the ability to govern decreases even in the absence of any particular policy from the top the ineptitude brutality and ignorance of lower level officials will brew disasters for the common people they rule over said wu who is a senior research scholar at the stanford centre on china s economy and institutions many businesspeople have lost a lot of money under zero covid which has shuttered cities and locked millions of people in their homes for weeks at a time as the government seeks to eliminate the coronavirus under the leadership of this dictator our great country is falling into an abyss said a hardware tech executive in shenzhen but you can t do anything about it it pains and depresses me despite many conversations over the years we never talked about politics i was surprised when he called after the party congress to talk about his political depression he said he used to be very nationalistic believing that the chinese were among the smartest and the most hardworking people in the world now he and many of his friends spend most of their time hiking golfing and drinking we re too depressed to work he said until a year ago his startup was doing so well that he was planning to take it public then he lost a big chunk of his revenues and his new hires sat idly with nothing to do when cities were locked down under the zero covid rules he said now he has no choice but to lay off more than 100 people sell his business and move his family to north america since the dark night has descended he said i ll deal with it the dark night way the tech entrepreneur from beijing who texted me after the party congress recounted a chilling experience in may when there were rumours that beijing could be locked down he felt he could not tell his employees to leave work early and stock up on groceries he was worried that he could be reported for spreading rumours something that had gotten people detained by police he told them only that they should feel free to leave early if they had things to take care of after the party congress most people in the investor s circle expect that they will be forced to pay more in taxes or be expected to donate more money to universities and other state backed charities they are not planning to make any big investments this successful business person is now applying to emigrate to a european country and the united states just like many ordinary chinese people the executives i spoke to said they were horrified by the video of hu jintao xi s predecessor as china s top leader being abruptly led out of the closing ceremony of the party congress they did not accept the official government explanation that hu had to leave early because of health issues if xi could remove his predecessor like that several of them said he could do anything to anyone loading a well connected investor in beijing said that his friends who are entrepreneurs now realised they could no longer remain indifferent to politics at social gatherings they have started discussing which countries to seek passports from and how to move their assets offshore at social gatherings hosts are asking friends to surrender their phones to be kept in a separate place for fear of surveillance after the party congress most people in the investor s

for ukraine in the months since russia s invasion of ukraine began greene said americans deserve to know where their money is going and how it s being spent she compared the billions of dollars sent to ukraine with the amount of money border officials say they need to patrol the u s mexico border we are completely protecting another country s border and also waging a proxy war with russia greene said we had five million people cross our border illegally since joe biden took office let s compare that to how many russians have invaded ukraine 82 thousand russians have invaded ukraine president trump s border wall would have only cost 22 billion with the money we ve sent to ukraine we could have already secured our border but we re not doing that greene said on thursday green also tweeted a

and is instituting a temporary lettuce portion reduction on its sandwiches because of supply issues the shortage is largely due to a dry growing season in california followed by a round of a virus that killed off a lot of the lettuce crop explained sylvain charlebois who researches food distribution security and safety at dalhousie university primarily the shortage is affecting romaine and iceberg lettuce in california the weather has been quite dry which has made plants weaker and a virus actually ravaged many crops there and so a lot of farmers just couldn t have anything to sell

they want to even carry a product that s selling for well above usual prices they just don t want to carry an overpriced product and being stuck with excess inventory and that inventory will likely go to waste said charlebois prices have tripled or quintupled over the past six months statcan reported that lettuce was 30 per cent more expensive this october compared to last year a search of ontario grocery store websites had iceberg and romaine lettuce going for 4 99 or 5 99 a head this week gypsy souliere the assistant manager at the kensington location of h w produce an alberta fruit and vegetable grocer said they re struggling to get stock and can t even guarantee if they ll end up with fulfilled orders souliere said 1 49 to 2 49 would be a reasonable price but lettuce is going for 5

article continues below article content it s been a really tough year for produce in general said souliere over the past week i ve tried ordering head lettuce specifically romaine lettuce other various types almost on a daily basis and i ve received it maybe two out of the past seven days and the subsequent increase in costs has made lettuce expensive not just for your average consumer but for restauranteurs as well who aren t looking to buy a single head of iceberg to chop up for a supper salad the regular person can go without lettuce for a bit restaurants can t a case of lettuce would normally be between 30 to 40 and they re now upwards of 150 per case they re struggling the most out of anybody else in our customer base said souliere advertisement 5 story continues below this

bullet they just end up suffering with the profits of their business souliere said in swift current sask shaun hanna the co owner of nightjar diner company said it s disheartening to see prices so high and the quality not as good as might normally be expected while restaurants can make decisions to pull items from their menus or hike prices he said people are facing loads of pressures on their wallets and they still want to offer a decent affordable dining experience we re looking at ways of doing that without having produce in canada it s a very challenging prospect hanna said advertisement 6 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content we re looking down the pipeline and we know that it s likely going to be to the point where maybe we re not going to be able to get that produce in to properly garnish our burgers and our salads and that sort of thing so we re going to have to be more creative in canada there isn t any good way to overcome the shortfall there s little lettuce production this time of year because of the temperatures and while there are some greenhouses they cannot fill the overwhelming demand during these type of shortages explained bamford the good news said charlebois is that around december importers usually switch from california lettuce to lettuce grown in arizona and mexico which means the shortage ought to be temporary since those crops are looking to be in good shape this is good news for grocers as lettuce along with onions cucumbers and tomatoes are high volume sellers and for canadians who tend to buy a lot of lettuce in the winter months we should actually have plenty of leafy greens on the market by the time we get to the holidays said charlebois email

syracuse what could possibly be one of the largest economic development projects in recent nebraska history is seemingly closer than it s ever been that was the sentiment thursday from officials with niocorp which has been working for years to build a rare metals mine near elk creek in johnson county we are significantly closer than we have ever been said mark smith ceo of the colorado based company i can t wait to bring the little red shovel out here and break ground he told a few dozen people who came to hear a presentation at the kimmel event center in syracuse what has smith so optimistic is a deal niocorp announced in september to acquire gx acquisition corp the deal which the two firms hope will close in the first quarter of next year will provide niocorp with about 285 million in capital that s a little more than one fourth of what it needs to fund the estimated 1 1 billion startup costs for the mine which will produce niobium an additive that strengthens steel along with scandium which does the same thing for aluminum and titanium on a site about 70 miles southeast of lincoln there s also a potential to mine rare earth elements that are used in electric cars wind turbines and other products niocorp also has an agreement to borrow up to 81 million from yorkville advisors a new jersey based investment firm that specializes in lending to micro cap and small cap companies the combination of niocorp and gx acquisition is by no means a done deal gx is what s known as a blank check company meaning it was created solely to merge with another company in most of those transactions the blank check company buys a private company and provides it access to a public stock exchange in this case niocorp which is already publicly traded on the toronto stock exchange is technically buying gx acquisition and hopes to get a listing on the nasdaq stock exchange where gx is already traded to do so it will have to do a reverse stock split essentially combining two or more shares into one because it currently trades below the nasdaq minimum price of 1 per share assuming the merger goes as planned niocorp officials said construction could start pretty quickly on the mine shaft portion of the project we are absolutely shovel ready smith said noting the company has all permits in hand and has done some site preparation work he said financing remains an issue and niocorp would still need to find somewhere between 700 million and 800 million to complete construction and get the mine up and running financing at this level is complicated and it does take a lot of time smith said but he also noted that one thing he s learned over his more than four decades in the business world is that when you have a good project you will find the financing and you will bring it into production and i ve known that on this project for over 10 years now we re going to get there this is a good project once construction does start it will take about three years to complete said scott honan niocorp s chief financial officer the company has estimated the project will create more than 2 000 construction jobs including 450 permanent positions over the 30 year life of the mine honan said it s estimated the company will pay more than 1 billion in wages to local employees and generate more than 600 million in state and local taxes gov elect jim pillen who attended the presentation called the project really really important because it will produce metals that are now almost exclusively imported from other countries this project s really a big deal because it s about national security pillen said

for open net pen fish farms as well as a win for indigenous rights and first nations food security both decisions significantly benefit wild salmon at increased risk from sea lice and diseases that are amplified by open net fish farms in the ocean said stan proboszcz senior scientist at watershed watch salmon society this week s closures coupled with the previous phaseouts of salmon farms in b c s discovery islands and broughton archipelago regions suggest a domino effect is underway proboszcz said it s kind of amazing he said it puts a lot of pressure on our federal government to follow through with its commitment to remove the rest of the open net pen at salmon farms in british columbia by 2025 it also means b c is the last bastion for open net fish farms on north america s pacific coast he said cooke seafood was the only commercial open net pen operator in washington waters the dnr decision in effect means washington has joined ranks with alaska california and oregon which either don t have or don t allow industrial fish farms hiwus chief warren paull said the shishalh have longstanding concerns about the impacts of fish farms on b c s declining wild stocks and the nation s way of life shishalh waters were a hub for salmon farms at the industry s start in the province in the 1980s he said fewer farms exist now but our concerns remain shishalh has worked tirelessly to restore salmon populations and protect fish habitat paull said in a statement protecting this precious resource for future generations has always been our priority the nation relies on the precautionary principle consistent with shishalh laws and responsibilities to make decisions protect resources and ensure the long term sustainability of fisheries the statement said we commend grieg seafoods for working co operatively with shishalh nation through the decision making process paull said adding consent based decision making is an aspect of implementing the united nations declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples undrip grieg seafood supports the first nations in whose territories it operates including recognizing the rights of first nations to self determine what aquaculture development they choose for their nation the company said in a statement greig held eight fish farm licences in shishalh territory with six farms already inactive as they were older smaller sites that were difficult to farm due to warm water temperatures and higher salinity which can boost sea lice numbers harvesting at the two remaining farms in the region is finished other sites have already been dismantled and outstanding ones will be decommissioned early next year the company said the refusal to renew cooke seafood s licences to raise steelhead is a critical step to support washington waters fishermen tribes and the wild salmon everyone is ferociously fighting to save hilary franz the state s public lands commissioner said in a statement monday removing the fish farms will restore full access to culturally important fishing areas in northern skagit bay said steve edwards swinomish indian tribal community chairman cooke s net pens have interfered with the exercise of our treaty rights for far too long we look forward to the day when the hope island net pen facility will be a distant memory said edwards the announcement ended the saga with cooke seafood that started in august 2017 when hundreds of thousands of atlantic salmon escaped the company s cypress island site into the salish sea franz said cooke was fined 332 000 and found negligent by the state department of ecology in 2018 washington passed a law phasing out open net pen farming of non native fish but cooke pivoted to raising steelhead in response ultimately the dnr refused to renew the company licences after finding its operations posed a risk of environmental harm to state owned aquatic lands but in the interim the company fought us every step of the way franz said bob chamberlin chair for the first nations wild salmon alliance in b c it was gratifying to see the washington state government respond meaningfully to first nations concerns and recognize the need to protect food security and treaty rights my wish is the canadian government and specifically fisheries minister joyce murray takes note of the decision chamberlin said and they use it as a very clear example of what needs to be done to look after b c s pinnacle salmon runs that are at historic lows the shishalh decision recognized the importance of precautionary principle in protecting salmon an important resource and a thread that ties coastal and interior to one another he said activist and biologist alexandra morton said the pending fish farm removals are pushing open net pens into fewer and fewer locations on the b c coast making production more vulnerable to algal blooms disease or warm water that can kill farmed fish it s questionable whether grieg had any choice but to respect the shishalh wishes to vacate the territory given the b c government now requires first nations approval before a fish farm s tenure is renewed she added it s shocking to me that the salmon farming industry doesn t see the writing on the wall said morton if the industry recognized it was time to move to closed containment on land companies would likely benefit from public and private support and investment she said adding other infrastructure like hatcheries processing plants and transport would all remain in place but nobody s going to invest in closed containment if the cheap and dirty open net pen farms are still happening neither grieg seafood nor the b c salmon farmers association responded to questions from canada s national observer and no one was made available for an interview grieg s exit from shishalh territory is in line with the development of sites well suited to salmon farming with the additional aim of improving operations environmental footprint and fish welfare while reducing costs the company statement said the changes won t result in job losses and grieg s total harvesting volume targets will not be impacted the aquaculture company shares concerns for declining wild salmon population and is developing new farming technologies that reduce interactions between farmed and wild fish the grieg statement said related vancouver island first nations worry
